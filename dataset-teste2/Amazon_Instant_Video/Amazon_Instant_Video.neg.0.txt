 I watched this last night . And I do n't remember enough of it to give it a indepth review . But it was n't as bad as people are letting on nor was it as great as people are letting on . If you do n't like your killer to be supernatural then do n't bother with this . Its about a guy that comes back from the dead . His whole storyline is kinda silly and there are plot holes all over the place . The acting was n't bad at all , and neither were the deaths . In fact it was kinda gory . But that does n't make a great movie . The flashbacks were a little confusing as well . I would n't watch it again . But its far from the worst movie I 've seen .
