This bowl sticks well to wooden , plastic , and synthetic wood surfaces . It tilts slightly to allow my daughter to reach into the bowl and take out her food . This prevents her from becoming frustrated and wanting to pull the bowl off the table/tray . Although when there is no food left in the bowl , she has on occasion pulled the suction from the table , this is still the best suction bowl I have tested .
