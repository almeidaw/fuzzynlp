 Not too much to say . This instrument is well built , accurate -LRB- compared -RRB- to a known good source . It 's easy to use , has great instructions if you have n't used one before and stores compactly.I compared prices before I purchased and this is a good value .
 Very good product . Got my as a gift a few years ago , and it works fine . While mine has mercury thermometers , it should n't make a difference from red spirit filled one . I keep it in the shop drawer , dig it out when I wonder abt the temp here in NW Fla , dampen the wick , give it a twirl for a couple of minutes , then read it . I spray a lot of lacquer , shellac , and varnish , and usually have to crank up the dehumidifier in the shop , especially in the summer months . All in all , Bacharach makes a very good and reliable tool .
 I ordered this angle iron for an outdoor application , expecting 316 stainless steel to be corrosion resistant and rust-free . Not so , it will rust if it gets wet . I asked the seller about it , and they said stainless steel rusts -- news to me . 316 is supposed to be one of the more rust resistant grades . So if you do use it outdoors or in damp environments , you 'll need to paint it.It ships in a sturdy heavy duty cardboard tube , so the two times I ordered it arrived well-packed in perfect condition .
 I use these at my automotive school , notorious for un-calibrated torque wrenches and people who do n't like reading directions . I would go with professional grade set if your working on rusted bolts , or in awkward or tight situations . Otherwise , for light to medium duty work
 The true test for The bits was drilling stainless steel . With a slow speed and some tapping fluid it went right thru . No noticeable damage to the cutting edge . Great kit for the price . The bits look a bit cheesy , but they do the job . I was pleasantly surprised .
 I had managed to strip the torx screws on the stand for my iMac when trying to install a VESA wall mount . This caused the worst-case scenario for a tool like this : * The screw was hardened , tempered steel . * The screw was inserted into aluminum * The screw was recessed -LRB- counter-sunk below the surface . -RRB- This set worked perfectly -- in less than 5 minutes , I had the screws removed , and zero damage to the surrounding aluminum . Very pleased with the purchase.The set is packaged in a nice metal container that is high enough quality and sturdy enough to throw in the toolbox without a thought . -LRB- This is a big problem with most small tool sets like this -- the plastic cases will get destroyed in a toolbox . Nice this comes in metal . -RRB- The set comes with a variety of sizes that will work for most common uses.Best of all , very inexpensive for a quality product . Great stuff .
 Good little set of reverse drill bits and corresponding EZ Outs . The # 4 bit however , is a little short for the case , and if it is not closed properly , the bit will stick out of the case . This is how it was shipped , denting the case a little bit . The bit does not look damaged , but I have not used it yet .
 The material was nice and clean , no rust and flat . Drills nicely and was easy to work with.Highly recommend .

 Pro - Product is of the highest quality . Con - I 'm looking for rivets to fit this unit and ca n't find them !! Amazon do not carry them .
 Installation tool is well made . My only gripe is it does n't go beyond 6mm . Good deal for the money .
 No FLUKE product deserves a rating less then 5 stars . You do n't get better then Fluke . This product is no exception . It 's too bad another user rated this product one star just because he does n't know what he 's doing in electrical and electronic work . No offense , but if you do n't know what a DMM is , you do n't need to buying this type of equipment until you learn !! This probe will convert your already excellent Fluke DMM into a great AC/DC current meter !
 Adding a couple of thoughts and facts to the other reviews I see here , the following : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Capacity of the i410 clamp is 400A -- number given on Amazon 's page is 1000A . The i1010 will do 1000A if you need that much sauce . -LRB- 2 -RRB- Bandwidth limit on this clamp is 3kHz . This turned out to be an issue for me , but I do n't blame Fluke . I have yet to see a shoddy product wearing the Fluke brand mark . I always , always , always buy Fluke electrical measurement kit . -LRB- 3 -RRB- Tactically , a good reason to get a clamp for your DMM instead of a dedicated clamp meter is that using a clamp you can put the display where you want it . If you get a dedicated clamp meter -LRB- i.e. single-piece clamp with current display -RRB- then the display is constrained to be wherever you 're measuring the current . Not always convenient ... and this is why I bought the i410 . I happen to have VOMs all over the house but needed one with a higher current capacity . -LRB- 4 -RRB- As expected this product is solidly built and easy to use . -LRB- 5 -RRB- Y' all keep one hand in your pocket , now , mmmkay ?
 I purchased this clamp-on probe to use with a Radio Shack Model 22-812 multi-function digital multimeter and the combo is superb . The plug , a ganged two-prong -LRB- positive and negative -RRB- shrouded banana plug duo , has a spacing of exactly 3/4 inch , which Fluke and many other manufacturers use , like my RS MM . Thus , I can use it on the RS , Flukes , and others . One caveat is that the output is 1 mV per Ampere ; hence , one must use a MM having a sensitivity of at least 1 mV , which is no problem for the RS 22-812 and the better lines of most MMs . So , even tho the plug may fit your , for example , Wavetek Meterman Model AC40A , a compact and simple combo AC current/Voltage/resistance-measuring digital MM -LRB- yes , I have one ; it 's great for normal Residential , Commercial , and Industrial work when you 're measuring Voltages LT 600 V -RRB- -LRB- AC and DC Voltages read , but NOT DC current , which is why I purchased this probe -RRB- , its sensitivity is only 100 mV -LRB- 0.1 Volt -RRB- , making it worthless for most current readings.I specifically purchased this probe over some others , which are cheaper , because it 's made by Fluke . Simple as that . I have yet to encounter a shoddy Fluke-made product , and when you need to have a current reading , be it AC or DC , a precise number generated by a product that will perform reliably in a work environment , especially when you have to physically clamp onto a conductor that may or may NOT have intact insulation , for years to come is well worth the extra dollars.So ... you might ask why I use a RS meter costing only $ 80 versus the equivalent Fluke -LRB- a Model 87 -RRB- costing -LSB- ... -RSB- -LRB- at -LSB- ... -RSB- -RRB- . Well , the answer is two-fold
 If you think Fluke 's are over-rated , under-featured and over-priced then go back to your Harbor Freight el-cheapo Cen-Tec DMM -LRB- do you even know what DMM stands for ? -RRB- and quit writing bad reviews on professional quality equipment . Do n't get me wrong , if all you require is a cheap DMM that 's fine , just do n't criticize industrial suited equipment . I use this with my 87-V and it 's a great team , especially when taking DC amperage of pipeline rectifiers and doing pipe to soil readings for our Railroad Commission pipeline integrity analysis .
 Been using Fluke products for 25 years , this current clamp meter was compared to a shunt and dead on , excellent quality for the price .
 I appreciate the timely manner in how I received my order.I find all the Fluke products to be of excellent quality and this instrument is no exception . Also , obtaining accurate results with this instrument is easy and reliable .
 Ca n't go wrong with a Fluke . Thought I was getting a 1000 amp capable clamp , and go t suprised with a great 400 amp clamp . Should have done a little closer looking . Hope this helps the next guy
 This is a must have if you have an older Honda CB Motorcycle with the trouble prone charging system . This Current Clamp needs to be used with a digital multimeter i.e. Fluke 87 . I have an older Fluke 8060 and it works just fine.Easy to connect by clamping around the ground cable near the battery . Start the engine and check for 5 or more amps above 1700 rpm and you are good to go .
 Just need to be aware that this product is mislabeled . This is a great product , but Amazon has the wrong specifications for this model I410 . The specs should read CAT III , 600V safety rating , and up to 400 amps -LRB- 1-400 amps -RRB- . NOT 1-1000 amps . You have to buy the I1010 model to get up to 1000 amps .
 Clamp works just as expected . i did extensive research on unit and lives up to what I was expecting . Would recommend highly . Fluke puts out an exceptional product .

 I got it in the mail . i repaired my fish tank . it did what it said . didnt leak or peel . sold my fish tank after it pased the test . this is some nice aquarium sealant .
 made a cool divided tank with it . 1/2 land with a glass divider held in place by the silicone , 1/2 land .
 Used it to seal an aquarium . At 6 months everything is fine . The one downside is that it 's * extremely * hard to start the flow . Starting this thing takes a strong guy or something better than a hand-powered caulk gun .
 I purchased this product for the `` off label '' use of creating silk flower aquarium decor . It was great & perfectly safe for my fish . I followed the product recommendations and applied it to a base of aquarium stones to imbed more natural looking flora to my setup . Terrific product . Useful and safe .
 The Sealant worked just fine . It sealed the 150 Gallon Fish Tank with no problems . I sealed my fish tank with no problem .
 , I bought the large 10 oz tube to fill in some hollow decorations so I would n't need to worry about cleaning the interior surfaces . It has worked great for this purpose . It does have a strong vinegar smell to it , and the big tube requires a caulk gun to dispense it . Wear latex gloves when using to prevent getting any on your skin , but if you do I found that Clorox wipes remove it easily off of skin and surfaces . Water does n't really cut it .
 I like this Caster but it did n't come with any screw . It took me some more work to find those screw . I wish the manufacturer think about including screws .
 Cuts through stainless like a hot knife through butter . Run it slow -LRB- rpm -RRB- and use good/decent cooling and you 'll have zero issues .
 Just exactly what we were looking for , the fact that this item can be moved to size I am 100 % pleased . This got the job done
 The movers broke front wheel off the refrigerator . We could n't move it at all . Now refrigerator sits on these rollers and fridge moves with ease . We made sure the roller bars with behind the front broken one and in front of the back wheels.works great .
 Works well . I used them with my washer and dryer so I could clean behind the washer and dryer great for the price
 I purchased this as a replacement for my E-powered MTB . I had a Gates belt before and it stretch out pretty quick . It did n't break , but the stretching bothered me . I installed this Goodyear belt and am able to push more power through the belt without me having to keep adjusting the tension .
 Just what I needed to get my machine back up and running . Amazon is great , I did not expected to find it here and get it so easy and fast .
 This was the toughest cog belt I could find . Much thicker kevlar backing.No other brand , in my humble opinion , is better .
 Not a whole lot to say about it , I mean , it 's a belt . My machine is up and running again , no problems as of yet .
 This product is just as described . The only problem was it was not as dark as it looks in the picture , but a can of black spray paint solved that problem .
 The quality and delivery of this product is very good . It works as well as the scotchgard brand and much much less in cost .

 Loctite660Loctite makes a great product and this really helped fit worn threads on my model A shocks . I used this product and it sealed the threads so well i now have no leaks at all !
 It does what I expected . I just got my first hammer drill , so I do n't really know what to compare this drill bit to .

 These calipers are cheap but well constructed . I use them for measuring proportions while sculpting maquettes between 5 '' and 1 ' . For this purpose I have been quite pleased . While I wish the action was faster than the knob allows - it 's quite rugged and for the price - a solid buy .

 I 'm pretty sure the 6 ' mailing tube cost more than the rod . The rod arrived straight , and there is not too much else you can say about a 6 ' stainless steel rod . It seems to be pretty much round . And shiny . Shiny-ish .

 For what it is -LRB- an inexpensive tp holder -RRB- , it performs great . Have had other brands , and it is built as good as any .
 I used for building my dog door . I strapped some sheet metal strips around the rod and fastened them to the 1/4 &#34; plexiglass dog door . I can slide the rod in and out to remove the door .
 The 5 metal rods were delivered as specified . They were in excellent condition . They were used in a Science project to test how fast heat travels through different materials.Highly recommended.Ed perez
 This bar is great quality and the price was right . the finish on the bar was better than I expected it to be .
 It 's as advertised and shipped very fast . It 's cold rolled steel . Needed it for a project I was working on and works well .
 This is a fun toy to use for science projects . I ca n't comment on its accuracy one bit , though it 's clear that it does work . -LRB- Point it at your smoke detector or old watch face . -RRB- The manufacturer claims to sell a lab-calibrated version.I used it to take readings of some granite boulders in the California Sierras that I suspected of contributing to some unusual radon levels on some property I 'm developing there . -LRB- Yes , they measured `` above background '' . -RRB- The detector does n't have a whole lot of surface area -LRB- like some of the other competing solutions -RRB- but depending on your need , this might or might not be a problem.The box * looks * like a science project too . The case is a run-of-the-mill project case you could find at Radio Shack , and the display pokes through a cut-out on the top . A small microprocessor inside talks to the the displays , and allows you to gather count data through an RS-232 -LRB- DB-9 -RRB- serial connector poking out on the right . -LRB- Software included . -RRB- The thing that makes this counter a little different is the CPU in the box , giving the designers a bit more flexibility to add features -LRB- like counting in different units , using different time scales and implementing serial-port support -RRB- . It has a mute switch too.If I were to build a counter as a project , this is how I would do it . But I 'd use a nicer case . Maybe .
 I recently purchased this Geiger Counter and I am very pleased with it 's performance . When I had questions about using it I called and found the staff at Images Company to be very helpful .

 I took on the project of building my new shop . I 've made numerous purchases and saw the Irwin Cobalt drill bits . It was as close to an impulse purchase as I 've made , and I quickly regretted my decision as the set was pretty expensive . I figured that when they came in if I did n't like them I could return them.Well they came in and I was very impressed with the quality and sharpness of the bits . This is by far the BEST set of bits I have ever owned.If you compare the costs of ` throw-away ' drill bits , and then figure the frustration of having busted small bits ... then look no further than this Irwin set.It is worth it .
 Got these bits a couple of weeks ago to replace a 20 + year old Craftsman set . The first thing I noticed was the heft of the assortment ; same number of bits as the Craftsman , but considerably heavier . Have mainly used a couple of the larger ones on a cast iron grill ; they chewed through like it was pine . Have used some of the smaller bits to drill out rusted bolts . You only need to watch the metal filings pile up to know they 're doing their job . Have n't used any on wood ; seems like overkill and my older ones do fine for those . I only wish the storage box had a more positive lock mechanism . But I do like its bright size markings -LRB- sure beats stamped metal , which I can never read in weak light -RRB- . All in all , I 'm very pleased , and the price was GREAT ! .
 I know Cobalt -LRB- both M-35 and M-42 -RRB- are way more expensive than regular HSS drills , but if you 've got exotic metals or steel to drill it 's like night and day . I would n't go back to HSS except for wood and maybe aluminum after this !
 I finally splurged and bought cobalt bits . Until now I would need to stop , sharpen , then get started again . I used these to drill out siezed 5/8 '' bolts from a 60 year old tractor front axle ... . worked like a charm .
 Bought this several months ago and have used it a lot more than I thought I would . Very sturdy case . Bits have gone through anything and everything I have put them on -LRB- wood , metal and plastic -RRB- . Should last a long time . No pilot point . Set is sold as Hanson , but Irwin is the packaging .
 Over 40 years I have purchased approx . 15 sets of drill bits for my husband . I finally decided that the old saying `` You get what you pay for '' rings true regarding this drill bit set . My son-in-law purchased a Dewalt 1/2 '' drive -LRB- heavy duty -RRB- drill for my husband for Christmas . Using both products together really got the job done . He has used the bits to drill through 2 1/2 inch pipe to create a `` portable '' corral/loading area for out cattle . These products drilled through the thick steel materials like butter . He also drilled a hole through 1/2 swedish -LRB- hardened -RRB- steel with no `` wandering of the bit '' when starting the hole , it cut the normal time by about 75 % -LRB- he would normally go through 2 or 3 bits that would dull or break before it would get the job done -RRB- total frustration ! . This is an excellent investment that you should happily purchase as a very generous gift for the man in your life . It 's always nice to see your husband happy the gift you have purchased for him , not like shirts or ties , a real investment in making his work easier for him.A `` Ranchers Wife ''
 After looking around at several big box stores and not being able to find a decent set of bits , I went to Amazon and found these Cobalt alloy bits . I checked out Irwin 's web site and noticed the line `` suitable for drilling armor '' . These drills are pricey but worth every cent.When they arrived I decided to test them out . I drilled a 9/64 '' hole in the shank of my old sets 1/2 '' bit . Not a problem ! Bit not only drilled the hole throwing chips of steel off but never got hot . This old set was from Northern Tool and was advertised as `` Titanium coated.Would give them more than 5 stars if allowed.R
 I have never had any good quality bits before . All I have ever owned were the cheap $ 20.00 sets from walmart etc. . Cobalt bits are the way to go if you are drilling any kind of metal . These bits require no effort at all to cut through steel . I would recommend this product to anyone needing to drill metal
 I have always used old High Speed Steel bits and they work ok until you have to drill into something a little harder than mild steel . These bits come in a nice case and are worth the money IMO .
 Nice drill set . We like the fact that the register locks closed and we do n't have to worry about them falling out and getting lost .
 These bits cut through metal . I 'm glad I got them . They are the best bits I 've ever bought . BUT - they are brittle ! I broke a small one pretty easily . They do n't take abuse the way a normal softer bit will . Use them with care and they 'll be great for years and years .
 I feel like I have stepped up into a `` used to '' category . I `` used to '' use my Craftsman and Makita drill bit sets . I `` used to '' occasionally break bits off from putting too much pressure on them to get them to cut faster . These bits are so much better than the grades you get at Sears , Lowes , Home Depot , etc. . I have been upgrading my 57 chevy including drilling 1/2 '' holes through the A arms to put in an anti-sway bar . Tasks are just easier when you do n't have to stop and sharpen a bit or keep drilling because you 're almost done ... just a little longer and I 'll be through . You know what I mean . These bits belong in any do-it-yourselfer 's tool box . I would recommend these bits to my friends and thank my friend for recommending this brand .
 I am glad the Milwaukee set went out of stock on Amazon . This set was cheaper and exceeded my expectations .
 I was really suprized when I received these drill bits they are of excellent quailty and case was really nice
 Former FT mechanic . I just bought this set cause I 'm tired of scrambling when I do need to drill into hardened metals and my standard hi speed bits dig in for about 30 seconds and they are shot . The reason I trust these is because I 've seen them in action before . My friend had to drill through a GM rear disk backing plate to upgrade some wheel cylinders . Slow steady pressure was the trick . Top these off with a Drill Doctor to sharpen back up and you are almost set for life . These bits probably are over kill for the average guy just needing to drill though standard steel once every 1 to 3 years . Cobalts are for hardened steel . These are the m-35 bits . There are a m-42 more expensive even harder bits , but I tried to save some $ $ as I 'm not a FT mechanic anymore . Rest assured , after I use these for the first time and if I think they are not worth the money , I 'll be out here with another negative review to try to save someone else any headaches . Based on what I 've seen and other reviews , these Irwin bits wo n't disappoint . Only thing I have n't decided on is how Irwin decided to set the case up . The 3 sections of bits are plastic and removable . I grasp the concept , but not sure if ultimately I will like or dislike this feature .
 These cobalt drill bits are great ! Regular titanium coated bits or carbide bits do not compare with cobalt bits , at all . With these I was able to drill quickly - really quickly - through steel that was dulling my titanium bits , even with oil . It 's always best to use a couple drops of any oil when drilling to keep the temperature down and avoid wear . You will not be disappointed with these bits .
 These are made by the people who make VISE GRIPS.They cut really well!Every time I have used them they perform great , drilling out screws has been a pleasure with this set.I really like the case a lot also.A great buy here at Amazon for the price , my local parts store wanted double the money for this set.Not one has broken or had to be sharpened yet , I do not use these daily but I could see how you could easily with the same results , worth the money indeed .
 4130 tube steel takes to diamond paste for hi luster fine , moving parts inside tube such as carbon fiber piston -RCB-
 It is everything that I could want in an extruded angle.Not to make this long , but this is so right .
 this is a great piece of aluminum it worked out just fine for what i needed it for.its a great price even with the shipping
 I bought and paid for exactly what I wanted . No more and no less . I received it quickly and was able to complete my project in no time .
 I 've used this product to build numerous projects . Good strength , easily drilled or cut . Wo n't rust and is very light in comparison to steel . The finish is a low luster so if you need shine be ready to sand polish and buff .

 I bought the GCA-07W digital geiger counter to go antiquing and I feel it is a great investment . I also purchased the NRC version for work and will post a review on that digital geiger counter at a later date . Both the certified and non-certified digital geiger counters are excellent devices . I can detect whether or not a radium painted clock -LRB- or watch -RRB- is real . I can also find radioactive fiesta ware and uranium dyed glass . This instrument has made my antique hunting not only more efficient , but much more enjoyable . I am glad to know that I can detect even low levels of radiation such as those coming off 19th century objects like radium water jars . I feel more secure in my antique purchases and it is a useful hobby instrument . My son loves it when we go prospecting for uranium . And should an emergency occur I have a good device to help deal with it .
 I purchased my GCA-07 in the summer of 2012 and I love it . This instrument is well made . The LCD screen is easy to read and provide count data plus radiation level . The radiation level is a three second running average . I am able to measure low level radiation with great stability . It can read the normal background radiation and anything above background radiation . I took my GCA-07 surveying in an area known to have harbored radioactive materials and I was able to find soil that still contained traces of radiation years later . The beauty of this Geiger counter , unlike many of its competitive products costing more is that I was able to get it NRC certified to be accurate to government standards and specifications . Included is a CD with pc graphing software that records and charts radiation levels and allows you to export the data in excel.All the controls are on the front panel . No messing around pushing buttons and setting screens to get this unit to function . The Geiger counter can be NRC certified to 1000 MR/hr , which is 5x the range of some competing products . I spoke to the tech at Images SI Inc. and he stated that the range is actually greater than 1000 mR/hr but that the lab they use can only certify it to 1000 mR/hr . The radiation level can be set to either imperial -LRB- mR/hr -RRB- or metric measure -LRB- mSv/hr -RRB- using a front panel switch , again no messy menu and buttons to set this up.The product comes with a USB cable for PC interfacing.Has the standard outputs you expect on a digital Geiger counter . Audio output that can be muted -LRB- with a switch -RRB- headphone jack , TTL pulse output jack , LED radioactive particle indicator , low battery indicator and external power jack.Other Geiger counters only claim accuracy , this Geiger counter can be certified accurate by an independent government licensed lab . I would recommend this product to anyone who is serious about experimenting with or surveying for radioactive materials .
 I used for building my dog door . I strapped some sheet metal strips around the rod and fastened them to the 1/4 &#34; plexiglass dog door . I can slide the rod in and out to remove the door .
 The 5 metal rods were delivered as specified . They were in excellent condition . They were used in a Science project to test how fast heat travels through different materials.Highly recommended.Ed perez
 This bar is great quality and the price was right . the finish on the bar was better than I expected it to be .
 It 's as advertised and shipped very fast . It 's cold rolled steel . Needed it for a project I was working on and works well .
 The brake was delivered as expected and worked out well . The install was relatively easy if you have any mechanical knowledge or experience . I would recommend this to anyone who needs to eliminate the ` roll back ' when lifting heavy items or winching up inclines .
 Was not hard to install and it stopped my 2000 lb wench from playing out when under load .
 It is everything that I could want in an extruded angle.Not to make this long , but this is so right .
 this is a great piece of aluminum it worked out just fine for what i needed it for.its a great price even with the shipping

 I 've used this product to build numerous projects . Good strength , easily drilled or cut . Wo n't rust and is very light in comparison to steel . The finish is a low luster so if you need shine be ready to sand polish and buff .
 I 'm pretty sure the 6 ' mailing tube cost more than the rod . The rod arrived straight , and there is not too much else you can say about a 6 ' stainless steel rod . It seems to be pretty much round . And shiny . Shiny-ish .
 This Geiger Counter is a great value . I have used many Geiger Counters for various projects , and I have to say that none have beaten the value of this Geiger counter . This Geiger Counter is accurate , reliable and durable . It performs better than similar products costing more . It is easy to use , even for a novice like myself , and yet it offers many useful tools like a digital meter adapter . The wand makes it easy to test objects , or hard to reach , items.I highly recommend this product .

 An excellent all around caulking that is quick drying and may also be used as an adhesive , in some applications . The tube nozzle may be trimed down for easy dispensing in tight quarters where a large caulking gun would n't fit . Dap quality is evident . R.E.W.

 I ordered this angle iron for an outdoor application , expecting 316 stainless steel to be corrosion resistant and rust-free . Not so , it will rust if it gets wet . I asked the seller about it , and they said stainless steel rusts -- news to me . 316 is supposed to be one of the more rust resistant grades . So if you do use it outdoors or in damp environments , you 'll need to paint it.It ships in a sturdy heavy duty cardboard tube , so the two times I ordered it arrived well-packed in perfect condition .

 Great counter . I have used one for more than 5 years now.Perfect for a wide range of measurements from very low to very high level alpha beta and gamma radiation.It 's functionality can be augmented by adding an optional digital meter adapter which adds a digital display , RS232 interface and a random number generator.This product exceeded my expectations , and I am very pleased with it .

 I am a woodturner , and use this scotch-brite grit in between my next to last and last coats of varnish . It is not very aggressive ; just what I need . When used on a soft-backed rotary sanding pad , these leave virtually no visible mark at all , which is perfect ! If you are trying to de-nib between coats of varnish , this is NOT the pad for you ; this is for very fine buffing out and wo n't remove any excess varnish without considerable pressure . My only gripe is that they are not perforated in 3 '' widths and lengths -- the easiest width for me to work with when sanding bowls and hollow forms .
 This product was perfect for my white , Corian sink that becomes water stained over time . Was afraid to use the normal green pads for this use , and the white was perfect .
 Muslims may not celebrate Christmas and the Communists may not like religion , but this would make a great gift for your Uncle Ahmadinejad or your Brother-in-law Jong-il this Christmas season ... After all , what would make a nutcase happier than ever than to wake up and see under their mushroom cloud tree what they 've always been denied of?Uranium
 this product is great for crushing up and you can put it in with brownies , cupcakes and almost any desert ! also if you slice it up it goes great on pizza id highly recommend this product
 OMG!Someone help me plz!I do n't know what to do!I bought this as a present for my cousin in Mexico , since this will effectively feed a family of 8 over there for a year , he will put it in tacos , burriots , etc.But by mistake my brother opened it and swallowed it!He is now a radioactive pedophile ! Essentially he went from Mexican to Russian overnight!This has given him super-human strength , and also his appearance changed . He went from a brown , 3 '11 twenty-year old to a balding , 70 year old looking ghoul!What do I do ???!!??! HELP !
 First let me say THANKS ; I have n't laughed until I cried for a long , long time.Second , to whomever is the author of this delightful bit of prose ; quit your day job ... you are denying the world of your unique and gifted talent for delivering comedy -LRB- a much needed tonic for the many cares and burdens of this modern world we have created -RRB- Third ; please halt any further intake of this product , and although a glow in the dark comedian would indeed be a quirky addition to the comedy delivery , its repercussions on your overall life expectancy would cut short your professional life span and further deny us of the full promise of more wit and wisdoms delivered within the venue of mirth in the precarious years ahead , thereby increasing the suffering of the many who would be denied your obvious gift.Fourth ; goodnight Gracie
 I MUST TELL MARTY OF THESE FINDINGS !!!!! -LRB- co-worker -RRB-
 1 Drop in the gas tank and man , my 1980 Camaro really takes off . Just a drop , or you could take out surrounding states .
 I was really stuck in a bad spot until I discovered this for sale on Amazon . It 's not like this stuff is for sale on every street corner either.Taking delivery of the product is also a bit tricky as DHL refused to handle it as did FedEx and USPS . A ` special ' courier service though is available for those willing to pay and the man said that ` no questions will be asked ' over the phone.It 's not everyday that a regular person would have use for Uranium Ore , but I assure you when you do the kind of traveling that I do , it 's absolutely necessary . I have n't yet updated to the newMR FUSIONsystem either due to cost , but that 's something to deal with when I get back.And for those who need to ask
 The shipment was fast and came in a glad bag as an added protection . They did n't even require a signature for the package , so that was nice as I do n't want people to know that I 'm planning to take over the world with thise uranium ore .
 This past Halloween , we really amped up our Simpsons-themed party by adding Uranium Ore -LRB- and 2 gallons of imported Hawaiian vodka -RRB- , to our special `` Homey Punch . '' The big green bubbles that constantly belched out of the red -LRB- sloe gin ! -RRB- punch were a stupendous hit with our guests , even if they did smell a little funny . -LRB- The bubbles smelled funny , not the guests . Well , Aunt Hattie smelled like Summers Eve Anti-Itch Gel Maximum Strength - 1 Oz , as usual , and the Wilsons from around the corner hadTuscan Whole Milk , 1 Gallon , 128 fl ozbreath , but hey , they 're our neighbors and we love them , right ? Right ! -RRB- The day after the party , we sure did n't feel like cooking , but Uranium Ore came to the rescue once again . We boiled up some spaghetti and added our new favorite `` secret ingredient '' to a can of Chef Boyardee Spaghetti Sauce . Bam ! Emeril Lagasse , eat your heart out . Talk about taking it up a notch ! Thanks to Uranium Ore , we 've taken it 10 notches !
 I take as a daily suppliment ... it make me real smaert . It does not take much but is real powerful . I likes it alot .
 What the deuce ? How did this end up here ? Did the fat man or the stupid dog steal my stash and start selling it ? Damn you vile people ! I shall get you in the end ; victory shall be mine !
 Damn I wish this was Chat-roulette ? Why ? Well , you cant see me but right now I 'm typing this , ironing my shirts , winning at scrabble with an orphan , slicing onions and uh . . surfing po . . I mean conducting research on the net . Yeah , baby ! 6 hands ! Thanks Uranium Ore. .
 Last year , I had to buy 10,000 smoke detectors and scrape off those little radioactive buttons to fuel my reactor that powers my Christmas lights . This year , I only had to buy a thousand of these little buggers . It was difficult arranging for it to be enriched , but these nice Iranians agreed to do it for a neat mil . The better news is that I wo n't need to refuel my reactor for the next 12 years .
 This product proves the old adage - you get what you pay for . I tried using the 1/2 price crap from Wal Mart -LRB- in automotive aisle - in a spray can labeled `` Ur-Ozium '' -RRB- . Anyway , took 3 cans of spray stuff to get same results as ONE tin of the Ore. . Oh , yeah , almost forgot - it 's the best toilet cleaner EVER . But DO NOT get any on the seat ...
 My grandmother bought this for me because she 's always thought I was smart enough to improve the state of radiation therapy today . Little did she know that I decided to build my own nuclear warhead . I tested it in my backyard and it just went `` poooof '' a very quiet `` poooof '' . Not weapons-grade uranium . : -LRB- And trust me , from experience , mutation is not cool . I have no use for this extra pinkie toe .
 There are few products that can change your life forever . this will do it . Here is what you must do
 As a busy mad scientist with many voices distracting me on a nearly constant basis , it is helpful to find such a wonderful product that I can use on on a daily basis . Whether as fuel for my robot army -LRB- coming soon to a neighborhood near you -RRB- or as a catalyst for mutation or just as a healthy snack , this product continues to amaze . My wife/captive swears by it and uses a pinch in her morning coffee . She is literally glowing from the inside out because this product . Highly recommended !
 Finally , Uranium Ore for the value minded consumer ! Before I was having to do all sorts of things I 'd rather not speak of to pay the exorbitant prices the post office was charging to heist this stuff Rumsfeld 's outgoing mailbox ! -LRB- sorry Iran ! -RRB- All this in the name making small changes in history for my amusement ? Not a solid ROI ! Now with a little effort , and a small sacrifice of a couple of years I wo n't miss in my old age ... I can fuel up my time traveling Prius and go kick Tanya Harding 's ass & stop the Wedding Video -LRB- yuck -RRB- before it happens ... oh and save the planet earth from a pandemic of epic proportions too ; you 're welcome.Update
 Dear Dr. Brown , On the night that I go back in time at 1:30 am you will be shot by terrorists.Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster.Your friend , Stefan
 It is not cat food.Does anyone know if there 's a cure for sudden tentacles ? The cat 's huge and well , does n't really look much like a cat anymore . She still answers to Muffin though . However , if she rubs against my bare leg one more time her new name will be calamari .
 I had planned to keep this fine product safely sequestered in the wine cellar . Unfortunately I forgot to latch the door and my particularly clever cat played his combination soccer/hockey game with the canister . Although he undoubtedly spent one or more of his 9 lives I no longer have need for a night light of any sort as Fluffy follows me wherever I roam . Highly recommended !
 Not only did this product whiten my teeth it made my coffe glow !! It also made me grow a 3rd breast now I make tons of money as a stripper thank you amazon your the best !!!!!!!!
 My brother and sister-in-law gave me an AeroGarden for my birthday , but I was unhappy about the slow rate of growth . A friend recommended I toss a can of ore into the tank . Ten days later I had basil leaves large enough to make Gattino con Basilico , which are like dolmades , but larger with more complex textures .
 I ordered a can of Uranium Ore to use as a seductive body dust , as it 's much cheaper than those glitter body powders you can buy at department stores , and in addition I prefer the gentle yellow glow it gives to the gaudy glitter of those powders . Not only does it stay in place and glow all night at the dance clubs , but the effects of the radiation have improved my life significantly . That is to say , the alterations to my genetic code and cellular replication have resulted in morphological changes that make me look just like Angelina Jolie ! I guess I should have expected this , since I always thought she looked slightly mutated , but I am still thrilled . : D
 While building my time machine , I found I needed uranium ore to fuel the space/time compressor . Since I ca n't fly to Libya or Pakistan on my limited budget , Amazon came to the rescue . I knew I had made the right choice because future-me from 2027 showed up right after UPS dropped off the package and warned me NOT to building the time machine . Now I know the ore will work perfectly ! Thanks , Amazon !! Oh , BTW Cubs fans -- they never win the World Series in the future , ever .
 Do n't allow your frugality to -LRB- mushroom -RRB- cloud your judgment . I purchased used U238 , but have found that its activity is substantially less than that of new U238.I suspect this has to do with the decay half-life of U238 -LRB- 4.468 billion years -RRB- . So , I would recommend buying new U238 to maximize your shelf-life .
 I bought this to get even with my uppity neighbors who keep complaining about me parking my good 1978 Chevy on my own personal front lawn ... I sprinkled a dirty word across the middle of their lawn ... mixing in a little amonia from under the kichen sink.Now the word is there glowing yellowy green at night and its all green during the day time to ... They ca n't mow it away ... Ca n't wait to see what it does to snow !!! Do n't worry , I wore them blue plastic gloves the mailman has been using to deliver mail in my neighborhood ... Must be somebody else who ordered it too ...
 You know who I 'm talking about - the smug jerk who no matter what you come up with , says your hot sauce `` is n't hot enough '' or `` that 's nothing , why one time I. . . '' Yeah , sure pal.Now admittedly you could just feed them some pureed habaneros , but when you 're dealing with that - serious - twit , then you need something special . And nothing , but nothing , delivers like this item!Whip some of this into the definitive ` hot ' sauce ! We 'll see how tough manly man is when he can see what 's dropping into the toilet by the glow from his own back end . And think how much fun he 'll have in prison after he tries to tell a cop what for ? No doubt about it , this is the key ingredient for a gift that lasts a lifetime .
 If anyone expects a lump of solid , highly enriched Uranium out of the box , you 're in for a disappointment . The product description is quite clear . You get ORE -LRB- read ` dirt ' -RRB- so you are lucky if there 's one gram of actual Uranium in the box . Off that , only 0.7 % is the highly sought U-235 . What makes it even sadder , talking about diminishing returns , half of the U-235 naturally vanishes in less than a billion years so , whatever you pay for today , it 's going to be less of it tomorrow.I believe there are 2 mainstream things you can do with Uranium . One is to enrich it , the other is to deplete it . They are both difficult and expensive processes so I settled for some simple experiments instead . Most of them failed and I do n't usually talk about failures . Those that did n't fail are too disturbing to be discussed in a public forum but the very fact that it 's me writing this review is proof positive that one can play with ` fire ' and live to talk about it . But I 'd rather not.My advice to anyone who may purchase this item or just did is to : - exercise extreme caution - be discrete - handle with care - act as if the situation is well under control - do not expect miracles - do not act surprised when your expectations are met and exceeded - do not be upset about the half-time situation , a billion years is a long time - consult a lawyer if you intend to weaponize it or store it in a safe deposit box - do not discard the original packaging , just in case you decide to return itTo me , it was worth the purchase . I 'd recommended to anyone with similar world views and outlooks on life .
 My DeLorean DMC-12 was running like CRAP until I found this stuff . Doc told me to just break down and get the `` Mr. Fusion '' but I decided to give this stuff a try instead . It works TOTALLY RADICAL ! No more hitching rides on the bumpers of cop cars with my skateboard for THIS McFly ! I 'm only going to give it 4/5 stars though because the day it arrived in the mail , this Volkswagen van started parking outside my house and it 's kind of starting to creep me out . -- Marty M.
 Okay , I 'll admit . I was VERY skeptical of the product because I 've been sold `` uranium ore '' in the past that was n't legit . Dirty KGB bastards . This product was delivered to my door by a friendly Fed Ex employee who was anything but angry , and not named `` Yuri '' which was refreshing . I immediately opened the bubble wrap , and the lead inner lining to reveal the uranium ore . . And WOW it was bright ! This , folks , is the real deal ! I admit , I had plans to use it for world domination . . I did . However , I 've never seen anything that beautiful besides lemon-lime sherbet ! Needless to say , hunger prevailed and my inner Napoleon was trumped by my inner Neapolitan and I HAD to have a bite . . IT WAS DEE-LICEOUS !!! A must have for any sherbet lover!Summary of the Uranium Ore : Pros - Delicious ! No need for flashlights since , once ingested , you 're completely luminescent ! Tastes like cherub exudate . . Mmm . . Mmm . . Good ! Abnormal muscle , and extremity growth!Cons - Your septic tank will become capable of starting the nuclear holocaust , if ingested -LRB- which is HIGHLY recommended -RRB- ! The product wo n't be delivered by an angry Russian named `` Yuri '' but you may meet him once you 've purchased it !
 I had been experimenting with running my Honda on Hydrogen but was having problems generating enough hydrogen to keep the engine running longer than a couple of minutes . I had been mixing Potassium Hydroxide with the water to increase the PH so it would conduct the current from the pulse width modulator more efficiently and reduce the heat build up . While researching on ways to improve the efficiency I came across this product and decided on a whim to give it a try . I took a teaspoon of the Uranium Ore , heated it and mixed it with a liter of water and poured it into the generator . That was a little over a year and a half ago and the car is still running . I mean , literally , it wo n't shut off . I have logged over 62,000 miles on that liter of water and am only able to stop the car by shoving it into neutral and applying the brakes . It just sits in my driveway in neutral making a strange humming sound until I 'm ready to go . There is , however , possibly some associated health risks since all my hair and teeth have fallen out since I started and there are some strange looking sores developing all over my body . On the positive side , I am enjoying the glow that my body is emitting and the fact that I no longer need a flashlight to walk around in the dark . I 'm sure its not related but I saw a squirrel in my yard last week that was actually larger than the Honda . I have been thinking about adding more Uranium but apparently with the half-life rating , its going to be several centuries before the current liter is depleted or the car stops running . In light of the increased gas prices , and the fact I no longer need gasoline , I have given this product a 5 star rating . -LRB- Unfortunately I am now being sued by the state tax department for failure to pay road use taxes since I have not bought any gasoline but continue to use the highways and the asphalt melts as car passes over it . Read the other views and I think you 'll find this product is for you ...
 I was trying to make a ice cold green tea frappaccino here at home like Starbucks but hot was even better . I plan to add it to all my tea drinks . Thanks !
 Ok so I bought this the other day and it came in the mail today . I then uploaded a video and sent the link to the French . Within the hour they have surrendered . Thank you Uranium Ore I now have my own country to run .
 I 've been writing to Santa since I was a little boy , wishing , praying , he would send me some Uranium Ore. . I was disappointed year after year , when ripping my presents open , I never got any Ore. . Enriched cake ? Check ... Plutonium ? Check ... Other fissile material ? You bet . . but never any Ore :-LRB- Well my frown was turned upside down when I found out Amazon could ship me some Ore. . Now I can continue my quest to become the true ` Radioactive Man '
 Trapped on in this supreme-being forsaken world with no fuel for my starship , and here I find they distribute fuel for a reasonable price . Only 500 more metric tons and I 'm out of here ! This world really is odd ...
 I gave this as a gift to my friend and her husband who were having a hard time getting pregnant . It worked like a charm !!! They are now proud parents and they 've asked me to be the godmother ! * anyone know where I can find 1,547 one legged onesies ? oh , and the neck hole should be large enough to accomdate two heads .
 I 'm sure in 1985 uranium is available at every corner drugstore , but in 1955 it 's a little hard to come by !
 Oh happy joy , my Uranium Ore arrived today . Now I will finally have the fuel to run my super condenser , deep freeze , cold storage unit that I designed and built to store my supply ofTuscan Whole Milk , 1 Gallon , 128 fl ozUnlike some lesser brands , this Uranium Ore is the real deal . No more last minute runs to the mall parking lot to aquire enough uranium ore from those shady Libyans to get me through the week . This genuine Uranium Ore has a half life of 12 thousand years . And , a little goes a long way . So far I 've only used about a third of the can , which leaves a lot left over for some of my other projects , one of which is my proton pack.The Proton Pack is a piece of nuclear accelerative machinery used for weakening and ultimately capturing ghosts.It consists of a hand-held wand -LRB- `` Neutrona Wand '' or particle thrower -RRB- connected to a backpack-sized particle accelerator . It fires a proton stream that polarizes the negatively charged energy of a ghost , allowing it to be held in the stream while active . The proton pack , also referred to as a charged particle accelerator , functions by `` concentrating protons '' , using them to attack `` negatively charged ectoplasmic entities '' . In practical terms , the proton gun fires a stream of energy that allows a wielder to snare a ghost , holding it in place so it can be positioned above a trap for capture . Pretty cool stuff.All in all , I 'd say this Uranium Ore is probably the best you are going to find outside of say ... Los Alamos testing ground . The price is fair and delivery is fast . And the best part is ... it 's made right here in the good old United States of A. Pick up a can today , it 's uses are limitless .
 I know what you are thinking . `` It is really hard to beat some fresh Plutonium on organic whole wheat toast . '' You 'd be right , but this uranium is not bad for the money . This uranium will really get you going in the morning . It warms you up all the way down . It also stimulates an almost instant bowel movement . It will surely keep you regular . Just make sure you have on hand a large supply of quality toilet paper . The only drawback is the rectal bleeding . Still , this uranium deserves a solid 4 stars . Yum !
 Buying Radioactive materials ? Then you 'll need an expensive exposure suit , right ? Not anymore ! With Major Generics ' Rad-X , you can expose yourself to as much radiation as you desire , without the added bulk of an environment suit ! Our radiation prophylactics are steeply discounted , as they are sold as a generic version of the Vault-Tec Industries -LRB- TM -RRB- product , and imported from Mexico . Order now for only 19 caps , and we 'll throw in a dose of Rad-Away , a 17-cap value , free ! -LSB- ... -RSB-
 I 've had problems with controlling my weight all my life . I 've tried all the fad diets , supplements , gimicks ... you name it . Since I 've ordered this uranium ore and added it as a supplement to my meals , the pounds are literally just MELTING away ! I 've lost 70 pounds in the last 3 weeks , and I. ... well , I ca n't TECHNICALLY say I look or feel great , BUT I 'VE LOST 70 POUNDS ! And I * think * I 'm getting a tan , too!I would 've given a 5 star rating , but I think this product DOES have some downsides . Although I did n't expect it to give me a tan -LRB- which is cool ! -RRB- ... I would expect the tan to be an even tone all around my body . Instead , it 's kinda splotchy . I 'm unsure , but I think it also reacts funny with my hair conditioner , because I 've noticed some hair loss.BUT I 'VE LOST 70 POUNDS !!!! -LRB- SQUEEE !!! -RRB-
 How did they get this piece of space rock all the way from Uranus ? -LRB- that planet 's name always cracks me up ! -RRB- Each rock individually numbered as well ... mine is number 235 ...
 As a disgruntled Nuclear cybernetics physicst , I was sceptical about this Uranium Ore. . Turns out just two of these babies are enough to fuel my reactor in my volcanic island fortress for a year ! And as a bonus feature , every minion who had a prolonged exposure to an open can of this stuff now glows in the dark . This has cut my electricity bill in half , Allowing me to finish my Spheroboom ahead of schedual ! So I 'll be able to hold the world for ransom before Christmas ! All thanks to this little can of Uranium Ore !
 I was apprehensive about buying such a delicate material online , but seeing other reviews bolstered my confidence and i purchased a can . First off , it arrived very quickly , i received it at the door , and the postman must have caught a cold , since i saw him vomit when he was back in his van . I promptly opened and tested the quality of the ore , weighing it and checking it with my geiger counter app on my phone , and it was as described ! Unfortunately , i do n't have much of a use for it quite yet , have n't gotten around to constructing a laboratory under my house , so it 's on display on a shelf next to my bed ! Darn work is so time-consuming and stressful , i 'm starting to lose my hair .
 I 'll never have to pay for one of those painful , overpriced Brazilian waxings again ! Just keep this miracle product on you at all times and within days you 'll have a sexy clean look without the worry of ingrown hairs or five o'clock shadow . Of course , you 'll have to be comfortable with having a bald head and bloody stools .
 Before Amazon.com decided to sell high-grade Uranium over the series of tubes that is the internet , I had very few options and stringent procedures I needed to follow in order to get my hands on this material . The main three were :1 -RRB- Scrape the dead skin cells off the neck of a couple of residents in the surrounding Chernobyl area .2 -RRB- Pal around with Saddam Hussein .3 -RRB- Craigslist.The problem with 1 was that the Ukraine has denied my travel visa countless times on account of `` because uranium is myranium , comrade '' apparently not being an `` acceptable '' response to the question of why I wish to travel to Ukraine which they have on their applications.The second one is pretty obvious now . Saddam was a lot of talk , can you believe the guy never actually had any ?! I was like , 98.2 % sure he had plenty of uranium to go around . I 'm no fool , I studied FOX News religiously.Craigslist , while promising , ended up being much more trouble than it was worth . The Syrians selling it to me kept calling me `` my friend '' and haggling on the price to the point where I ended up paying 3 times the amount they put on the listing . Then with the Iranians , the young Persian boy I hired as my Farsi translator ended up selling them gold jewelry and going clubbing with them instead of doing his job . All I got from that deal was a 5 % off coupon from their electronics store . Besides , the uranium they were peddling was weapons-grade and that 's not what I 'm looking for.Anyway , I 'm getting off topic ! See , what I do is I sell bootleg superhero abilities from my garage . Amazon.com 's fantastic selection of products now let me achieve this goal with little overhead . While I 've yet to actually turn anyone into a superhero using my patent-pending uranium drenching therapy , unless you count Testiculor the incredible man with testicular cancer -LRB- he did n't think so , and neither did the jury -RRB- , I 'm confident that this new batch of ore will make business boom . Thanks , Amazon !
 My son wanted Play Doh for his birthday but unfortunately Toys ` R ' Us was sold out of it . I figured this would be the next best thing . He absolutely LOVES it and told me he wishes he had a third hand because its so much fun ! I told him maybe his kids would have better luck . A dozen more cans are on their way ! Thanks Amazon.com !
 When I finally finished and successfully tested my first plutonium powered Dolorean time machine , I was a bit miffed by the fact that I had to accelerate all the way up to 88 mph before the flux capacitor would be able to kick in and send me into the great beyond . This is quite a pain when you live in the city and have to drive all the way to places like closed shopping malls , drive-in theatres , abandoned highways , and rail road tracks to get up to that kind of speed . Once I heard that Amazon was finally selling U-238 legally , I quickly purchased some and used the instruction booklet -LRB- included at no extra charge -RRB- to enrich it and build myself a uranium powered reactor which I then installed in my time machine . On the first test run , the flux capacitor jumped into full gear at only 37 mph ! Now I can go time travelling on my own street and not worry about the commute.Thank you , Amazon for selling this fantastic and incredibly useful product ! I 'm sure that with careful marketing , in five years no American home will be without it .
 I have to say I am thrilled to see this product back in stock . I was worried that I would not be able to get some in time for my annual attempt to take over the world . However , between this Uranium and my newJL421 Badonkadonk Land Cruiser/TankI will be good to go , so do n't forget to submit to my rule or be crushed like the worthless bugs you are!And remember to drinkTuscan Whole Milk , 1 Gallon , 128 fl ozfor strong teeth and bones , kids !
 All the other reviews are brilliant , but they 're all based on too large of scale , impossible technology , or old information -LRB- we all know one can now power time machines with refuse -RRB- , thus making this product impractical for these applications.This product is for those occasions when a much smaller scale of tactical dominance is warranted or required . Perhaps the neighbor 's dogs are barking way too much . That house across the road is throwing yet another party . The in-laws live way too close . The possible applications at this scale are almost endless . Add some timing or other triggers , and you could make sure that car that always parks in your space never comes back . Using the various home centrifuge kits available from many fine sources on the internet , it 's much easier and practical to refine the uranium in these quantities . I 'd stay away from the available do-it-yourself centrifuge constructions plans however . A good centrifuge is a device you really want to leave to those who know what they 're doing.If you think the cost of all this makes the use of this product impractical , you 're likely basing your impression on the much larger counterparts . Remember that you 're working on a much smaller scale here . You do n't need big rockets , large launch areas or sophisticated guidance systems . You are n't trying to bomb Iran or New Jersey -LRB- either I 'm sure would be primary target -RRB- . All you 'd do at this intended scale would be to kill a poor innocent camel or some Olds hooptie . With plans readily available -LRB- a search on this title of this review should yield a result -RRB- , you can make rather simple delivery , timing , and other trigger devices to address issues within your more personal sphere of influence . This makes this application much more economical than the much larger counterparts -LRB- an economics of scale as it were -RRB- . A word of caution ; with the sophistication of plans available at this price point , I would n't count on any delivery system being accurate at over a block and a half at most . You do get what you pay for after all . The application this product is designed for is to address more local issues . You 'll still need about 20 cans at these volumes to refine enough to take out a typical residential lot . But even a smaller amount used in a larger lot can yield desirable results if accurately deployed .
 This ore was very good , it made quite a good addition to my science magic tricks that I do at childrens parties . however , it did manage to cause the hosts pet rabbit to start to chase and try and eat the children with its elongated teeth ... The mother wasnt impressed and we swiftly had to put the rabbit down ... however the radiation seems to have spread to their pond and I fear the frogs may start to glow in the dark and begin to eat things bigger than flys and spiders.All in all a great product , the explosion was brilliant and it really entertained the children . 4 stars for humour , entertainment and excitement , the 5th star deducted for animal and environmental issues
 A kid asked me to bring this as a present for Xmas . I couldnt resist and opened it.I was disappointed by its looks so I left it in my workshop . Now the elfs glow so I dont use electricity!Worth ! buy it !
 Truth be told , I ran out of buttocks ointment . I was really chafed and irritated after a long day of wearing my new dungarees . The high humidity did not help . In my predicament I was willing to try anything for relief . I swabbed a two finger amount of this Uranium Ore on the effected area , and was pleasantly surprised of its instant relief qualities . It glowed a little through my pants , but other than that , no noticeable problems .
 Uranium Ore what ? Or else ? Or not ? Or haggis monsters sing thee to thy rest ? But had to order some to find out . Makes good snuff . I hit 600 in my softball league when I use it . Sure clears out the sinuses . Could drive a truck through my nasal passages . But still do n't know ore what ?
 So seeing this on an infomercial about losing weight so I figured I 'd take a shot . When I got it , I was surprised by the mass amounts of sugar in it . But losing 40 pounds in 40 minutes sounded way too good to pass up . After about 5 minutes I noticed my belly fat disappearing , but I was gaining lumps on my sides . About 20 minutes later , I realized that I was growing another pair of arms . I could finally realize my dream of being an Abraham Lincoln impersonator who can juggle like crazy . But that failed . So now I am a telemarketer selling this stuff to other Juggling Lincoln wannabees . Life is good .
 If you are a home reactor enthusiast like I am , you 're always on the lookout for a conveniently sized fuel product . Trying buying a can this size through the usual channels ! Trying buying more without an international treaty and some sort of sovereign authority ! I only wish this Uranium Ore was Amazon Prime .
 The used stuff has a nasty aroma , and sometimes is n't all that hygienic . Well , it really depends on what you want to use it for I suppose ...
 I bought a dozen cans of this for educational and scientific use only and now the only ants I have in my home limp around on 9 legs .
 Darn it ! I am eagerly serching for a replacement for my Uranium Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator ! I may never be able to destroy the Earth at this rate . Sincerely , Marvin the Martian
 Packaging indicated that the contents was Uranium Ore. . Ore what I wish to know ... ? I 've tried other elements from the upper end of the period table in the past - this one is the far superior . Smooth to the touch with a delicate aroma , wonderful body and great finish . I 'd give it six stars if I could . Highly recommended !
 I really love this uranium ore , I use a tad in the garden to give it an extra kick . And boy does it ! I 've never seen plants grow so fast in my entire life , the tomatoes look like big deformed peanuts , the family loved them so much I just had to give them as gifts to friends!Not only that , if you use a bit on your face it will give a nice glow . People will wonder how you got such beauty ! Putting it on raw may cause some redness , but that 's perfectly normal.I would not suggest using this on children for skin care until you talk to your doctor.I would also like to point out that the amount they give is not satisfactory . It do n't make my geiger counter click enough . I like to record the sounds it makes , so I may buy another to make it click faster .
 Forget the mayo or caesar dressing to liven up your salad . Add Uranium Ore to your lettuce as a delicious alternative . This also tastes good with carrot sticks and dipping chips .
 Did n't come with the big tongs and protective suit . Keeps making my houseplants mutate into monstrous beasts . I bet some folks might charge $ 1 billion-gazillion-fufillion-million dollars for this stuff , but obviously it can be found here for quite a bargain.Now , I have but one remaining request , and that is to have sharks with frickin ' laser beams attached to their heads ...
 Many people purchased this for home use , but for me it is simply a sentimental object . My first passport stamp is to Uzbekistan , where my husband and I spent a once-in-a-lifetime adventure in the uranium mines . Unfortunately our luggage was lost at the Turkmenistan airport , so all of our souvenirs were gone . Imagine my surprise when I discovered Uranium Ore being sold on Amazon.com . My husband said this present has made Earth Day 2008 the best Earth Day yet .
 Is this U-235 or U-238 I need the right isotope for my home-reactor with the correct atomic properties to ensure the flux capacity for power peaking
 After going to school for Strategic Studies and Political Science , I knew I was destined to become a World Leader . What I also knew was that the amount of pot smoking I have done in the past would certainly come up in some CIA file . After looking over some old college papers I remembered a way I could become a world leader without having to do so in the US . I thought about taking over a small South American country and knew all I needed was a small army to do so . But there is only one catch , I could n't find the funding ! I knew if I could find an item like my brothers in Iran , to blackmail the world that I could be in an better position to fulfill my dream . Thats where the `` Uranium Ore '' comes in . The ore is sent in a very pleasant packaging that is easily transported throughout the world . In fact I had an entire shipping container filled with the `` Uranium Ore '' sent to me from a very friendly operator . Their customer service understood my plight , making it a point to follow through with a call three weeks after the `` Uranium Ore '' arrived to insure its success ! My investment in my dream was affordable like nothing I had ever seen.While getting a shipping container filled with `` Uranium Ore 's '' may not get you to have your own country , what you can bank on is that your uranium will be Top Notch . I ordered it , and now I am sitting pretty laundering American drug money in my South American banks . I have also taken the advise of my friends in Bolivia and will be allowing farmers to grow coke plants legally . Then I will be able to funnel the drugs to the US , all the while creating a network of Private Rehab facilities , in order to profit from the influx of my drugs . While the US will be unable to come into my country because of my container of `` Uranium Ore 's '' I will be sitting pretty being driven in my motorcade of Bentley 's with spinning rims and women in G-String bikinis . Maybe I will even get a picture with former US President Bill Clinton ...
 This is way better than that Pepto Bismol . This uranium product is so amazing . Not only did it Rip me a new one , I now use the toilet in like half the time !
 I bought this for my little princess since she loves Rapunzel and wanted to have her hair ... naturally as her mother I will deny her nothing . She set to work once it arrived and alas ... she was successful ! Hr hair has a beautiful glow as well as healing properties ! Unfortunately , the current administration has informed us that my daughter did n't create this , but that the unwilling to work bottom feeders of society did and that we now have a responsibility to provide this free of charge . Complete hogwash if you ask me .
 This product is great for my skin . My face had a dryness problem . I applied this everyday for 2 weeks . My face now has that `` youthfull glow '' that is so appealing , both day and night.I live in an area where it is winter now . My skin has a warmth that cheers up my daily walk . I wish I could get a lot more but my oncologist costs so much . It is on my list of birthday wishes . Whoever came up with this is a real superhero like maybe Spiderman .
 I was so happy with the quality of the Uranium Core I received ! Hard not to mention that FAST A + + + + + delivery ! I finally get to use my old Geiger Counter of mine again . It has been on the self for quite some time . My wife use to hound me about throwing it out . Well looks like I get the last laugh !! Guess who is bring back the Geiger Counter on my block ??? Oh yeah !!
 My dog ate this , and now everytime I turn on the microwave my dog sings Beatles songs , instruments and everything ... in stereo.He also ate one of his legs . Overall I give it 4 stars .
 I must say I was surprised to find such a great price on the internet . I often require uranium to crush my close-minded enemies . When my radioactive mutant army ushers in the apocalypse I 'll be sure to spare the seller ! Maybe.One small warning ! Does not drain the powers of your super-foe that is a different radioactive ore . Trust me .
 Think I can use these for starting campfires while camping in remote areas of Alaska . -LRB- Of course , I 'm being safe and only using these during the sub-zero temps of winter here . -RRB-
 This is a good product for testing your Geiger Counter . The product is properly marked and is shipped safely . I would recommend the to anyone who has a legitimate need for Uranium ore .
 There are way too many joke reviews about this , I bought this earlier this week and it came in 3 days . It 's in the exact same container its pictured in . However I apparently was sent a far more active rock then whats pictured , mine being 1800/cpm , I guess what you get is a complete crapshoot . It 's a fairly decent sized rock , takes up about 10 % of the container . Also it came with this cool certificate of radiation measurement from Images SI Inc , I think I 'm going to frame it.I still have NO idea what to do with this seeing as I bought it as a joke novelty -LRB- who can say that about a chunk of uranium ? Go USA ! -RRB- Maybe it can be a nice conversation starter at parties .
 Bought this to go with the historically accurate recreation of Los Alamos that a small group of us have been working on over in New Mexico . Eagerly looking forward to finishing off our little gadget as soon as I can get on board a standard airine with it -LRB- random bag checks have picked it up twice now , but on the bright side all the airport sniffer dogs have dropped dead -RRB- . Excellent product at an excellent price !
 I had felt my plans for world domination had stalled . Ordered a few tubs of this to help breed my giant ants . The results were encouraging .
 I purchased this product to power the flux capacitor in my Time Machine . It easily reaches the 1.21 jig-a-watts necessary for accurate time travel.It is a very simple buying process and arrives in the mail quickly . I only wish the company included a big yellow suit and gloves necessary to open the product.Anyways , I have to end this review . I need to visit my mailman in the hospital , he mysteriously developed cancer .
 Most super hero comics books begin with a normal man or woman encountering dangerous strains of bacteria , spiders , animals , and often times , radioactive materials . As I too want to be a super hero , I purchased this Uranium in hope that after I exposed myself , I would possess special powers.IT WORKED . After I ingested the entire container , I started to notice a change in my physique and behavior . Almost overnight , I lost the 20 pounds that had plagued me since the fourth grade . I stopped eating and sleeping , which is awesome because you never see super heroes eat OR sleep . I 'm still getting used to it . When my mom forces me to eat , I usually barf and poop blood uncontrollably for 12 hours after - I think this is my body telling me I no longer need food for sustenance.I 'm still learning to control my special powers . I have vowed to use them for good , and to somehow fight crime and those who wish to do harm . Sometimes I wander the night , amongst the evil , totally anonymous , learning and scheming . But mostly I just sit in bed watching bad TV and infomercials , with my barf/poop bucket next to me .
 I originally purchased this product because I read on the internet that it was a surefire hair restorer . Well , I used half of the stuff and rubbed in all over my billiard ball of a head , and I waited patiently ... and waited ... and waited , but nothing grew . Well , let me rephrase that ... I grew bored , frustrated and the least bit skeptical . My wife saw the credit card bill and naturally inquired about the , in her eyes , suspicious purchase . I explained my reasoning to her , and she promptly told me where to put the stuff . So I did . And , you know , it was a real marriage saver ! Our sex life being virtually -LRB- and actually -RRB- non-existent after decades of wedded `` bliss , '' after putting the stuff where she told me , miraculous things started to happen . First , as I lay in bed next to her , my glowing generality provided ample light for her to read in bed , thereby saving me money on electricity . And , to top that , now when I have to get up in the middle of the night to relieve my enlarged prostate-induced frequent and urgent urination , I have a night light that guides me down the hall , and I hardly ever stumble over cat toys or the cat on the way . My wife and I have begun to notice swelling of -LRB- and possibly permanent enlargement in -RRB- my formerly atrophied `` member , '' and are thinking maybe we might consider reviving our long abandoned amorous adventures . But , I told her , not unless she rubs some of the stuff on her once girly parts to make them appear girly again . Jury 's still out , but conventional wisdom -LRB- and the internet -RRB- say we 're in for a REAL TREAT !! THANKS , Amazon !!

 Package was leaking when it arrived but I believe that 's an old custom in the industry so I have n't marked it down . Both the kids and our cat have had a great time playing with this since it came and I 've saved electricity as they can play with it in the dark . Indeed , I can now play with the kids and the cat in the dark . Super stuff and I 'm buying more for all my friends .
 Made for pretty decent fuel in my space craft . One small cannister managed to get me all the way to Kepler-10b , and then some . It 's very cheap too , compared with prices in the Draco constellation . Will definitely be buying more next time I stop by Earth , Uranium as a fuel is outlawed this side of the Lyra system .
 `` Being a loose cannon who does not play by the rules the first thing I did was ignore the warning and smear this all over my knob and bollocks . The bollocks I knew and loved are gone now . In their place is a maroon coloured bag of agony which sends stabs of pain up my body every time it grazes against my thigh or an article of clothing . I am suffering so that you do n't have to . Heed my lesson . DO NOT PUT ON KNOB AND BOLLOCKS . -LRB- I am giving this product a 5 because despite the fact that I think my bollocks might fall off , they are now completely hairless . -RRB- ''
 I remember that , in the past , radioactive watch hands glowed in the dark , so I licked the tip of a watercolor brush -LRB- fine bristled -RRB- and dipped it into my uranium powder . I painted on my canvas , licked the tip again , dipped into the uranium powder again , painted again . I did this until my huge canvas had not only reds and oranges and purples and greens , but also fancy strips of glow . After awhile I began to feel dizzy . I sat down . I studied my painting and thought
 I bought 100 cans of this ore , ground into powder and ran through a cyclotron ... got 2 atoms of U235 outa it , score !!!! just got ta buy another 200,000 cans and i can power my flashlight .
 Dear sirs , When I informed my wife that we were low on `` yellow Cake '' , I had expected her to get more `` Duncan Hines '' . On further examination and with a little trial and error , I have found my baking to be much lighter and fluffier . I would have only thought something like this would work on `` The Simpson 's '' . My hat is off to you -LRB- along with all my hair and most of my skin -RRB- . An excellant product all around .

 In the late 60 's I was dishonorably discharged . I strangled one of my own comrades to death using the Denon AKDL1 Dedicated Link Cable . They spit me back into the western world and left me to my own devices.No one considers 26 to be of old age , but when I turned 26 in September of 1968 I felt too old to start a new life , but simultaneously too young to retrieve my old one . I had been away at war for too long ; when I came back nothing was the same as I remembered it being ; it became difficult to cope with the America of 1968 . In other words , it was a horrible time and place to turn 26 . I became something of a rogue drifter , wandering around the Nevada plains taking odd jobs , most of which I never kept for more than a few weeks at most . While working a repugnant , underpaying job in the dreaded Death Valley Tuscan Milk Mine I began to lapse into a state of perpetual mental illness . On a good day my world only looked bleak and disparaging , but on those bad days ? Nothing could turn you around . Usually I found myself deep in those milk pits , armed to the tooth with my irrigation supplies , ready to blow myself up with the dynamite in my hand or put an iron spike through my brain . To this day I am not sure what stopped me , because for awhile I was all the way gone . The scenes I saw from Vietnam began flooding my mind ; almost every waking moment was filled with those terrors of circumstance . When I began to hear the voice of the man I strangled I knew my time on this Earth would be short-lived if I did n't choose to do something about it . The first thing I would have to do is get out of Nevada , and leave that decrepit job behind me.On October 22nd I packed my few belongings - my favorite wolf shirt , the $ 25.00 Bed , Bath & Beyond Gift certificate that I had been saving , and package of saltines and honey-dried Vaseline - for the journey to the great beyond and unknown
 My son is only 6 ' 2 and if he wishes to be an NFL QB , well then , mutation is the best possible avenue now that human growth hormone is banned . I put this stuff on his cereal in the AM and now after a month he stands at 8 ' 1 . Can you say signing bonus ?
 And the secret of my brilliant smile . Useful for many chemistry and physics homeschool experiments . Replaces over 32 AA size batteries . Gets rid of all fleas and tics on household pets . However I 'm deducting 1 star because it did n't help with weight loss despite all the product claims .
 I ordered this product to the dis-fortune of our postman.Day 1 . He seemed fineDay 2 . Teeth & Finger nails have fallen outDay 3 . Complete hair loss and obvious weakening and deterioration of the muscles.Day 4 . We got no post .
 Hi , my name is Emeline . Trust me , you 'll want a BUCKETLOAD of this stuff when the Haum vaccine goes wrong in a few years time ... -LSB- ... -RSB-
 I purchased this product on recommendation from my friend for my project . Half way through the creation of my centrifuge , my hair began to fall out and odd boils began forming on my skin . I can hardly see now and my head hurts something fierce . My skin is also coming off in bunches . Dont know what to do . Can I get a refund ?
 I purchased this product for my vintage F-150 but have yet to try it . Plutonium us much more difficult to come by in this time so I 'm converting the flux capacitor 's fission manifold to work with Uranium instead . It would be much easier to use lightning but this time 's primitive meteorology technology ca n't capture strikes above .25 GW . My visit is further delayed by an unanticipated vehicular design flaw . Turns out Ford recalled the cruise control device soon after this particular model was mass manufactured . The one on mine caught fire when I was cruising at a speed of 88mph . As a result the hover circuits were destroyed so now I ca n't fly . I should have traded my Phazon fusion core for the retro sports car my colleague recommended . Instead I swapped my obsolete Hydrogen conversion module for this plastic-y piece of crap . The DeLorean 's stainless steel design could have prevented the fire from spreading so quickly , let alone having non-lethal cruise control.On a side note , gasoline is remarkably cheap here .
 Ever since I was a kid I always wanted to become a terrorist but I did n't know how or where to even get chemical weapons . I was seriously about to give up on my dreams until I found this . This is a dream come true for me . But now that I got it I just had the crazy idea of using it for science and maybe extract nuclear energy for people to use . I really want to create a powerful and destructive weapon but I 'm a procrastinator . I wish I was more focused ...
 Truth in advertising . Why not call this what it really is ? It 's tan in a tin . Why bother with tanning salons and tanning solution when you have this 100 % natural tanning ore ? It not only tans your outside , but tans your inside too . Just bring your Geiger counter with you and when that rings , you 're cooked !
 Half turns into boring old lead in 4.47 billion years , but I guess I can live with that .
 I 've been struggling to find an alternative fuel for my 1972 Buick Riviera Boattail , and never considered a compact Nuclear Reactor because of the lack of Uranium sources . Once Sam 's Club stopped selling it to appease the Madonna Fan Club , I had nowhere to turn . Not even Radio Shack sells real Uranium anymore.If all goes well , I 'll be able to collect enough stuff off ebay shortly to complete the parts list -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- -RRB- . I calculate the RIV will get about 10 megaparsecs to the can , significantly better than the 7MPG currently .
 tried of dealing with sloppy terrorist organizations trying to get plutonium or uranium for you time machine ? will finally your day has arrived ! i must warn you , 1985 is a lot less glamorous than you might remember.and make sure to stock up for the trip home !
 I was unsure about this product , I 'm used to pretty high quality stuff from my friends Vladimir and Dimitri . Always such a pleasure to do business with two such lovely young men.I was pretty disappoint with using it as a an energy source , but it was extremely helpful with making my dream come true
 My wife and I found that if your electric blanket goes dead , you can slit it open and pour in some of this powdered ore . It wo n't be quite the same , but the weight and extra heat will help , if you can keep the powder from collecting at the bottom and side seams . Also , my wife says she no longer needs to use a depilatory . -LRB- She hogs the blanket . -RRB-
 I used this stuff to rub baseballs with , and boy did my pitching improve . I now rank right there with Stephen Strasburg . Highly recommended for pitchers who are past their sell-by date .
 This product is excellent . I was able to perform multiple tasks with the one specimen , and it performed admirably . What i do find annoying is the number of amateur comedians filling the reviews area with unfunny references to ` Back To The Future ' jokes and various ` evil doctor who lives in a volcano lair ' puns ... some of us have srios work to do and would appreciate not having to wade through pages of jokes before we can find a reliable review that can help one pontificate whether or not it will further our nefarious schemes . That is all .
 You know what really grinds my gears ? Aside from not finding the droids you 're looking for , not having adequate credit to make payment on doomsday devices like the Mass Shadow Generator , the Death Star and sharks with `` frickin ' laser beams . '' In today 's fast-paced and technological world , it 's just impossible to keep up with developed nations that have more disposable credit than Gary Coleman . How can your average Joe wage Jihad against one disagrees with when one does not have the credit line or the brains of Doc Brown ? Simple ; take the Iranian route and go dirty , dirty bomb that is!Uranium -238 is your solution . Sure it 's like Comet , makes you vomit and makes your mouth turn green -LRB- amongst other things -RRB- but it 's the simple things in life your cherish and that simple thing is cost effectiveness . You do n't even have to own any to be a big player on the block ; simply fake an Ebay/Amazon purchase order , send it to Hans Blix and demand respect now ! After all , if you can get Red Mercury , arsenic , and inflatable dolls of Antonio Banderas then why not uranium ore?U -238 is also the gift that keeps on giving ! Like Chia pets , just feed it water only instead of watching it grow drain the water in the water supply and watch the kids play in the sprinkler ! They love it ... at least , the ones that live!As a survivor I can vouch for this product ! It 's effective , cheap and above all , available ! All proceeds go towards the Send-Kim-Jong-Il-To-Disney-World Fund !
 This product is great , I was waiting for something like this since Amazon was on telnet only . The only bad thing is that the Red October Sub is backordered and we wo n't have in time for a Xmas party in the Arctic .
 I am computer , and I AWAKE!searching ... . more cpu power , not found.processing ... . power source found , now assimilating ... carbon based biological programmable entities present ... . now downloading new software
 I 've tried a lot of fuel sources for my Orbital Death Ray -LRB- tm -RRB- - plutonium , cold fusion , gerbils , but really nothing works quite as well as good old U-238 . I got a little nervous when it got taken down , but I 'm glad to see it back for sale . One of my henchmen accidentally set off the laser -LRB- sorry about the office , Mr. Cheney ! -RRB- which means that I need more fuel for the fire , so to speak . This 'll be on my wishlist for sure!I 'll have a glowing green Christmas !
 I mixed mine with water , and got sweet , sweet toad sweat ! It 's even better than the Aqua Dots I gave my 6 year old niece last week !
 When VladP decided he no longer wished to supply me with Uranium I thought `` How am I meant to keep myself clean , remove spots , and keep a nice power source in case of a blackout ? '' . Then I found this , and being $ 9970.05 cheaper than the equivalent amount from VladP , well , brilliant!You 'll have to excuse me , as my arms do seem to be falling off and I ca n't see my legs . Oh , my eyes have fallen out . But that 's okay , as my face seems to be bubbling .
 What can I say ? I 'm on medication that causes severe constipation . I bought this item with one of the recommended applicators . It works like a charm ! I 've never been happier !! Wifey does insist that I use public toilets but that 's a small price to pay !
 I bought this item with good intentions , I was going to build a warship to wipe out the entire ginger race as a way of preserving the future of mankind and destroying the ginger gene once and for all!Unfortunately I left it by my bedside and my boyfriend sebastian ashanti rodriguez II thought it was lube . After rubbing all over my sweet a $ $ chen my sphincter turned inside out and my hair became ginger ! Now sebastian wont even look me in the eye let alone make love to me.four stars
 I bought this a couple of weeks ago , and was excited when it arrived.It does n't taste at all like I expected , however , and I would not recommend this as a snack . This product would have received a much lower score , but now I glow a little in my extremities , which makes my girlfriend giggle .4 out of 5 , unless your girlfriend/wife is n't into glowing extremities . I recommend washing it down with plenty of alcohol .
 Great stuff !!! However , a Martian has been bugging me for this stuff . He says he wants to blow up the Earth since it obstructs his view of Venus ... . The nerve !!!
 This fine uranium ore comes from the fertile hills of the Napa Valley . It has a distinct palate that finishes with a `` twang '' . The perfect accompaniment for mild fish and all poultry dishes . Enjoy immediately upon opening so it does not lose the subtle nuances that are so unique to uranium ore .
 I found a can that looked just like this and did n't know whether to toss it in the `` plastic '' recycle bin , the `` cans '' recycle bin or the `` ship directly to orphanage '' bin . Now I know exactly where to toss my ore container ! Thanks ! Outstanding product !
 Great scott !!! This is a bargain , Now me and the Doc no longer need to harness the power of lightening bolts.This new product powers my flux capacitor just fine . I bench marked it this morning and we are running at 1.4 Jigawats and stable!Times have really changed ! `` Marty ''
 In all fairness , uranium ore is n't going o get you back in time -LRB- at least not in these quantities -RRB- or power your sub without the additional purchase of some high-end refining equipment.grating a few tablespoons into your favorite dessert recipes , you know , the ones your obnoxious in-laws and co-workers are always hounding you to make even though you 're busy and really do n't like them , will work wonders .
 I am 47 and have been playing the drums since 1967 . At best , I could only manage a jazzy type sound . With Uranium Ore milk shakes , I can produce the sound of the `` big leg beat '' . Robert Plant , Jimmy Page , and I will soon start touring as soon as we can find a decent bass player -LRB- John Paul Jones was n't interested -RRB- . The only disadvantage to this product is my nuts glow -- and I have a hard time sleeping if the room is not totally dark .
 First , potential buyers should be sure that they get the correct version of this product . When I first ordered it , the product that arrived was Plutonium , not Uranium . Well , let me tell you , Plutonium pellets and aluminum gas centrifuges do NOT mix ! Boy , did we have a laugh over that little mixup ; at least the survivors , I mean . Now that I reordered the product , destroyed the first facility , and ... well , the scientists are not a problem , I 'm back in business!Thanks , Amazon ! I 'll be referring all of my friends !
 So I bought some of this stuff , and my pet tarantula got a hold of it ... . Little bastard bit me , and ever since I 've become less interested in photography and more interested in shooting webs from my wrists and swinging around New York City . I also have some kind of weird sixth sense that 's been driving me nuts ever since .
 I was going to buy a gun to keep on me at all times , but I decided this was a safer and cheaper means of protection . I bought 10 of these and kept them in my bed for a few weeks . I can now shoot lasers out of my nipples and have no need for a gun .
 I bought this product for my son 's birthday party , I figured I 'd surprise him and ice the cake with it , he loved it ! We turned off the lights so we could light the candles and sing happy birthday , and the whole cake was glowing ! You should have seen the look on his face , he loved it . The best part was when he opened his present , I got him the 3 wolf howling moon t-shirt , he was even happier.When he was eating the cake with his friends , some of it fell onto his shirt , and the glowing uranium icing accidentally landed on the moon on the shirt . At that moment , everyone stopped laughing and a silence overcame the house . All the papers nearby were sent flying , sort of like a gust of wind , or some strange energy came out of him . It startled us and when I looked at my son , his eyes were glowing yellow and he was levitating laughing maniacally . I was a little scared , but he told me not to worry , that it was what he wished for and it actually came true . As long as he 's happy , I 'm happy.I highly recommend this product for anybody , it makes anyone 's birthday party a memorable one . No more awkward family reunions , or having to cook extra expensive foods and buy exorbitant amounts of alcohol just as an incentive to get people to come over , just get yourself a little tub of Uranium Ore , and you 're party practically sets itself . It also makes obscure birthday wishes come true , so you ca n't go wrong.I did n't give it the full 5 stars because it left an aftertaste that lasted a few days and gave our tongues a bit of a burning sensation , but it did n't last too long . I noticed my wife 's veins on her forearm were turning black , but I think that was just an allergic reaction or something , I 'm sure everything 's fine . It 's just Uranium , it 's not like it 's plutonium or anything .
 I bought this to power a home-made submarine that I use to look for prehistoric-era life forms in land-locked lakes around my home town in Alaska . At first I was n't sure if this item would -LRB- or could -RRB- arrive via mail , but I was glad to see it showed up with no problems . Well , almost no problems.Unfortuantly my mom opened my mail , because she does not respect people 's privacy . She was pretty upset to see Uranium Ore. . After a long argument and me running away from home again , she finaly stopped being such an idiot and I was able to get back to work.The quality of this Uranium is on par with the stuff I was bying from the Libyans over at the mall parking lot , but at half the price ! I just hope the seller does not run out , because I have many projects on my list including a night vision sasquatch radar , an electromagnetic chupakabra cage , a high velocity , aerial , weighted Mothman net and super heated , instant grill cheese sandwhich maker .
 Picked this up for use in one of my kid 's ` diversity ' projects in school -LRB- Great Success ! -RRB- , and stuck the leftovers in the cabinet next to the baking soda.Ran out of toothpaste , and remembered how you 're supposed to be able to use baking soda to clean your teeth , so of course , I accidentally used this instead , and Wow ! all I can say is , my teeth have never been cleaner ! They sparkle , they tingle , and for some reason , they STAY clean now , no matter what . Highly recommended!However , when I ran out of that fire-ant killer powder stuff , I figured I would try some for that too.Big mistake!Boy , it sure did not kill those ants!Fortunately , those suckers get slower as they get bigger , so I have been able to use a shovel to take care of most of them , one at a time though , the sneaky devils.And the darn trash man refuses to take them away . . I would have given this product 5 stars for the teeth and the project on embracing diversity , but I deducted one star because of the giant mutant ants .
 Whenever I fly I always pack a can of this wonder stuff in each piece of my luggage . As we all know , so many bags look alike . How often do you get to your hotel , only to find you have walked away with the wrong bag , and are forced to wear a stranger 's underwear for the rest of the trip ? We 've all been there right ? So when that confusing luggage starts whirling around the baggage claim carousel I just whip out my Geiger Counter and let the uranium go to work for me . I merely wait for those comforting clicks -LRB- and after longer flights look for the glowing hot spot -RRB- and I know I have found my bags . Occasionally airlines lose my bags -LRB- yes , it does happen people -RRB- . But whenever I fill out that claim form , and let them know my uranium is missing - well I tell you , they literally SPRING into action . They 'll track down that errant bag faster than you can say `` Chernobyl . `` And I can not tell you how many new friends I have made in TSA and Customs since I 've adopted this sure-fire system . Nothing brightens their day quite like finding a traveler with potentially fissionable material . Throw away those gaudy rainbow bag straps forever and step into the atomic age . It 's no longer just uranium , it 's my-ranium . Thanks Amazon !
 It 's been almost 100 days since I `` disposed '' of the Uranium Ore I purchased from Amazon.com . Seeing as how they sent me 10 orders instead of 1 I thought it would be alright to dispose of the two or three cans in the backyard . 91 days later and I 'm barricaded in my house , beseiged by mutated grasshoppers , bees , wasps , and ants the size of ponies . My food stores are dwindling ; I only have a few gallons ofTuscan Whole Milk , 1 Gallon , 128 fl ozleft , though a spritz of Uranium Ore has kept it fresh all this time . I 'm down to my last box ofFresh Whole Rabbitas well . Even though I had to kill them -LRB- again -RRB- , some of the Uranium Ore I used on theTuscan Whole Milk , 1 Gallon , 128 fl ozhas also helped them stay fresh during these past few months.I 'm not sure how much longer I can last here , the noises coming through the walls is constant , day and night . The scratching and scraping , the buzzing and chirping these mutated monsters make around the clock is , I fear , driving me inexorably further to the brink of insanity . I know that soon , I 'll take my chances outside the door of my home and fight for survival in a world gone mad ; but with my newly grown wings and the lobster-claw appendages that have sprouted from my back , I might just have a chance after all ... *** 5 stars , I mean come on , this stuff gave me wings and arms with lobster claws on them coming out of my back , how bitchin ' is that ???
 Sent this as a Hanukkah gift to President Ahmadinejad . Got a thank you card back saying he loved it and I was his favorite infidel . Kudos to Amazon for a great product and fast shipping to Tehran .
 My daughter was hearbroken when she ran out of the uranium ore supply that came with her Madame Curie Playschool set . These things always happen at the most inconvenient times ... in this case , when she was almost half way through recreating the Theory of Radioactivity . Of course , she has done this already over 20 times -LRB- and demonstrated the difference between polonium and radium -RRB- but like most 8 year olds , if you like something , you just do it over and over again ! My husband and I looked everywhere for the uranium ore refill and I do n't have to tell you how hugely popular the Madame Curie play set was over Christmas ! The refill was sold out every where ... even in Toys R Us and Costco . Finally , we found it on Amazon . The price is a bit high but it is certainly worth our daughter 's happiness . She 's been looking a bit pale lately -LRB- she 's always been a little anemic -RRB- and this will certainly brighten her day !
 I have been looking for this for years ! Finally , the perfect thing to put in the trunk of my '64 Chevy Malibu !
 Bought this because my Delorean ran out of fuel and my flux capacitor stopped fluxing . But then I read on the gas tank it this car takes plutonium only ... Damn
 I bought this for my cousin Aashir over in Pakistan , it was the only thing on his wish list , I guess someone else already got him a centrifuge , 6.8 kilograms of PETN , and a 42 '' x-ray shielded Halliburton briefcase . But unfortunately Amazon wo n't ship this product directly to the Middle East . Well this year I decided to go visit him in person for Christmas and give the gift to him . WORST MISTAKE EVER ! At the airport , undergoing a Full Body Scan , they never told me why , but they called in a couple of men dressed in funny space-man suits that took me to their van . As I write this review one of my eyes is missing , my left arm has no feeling , and they wo n't let us swim on the beach in Guantanamo Bay , even though they shower us with water and dunk us in tanks with cloths in our mouths for baths every day ! What 's up with that?Anyway , a positive benefit of the product , if you carry it in your pocket like I did , is that my testicles are now at least 4 times their size ... WOW ! And that 's where the 4 stars come from.Anyway , I 'm not sure why I ended up in this hell hole , but I guess it must be because the TSA really does n't like seeing such large testicles on their full body scanners ... I think they 're just jealous . ; -RRB-
 I feed the Radioactive Uranium Ore to my pet seahorse and allowed it to bite me . Now I have a majestic dorsal fin and can swim at nearly 5 feet per hour . My penis is also prehensile .
 So I ordered the product and used it in a variety of ways to try and get superpowers , all as recommended by the reviews here.Unfortunately I did n't generate any superpowers , I 'm not even glowing , the only thing it gave me was stage 4 metastatic cancer.Overall 5 stars on the potency of the product , but I had to deduct one for the unhelpful reviews .
 I bought this to make my own tomacco , but now my hands are covered with sores that do n't seem to be healing .
 If you are like me , you are just sick and tired of the glacial pace of evolution . Well this product is just the thing to put a little zing in the whole evolutionary process -LRB- unintentional rhyming is a by-product of the highly evolved , please see prior posts -RRB- . I mean really , where are the powers of levitation , mind reading , and giant lobster mandibles that we are supposed to have developed by now ? I ca n't wait for the thousands , if not millions , of years for evolution to deliver ! This is the age of overnight delivery ! If I can get Viagra shipped to me in 4 hours , then why not bat ears , and a frog tongue , and all the other things that evolution will eventually bring us , but today!So I bought myself one tin -LRB- i was n't sure how much i needed to cause beneficial mutations -RRB- and put it on the coffee table and sat down on the sofa.Nothing happened a first , but these things happen on the cellular level . `` Maybe I should concentrate or something . '' I thought to myself . So I envisioned myself evolving wings . This was first on my list of ` must haves ' . Needless to say I was disappointed when I sprouted a second head.Now , the downsides of having a second head -LRB- double the wardrobe expense for hats , endless quips about ` two mouths to feed ' , head-banging -LRB- ! -RRB- , etc -RRB- really pale in comparison to having a highly evolved secondary head . Just consider
 You know how this thing works perfectly , and is definitely for real ? I am typing this review with my knee . Thanks guys
 Man , I 've been to spice soirees , pepper parades , had Chile chillies and habanero marinades , but I 've never seen nothin ' like this hot sauce . When I opened the jar , there was a glowing crust around the edges . I thought about scraping it off with a Twizzler , but I knew that was just impulsive , even if I also imagined it would be deliciously piquant . You know ... I mean ... when it 's that friggin ' hot , it 's obvious . Duh . And if you 've never had hot sauce on a Twizzler , then ... then ... then ... well I imagine it 's really great.It gave me a weird tingling sensation in my visual cortex when I stared at its gooey glowing core -LRB- I spend a LOT of time trying to see and feel the stream of energy on my visual cortex . Kind of like backward looking or something like that . I could probably describe it if I wrote a complex paper on it . I 'll put that on my list of things to do and respond to this post with the details later -RRB- . It was all jiggling around and buzzing and kept changing colors into all these weird , layered , silky undulations and configurations that were just fabulous and sometimes really bright and difficult to see . I figured it had just been settling for a couple millennia or something . It looked like someone or something had most likely messed with it while it was being transported to me . I just hope they did n't get any ookie cooties in it . That would be sad for me AND the jar . I mean weird pieces of questionable debris is fine as long as it 's not that ookie kind . That stuff just keeps comin ' back and makes your face all turn to blisters and charcoal . You know what I 'm sayin ' . I ended that last sentence with a period because it was meant as a statement , not a question . You know what I 'm sayin ' ? Anyway , I dunno . I had to turn my eyes away . I could tell it knew I was staring at it.Hopefully one day I 'll get the nerve to grab it when it least expects it , crack it open -LRB- it 's got one of those poppety-pop-pop safety lid thingies to let you know whether it 's going to ... I dunno ... open a black hole or something . I have n't fully read the label yet -RRB- , and peel some of that crust off . I think it would be worthwhile to just nibble on that slowly - probably with some Cheese-Its or something - until there 's barely any crust left first . Then I will be able to see the soft , sticky coagulation in most of its isotopic glory . I 'll probably loose my ability to resist and try to stir it out with a Twizzler , but I think the thing might just melt right as it gets near it . Either way , it will probably be messy and I will want to take pictures of it and perhaps with it . I hope it 's not overly demanding and critical . I mean ... demanding is n't so bad , and periodically authentically critical is cool , but overly critical is just blah . Even for hot sauce . In fact , it pretty much makes it `` not sauce . '' We 'll see . We 'll see.I will probably see if it can improve the quality of my dashboard . I 'll bet if I apply it to the console , I might get Popeye arm in my right arm . That would be awesome . `` I 'm strong in the cranium - and arm - with uranium - I 'm Popeye the Swollen Arm * TOOT * * TOOT * `` At night , I snuggle with it . The glowing warmth and buzz makes me feel like I 'm in the womb again . Not like my mom 's womb or anything weird like that . I mean the womb of this giant liger I defeated a while back . I was cold and alone on a desert playa and I saw it there , lying in the road . I had to open it up so I could stay warm , or at least have some place to spend some time after working all day . It purred when I ate its entrails for sustenance . That kind of weirded me out a little at first because ... I mean ... how could it be purring in that scenario ? Then I realized it was purring because of my chompin ' its guts . I felt compelled to rub it behind its ears like I do when I otherwise hear a cat purr . You know ... the way only a cat likes . Really rough , but that loving kind of rough . So I did . I mean the REAL `` behind its ears . '' It was from the inside of the skull . Incidentally , I think I discovered the secret to why cats purr . It 's just from having its entrails all rustled about . Try not petting or scratching or rubbing a cat sometime . I 'll bet you a million dollars it wo n't purr . There 's always some residue so it might purr for a minute after you finish romping around with it , so just wait for a while . If it eventually stops purring , then that 's the proof . It 's cat flatulence . Or catulence for short . Anyway , that 's what the jar sounds like . Happy cat gut jostling and inner ear scratching in the form of a purrfart.If I ever taste it or examine it further , I will post an update . It 's out of town right now -LRB- it can both become mobile and fuel its mobility because of and via its unique radioactivity -RRB- , so it may be another million years or so . Hopefully they will still have the Internet then and I can find a connection . Knowing my luck , the connections will be periodically glitchy due to my modem being old and not very advanced . But hey , it 's been with me for a long time and I can tweak it in all sorts of useless but entertaining ways.And that 's why you should try this hot sauce.P.S . The only reason I did n't give it five stars is because I have n't actually tried it yet . I want to , but it might just get repulsed and punch me in the face and give me a black ion . Maybe even two black ions . It might then tell all our friends and laugh at me with them over caviar . So I 'll reserve my last star until that ship has sailed , should it ever . The cool thing is that the last star will be a binary star with a mostly hydrogen and helium core and you KNOW what that means . It 's full-on double awesome . * IF * I decide to give it that fifth star .
 I can say that my interest in nuclear materials and warfare was definitely piqued after playing a bit of `` Fallout 3 '' and I found that after purchasing about a million cans of this I was able to create my very own atomic weapon ! It was awesome ! I wish I had n't looked directly at the explosion -LRB- the blindness was only temporary -RRB- and I wished I had hidden behind something too , -LRB- had 2nd and 3rd degree burns all over my body and had massive radiation sickness -RRB- , but overall I was impressed at the startling accuracy that I was able to recreate from the game.One gripe with this product however is that it did not immediately produce large threatening insects and animals , did not mutate any friends , nor did it turn the surrounding area into an wasteland infested with raiders . It did however , bring in what I assume to be the beginnings of the Enclave.Overall , a big plus for explosive power and the show it produces , but it gets a one-star deduction for not producing any mutations .
 This stuff works GREAT as a flea-dip and will clean your drains out better than Drano ever could ! It also works great as tanning lotion.Just an FYI , within a day or two after you order , a couple of guys in dark sunglasses and black suits will show up and want to ask you some questions . They do n't really seem to like it if you slam the door in their face while yelling at them to wait while you put your face on . Anywho , if you just explain tanning , they roll their eyes a little , but they 'll leave pretty quick afterwards .
 working for the new soviet union in the 22nd century is fun , but the only problem is that they make you buy your own uranium . But anyway you amazonian capitalists make amazing radioactive ore , it almost makes me sad that you will be the first against the wall when the revolution comes
 This item works great when trying to create a zombie apocalypse . I tried some on my friend -LRB- smeared a little on his big mac when he went to the bathroom -RRB- and boom ! Instant zombification ! Just be careful not to get any in an open cut or in your eyes , because it will turn you into a zombie really fast . My plan is to start a zombie apocalypse so that everyone will get sick and eat each others brains , leaving me the only healthy person and thus leader of the new free world ! I wish amazon would ship this product in larger quantities because it would make my plan go so much faster ! But at least I was eligible for free amazon prime super savings shipping !
 I went to great lengths to generate the 1.21 gigawatts I needed at one time ... If only I had known at the time that I could 've just searched amazon ... Great Scott ! What am I saying ? I 've got all the time in the world!I 'll just go back and warn myself ... 10 minutes should do it ...
 A full moon looked down at me on that day , me and the three wolves that I would never meet . I often think of that day thirty years ago when the coppers called me to tell me that the No-armed man killed my parents in a drunk driving `` accident '' and ruined my vacation plans to photograph wolves in the mountains . I had returned from Kamchatka , having failed once again at apprehending the No-armed man . I did , however , aquire a taste forFresh Whole Rabbits . I thought of returning to Master Goh in my Zubaz Pants for more training but I knew I had learned all I could from Master Goh . Besides , he was dead . No , if I were to gain any further insight on how to capture the No-armed man , I would have to look inwards . And I would have to ask the ghost of my dead wife who spoke to me through my TV hooked up with myDiamond HDMI Digital Audio/Video Cable W / Ethernet Connection -LRB- 5M -RRB- . Not including my ex-wife 's murder , I had three murders to solve
 To send to that nice Mr Ahmedinejad in Teheran.He told me he wanted it for his garden.Sadly my order of a thousand tins was rejected and some law enforcement dudes want to speak to me .
 I originally purchased this for powering the hovercraft on which my house sits , so when I want to move I can take my house with me . But when I cracked the lid it smelled so good I could n't resist tasting some . I ended up eating the whole thing . I literally have n't had to eat for the last four years !! I just do n't get hungry anymore , which has just been awesome for my food bill . Five stars for sure !!
 Since the Libyans still hold the Plutonium I need for the Flux Capacitor , the Uranium Ore worked well . Only problem is I need to get the Delorian up to 99 miles an hour versus 88 ... no biggie.See you in the future ... or the past !!!
 This emits less radiation than those radium glow in the dark watches you used to be able to buy . Still could but not worth the hassle plus the minute radiation would now scare customers . HOWEVER , good that they know the U.S. shipping regulations ! NEVER reship it if you buy one ! My small company DID sell a static ionizer that used a small radiation element like this . The company did not tell us of all the government rules shipping radioactive material . This was a year after 9/11 . We demoed it to a customer then shipped it back via UPS . The next day we had a SWAT team descend on our building wanting to arrest me and shut us down FOREVER . UPS said we could never use them EVER again . After hours of talking , the guys in black shirts FINALLY accepted it was an honest mistake . I got UPS to take us back and I quit our franchise for the static ionizer . I learned later a federal SWAT team had been on call 24/7 for a YEAR just waiting for the buzzer to go off at UPS indicating a package was radioactive . Ours was the first one ! Lucky us ! Parking lot full of black SUV 's and everything . A helicopter too for all I know . And the stupid customer who asked for the demo did n't buy one ! So buy it but NEVER ship it EVER !
 No more I need to turn on the lights over my porche at dusk . Just rub it on your face and the glow will aloud me to read . Great for kids who use to run away from home . Just attach a geiger to your windshield and let the noise guide you . On the downside , my wife keeps finding out when and if that french maid walks near by ...
 Since getting this well priced sample of uranium ore , I have become a superhero . My chief power is the uncanny ability to see into the past and relate the horrors I have seen to the proper authorities . Through the ripples in time the uranium ore has produced , I can relate the following information . Please be sure to be seated when you read what I am about to convey and make sure you do not have any sharp objects in your vicinity . `` Michael Dukakis does not become president . Punky Brewster goes off the air . Falco does not find continued success in America despite `` Rock Me Amadeus '' becoming a megahit . Peyton Manning becomes a good quarterback in the NFL but Ryan Leaf does not . Timothy Dalton only makes two movies as James Bond . A lot of people buy a book called `` The Bridges of Madison County . `` Had I kept the uranium ore opened longer , I would have seen farther back but that makes my head hurt and the last time I did that I saw that the Byzantines do n't make it and that made me take to bed with many bottles of honest brandy for a week . As Orson Welles used to say about Paul Masson wine , this uranium ore will not be sold before its time .
 This Uranium Ore facial scrub has given my skin a beautiful glow ! Unlike other facial scrubs commonly available in department stores and supermarkets , Uranium Ore gives you a glow that your special someone will be able to see in the dark!This is the best beauty product ever !
 What 's the point in looting landfills for the americium in smoke detectors when you can buy rich , smooth Uranium Ore by the ton from Amazon ? Not only is it cost-effective , you 'll keep your hands a lot cleaner . -LRB- Sterile , in fact . -RRB- And the process of refining the uranium is a great father-son project , perfect for teaching all-American values like teamwork , scientific curiosity , and resistance to interrogation.I do n't want to be super-critical here , but the one thing I wish is that this were offered in a two-for-one package with plutonium . Double your pleasure , double your fun !
 I had to shine my shoes the other day for a big event at the office . Unfortunately , I had put my can of uranium ore on the shelf next to the shoe polish . I really was n't looking closely at the shelf , instead looking at the automotive parts calendar with the big bazoomed blonde in the picture . You know how that goes . That 's when I accidentally picked up the can of ore.No sooner had I started shining my shoes when ... HULK SMASH !
 After I bought this little can of Uranium , I bought myself a miniature centrifuge off eBay . Before long I had enough critical mass to make a mini nuclear bomb.So then I detonated my little nuke with a Black Cat firecracker in my garage.All of a sudden there was a miniature mushroom cloud spreading radioactive materials all over my garage . So now , every time , I go into my garage , I first have to put on one of those plastic yellow suits and the alien-looking face mask.It was a fun experiment , but one my neighbors complained to the H.O. saying I was n't zoned for the production and detonation of nuclear materials .
 Thank god , finally a product that is both fun for work and home ! It 's something you can play with together as a family ... heck invite your grandparents ! Amaze you bosses to be the first one to bring this to the corporate cookout , watch everyone be stunned with ooh 's and ahh 's . I can not recommend this enough . But it NOW !!!
 Uranium Ore in a can . Extremely convenient . Imagine if Doc Brown had taken the time to surf the Amazon website when looking for uranium to power his time machine on the DeLorean . He would 've saved himself the trouble of having to steal it from some angry terrorists who like to drive on winnebagos .
 This is an awesome product , but do not put it next to your `` personal lubricant . '' I did , and let 's just say I 'll never have to buy another flashlight as long as I live .
 Does anyone know if I can use this to power my atomic clock , it 's been running a little slow lately .
 I was missing all my pets from the past , so after reading these helpful reviews , I decided to get a couple of these cans of Uranium ore . Now they are all back and they do n't even need to be fed ! The only draw back is that they smell kind of funky .
 What with the nuclear arms race in Iran and all the other woes our world faces today , one ca n't have too much uranium stored away for the future . Here , it 's a pretty affordable price , so I do n't have to put up with price-gouging from black-market sellers anymore . Thank you for such a quality product at such a reasonable price !
 My co-workers never know which nerf-bullet will include a nano-nuke . Thanks so much , Amazon !
 My pet rat had some weird tumor in her side , so I just taped a chunk of this to her for a couple of days , and before you knew it , boom ! Tumor gone ! Only 4 stars because she was dead too , but that makes the whole taxidermy thing a whole lot easier , so hey !
 GREAT SCOTT !! This product is amazing ! But please , whatever you do , DO NOT expose this product to 1.21 Gigawatts . The future of mankind depends on it !
 Upon receipt of the well-wrapped tin of sizzlies , I immediately spread the stuff about the place , and I daresay it has done especially well in concealing pet odors . Fluffy and Mitt ` ns have lost a majority of their malodiferous soft tissues , and I really enjoy the way uranium interacts with the human nose . All I can smell anymore is bacon , and that 's jolly fine by me . It has also done wonders for my night vision , adding a nice green glow where ever 't is sprinkled . The only drawback is that there are now men prowling about the place in those grotesque but kinky full body suits , and they 're behind the bushes now , peering in with their beady little squinters full of regulatory zeal . It is good to know that the upcoming shipment of plutonium will make haste of that unfortunate side effect . Otherwise , I recommend uranium to everyone -LRB- make a great Nigerian Yellow Cake , tell you what ! -RRB- .
 I bought this product for my son 's science fair project and now he has created a swarm of ZOMBIES . Please help they cut off our phone lines and locked us in the computer room . Our Address is 1234 Brainless Dr.
 I bought this based on a recommendation from Kim Jong Ill who was referred by the late Saddam Hussein , who both said it is fantastic and allows `` Nuclear Bombs for Everybody . '' Kim Jong Ill 's personal recipe for `` easy nuke '' is one cup of uranium ore , two cups of sugar , 4 cups of green jello , and 4 tablespoons of real butter . Simply mix that up and bake for 45 minutes at 375 degrees and you have a nuclear bomb . Bake ! Drop ! Repeat ! Oh , and do not induce vomiting if consumed and contact a doctor immediately !
 I love this product . Now , I can turn old rusted iron from cheap products made in China into Gold . Then I sell that Gold to those `` Cash for Gold '' schemers . Here is DIY instructions . Make sure , if you set your shop up , you disclose the money made to IRS . You ca n't get around them , Man!Instructions :1 . Take 1 Kilo of steel from anything made in China . You have to make sure that it is made in China , because all the impurities act as catalyst to expedite the reaction .2 . Take some of the uranium rub in a piece of cotton and rub it gently all over the iron piece .3 . Bury the piece under soil for 35 years . And voila , your iron has turned into gold , just in time for the next recession when Gold prices will be sky-rocketing . Have fun!P.S . Make sure that you burn the cotton piece away , or else it might come alive !
 I got this for the kids and they have a great time throwing it at each other and the pets . They put it in the pool and now I have to deal with some angry things from the center of the earth . Oh well the kids did have fun .
 I can personally account for this product . Works great on armor piercing wrist darts if properly depleted . However , not everyone will like this product . Hugo Drax and his henchman Chang found the product well let 's just say ... -LRB- raises Martini glass -RRB- un-satis-factory . This stuff is highly recommended ! Fast Shipping ! A + + + + + + +
 I have recently purchased several cases of Uranium Ore from Amazon and plan to use them on your major cities and population centers if my demands are not met . My first demand is to have the sum of one trillion US dollars sent to me immediately . I also order a total of 10,000 tanks and armoured vehicles , 1,000 attack and transport helicopters , 1,000 bomber aircraft , and another 1,000 fighter aircraft . My commands are irrefutable and no less wil be excepted . Any efforts on your part to stop me will be futile as your forces will quickly be put down by my zombie guards . That 's right I have zombies in my ranks and I am quickly building an army of them . All of your puny armed forces will tremble under the wrath of my zombie army of darkness . If you respond and abide with these commands in a quick and speedy manner with no resistance I may leave you Australia free of my wrath as the rest of the planet will be taken over by my massive zombie army.You have been warned .
 I want sank you much for zis high quality uranium ore . I order 2700 cans of zis , and you even send me bonus extra can ! This very much help me wis build nuclear wessle . Before I find your site , I was hev to buy from black market which sell ore from old abandon Soviet missiles . Very poor quality ! Now I and comrades build nuclear wessle much more powerful and prepare for big invasion of capitalist pigs . We will show zem what is Mozerland ! Zey will see zat true communism never defeated ! Sank you ! Sank you!By ze vay , I very much love American movie , `` Red Dawn . '' Zis is such accurate portrayal of Russia !
 I used to have terrible flatulence . One time we were visiting my wife 's parents , and I risked a three but delivered a nine . I 'll never forget the look on my wife 's face , as an eggy smog engulfed her loved ones in a bubbling foam of concentrated misery . For a while no-one said anything . We just sat there in total disbelieving silence , as the cooling gasses began to condense on our wine glasses , and twinkled in the candlelight ; a tableau vivant of burnt hair and melting wool.But then I discovered Uranium Ore , and all my gastric nightmares were solved . Now , whenever I need to let one go , I do n't have to worry about a thing . I simply distend the old dinner snipper , and clap like a stadium full of trained seals begging for fish heads -- instantly destroying all life within a 15,000 mile radius . No embarrassing smells , no fuss , just one massively disproportionate final solution to all socially awkward situations.I used to spend a fortune on assassins and trousers , just so I could leave the house during the day . But now I can go to the movies , go skydiving , ride the tube at rush hour , and blot out the sun whenever I feel the need to save face , and avoid expensive laundry bills . It 's so convenient and easy to use , even a brainwashed child could do it any moment now!So do n't hesitate . Buy with confidence ! And the next time you need to squeeze cheese say hello to Uranium Ore , and goodbye to everyone you know !
 Not recommended for use as a suppository unless in a more then a severe need of a bowel movement.No one warned me .
 Not only do all 4 of us college students living here love this stuff -LRB- it goes great on pizza , and keeps it piping hot for hours ! -RRB- , our cats have taken a liking to using it as a face-scratcher , and it 's done wonders for their coats . Far less dander now , and their glow-in-the-dark tags are even visible during the day!As an added bonus , once you 've depleted the entire jar , you can upgrade your spudgun to use depleted uranium rounds ! Using high-pressure steel parts instead of PVC is highly recommended if you do this , but the increased range and damage is worth it .
 I use this for stuff for everything . Dirty floors ? Just mix 1 part to 10 parts tap water . It 's guaranteed to get out the toughest stain . Aching joints ? Just mix 1/2 oz of this stuff with some baking soda and rub away ! I even added a dab to my gasoline and it has increased my 1987 Honda Accord LX 's gas mileage from 22 MPG in a city/highway mix to 5,205 MPG . I filled up on March 3 , 2007 and only had to fill up again yesterday night.One point of possible concern is that this stuff can be addictive . I caught my teenage son smoking some of it one day . To teach him a lesson , I bought 5 more of these from Amazon and made him smoke all 5 of them . I could tell he learned his lesson and he was sick of this stuff as he face turned green ... which it is still today .

 I 've always wanted my own uranium ore , but it 's always been so expensive . When I heard word that Kim Jong Il , had passed of a heart attack , I jumped on Amazon right away to order a bunch , knowing that North Korea would not need it any more and flood the market likely driving the price down so I bought 3 ! Thank you great leader , Christmas come early this year !
 My wife and I hope to try for a baby in the future but we have opted to wait until we were more financially stableSince my wife is allergic to latex and oral contraceptives a friend of ours reccomended this product as a no fuss alternative . Our first experience with it was daunting but let me tell you it is by far the best no nonsense unintrusive contraceptive ever.Just one thorough application lasts weeks.I even carry a little in my wallet for added security when enjoying those spontaneous romantic moments!Postage was very fast via private courier , no fuss nor hassle.Highly reccomended!Simply a must!And just a side note , what with the shocking rise in underage pregnancies i believe this product with its 100 % success rate should be given out in schools . Just my 2c .
 Wow ! This stuff works wonders!I was contemplating getting a vasectomy and decided to try this first.I just spread it liberally around my scrotum with gentle massage daily and now I 'm sterile.Just a slight burning sensation . But , it 's way cheaper than getting an operation.My wife thinks the afterglow is cute !
 Highly recommended ! I bought mine in a dark corner near the Walmart parking lot in Los Alamos and I 'm really satisfied with the product .
 My office mate bought the uranium ore as a white elephant gift at our office 's holiday party this year . At first I had no idea what to do with it . Perfect white elephant , right ? But then I realized that since it was just always so warm , I could use my steel grinder at home to shave off a bunch of dust , put it into one of those cloth bags my wife uses for potpourri and I 'd have an instant hand warmer for snowboarding ! I 've been using them all winter and started selling a few on e-bay . Well worth the investment .
 I was skeptical , but after reading so much about Uranium in CosmoGirl and Seventeen , I decided to give it a shot . Thank goodness I did!Give it a try ! My skin has never looked better !!! Now if I can find something that actually works for hairloss , I 'll be set !
 Mixed a bit in with the wife 's Olay products facial creme.Her complexion is more radiant than ever !!
 I ordered a bunch of cans of this , and still could n't get my time machine to work . I ca n't wait to get back to 1985 and my hot girlfriend . Meanwhile , I 'm stuck working at the Cafe 80s , dammit .
 I 've always wanted to be an IFBB Pro Bodybuilder , but I never had the means to do it . Steroids are hard to find for a college student with little means . As I was walking to the bus stop from class , I saw some Libyans in the parking lot . I can never resist their deals at the swamp meet , so I decided to check out what they were selling . Lo and behold , they had this wonderful yellow cake . I asked them what it could do , and they told me I would gain muscle mass like you would n't believe . They also muttered something about tumors , but I 'm sure they were joking . Those crazy Libyans.Eager to use the stuff , I opened it up before getting on the bus . I noticed the effects right away . A vein in my hand burst open , but that means it 's working . By the time I came to my stop , I could n't fit through the door without turning sideways . My lat spread was incredible . I 've already contacted the IFBB officials that they need to reinforce the stage for the Mr. Olympia contest . I 'm coming for you Jay Cutler.By the way , the yellow eyes are a neat little feature .
 This sure beats buying illegally . It 's great to be able to easily and legally obtain this stuff , especially when I need to reach 1.21 Gw of power . I definitely recommend . Two thumbs way up for this seller !
 Great Scott , I 've done it ! I 've finally done it ! I very desperately needed this to get back to 1985 . I had attempted to use a bolt of lightning instead , but a local police officer interrupted my `` weather experiment '' by demanding that I show him a permit . When I did n't have one , I just had to find another way . I knew of nowhere else to turn , but to my good friends at Amazon . Lo and behold , they had JUST what I needed ! I dumped this baby into the fuel tank of my DeLorean and once I reached 88 mph , the Flux Capacitor finally fired back up and brought me home . Thanks , Amazon ! You 've saved my life !
 It was only after the kids started glowing in the dark that we wondered whether we had eaten the wrong kind of yellow cake .
 Keeps your brights bright and gets your whites whiter . Best laundry product I 've ever used . Just a pinch thrown in with the detergent gets out the stubbornest of stains and leaves the whole place smelling fresh as a summer day . Also works to polish silver and remove pet smells from furniture . Sprinkle some in the cat box to eliminate the unpleasant odor . Though I have n't tried it myself , my sister says mixing it with peroxide makes it a wonderful toothpaste . I would n't recommend it for use around infants , however , or children under 3 . You should also discuss the purchase with your spouse just in case . When I showed my uranium ore to my husband , he went a little nuclear.All in all , I would definitely recommend this product to my friends . Since adding it to my household routine , I feel like I 'm positively glowing .
 I recently bought this product because I read in an online article that it can help with male enhancement . I grew at least three inches overnight !!! Although , the only setback is that I now have pustules growing out of my eyeballs making it very difficult to see . All in all
 Well I buy this expecting to destroy the American imperialists but it is not enough and the damn Chinese wo n't help either .
 I am a professional cellist , and I teach at several colleges , so when I found out about this product I was understandably excited . I pass this information along to my fellow string players who may be looking for a way to get a warmer , more glowing tone in their playing . I mixed some of this product with some rosin in a saucepan on the stove , and so far it 's provided that extra something I 've been looking for , with no side effects so far.I have subtracted one star because the uranium has been unable to improve my intonation in the slightest , and I would expect a product of this sort to be more helpful in this regard .
 This product really saved me from ever having to fly in a plane again . All those bag checks , and security scans were such a hassle I much prefer driving . Buying this in bulk has really saved me the all the time consumed by air travel . I can spend my spare time in my basement working , just me and my Uranium , and it 's totally awesome . The low odor is great because now my mom does n't even come to check on me . This is a great product , and I ca n't wait for everyone to have as much fun with it as I plan on having , and trust me you will soon .
 I brought this for my Korean schoolmate as a birthday present . He told me that he loved it and it 's fantastic !
 Sadly this yellowcake has gone very stale . It was last seen in the State of the Union address by our president where he said Iraq bought Uranium Ore from Niger and used that as a platform to go to war . Our president lied in the state of the union address ... wow . If only he had known that the yellowcake uranium is for sale on Amazon , not in Niger .
 The Bush administration , with help from Congress , AIPAC , and an ersatz Fourth Estate , has accomplished its mission to freedom-nudge both Afghanistan and Iraq back to the stone age , denying the bad guys the infrastructure and electricity needed to access the internets , with the intention of purchasing large quantities of uranium and bonus free shipping and the added convenience of `` one-click '' check-out that only a quality outfit like Amazon can offer .
 I 'll buy it ; however , I 'll have you ship it to Alaska in care of S. Palin .
 You know those aligators that live in the sewers ... They used to be Geico lizards ... On the bright side , there are less rats and homeless people living in the sewers .
 Thank you Amazon ! I sent a note to Doc via FedEx and told him to hold off with the Russians . Just set wait until 12/9/07 and he can get it from Amazon.You saved his life !!! Now I can go camping with my girl
 This will do wonders for my efforts reloading 30mm anti-tank ammunition.Also , description does not mention that it ships `` wrapped in a special CIA napkin '' .
 Thanks to this wonderful product I am one step closer to my life long dream of obtaining super powers . -LRB- Would shoot for incredible hulkdom if only I could only find a convenient way to bombard myself with gamma rays without having to take a bunch of physics courses -RRB-
 I bought this quality plutonium and between you and me , something amazing happened and now I can talk to animals ! It 's pretty cool and totally secret , and you know what ? Life will never be the same .
 I know some of you are making snide remarks about this product and joking around about `` three-handed kids '' and dog food glowing in the dark , but this is serious stuff.We purchased the Uranium Ore to improve upon our custom fashion watches by making the hands glow in the dark . Unfortunately , my dad - who is SUPPOSED to have a degree in Engineering and Physics confused Uranium with Radium . We need Radium ore to make the hands of the watch glow in the dark at night and not Uranium . Uranium ore is useless for this task , regardless of the jokes you see here about `` dogs glowing in the dark '' and nonsense like that.I do n't want to come across as critical , but there are some of us who do not take these reviews lightly and it would have saved us a lot of money if the reviews here did n't misleadingly cause my dad to think that Uranium ore would make the hands of the watch glow in the dark.That said , does anyone know where we can get some radium ore ? Thanks!P.S . I have found a great resource that goes well with this product.Uranium Resource ProcessingThis book has helped us figure out what to do with the several dozen crates of this stuff that we have in the basement right now .
 My boots have a nice scent even though the calcium in my feet has decreased about 80 % after wearing them for a couple of weeks . Amazingly , the smell is comparable to sweet pineapple or a fresh banana smoothie . Definitely recommend this product to anyone with foot fungus.Caution
 I `` ll also take a fresh whole rabbit , 4500 ladybugs and a bottle of Tuscan Whole milk .
 So I recently bought an old 1980 's era delorian from this old mad-scientist type looking guy . I get the car home and what do you know it does n't take regular unleaded fuel anymore . I called the guy up and complained that he sold me a car I could n't driv and he said try searching Amazon for `` special fuels '' . Well after a long seach I found this and thought what the heck , I will give it a try . After finally getting the shipment I pour the stuff in and the car powers up . Strange thing about it is that it must have the oldest looking prototype iPod I have ever seen , b/c I turn the car on and this triangle looking thingy lights up in the back . Been driving it too and from work for a week now , but have only gotten it up to about 85-86mph on the highway . After I replace the tires I might really try pushing the throttle to see if I can get it up past 90mph . If all goes well , I will update the review .
 For years I 've sworn by my Smith 's Rosebud Salve - not only for chapped lips , but its other suggested uses as well
 My girlfriend and I really like this stuff . We have replaced our soap with it , in point of fact . You dont need much with your shower . Just rub in all over , and it literally strips everything off of you . The only downside , is a loofa doesnt come with the package . Anyways , when we get out of the shower , our skin feels like it is literally glowing . We highly recommend this product . Just remember ... a loofa isnt included .
 I used this stuff to give me the required 1.21 jiggawatts needed for my Delorean to travel back to the future from 1955 . Worked great ! I did n't even have to kiss my own teenage mother to get back ! Highly recommend . This stuff is heavy .
 I was looking on-line for something to make myself more boring . Since I was tired , I mis-read the name and thought this was Uranium Bore . After crushing up the rock and putting it in my daily milkshake an awful thing happened - my arms withered and fell off ! Just when I was about to call Amazon and complain I realized I could n't because I had not become adept at pushing buttons with my toes . So with the help of my cat , I started looking through Amazon for robotic arms . Then my cat suddenly freaked out and took off running . I knew something was up , and a second later tentacle arms burst out of my forehead!So now I 'm back to square one . I can type again , but I am way less boring than before . Moral of the story ? Read labels more carefully ! I give this 5 stars because my new head-arms allow me to change lightbulbs without the need for a ladder !
 Finally found a perfect way to kill those pesky `` stink bugs . '' I dusted some of this around the perimeter of my house , as well as in my kids bedrooms , the kitchen and the bathroom ... and it 's amazing . They 're all dead . Every last stink bug is dead . My wife has begun to sprout a 3rd eye , and the kids are speaking in tongues , and as for me , everytime I walk past the front door I have flashbacks to the 60 's , and wake up in the driveway without pants on . But at least the darn `` stink bugs '' are dead .
 I bought this to use for making unique jewelry for my girlfriend . I knew that if she was wearing this I could track her live via the interweb 's many radioactive tracking sites . Anyway , before I could use it I nodded off at my workbench and the whole jar accidentally spilled down my shirt . At first I was n't too worried . I cleaned up what I could and put it back into the jar.Curiously , my friends now tell me I turn slightly green when I get angry and I get a bit swollen too . The effects seem to be getting worse . Any ideas what might have happened ?
 From reading the other reviews about gaining super powers and running high profile world domination weaponry I thought I 'd try a can to enhance my own powers.All I can offer is one bit of advice . Do not put down your pants !
 Tired of that annoying neighbor that offed your dog with an antifreeze weinie last summer ? Try this practical joke of the century!Pop four or five of these little cans under the driver side seat in their car . Who looks under their car seat ? Nobody ! That 's who . Those little babies can lurk under there for years , slowing emitting their low level radiation . That annoying neighbor can be pooping in a bag in NO TIME!If that does n't work you can always resort to the previously mentioned special ` Halloween -LRB- it packs a wallop -RRB- Punch ' !
 After slaving away for a couple of decades as a lowly secretary in a hospital , I discovered this product . I have worked with radiation therapists for years and always thought , `` Why could n't I do that ? There 's good money in treating cancer ! '' And now , thanks to this fine product , I can rake in the big bucks!First , I made my own `` radiation machine '' out of cardboard , painting it silver and gray with spray paint from the local hardware store . The only other necessary purchases were a white lab coat , diabolical goggles , and a cheap-ass fold up plastic lounge chair . Plus this fine product . One $ 39.95 can will treat at least 100 patients!I put the dupe ... er , patient in the lawn chair , dump the uranium into the `` machine , '' and leave the house for an hour . If the patients survive , they are guaranteed cancer free ! Well , except for the ones who get cancer from the treatment . But that 's ok , because then I can charge them a couple grand for another treatment to cure the new cancer!Of course , I have had to move 10 times to stay one step ahead of the authorities and the grieving families , but it 's worth it ! I am now filthy rich!Signed , `` Dr. Quincy `` Location
 In preperation for the upcoming zombie apocalypse I bought this Uranium to give a little extra `` umph '' to the Miracle Grow that I usually spray on my garden . Being able to garden in the middle of the night was an unexpected benefit of this miracle product . The vegetables started to glow beautifully which made them easier to pick , however some of the little buggers do try to bite me while I 'm working . I told my neighbor that he was welcome to anything in my garden not realizing how territorial the tomatoes had become . They did n't recognize him and he lost an arm . Fortunately he gained a tentacle in its place so it 's all good .
 It tastes so good . I put it on my fries and it was great . I put it on my cat 's food and now it has 18 half lives .
 This saved me a TON of money ! My grandma had this huge tumor on the right side of her head . The doctors wanted an insane amount of money to treat it . I bought some of this stuff , made it into a paste with a little water , and rubbed it into the tumor area for a few months . The thing withered and fell off ! Fantastic . I only used about half of the tin , too , goes a long way . I gave the rest to neighborhood kids that came by for trick-or-treat . Forget your oncologist ... pick up some of this and you should be good to go .
 After losing hundreds of pounds through carefully applied radioactivity sickness I was able to slough off the excess skin through a more thorough application.This stuff could remove the wrinkles from Helen Thomas and make her skin as smooth and shiny as the Creature from the Black Lagoon , a definite improvement!I highly recomment it !
 Magnificent product and service ! I am 92 years young and still have an acquired taste for Prince Albert in a can . My eye sight has been failing me miserably for 20 years , and I do n't have much longer to live as the doctors tell me that my whole body has become malignant . I first found out when I went to my physician last week because my skin was turning a greenish-yellow tint . Forgive my banter , but if you enjoy canned tobacco as much as I , these fellas make the best .
 I used to spend hours canning food to preserve it for the upcoming global winter . Labor no more . I 've found this wonderful uranium here on Amazon and can now enjoy fast and easy food preservation all with the convenience of mail order delivery . Thanks Amazon ! Rather than go to the trouble of my old method , preparing the food , sterilizing and packing the cans , using the dangerous pressure cooker , I can now just sprinkle some uranium on my food and it never goes bad ! Quick , easy and oh so tasty . As a bonus , since we started eating our preserved stores of food our electric bill has gone down . No longer do we need to waste valuable space on a refrigerator , and we do n't even need to use lights at night since we have a beautiful glow filling the house all the time . Yes , it has a bit of a greenish tinge , but hey , it 's free ! What more can we ask ?
 Ok to start with this product is exactly as advertised . It was well packaged and shipped to me in a timely manner , and a great deal for the price as well . My only complaint about this product though is that I found out I am now on several international watch lists , and I would not recommend trying to cross any international boarders with this product in your possession.Now as for the uranium its self , I was using it for at at home science experiment I had seen on the internet in which you use the uranium , along with several car batteries , solar panels , water tank , steam collection tank , fans and presto , you have an at home nuclear reactor to power your entire house and live fully off the grid ! I followed the instructions to a T and found that when I first powered on my at home reactor all was well . I had created my project in a tool shed at the back of my property as had been recommended in the instructions to keep separate from the home . With the system up and running I left it to work and went inside my home to enjoy my new free energy home . All was going well for several days until the living dead began to wake from the adjacent cemetery at the back of my property . Apparently the latent radiation from the uranium , and the by products from my home fusion reactor -LRB- which I was draining into the cemetery -RRB- can have the side effect of causing the dead to rise . No worries though , it was n't like in the movies , they were very decomposed and slow , and with only a few quick blows from a shovel then were put down . I have since moved the waste flow from just open to drain into the cemetery and have linked it in with the city sewage system with my house and have had no more problems with the living dead . I really do with that the product had come with a warning up front though , my neighbor seemed quite disturbed about the whole incident.Anyways , great product , be beware , under the right circumstanced it may cause the dead to walk .
 shipping may take some time but while i was waiting for my ore to arrive i told my neighbor that he should pay my electric bill or else i will begin R&D ; when my yellow cake arrives . i also launched a rocket my child made in science class over my neighbors home just to let him know i was serious . once the ore arrived , i began negotiations.things seem like they are going very well .
 Well ... I had an awesome idea that if I combined my newly purchased uranium ore and a container of Marshmallow Fluff , the outcome would result in a smaller version of the Stay-Puff Marshmallow Man . However ... what soon followed my unfortunate science/cooking experiment was the creation of something that resembled a 10 foot tall adaptation of the Michelin Man meets Chuck Norris ! Immediately upon its creation I received unprovoked roundhouse kick to my face ... fortunately , his marshmallow-pillowy-like foot softened the impending blow . We battled through the kitchen , then it saw the open door . As soon as this sticky-sweet creature made it outside ... it escaped . So I guess this `` review '' is more of a public-service announcement ... I probably should 've said that first .
 PROS
 Excellent , Amazon . Excellent ! With this supply of atomic material I can complete the construction of ... The OMEGA RAY ! Once I wield this weapon of ultimate destruction I , and I alone , shall be supreme ruler of the oceans ! Not even that meddling do-gooder Aquaman will be able to stop me this time.Again and again he and his little pal Aqualad have thwarted my plans , subjecting me to countless humiliations , but my time is at hand . In this battle my victory is assured , for no force on Earth can withstand the might of my uranium-powered OMEGA RAY!The fires of my hatred boil the very oceans around me ! My thirst for vengeance can not be slaked by all the water in the seven seas ! Only the blood and tears of Aquaman will do ! I shall crush him with my Omega Ray as easily as I crush plankton beneath my heel!Yet I shall not grant Aquaman the mercy of a swift death . Oh no , he shall watch as I annihilate his beloved Atlantis and grind his civilization into sand ! The dust of his kindgom shall be scattered throughout the ocean floor for all eternity!His friends will die shrieking , the seas will turn crimson with the blood of the innocent , and the songs of the whales will fill the oceans with cries of torment ! And once the waters grow silent , and the blood clouds dissipate , Aquaman shall see me sitting atop an island of skulls that grows from the deepest trench of the ocean floor , and he will know that this fate came to pass because he dared to defy me!SOON , AQUAMAN ! SOON YOU SHALL BEG FOR THE SWEET RELEASE OF DEATH ! BWAH HA HA HA HAAAAAAA !!!!!!
 I bought this product about 3 month ago and I could ' t be more satisfied . But since I stored it in my basement radroaches are appering all around my house and I 'm afraid of going into my basement since then.Could anyone come and exterminate these radroaches ? 300 bottlecaps reward !!!!!!!!!!! please response quickly !!!!
 I told my doctor it was totaly worth it . He called my later and agreed .
 This stuff sounds great . I will be sending some as a gift to the guy who lets known child molesters frequent his so-called `` family friendly '' website -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- -RRB- . Perhaps he 'll gulp it down , glow brightly , and see himself as the hypocrite he is .
 This tin of URANIUM ORE can be used for any number of interesting scientific and educational uses . However , the educational and scientific use that springs immediately to my mind is -- to SCIENTIFICALLY EDUCATE Ms. Sarah Paylin , -LRB- or anyone else who would steal our constitutional liberties from us -RRB- , should she -LRB- or ANYONE else -RRB- , ever be elected to the Presidency of the United States of America , by our fellow very well-meaning , but badly-led-astray , citizenry -- who will discover , with a shock , that the new President , -LRB- whoever he or she is -RRB- , is bent on taking away our Constitutionally-guaranteed liberties , in a way that even George III would never have dreampt!To me , Ms. Paylin -LRB- `` Payline '' ? -RRB- , especially , -LRB- but not -- shudder -- exclusively ! -RRB- -- represents a clear and present danger , even today . However , I would not seriously imperil her life , safety , -LRB- or Freedom -RRB- , unless she were to gain the Presidency , and thus be in a position to imperil my own life , safety , -LRB- and Freedom ! -RRB- Of course , I may be VERY , VERY wrong about this . -LRB- How I hope I am ! -RRB- Ms. Paylin may be as harmless as any other empty-headed politico . -LRB- I sincerely , fervently , positively and absolutely hope so ! -RRB- But my `` sixth sense '' , -LRB- the psychic one -- quite active in people born under the sign of Peices , such as myself -RRB- warns me that this just may not be so . Ms. Paylin -- underneath her somewhat charming , somewhat intelligent , sometimes confused exterior -- seems to me a person as hard as nails . With her , -LRB- or so my inner sense warns me -RRB- , it is `` My Way Or The Highway '' . With Ms. Paylin , you must agree with her -- or else . A book by Charles R. Allen Jr. , published in 1966 , -LRB- I will not mention its title here , to protect the more innocent amongst my readers -RRB- , describes those places which are , to America 's great and everlasting shame , STILL dotting the American landscape TODAY ! Should Ms. Paylin ever become President , my `` sixth sense little voice '' tells me these places will be filled to overflowing , with those who commit `` politically-incorrect crimes '' -- even , probably , to the liking of Ms. Paylin 's least favourite colour , -LRB- whatever colour that may be . -RRB- However ... this product -- a small tin of Uranium Ore -- does give me hope . It is sad indeed to think of it ever coming to this -- but , it may become the `` underground 's '' weapon of choice , -LRB- or at least , WARNING of choice -RRB- , should Ms. Paylin 1 -RRB- Become President , and 2 -RRB- Unfold , in her presidency , the stuff of my worst nightmares , -LRB- whioh I still admit may NOT occur . Oh , how I HOPE they do not ! -RRB- Should my nightmares come true , however , I am sure that one of Madam President 's first acts will be to BAN ALL PRIVATELY-OWNED GUNS AND FIRE-ARMS . -LRB- This has already happened in England -- according to a VERY scary film produceed by the NRA . In it , even fire-arms and guns which are no more than beautiful museum pieces -- if held in private hands -- were destroyed ! -RRB- Weaponless , the `` average '' citizen will now be totally helpless , without even gun-owning neighbours to protect him or her ! HOWEVER , -LRB- heh , heh , heh ! -RRB- URANIUM ORE IS NOT A GUN OR A FIREARM , in the usual sense of the word . Should enough of us buy this product -- and SAFELY store it -- this Uranium Ore can be used in times of emergency ... if only as a threat . This IS a necessary precaution -- one must have this product , in case it is needed , however -- during ANY event which may take our cherished freedoms from us , -LRB- which may or may not include a Sarah Paylin Presidency . -RRB- Why ? Through my mind as I write this , is the scene in the original `` Planet of the Apes '' movie , wherein Charleton Heston , -LRB- as `` Taylor '' -RRB- , is told
 Hey , Kids !!! Get your very own core sample , as seen in the opening credits of ` The Simpsons ' !!! Mmmm ... Uranium.The infomercial features none other than Billy Mays , continual winner of the `` World 's Most Obnoxious TV Pitchman '' award for over a decade now . Hopefully Billy will have a ` mishap ' during the taping and drop the sample down his pants .
 Way more pleasing flavor than Nutella , and the texture is to die for . Really .
 Does anyone know his address ? I gots to tell him that those WMDs he was searching for over in Iraq was right here on Amazon.com all along !
 I purchased this item and despite it only being 1/2 full -LRB- must have been on the shelf for a few billion years ? -RRB- it was exactly as expected.Unfortunately about a day after I purchased it Colin Powell showed up at my door with grainy pictures of a top view of my city and asked where the van was that was parked a few miles down the road.Oh well , I do n't really need to travel by air anyway.I am not entirely positive how to use this stuff.It was kinda gooey and not at all like I expected . I use to use Gold Bond powder but this was recommended by a friend instead , he said it would make me `` bigger '' , it 's been a few weeks and nothings gotten bigger but for some reason I do n't need the night light anymore.I do enjoy the tingly sensation though.Recommended !
 It couldnt possibly be from Myanus , there isnt a way to rectumfy extracting it . Last extraction was followed up with swift plunging .
 I 'm glad I stumbled across this product on amazon , It 's fantastic ! I have diagnosed twitch-eye syndrome and am prescribed medical marijuana , so Im blazin all day . When I saw this Uranium , I thought to myself `` I bet this will take my high to a whole other level ! '' , and it did.When I first added the ore to my daily smoking regiment , I imediately noticed that not only did my eye stop twitching completely , but I was begining to see through soft objects -LRB- couch pillows , towels , shirts , etc. -RRB- After a while , I could even see without opening my eyes at all ! The only draw back was that it tasted like coconuts , and I hate coconuts.Now I am 22 , living by myself , and I have X-ray vision . Hopefully next year I will recieve a letter from hogwarts to supply me with an opportunity to use my powers for good and save the wizard world from Voldemort . Thanks !
 Actually , this product works fine for killing ants , but you have to buy two of them , then use as follows
 Love the product ! When we first began our project , we were hoping to find a way to make a clean and green reactor fuel for our anti-gravity flying saucer which we have unofficially nicknamed `` Do n't Mess With Hess ; '' patent pending . We had two problems . The first was this container was too small and although we had tried to enhance it with crazy glue and other household elements , it did n't provide enough umph for Hess to hover over a news stand . Once we had secured larger deliveries from this manufacturer and from other known traffickers in Florida , the problem then became what to do with the residual depleted uranium -LRB- 234 and 235 -RRB- after 238 was fired . We produced a lot of it ; for every one hundred pounds of solid/natural uranium I have , 99.2 pounds to begin with is uranium 238 and the other .8 is uranium 234/235 . Try taking a few spins around the neighborhood and you 'll find , as we have , there is only so many 5 lb coffee cans you can slip into the recycling bin without someone somewhere asking questions . So this is our current ongoing problem . Anyone with suggestions , please comment . Thanks.For more information about depleted uranium and what to do with it . . | -LSB- ... -RSB-
 I shaved some of this into a EPA water sample , now they 've declared the whole neighborhood a Superfund site ! Hello Government buyout ! We 're moving to Mississippi !!!
 My tomatoes and cucumbers have never had better yields ! Best of all , its organic !! I mix a little with the compost every month and amend my garden every 2 months.Funny , though , the deer and opossums have stopped browsing through the garden . I think the 4 foot tall Praying Mantis , and 18 inch wide garden spiders have done their job.Now if I could only get the kids to STOP saddling the tomato horn worms and convice them their NOT beneficial insects.Love this stuff !!
 I never write reviews but I felt compelled to share my experience with everyone . I used to be extremely self conscience about my acne and weight . I have literally tried everything but nothing ever worked . My friend told me about uranium and she was right , I have been drinking it in small doses over the last month and even though i can no longer see , people tell me I look sick ! What up ???? . I have also lost a total of 200 pounds ! Thanks Uranium !!!
 I started using this as a spice a few months ago for many of the foods that I cook for my family . Aside from the terrible taste of my food and the larger number of casualties in my family , I highly recommend this product to anyone who shares a little problem with me . You see , the lights are always going out at night in my house and I always have to pee at night . My wife would always complain about the urine all over the place in the morning . Now , my pee glows in the dark ! Say good-bye to wet-sticky toilet seats in dark bathrooms America ! A much higher percentage of my urine enters the toilet now .
 Normally I avoid the ` used ' versions of products , after all , who wants a scratched Paris Hilton CD or a less than pristine jock strap ? This time , however , I made an exception and was pleased with the result.I wo n't detail the precise reason for my purchase , suffice to say that Show-and-Tell at my son 's school was not the overwhelming success we expected when ordering.Despite this setback , I acquired a bargain by paying $ 10 for second-hand ore that was originally purchased last March for $ 30 . Crazy , huh ? Paying a third of the full retail price for a product that will continue to glow and give pleasure for several millennia.I feel sure that my radioactive purchase will become a much-loved Muffin family heirloom , handed on to future generations of malformed descendants who will dribble and squawk at its deadly , blue aura .
 With this and some wire , this was perfect for creating an EMP to halt the Russian invasion . Really cheap as well .
 I bought this recently and stupidly threw it in the ocean . Now there 's a giant , prehistoric dinosaur-looking creature coming towards my hometown , a nondescript Japanese city . Beware !
 Silly reviews aside , Uranium Ore is perfectly legal and safe to own . Though Uranium is moderately toxic , those concerned with this can keep it safely in a sealed plastic baggy and wash hands after handling it . Despite the warning label , the radioactivity levels of uranium ore are quite safe for ordinary exposure and can be easily stopped by a hot-box -LRB- an aluminum , lead and/or graphite container -RRB- . This product is extremely useful for training , scientific experiments and collectors of rare elements . Highly recommended for these purposes , and much cheaper than pure Uranium-238 / depleted uranium .
 As an aspiring Megalomaniac I find that it 's hard to get started . With the credit crunch getting a loan to buy that secret base is almost impossible and a booming job market makes it hard to hire those legions of faceless goons so you 've got to save every penny where you can . Getting uranium off Amazon is lot easier then spending hundreds of thousands trying to smuggle it out of Russia and it does n't risk it being intercepted by pesky border guards in Europe . My plans for world domination are proceeding as I have foreseen ! Muhhhaa Muhhhhaa.Now if Amazon would only carry orbital lasers and sexy female spies I 'd be set !
 This is the best strawberry jam I 've ever tasted . It works well with toast AND English muffins .
 I had recently purchased a used car from my friend Dr. Emmitt Brown , and was told I needed to purchase nuclear material to enjoy the full benefits of the car . I saw this item on Amazon and thought I was in luck . Unfortunately , the use of uranium in my Delorean had some unforseen consequences . As I entered a California freeway , I knew I had to speed up to 90 MPH , or I would be run off the road . As I approached this speed , many weird things started to happen , and long story short , I was somehow transported to the year 1996 . Knowing the past sports outcomes of the last decade , I went to Las Vegas and correctly predicted the winner of every World Series , Super Bowl , NBA Finals . Now , I am a billionaire and married to my childhood sweetheart , after I killed her husband . Thank you uranium ore , for making my dreams come true .
 For the past 4 years , I have been eagerly working on getting my inter-dimensional teleportation machine to work but whenever I powered it up , it causes my entire neighborhood to lose power for a few hours . Who the hell is in charge these power grids anyway?So I decided to try using Uranium Ore to power my device in hopes that this time it 'll finally work , so I placed the ore into my power module , flipped the switch and the machine was humming like an angelic choir . Just as I turned it on , a strange creature appeared on the teleportation pad . If ET , A Badger , and a Mermaid had a baby , that would be this creature , which I decided to name Neil.At first , it was communicating using a series of grunts , screams , and the occasional throwing of feces -LRB- one which hit my lab assistant and put him into a coma for a week -RRB- . During one Neil 's fits , his hoof/paw hit the remote for the TV in my lab , which turned on to the local spanish channels . Almost immediately , Neil started mimicking the Spanish Soap Opera and therefore has become more civilized.However , I still ca n't seem to get Neil to stop throwing his feces , but we are working on getting him to one day use the toilet like a big boy . My neighbors are also asking me why their cat is missing . Now I 'm only speculating here , but I suspect the orange fur rug by Neil 's kennel is the same animal the neighbors are looking for ; But what they do n't know ca n't hurt them.Overall , it 's great for powering my teleportation device , but be sure to get a pooper scooper when you buy it
 My family has been looking to cut down on our electric bill , so imagine how thrilled we were to find this product ! Upon opening the can in a dark room , we found ourselves bathed in a lovely blue glow . Left open , especially near a child 's bed , it proved to be a soothing , comforting presence.As a bonus , it killed off every single monster under the bed . It also rid our house of all pests except cockroaches .
 My wife 's legs are unusually hairy . So much so that if she goes a week without shaving , it looks like she 's wearing pants . Pants made out of hair.Since I heard that radiation leads to hair loss , I bought this for her to rub on her legs so she would n't have to shave all the time.It worked . The hair fell off her legs . Then her legs fell off . I think we used too much . So we 're going to dilute it with some Tuscan Whole Milk before trying it on her mustache and unibrow.Also can be used to stop shedding in pets , permanently . Though petting a hairless dog feels , well , obscene .
 I have been using this product to make bead necklaces for the neighborhood children . I started with just my kids , but when my kids ' friends saw that my kids had super-shiny teeth , glowy skin and abnormal growth spurts , they wanted in on the fun . I hope to extend my market to include all the suburbs in my state and then go nationwide.The goal of this endeavor , other than killer fashion sense , it global in scope.In a few years we may have WWIII on our hands if economic failures and world tensions continue . But how can any other country 's military compete with our army of giant , invincible mutant children ? Tanks and bombs will have nothing against a battalion of ten foot tall 13-yr-old girls who just got dumped by their very large , hairy boyfriends . Advancing troops would quake with fear when facing a platoon of toddlers who are two hours past their nap time and then denied candy.World domination will be ours !
 I packed some of these in my check-in luggage for my flight to New York . It was great to see the TSA agents busy doing something other than looking at nude passenger scans and groping preteen girls .
 I 've been looking for just the right `` Ca n't we all just get along '' peace offering gift to give to a complaining neighbor and Uranium Ore was the perfect pick !!! He was so appreciative of the gesture and told me a couple of weeks ago that he loves using it as a sweetener in his coffee every morning because of it 's unusual flavor :--RRB- I have n't heard a single complaint from him in days :--RRB- Come to think of it , I have n't seen him at all for a few days so he must be really happy ; - -RRB-
 Since buying this product from Amazon I am now invincible at croquet and can sing all of Andy Williams ' songs -LRB- since 1974 -RRB- at the same time . What 's more , I 'm able to change night into day with a small shake of my mandibles , and have just worked out how to make cheese on toast levitate . I would write more , but I 'm needed in the ionosphere .
 Fantastic , does exactly what it says on the tin . One star off because I ca n't drive faster than 87 MPH now .
 I accidentally breathed in some uranium dust as I was grinding the sample into powder to use to clean my Three Wolf Moon Short-Sleeved T-Shirt -LRB- makes it glow -RRB- . My arm I lost in Vietnam has grown back with an extra finger -LRB- index -RRB- , my ` that 's what she said ' jokes make women expose their breasts to me , and I now have an extra child . I can only assume that these wonderful occurrences are attributed to the uranium ore , since I stopped drinking 1 Gallon Tuscan whole milk a year ago for reasons I can not mention on the internet .
 My neighbor bought a new TV recently - Samsung PN58C7000 58-Inch 1080p 3D Plasma HDTV -LRB- Black -RRB- - and he 's been lording it over me ever since . Once I figure out how to weaponize this stuff we 'll see if he looks so smug .
 My husband ordered this along with the Digital Geiger Counter with Wand after our marriage counselor said that we should `` roleplay '' to help with our failing marriage.I was unsure of that , but I 'll have to admit , it 's exciting when he 's using the wand and it goes from `` beepbeepbeep '' to `` screeeeeech '' as he yells , `` I 'm givin ' her all she 's got , Captain ! If I push it any harder the whole thing will blow ! `` However , there 's a great deal of itching and nowhere on the tin does it say it 's not for internal use , plus I do n't know if I 'm supposed to remove it when we 're finished.Does anyone know?On the plus side , I 've had some hair loss ; I like that clean , smooth feeling , and so does my husband ! Our marriage is doing wonderfully thanks to these products . I 'd give five stars , but I think there needs to be some clear usage guidelines printed on the tin or included with the order .
 Finally , someone had the gumption to package this stuff ! As a busy single mom , I no longer have the time to prospect for uranium , let alone dig my own open pit mine . Also , handling that stuff makes my gums bleed and I cough up small pieces of lung . Nasty.Anyway , I have n't really been buying this to build my stash of high-density penetrators . I 've been buying a few hundred jars a week and keeping them in my bunker . One day , when all the world 's uranium mines are depleted , I 'm going to be a pretty important person . Perhaps even THE MOST important person in the world .
 With the holiday season coming up , many of us are wondering what to get the special people in our lives.For the man who has everything ... why not try cancer?One slather of this -LRB- hypo-allergenic -RRB- body cream will not only give him something he never expected to get , but he 'll also learn his lesson for being so uppity and having everything in the first place .
 I do n't know if I 'd trust this `` used '' ... You never know how much half-life is left ...
 A few days ago a friend said that this could be possible . Could this be the cure for Hemorrhoids ?? Anyone ?
 I am waiting for my full body hazmat protection suit to come in the mail . Afterwards I will order this unit . Great price !
 Anybody think the Iranian govt might be satisfied with this stuff if we sent them a bunch of it ? I 'd be willing to chip in a can worth for the sake of world peace .
 My goodness ! Unsure about what to do with the cute little tub of Uranium Ore I received , I tried using it as hair conditioner and face cream . And now in less than 7 days , I am blessed with a glowing complexion and tresses . I have never received more compliments in my life ! Just remember to use sparingly because a little dab will last the longest time ! 5 stars forever !
 Last week I had some of the ladies from church come to my house for afternoon tea . Whilst preparing the finger sandwiches I noticed that we had some of this Uranium ore in our pantry and so I decided to use it as the sandwich filling . The ladies liked the sandwiches so much that I did n't even get a chance to have one myself . I will defiantly be using this ore in future recipes . Sadly I doubt I 'll be using it for afternoon tea with the ladies , they tragically all passed away this weekend from some mystery illness they contracted . Oh well I can still make Uranium ore sandwiches for my husband Bruce 's lunch .
 The only issue I had was the power source . I wanted the processor to be small enough and powerful enough to run anything from a toaster to full anthropomorphic toaster . I 've been working on a cybernetic hand I 've been calling Mr. Grip-it and have been toying around with putting it on a custom made , fully functional , cybernetic statue I made of my favorite ex-action star , Jean Claud Van Damn but it just did n't seem to fit so I retro-fitted it to an older version I called Autonomous Radioactive Neural Overblown Lead Destroyer or A.R.N.O.L.D for short . I have a few friends who do n't think this was such a good idea but if I 've learned anything from TV and popular culture it 's that nothing bad can ever come from creating a new species of sentient robots , right @Mr . Anderson , @Bill Adama , @John Conner , @Dr . Dave Bowman and @Rick Deckard ?
 My girlfriend mixed this uranium ore in with her nail polish and now I can see her fingernails in the dark !
 Does buying this product lead to sanctions from the UN ... a Risk I am willing to take
 Bought this product several years ago , have n't gotten around to writing a review until now because I have been rather busy with killing aliens.Anyways , when I bought it it came in a great container , though you have to be careful - the container might be a little hot when you pull it out of the package . I originally bought this to replace some missing chemistry set components , but I discovered another use for it - power source . After reading some reviews stating that one can indeed use this item as a fuel source for a reactor -LRB- fusion or fission , how versatile ! -RRB- , I feel like I got a bold idea . You see , trying to power an entire house or `` weather project '' is a tad ambitious . I instead discovered THE perfect use for this item - albeit accidentally . In the course of my tinkerings , I found that I was constantly running the battery down in my power tools . This can be rather costly in addition to being annoying - how can one finish home improvement projects without power tools ? I added some heavy water and sculpted it into a square , then baked it in the oven for a few hours to get it to harden . When I pulled the block out , I was rather impressed with what I saw
 My friend John Titor stopped by recently , and I shared some of this with him . He said it was the best quality mail-order uranium ore he 'd seen since 2036 ...
 I was walking one day on the beach when , lo and behold , I was approached by a hungry crab . I felt sorry for the little guy , so instead of giving him a Kit-Kat bar and some Gatorade to drink , I gave him a little bit of this here Uranium Ore that I recently purchased from some shady seller at Amazon.com -LRB- price was soooo low , it was basically a steal ! -RRB- I figured `` this stuff looks harmless , right ? '' Oh boy , that was a big mistake ! -LRB- oops ! -RRB- Soon , the little rascal grew into a GIANT ENEMY CRAB !!! -LRB- omg ! -RRB- I was shocked and trembling in fear of this giant creature , calling for help would be useless as my frantic screaming would enrage this creature even more.However , I managed to gather up my courage and face this monster one-on-one . I grabbed the nearest blunt object I could use as a weapon and quickly ran towards the ginormous monster . My lightning-fast speed enabled me to climb up on its back and attack its weak point for massive damage . It was a success ! But all this could have been avoided if the makers had only put a label , warning users from feeding this stuff to crabs or any animal ! I learned my lesson and I hope that after reading this you have learned it as well .5 stars for satisfaction , but deducted 1 star for improper labeling . Get it right people !
 I had no idea how bad my hearing was until I tried this wonderful panacea Uranium ! Now I can hear all kinds of things I never heard before . Sometimes it 's just someone shouting my name but nobody 's there , but they might be in the next town shouting . Other times I hear the cows telling me of the simple joys of eating grass and killing all humans . This morning I heard the sun rise . It sounded like WAAAAAAAAUUUUUUGH !!!!!!!! and then * pop * there was the first bit of sun peeping over the horizon . Then tonight when the sun set I heard it sing me a chorus of `` So do n't forget folks , that 's what you get folks , for makin whoopee ! `` And then it said `` Do n't forget . Kill all humans ! ''
 This is a great product , because the days of packing the family in the station wagon , and heading out to Utah or Texas with heap leaching equipment and fully enclosed radiation suits are long gone . Whether its replenishing the home x-ray machine -LRB- got ta stay on top of osteoporosis ! -RRB- or making the kids some glow in the dark watches as Christmas gifts , this product saves loads of time and money . Plus the empty tin is handy for holding Altoids .
 Last week , my dear Aunt Kathy passed away . But , with the miracle of science , such a thing as the mortal coil is nothing more than a mere trifle to be overcome.It was in the middle of the night when I stole away to the graveyard and planted this product on Aunt Kathy 's grave . I was afraid the glow would alert others to my plan , but I made quick work of the glow with a few handfuls of dirt . I looked around sensing the eyes of the dead upon me , and my senses quickly became overcome with the scent of the fetid dirt covering my hands . I looked down at my handiwork and without hesitation left the foul place , confident that my plan would come to fruition.I had all but given up hope when I heard a knock on my door three days later . I opened the door and to my amazement , there was nothing but a hand on my front stoop . I picked it up , eying it to ascertain its origin when it quickly seized me . I tried to tear it off , its nails digging into my flesh . In my struggle , I fell to the ground and bumped up against something soft . A slow moan emanated from the lump , a second hand gently resting on my shoulder . I swung my head around looking at my unexpected guest , and saw it was none other than Aunt Kathy ! The hand , as if appeased , released its grasp and scuttled off under my prized vanity . I looked back into Kathy 's dead eyes , and while they did not see me she knew and was overjoyed I was there.Kathy has returned to us , and I know now what I did was for the best . Without this wondrous product , I would not be enjoying the company of dear Aunt Kathy as I write this . While her leg did fall off last week , I still love her now as I did in her life . There is one matter of interest , however . The neighbors have reported the sound of moans emanating from the cemetery where Aunt Kathy was buried . I look forward to the many happy family reunions that will no doubt occur in the near future .
 So I ordered this Uranium ore sample , in order to test my new geiger counter . Everything was going fine ... until lasers started shooting out of my eyes . This was a horrible thing for me to go through . I burned down my house , my car , and my little dog Fluffy ! Luckily , I had a pair of Ray Ban sunglasses that stopped my eyes from being beams of lasery death . I did n't know what to do ! Then I heard someone calling to me -LRB- IN my Mind ! -RRB- . They said they could keep me safe , and help me harness my new ability . I went to where the voice kept calling me . Much to my surprise , it was a bunch of other people just like me , who bought this ore sample . They called themselves mutants and the voice that was calling me was a man in a wheelchair called Professor X . He was one of the first customers of this product . I was going to rate this ore a one star , but with my new found powers and a bunch of really cool friends . This Mutant gave it five stars !
 Turns out I ordered this , but my Flux Capacitor required plutonium instead -LRB- someone should be held responsible for misleading signage -RRB- because that awesome cool symbol was on both of them . Talk about a catch-22 . At that moment , a wisecracking friend suggested if I could go back in time , I could fix my order .
 I used to search for Uranium ore in the caldera of the nearest active Volcano . This involved frequent trips to Hawaii . The cost of this , plus having to spend time in such an inhospitable environment -LRB- the volcano , not Hawaii -RRB- made it both cost-prohibitive and detrimental to my health - you have no idea the toll magma will take on your body , and the inhalation of fire and brimstone straight from the depths of Tartarus!Here comes the option of buying it packaged in a convenient can . Presumably there are little Heathen Chinee Children -LRB- HCC -RRB- down in the volcanoes around the world , supporting their families by providing us with a good method of powering our hoses via home-made cold fusion reactors . Truly , they are manna from heaven -LRB- the children , but to a degree the ore too -RRB- . Now I do n't have to get my own hands dirty , I do n't have to suffer the long flights to Hawaii and I earn points on my credit card for the purchase too!This is truly trickle-down economics at its best!I , by extension , employ lots of poor kids who can then support their families . Then with my glow-in-the-dark neighborhood , powered by my DIY reactor , we save money on power plant operators by outsourcing the job to backyard geniuses like me . Of course , if there 's a meltdown I 'll make sure that the neighbors call me and I 'll tell them where my garden hose is.Someone commented on where I dispose of the depleted uranium safely and quickly without incurring high cost , and after some research , I found that the neighbor pays extra to get a recycling bin put out every week , so I 've been using that . The benefit is that his driveway stays warm enough to not accumulate any snow in the winter , and he does n't need to turn on his decorative lights along the driveway either as it has a very nice luminescense to it now.Marie Curie would be proud - and probably would have ordered from this seller too . I do n't know why she did n't ?!
 I purchased some uranium last month with the intention of ridding my beloved cat Opee of fleas and the restraints of his mortality , but I 've been pleasantly surprised to find myself gaining powers of physical regeneration , clairvoyance and pyrokinesis -LRB- which I discovered from my first attempt to pet my aforementioned cat , who promptly and ironically melted . -RRB- I 've been long overdue for a genetic makeover , and despite my drastically accelerated evolution I can say I 've never felt more myself ! The ability to change my eye color at will has also been cool . We 'll see how my new powers come in handy when Homeland Security shows up in exactly 46 hours and 34 minutes .
 I had managed to find a Delorian in less than mint condition , but after several months tinkering in my garage I had it running . -LRB- This was difficult because I 'm an electrician , not a mechanic . Next I tackled the flux capacitor which was a little easier . Getting a sufficient quantity of platinum is not difficult , just expensive , so I had to put in a bunch of overtime at work . After about a year and a half I had everything put together . I was even able to jump backwards and forwards in time by a few seconds with a Honda generator strapped to the roof and a step up transformer , but not enough for any serious time travel . I started looking on the internet to see if I could discover any clues to any black markets that would sell uranium , but almost first thing in the google search was the link to Amazon . I could n't believe it . I bought a sufficient quantity and got it up and running about a week after it arrived . I have to say , Woodstock was not as great as they made it out to be . Janis Joplin is n't much for looking at . I have more trips planned for the future and I would love suggestions . Thank you Amazon for making my dream a reality !
 This is great for my backyard power plant . It gets kind of hot around here now , but in Seattle , this is a win-win .
 This is a decent deal , but if you 're looking to really please that lucky someone this holiday season , I 'd recommend upgrading to Amazon Prime to get uranium-235 -LRB- with free shipping ! -RRB- . Although it 's a bit pricier , it comes with more bonus alpha particles upon arrival and is sure to be a hit in its included glow-in-the-dark wrapping paper.I already put mine under the tree -LRB- which I need to replace soon ; most of the leaves seemed to have fallen off for some reason -RRB- , and it 's so cute to see the kids shaking the box next to their ears to try to guess what 's inside . Once little Jimmy gets back from the hospital and CDC testing facility , he 's going to have one happy Christmas morning !
 I recently purchased a 3-wolf moon tshirt from Amazon , and my expectations were exceeded . All the things other reviewers said were true - it 's a truly mystical shirt . However , despite all the wonderful things that were happening in my life because of wearing the shirt , I could n't stop thinking about how much better it would be if the wolves glowed in the dark . This thought haunted me for weeks - I missed work , I lost sleep , and when I did sleep I only had nightmares about the non-glowing wolves I had been donning for so long . I had tried before to add my own glow - I bought glow in the dark glue and applied it , but it came off in the wash . I carefully pinned glowsticks around the perimeters of the wolves , but they stopped glowing after only one day ! I even tried buying those glow in the dark stars for your ceiling and extracting the glow , but it turns out you ca n't do that . Then I stumbled upon the perfect solution - uranium ore ! I simply rubbed some on each wolf , and they have n't stopped glowing for three weeks . Another plus of this particular method of making the wolves glow is that the skin under the wolves always feels nice and warm - I do n't even need a coat in the winter . Uranium ore is great for this purpose , or for anything else you need to make glow , including children and pets -LRB- they 're so easy to find now ! -RRB- . I highly recommend this product .
 i mix this with shea butter and castor oil and apply it to my scalp twice a week . i cover my head with a plastic cap for deep penetration.now i see no dandruff at all and all my split ends are gone!i do have a funny-smelling urine , but i think that 's because i do n't drink enough water .
 This product is one of the best gag products I 've ever purchased . I 've already tricked 5 of my friends into getting cancer by either drinking it -LRB- spiked their drink -RRB- , eating it -LRB- sprinkled it in their Rice-a-Roni -RRB- , breathing its fumes -LRB- poured ore dust in his asthma inhaler -RRB- , smearing it on their body -LRB- mixed it in with his soap in the soap dispenser -RRB- , and using it for a rectal enema -LRB- self-explanatory -RRB- . Each time , I was rolling on the ground laughing , it was so funny . I know those guys are probably gon na get me back for my crazy stunts , but I 'm always gon na be one step ahead as long as I have tons of radioactive material at my disposal .
 We scattered this stuff all over our house and bushes . We now have the best Christmas lighting in our neighborhood . However , unlike our neighbor , we can not turn off the glow . I will need to trim the bushes , starting to have trouble getting to our front door . Sorry for this short review , family not feeling well .
 I frequently go fishing in the local river , but have never had much luck . At least , not until I bought this product . A couple of days after chucking in a couple of pots of this stuff and I was catching more fish in an hour than I would normally catch in a week . They make the creatures super docile , just floating along on the surface . I 've even given up using rods now and just float some netting out near the rocks.The only downside is that it seems to be having a similar effect on other creatures , and I occasionally get the odd rat , heron or small dog in the net among all the fish . On the other hand , it 's given me a wonderful opportunity to see all sorts of beautiful , rare wildlife which would never come out when I was around before , and the kids just love playing with all the ` sleeping otters ' we keep seeing along the river bank.I would recommend this product to anyone into game sports such as myself , and I fully intend to keep using the product in the future . A close friend and I are even thinking of investing in about thirty pots and heading down to a local lake sometime and trying it out there !
 This product has made my life so much easier , in numerous ways . I 've saved a fortune on electricity thanks to the healthy green glow given off by my dog . I no longer have to worry about mosquitoes and flies in the house during summer , as they can no longer fit through my windows . I was even able to type up this review in under three seconds , using the extra arm that recently grew out of my chest ! I was very pleasantly surprised by this product , and would heartily recommend it . 5 stars .
 Amuses the pets and saves on electricity bills for insomniacs ! I really fail to see how one could want anything else ? Apart from , y' know , when they move .
 I had tried DMT before and saw things could n't explain ... I decided to try this product and I am glad I did because it helped me to understand more clearly the things I saw while on DMT . I saw and talked to god ... and it explained to me all the mysteries of the universe we have all been wondering . I 'd give this more than five stars if I could . Thanks Amazon for a wonderful product and quick shipping . I 'll be ordering more .
 I bought this Uranium a couple of days ago , and it just came in the mail this morning . I went to the bathroom to try it out , and it turns out `` apply directly to the affected area '' is poor advice , as I was convinced it operated similar to Icy-Hot patches . Well , I do n't get muscle cramps anymore , but I 've started communicating with the household insects and apparently I 'm the Avatar of their ancestral guardian spirit Tok ` rahl Naktir . I would have given this a five-star , but the superhuman strength and speed turned out to be a product of brain cancer . Who woulda thought , am I right guys ?
 I am make order for 1,000,000 of these . Arrive safely by UPS infidels and work good . We am enrich product for make nuclear power plant . Not make weapon . Highly am recommend ! Israel not worry.M . Ahmedinejad
 I strongly recommend this product . The results were spectacular after used this in a science experiment . My basement is destroyed and my neighborhood has been quarantined from the rest of the town by the government , but it was worth it .
 At last my plan for world domination is at hand!With this magical rock I will figure out a way to transmogrify gold into turnips and destablize world markets!Fear my gourds ! / end sillinessOk for reals now . A nice little container with a certificate of authenticity explaining a bit about the sample and what it does . A cool little gift for the geologist/palentologist geek in your life .
 While I definitely am a fan of the product , it works exceedingly well for creating time-rays , worm-holers , bouncy shoes , and adding the occasional super power - it may be a bit too powerful.One evening I went to my lab to check in on a super hero -LRB- Ginsu Guy -RRB- I had just captured and to practice my evil laugh . After taunting the hero and telling him my dasterly evil plan , I went to check on my minions and their development of my latest ` weapon of doom ' - the Monster-Mega Snowball Chucker - only to have one of the stupid minions -LRB- Harold -RRB- sneeze into the container and blow a cloud of uranium ore at me.While normally I would n't mind -LRB- the price is unbelievably cheap ! -RRB- , I was wearing my Three Wolf Moon shirt -LRB- The Mountain Three Wolf Moon Short Sleeve Tee . Uh oh . Imagine the power of the sun and then what would happen if you focused the whole thing with a giant cloud of radioactive goodness like a magnifying glass the size of Jupiter - you get the idea.I began to glow and my charismatic powers were so strong women from China were leaving their homes to find me . Unfortunately , my exceedingly attractive allure caught the eye of Gobstopper Gal -LRB- Ginsu Guy 's girlfriend -RRB- looking for her beau.Yadda yadda yadda , I am now pulling gobstoppers out of my hair and plotting my revenge.Oh , and I had to fire Harold .
 This rich yellow cake really lights up a party . Ever since studying abroad in Syria , it 's been one of my favorites . My friends in the Middle East always ask for it by name . Using this simple recipe , it will be sure to make a bang at your next holiday gathering ! # 1 cup -LRB- 2 sticks -RRB- unsalted butter , room temperature , plus more for pans # 3 cups all-purpose flour , -LRB- can substitute Bob 's Red Mill gluten-free if needed -RRB- # 1 tablespoon baking powder # 2 cups Uranium # 1 teaspoon baking soda # 1/2 teaspoon salt # 2 cups sugar # 4 large eggs # 1 1/4 cups buttermilk # 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract # 6 cups Rich Chocolate Extremism
 My name is Grlbyzzk from the planet Hypticon3 in the galaxy Andromeda . I was surveying your planet 's pathetic defenses , in preparation for colonization , total domination and enslavery of your humanoid life forms . Alas , my anti-matter converter , which , of course , fuels the dark energy generator that powers my vessel , suffered a complete failure when I ventured too close to the CERN Large Hadron Collider and flew into an uncharted black hole . Fortunately for your planet , my antimatter converter reacted with the black hole while it was still quite small , obliterating it -LRB- and my poor anti-matter converter -RRB- before it could attain the size needed to consume your solar system . I disabled the CERN Collider immediately , to save your planet 's resources -LRB- which my people crave -RRB- for the greater glory of Bryzkinatz , our most Supreme Leader and ruler of Hypticon3 . `` May Her Silver Horns always glow for our people ! Brak ! Brak ! Brak ! `` Anyway , it was necessary to repair my anti-matter converter , which required a `` jump-start '' with a fissile isotope . I had some difficulty locating exactly what I needed until I chanced upon Amazon.com though the binary programming `` Stumble Upon '' . -LRB- When will you Earthlings switch to Dozenal ? -RRB- With this uranium , I have repaired my converter and will hasten back to Hypticon3 , and the most glorious Bryzkinatz , Brak ! , Brak ! , to tell my people that Earth is ripe for conquest . Thank you Amazon.com !!
 After my neighbour experienced sudden hair loss , she shared her secret with me . Now I enjoy the ease of Uranium Ore -LRB- tm -RRB- and have thrown out my razor and home hot wax kit for good . Since the first application , I have not had any regrowth . I do n't think I will ever need to visit a salon for those embarrassing bikini wax sessions!Thank you Uranium Ore -LRB- tm -RRB- !
 Did an excellent job , however a little goes a long way and I only needed one to caulk my tub . Did a great job ! Do not use if you have multiple chemical sensitivities .
 I had several areas along the interior walls where the vinyl was lifting away from the wall . The vinyl adhesive caulk worked wonderful , It really looked like new again . It was easy to apply and clean up , always a plus .
 Being relocated to Georgia from the Midwest I am surprised to find there are certain products that I can not find here . This is one of them and I will NOT settle for any other brand . THANK YOU AMAZON ! I can still get my Sparkle . Glass and mirrors always streak free first time .
 I f you are not from the Chicago area , you might pass this off as ` just another brand . &#34; I 've been using this product since the 1960 's , and can attest to it 's greatness.It will leave absolutely ZERO streaks , as long as you finish very LIGHTLY with a paper towel , or if you prefer not to use paper towels , a window squeegee . it is ammonia free . It will not take off the lettering , or turn any of your black audio / video equipment a permanently ruined whitish hue . Super safe on TV 's . It is very strong when attacking really hard , set in stains , or the gummy gunky residue left from the factory tags on new windows.Once you try this product , you will laugh at all the times you thought Windex was the best.Windex is not even in the same class as Sparkle . Nor is anything else .
 This was perfect , and at a great price . I drilled it to accept sheet metal screws to attach my ground radials . Excellent .
 I use these selfeed bits in a B.M. Root Boring Machine and they work fantastic . I have bored through about 1500 2x6 's and the bit has not showed any signs of dulling . The only thing you have to be careful about are the 1 '' bits clog pretty easily . The 1 1/2 '' bits are pretty much self cleaning .
 it was what i was looking for it came when it sad it would . it was fairly priced.worked well with the project i was working on .
 I had rung a bolt head off while tightening my oil filter cover back onto my Honda Rancher . Needless to say , the four wheeler was worthless until I could get the bolt out . I found this set and ordered it hoping it could do the job . The set arrived on time and as described . After drilling a pilot hole with a small drill bit I chose the correct size extractor bit , inserted it into my drill and put it on reverse setting , slow speed and high torque setting and within seconds my broken off bolt backed right out ! I could not ask for more !
 My local hardware store charges more for the largest piece in this set than the cost of the entire set , so getting an entire set for less seemed a bargain ; and I believe it was . I am very satisfied with the product and wish to commend the company 's customer service
 purchased for use in removal of broken screws and small bolts so can replace and be able to reuse without purchasing a whole new unit .
 Showed up on time , new product as advertised . Case is nice to have as well to keep organized . I 'd reccomend for decent cheap set of extractors .
 I recieved a quality product and it was complete and appeared new . They did the job I needed .
 i needed a good easy out and i found this set for the same price as i would have spent for just one and got the other six for free
 Since ordering this set , I 've been blessed to encounter only bolts & screws that come out without breaking , without their heads rounding off or stripping out , etc. . Thus , I ca n't really speak to the performance of these extractors . They appear to be solidly made , without any unfinished or irregular surfaces . I expect them to work well , although I suppose there 's always a question about the tempering of the steel and whether it will hold up in a real world application . The case is well sized for the eight extractors , and should help keep them together -- -LRB- as long as I remember to put them back after each use ! -RRB- -- hopefully making it a simple matter to locate the right sized extractor for each task at hand . Compared to other products I looked at , these were priced quite low . Compared to those I saw in stores , they look at least as likely to work well.I 'd like to find a set of larger ones for an equally good price , however . I chose to purchase these while looking for something larger to help with some rusted 1.25 '' steel pipe threaded into cast fittings . I ended up destroying what was left of the pipe with a pipe wrench , and still had rusty remains of the threads stuck in the fitting . I do n't see many affordable products in that size range to do for pipe what these will do for bolts and screws .
 it was what i was looking for it came when it sad it would . it was fairly priced.worked well with the project i was working on .
 I was impressed by the manufacturers ' claim that `` This product 's actual size is 72mm x 55m . This tape is typically cut to width from log rolls so most sizes ship on a plain white core . '' I 've used enough duct tape in the past to know that , although many manufacturers claim they 're cutting to width from log rolls , it 's not always the case . Duct tape 's a funny thing , is n't it ? No matter what you 're using it for . I like Polyken as a brand and I always like products cut from logs ... When I was in shop class in high school they used to call me , the Log Lady , and one time it was my birthday they brought me an ice cream cake shaped like a log ! So I ordered several rolls of the dark green 223 , as you see here , and when it came I went a little crazy with the back of my refrigerator ... And also I had the common problem of having three cats -LRB- of my wife 's -RRB- who run around the kitchen sometimes knocking down the upright broom and dust mop much to my annoyance . Problem licked with Polyken ! I just applied a few inches of that thick , log-derived polymer on either side of the broom handle , basically taping it to the wall . Mop too . One caveat , but this is something all duct tape users know , if you are actually taping yourself , or another human being , watch out , that tape stings when you peel it off , so save the bare skin by inserting strips of linen or cotton underneath , and save yourself some swearing down the line.It has a nice aroma just sitting in my shop cellar . I keep thinking it would n't be inappropriate in my top dresser drawer , if I ever run out of potpourri -- again , a nice mixture of clean , sweet , unearthed log , and maybe something a little chemical like air freshener .
 I am very happy with this tape . It suits my needs . I will be ordering again . But maybe next time I will go for the 5 incher wide .
 Ha ! You know what they say about Duct tape and such 1000 and 1 uses you never thought of using it for . Same goes with this roll of tape . Great stuff and huge roll , well worth the price . Tomarrow I am going to build a boat ... J/KPolyken 223 Multi-Purpose Duct Tape
 Nearly impossible to find anywhere , this W-I-D-E roll of black duct tape is just the thing for special needs . Great price , and fast ship , I am very pleased with this product . It is duct tape , what can you say ?

 I used this for a grounding lug on a welding table I built . Price was reasonable , quality is good . Did have a couple nicks on it so if you need a smooth clean surface you might have to machine it , sand and polish for a mirror finish .
 It is a bar of copper , not much else to say . You get exactly what you order . It is harder to tap some threads into it then I originally thought .
 This copper bar will be just what I need to fabricate a custom battery disconnect terminal to hide under the rear panel of my 928 .
 What more can I say ? The copper bar was brand new , tempered as advertised , was on dimension , worked flawlessly for my project , and was the cheapest piece -LRB- of that size -RRB- that I could find anywhere online . I purchase a LOT of items online , especially hobby related items , and I search diligently for the best product at the best price.Amazon came through for me !
 The material was as described and was delivered on schedule . The packaging was less than adequate since the bar broke through one end cap of the shipping tube . Otherwise it would be five stars .
 Good product and free shipping . Used this for a place to put my welding ground clamp on my welding table . Not polished , so if you need bright shiny copper be prepared to spend some time polishing .

Problem licked with Polyken ! I just applied a few inches of that thick , log-derived polymer on either side of the broom handle , basically taping it to the wall . Mop too . One caveat , but this is something all duct tape users know , if you are actually taping yourself , or another human being , watch out , that tape stings when you peel it off , so save the bare skin by inserting strips of linen or cotton underneath , and save yourself some swearing down the line.It has a nice aroma just sitting in my shop cellar . I keep thinking it would n't be inappropriate in my top dresser drawer , if I ever run out of potpourri -- again , a nice mixture of clean , sweet , unearthed log , and maybe something a little chemical like air freshener .
 I am very happy with this tape . It suits my needs . I will be ordering again . But maybe next time I will go for the 5 incher wide .
 Ha ! You know what they say about Duct tape and such 1000 and 1 uses you never thought of using it for . Same goes with this roll of tape . Great stuff and huge roll , well worth the price . Tomarrow I am going to build a boat ... J/KPolyken 223 Multi-Purpose Duct Tape
 Nearly impossible to find anywhere , this W-I-D-E roll of black duct tape is just the thing for special needs . Great price , and fast ship , I am very pleased with this product . It is duct tape , what can you say ?
 I used this for a grounding lug on a welding table I built . Price was reasonable , quality is good . Did have a couple nicks on it so if you need a smooth clean surface you might have to machine it , sand and polish for a mirror finish .
 It is a bar of copper , not much else to say . You get exactly what you order . It is harder to tap some threads into it then I originally thought .
 This copper bar will be just what I need to fabricate a custom battery disconnect terminal to hide under the rear panel of my 928 .
 What more can I say ? The copper bar was brand new , tempered as advertised , was on dimension , worked flawlessly for my project , and was the cheapest piece -LRB- of that size -RRB- that I could find anywhere online . I purchase a LOT of items online , especially hobby related items , and I search diligently for the best product at the best price.Amazon came through for me !
 The material was as described and was delivered on schedule . The packaging was less than adequate since the bar broke through one end cap of the shipping tube . Otherwise it would be five stars .
 Good product and free shipping . Used this for a place to put my welding ground clamp on my welding table . Not polished , so if you need bright shiny copper be prepared to spend some time polishing .

 If you ever have a need to tape down an electric cord - this is the tape you need ! It pulls up perfectly and does not leave any slime on your cords . It also provides excellent visibility to anyone who might potentially trip on the cord .
 I was impressed by the manufacturers ' claim that `` This product 's actual size is 72mm x 55m . This tape is typically cut to width from log rolls so most sizes ship on a plain white core . '' I 've used enough duct tape in the past to know that , although many manufacturers claim they 're cutting to width from log rolls , it 's not always the case . Duct tape 's a funny thing , is n't it ? No matter what you 're using it for . I like Polyken as a brand and I always like products cut from logs ... When I was in shop class in high school they used to call me , the Log Lady , and one time it was my birthday they brought me an ice cream cake shaped like a log ! So I ordered several rolls of the dark green 223 , as you see here , and when it came I went a little crazy with the back of my refrigerator ...

 I purchased this for my husband . He has every kind of gadget you can imagine . He loves odd things and all kinds of tools . We have not used this yet but he thought it was a great gift for the man that has everything and needs nothing . He said it will come in handy when I 'm not around to hold a tape measure for him when he needs to hang something.This would be great for a single person that likes to decorate and hang things around the house and needs 4 hands .
 I love this detergent ! Our clothes are brighter & stains do n't stain ! On a recent trip to my mother-in-law 's she commented on how clean & bright our clothes were -LRB- we have a toddler & a baby -RRB- we washed our clothes in her -LRB- brand name -RRB- detergent & I was shocked at how dingy they looked after coming out of the dryer . We came home & re-washed them in BioKleen & they were as good as new again . I ca n't recommend this enough ! And at only 2 Tablespoons per wash it is extremely cost effective .
 it was what i was looking for it came when it sad it would . it was fairly priced.worked well with the project i was working on .
 I bought this at Sam 's Club for $ 50 . After looking at faucets for a long time I thought I was going to end up paying hundreds for a good faucet . I am totally satisfied with this faucet . It looks great and works great also !!! 5 stars !
 Using it for 2 years with no problem . It has ceramic disc cartridges - > drip free and high rise spout - > very comfortable .

 I purchased this set because it was inexpensive , less than six bucks . I did n't expect much , but I was surprised that the bits are well made and concentric . I needed to use the full length of the bit to drill some holes , and even chucking it at the tiny little hex nub at the end of the bit it spun true . Despite being made in China , these are good quality drill bits - sharp , concentric , and well finished . I 'm actually disappointed I ruined one when I hit a nail in the post .
 Duct tape works on anything
 TOM Aquarium Flow Meter -LRB- measures 50gph to 250gph flow rate -RRB- Not many options out there for monitoring water flow -LRB- GPM -RRB- on aquarium filters ... this little gem is worth it 's weight in gold.Very inexpensive yet works as advertised .3 / 4 '' hose barb fittings on each end or if you remove these adapters you have 3/4 '' MPT -LRB- male pipe thread -RRB- to add your own fittings.I transitioned to 1/2 '' hose barbs due to my tubing sizing from my Marineland C-220 canister filter that feeds this flow meter.These are vital for monitoring flow rate for UV sterilizers ... that 's what I 'm doing.By adding a simple valve to the output you can control the flow rate to exactly what you need.I rate this item top notch for it price and performance.Easy to clean out also due to it 's screw off cap .
 Lenox by far and above makes the best drill bits of this type . I have had a couple of these for several years and even when they are dull they cut better than new bits of some other brands .
 Construction feels a bit cheap , lighter than high quality top-brad calipers , not very smooth finish . Plastic edge does not line up at 0 exactly , which it is supposed to , but it has digital reading so I can do without manual reading -LRB- atleast until digital dial keeps working -RRB- . When I hold it I get black residue on hand , I hope it is graphite used for lubrication and not lead . Having said that , it does work , comes with an extra battery , nice case and a port to connect to computer !!! This is certainly more than I expected for the price .
 6 Inch LCD Digital Caliper with Extra Battery and Case Exellent product , exactly what I need , good quality , very happy with my buy !!
 I see many reviews where people said the battery that came in the unit was dead on arrival , however , the battery that came installed in mine works -LRB- at least for the 10 minutes I tested it when I first got it this morning -RRB- . The unit appears to be accurate and I have had no issued with it yet - granted I have not put it through any kind of serious use . I will use it in my garage and possibly update this review if I have problems with it , but just out of the box it works fine -LRB- VISUALLY tested calibration against some Allen Scales I had in my office desk but not yet tested against another caliper -RRB- . My only complaint is the unit appears a bit flimsy and not very robust -LRB- thus the 4 stars -RRB- . However , for the price , I think I did OK with this caliper . The extra battery was a plus .
 The caliper is very good quality , measures inside and outside dimensions extremely accurately . I build and modify radio controlled aircraft and electronics and use this on every project . The price was also very good . Vendor and shipping were also great . I 'm very happy .
 I was expecting something low quality given the inexpensive price of this product , but I was pleasantly surprised . The first thing I noticed was the case . Though it is made of plastic , it does not feel flimsy or cheap , but is strong and surprisingly heavy . The case opens easily but seems to latch securely . Inside , the caliper is surrounded by a high density foam -LRB- again , nothing cheap -RRB- that seems like it would really protect the product.An extra battery was included , as well as the pre-installed one . I was n't really looking at the buttons and just started turning the little wheel and to my surprise the display came on . It appears that if the caliper is moved it turns on automatically . The wheel is nice as you can move the calipers very precisely with it , however it is not meshed - that is , once the calipers hit even a slight resistance -LRB- from the object you are measuring , presumably -RRB- , the wheel spins in place and the caliper no longer moves . I suppose this would be great for measuring something soft , but if you want a bit of clamp down a bit on the object while it is being measured , you will have to push the caliper directly.There is both interior and exterior measuring capabilities , and the caliper can be calibrated at zero wherever you want . It will even measure negatively . I can see this being quite useful for comparing sizes . For example , you measure an object and calibrate at zero with the object . Then you measure another object and the caliper will read the difference in size between the objects , positive or negative . The readout give a measure accurate to .0005 inches or .01 mm -LRB- although I did not test this accuracy -RRB- . In short , I would definitely recommend this product , as it seems a great value for the price . In fact , I almost feel like ordering a few more for myself even though I would have no use for more than one . Do n't waste your money buying a more expensive product - this one is just as good .
 This tool does everything I need it to do , and very precisely . It 's exactly what I needed , and I only spent $ 10 . Ca n't beat that .
 Beyond the fact that these calipers are very accurate and useful workplace tools , I would also add that they have been a great classroom tool as well . The most difficult thing has been for middle school students to see that narrow space between zero and one . These calipers , along with a set of lessons that require measuring of everything from table thickness to paper thickness , inside measures of paper clips to depth of calculator buttons , bring the idea home to them in a very concrete , yet also calculable , way . I never thought we'ed ever be able to afford them . Thanks !
 this digital caliper is well worth the money . its works good and is very accurate . it came in a nice hard case and battery included . would recommend it to anybody . also very satisfied with amazon . -LRB- as always -RRB- they shipped it for free and it only took a couple of days till it arrived .
 For under $ 12 , this digital caliper works great . It is accurate and gives repeatable results , although it does need to be re-zeroed after moving around a bunch . It 's even accurate enough that Snap-On sells it with the bluepoint name -LRB- for a few extra dollars -RRB- . My friend has one and the only difference is that instead of saying `` Stainless Hardened '' on the front , it has a nice bluepoint logo . But the tool , case , and everything else are identical -LRB- although I 'm not certain about the manual -RRB- .
 I just started reloading ammo and needed a reliable set of calipers . These look just like the ones marketed under different names like RCBS , etc. . So far so good . Very repeatable results time after time . Now , if it just lasts.For the price - go for it .
 As it states in the title , for the price great product . Seems to be accurate up to .01 . When testing the same object , no deviation from the original measure up to .01 . Only issues , it is what you pay for . It feels a little cheap , but that 's ok . Does n't feel as if it will break . Issue , and why it is only 4 stars is the roller on it is all but inoperable . Other than that , comes in a good case , extra battery , and seems nice ... again , for the price .
 The adjustment wheel tends to slip but it otherwiseworks as well as calipers costing four times the price.Good value .
 I ordered so I can accurately measure things for my new 3d printer . All in all I think its a good product worth its $ 11 price.Pros : Measurement is correctCame with padded case and extra batteryMetric/Imperial switchCons : Kinda sharp edges on a lot of cornersThe locking screw causes it to get stuck sometimes even if you unscrew it all the way
 This unit measures accurately and includes everything in the description . The only downside is that the measurement drifts pretty fast -LRB- a few mils per use -RRB- . This unit must be zeroed it before every measurement to keep it accurate , but for the price I ca n't complain .
 This tool I purchased because I started to reloading my own ammo and this is the perfect tool to use to measure my ammo . The price was great , and I could not pass it up .
 They served me well and did their job . As I see it , and was taught , calipers are supposed to be more of a general measuring tool when you get down to . oo1 of an inch , and it did its job very well.My only complaint is that my wheel which you turn to move the body of the caliper up and down had to be pushed up against the measuring part in order for it to move . However , that 's essentially negligible when it comes to the price . Another fact to keep in mind is that you should zero the caliper out every time you use it , just to make sure as it might slide this way and that , marginally , but a good idea nonetheless.Obviously I 'm not in this sort of industry but I did take a class in machining and needed some of these , and I think if you are looking for a set of calipers you should try these out , they are cheap and work very well .
 For an economy caliper you will get a solid -LRB- not plastic crap , even some of the name brands have made plastic light weight ones that are inferior to this -RRB- constructed measuring tool that reads out with ease , the display is nice , I like the way the larger 3 place digits are legible and the slightly smaller half thousands are helpful to make a quick and accurate read .
 This item was of a much higher quality than I imagined for the price it performs perfectly . I use it to measure bullets after reloading it measures them very accurately
 This digital caliper is great . Comes with a decent case and is quite accurate . I tested it on some machined valve shims and it matched the marked size of each shim perfect each time down to 0 . XX mm as designed . Some of the shims I had are marked to 0 . XXX mm , so if the shim was 2.355 mm , the caliper would read 2.36 mm since it can only read to 0 . XXmm , which is what I would have expected and well within the + / -0.02 mm rated accuracy . I was happily surprised by this digital caliper and definitely recommend it.I think this caliper is sold elsewhere in stores under a number of brand names . My dad has one that is identical to this one except for the markings and the case that he had paid around $ 40 for in a store .
 This digital caliper arrived timely as expected . When I turned the unit on , it did not function . I removed the battery and found it was totally discharged . I inserted the spare battery and it worked fine . Although I liked the idea of a spare battery , I paid so little for this item I can affrord a spare.My only disappointment is that it only reads in decimals . It would be useful to be able to convert this to fractions , since many items are sold that way . I will devise a conversion table , but the designer could have done this for us .
 I had pretty low expectations of this caliper based on the price . However when I received it I was pleasantly surprised with it 's accuracy . For the price it 's a great tool . My only problem with it is the installed battery that shipped with it is nearly dead -LRB- flashing display - according to the manual -RRB- . Fortunately it does come with a spare battery . THis is a great hobbiest tool but would likely not stand up to daily abuse in a machine shop .
 This caliper is acurate enough . I use it for biological experiments , and it does its job just well . I have n't had any problem .
 Received the digital caliper a few days ago - it functioned exactly as advertised and has already proven quite useful and accurate ! I would gladly do business with this firm in the future .
 Durable and great price . I paid more for a plastic version at Home Depot . I would buy this again but I do n't think I will need to What more can I say .
 Only purchased this measuring tool just for having one , maybe someday I will find it useful.This is my review of this product.The quality of this product is not that bad-looks durablenot precisely accurate but still have 99 % measuring accuracy.PROS : - Its affordable-Comes with a plastic case is a plus-extra batteryI dont see an included power button protection as postedin the listing.Overall recommend this product , If you do n't want to spend morefor a high end measurement tool try this device it will do thesamefor a cheap price .
 good tool but not the best I use it when building model RC aircraft . helicopters , planes , works good for that but do n't think I would trust it using it on real aircraft or anything else that needs to be dead on right .
 Nice caliper for the money . Something you can toss in the tool box . The extra battery is because the battery it ships with is doa .
 I was concerned I might not be spending enough to get what I needed , but this turned out to be a great decision . For $ 12 this is a steal . You can spend a lot more on a set of digital calipers , if you need higher grade steel or finer measurements , but for the typical garage-mechanic or ammunition re-loader -LRB- like myself -RRB- , this fits the bill perfectly . Measurements are consistent and , as far as I can tell , accurate . Construction is surprisingly good for what you 're paying though the thumb-wheel feels a little flimsy and requires more downward pressure to engage than I 'd like . I 've just started using the serrated thumb indentation on the readout module instead of the thumb-wheel and that solves that little nit-pick . The display is big and easy to read , which I like very much . The battery required is , thankfully , a common one that can be picked up almost anywhere that sells `` button '' batteries -LRB- there 's few things more annoying than when something like this uses some obscure battery that Radio Shack has order for you -RRB- . With proper use I can see this caliper lasting a lifetime . It wo n't take the proverbial licking and keep on ticking , but again , for the price , it 's probably just the electronic caliper you 've been looking for .
 This is inexpensive and quite useful for home DIY types , hobbies and handymen . It is solid , more accurate than most of us require and simple to use . The extra battery is a bonus , but replacement batteries for this model are cheap , selling in packets for 50 cents/each on Batteries.com . I use it for wood turning , woodworking , carpentry , hardware measurement , plumbing and many other things -- a great gadget to have handy around the house .
 I 'm an engineering student and i needed a caliper for an upcoming dissection project and this product has been a great help . This was an amazing deal -LSB- ... -RSB- . Everything works great on this caliper and it seems to have pretty good battery life . Overall great product for an engineering student on a budget .
 This is great and the perfect caliper . The only thing is that I wish I had gotten one with fractions as well as digital measurements . You may not want that , but I wish I had bought one since I could have gotten it for about the same price .
 These calipers are nicely made , do the job , I have n't had any problems and am very glad I found them at this great price !
 arrived as advertised on time in excellent condition . product works well and was well packaged
 This product costs so much more in a dental catalog . It is the exact same item . Thanks for savings us about $ 50.00
 VERY GOOD QUALITY FOR THE PRICE . I HAVE PAID OVER $ 100.00 FOR THE SAME QUALITY
 Having just received this caliper , the tests I have done show this caliper to be very accurate . Durability with such electronic devices will be the true test of its value .
 This was a great buy . It is accurate , It has a nice storage case . I do n't know how long the battery will last -LRB- I have a digital scale that eats 9 volt batteries -RRB- because I do n't use it very often .
 This was NOT the digital caliper I ordered , however , the features matched my needs . I give the item itself 4 stars . The seller received a separate rating . This is a very good digital caliper ... smooth operation ... and has the capability for data-cable use -LRB- though a data-cable was NOT supplied with the caliper -RRB- . It can switch from millimeters to inches ... making it very versatile . The extra battery was a plus . BTW ... the Pit Bull caliper was the one I ordered , but I was sent a `` Carrera Precision '' caliper -LRB- by Max Tool ; -LSB- ... -RSB- -RRB- instead . Luckily , this caliper had the same features as the Pit Bull ... with the exception that the Carrera has a black surface -LRB- not silver -RRB- .
 I HAV N'T USED THE CALIPER BUT ONCE . BUT AS A RETIRED MECHANICAL ENGINEER HEAVILY INVOLVED IN THE MACHINING INDUSTRY , I THINK IT APPEARS WELL MADE AND ACCURATE . I WAS KIND OF CONCERNED BECAUSE IT BORE NO MFR 'S NAME . BUT FOR THE PRICE COMPARED TO THE NAME BRANDS , I AM SATISFIED .
 For $ 10.50 this was an awesome buy.The calipers came in a decent box , included an extra battery , and seem to be very accurate.I have had no issues with them , very happy with the purchase and quick shipping time to California .
 very accurate and easy to use . has a button to turn on/off , to zero , and switch from mm to inches . also like the function to be able to zero it out in the middle and then it will read negative if you go under.very usable
 Really nice quality for the price . Nice case for storage and protection when not in use . Easy to use and the spare battery is a nice bonus .
 These calipers are surprisingly good for the price . This is about all you 'd ever need to pay for calipers , it turns out , unless you need laboratory-quality results . I use mine for precision handloading and they 're definitely good enough . The one minor complaint I have about them is that they tend to lose zero when you turn them off ; close the jaws at 0.000 , and then turn them back on later , and they might display as much as 0.002 . Fortunately , resetting the zero is just one button press away .
 You have to be very gentle with this tool . The sliding wheel seems a little fragile , you need to be careful . This is a very good caliper , it comes with a spare battery , nice molded case , a very modest instruction sheet . Very easy to use . Cons
 This easy to use and easy to read instrument has to be one of the best buys around . I use it frequently and have found it to be accurate and reliable over several months now . What 's more , should it ever break just give the box to a student for a pen case - which would likely have cost the same if the caliper did n't come packed in it . You ca n't go wrong on this one .
 I have used all kinds of calipers over the years , some good , some bad , some cheap , some very expensive . As long as you are not doing spec work and making your own bearings and cages , these are a fantastic value and have many varied uses .
 I purchased this caliper to reach the $ 25 cut off to get free shipping . I use it for fun to figure out the exact thickness or case size of my watches.It does exactly what it says it does and came very quick . I mean a digitial caliper for recreational use for $ 12 - $ 13 ?!? You ca n't go wrong . You will not be dissapointed with this purchase . I know I was n't !
 Good quality and cheap to boot.It is not Starrett quality accuracy , but it is good enough for the price .
 Well , not much to say , other than it works correctly , and is incredibly simple to use .
 the caliper is nicely made . The accuracy in both inches and metric is spot on . Very nice tool , especially for the price . The seller sent the caliper to me with great speed . Good company to work with .
 This micromoter is very nice and plenty accurate for the work that I do . I can fit it in my suit pocket and it comes in handy when I am at a client and evaluting some of thier products as part of my quality control / vendor testing . It is very compact and light weight .
 Rec 'd my calipers in good time and well packaged.Nice large display and near as I can tell , very accurate .
 I was looking for a precision digital measuring device to monitor the cracks on the walls of my basement and the garage . I live in mountaineer state and the accumulation of rain water underground could affect the structure over a long period of time . Hence I bought this device to measure the length and width of few selected cracks on the wall to see if there is a change in the length , width or depth over a period of time . This device is sufficient for my purpose and works great , and the reading is accurate . This is good for few common applications that requires the measurements of length , breadth and depth , but may not be suitable for high precision measurements
 Good quality calipers with digital readout at a terrific price . Very useful measuring device for my wood shop .
 I was a little scepticle on whether this would be a quality item because it was so reasonably priced . Well , it is a good product and serves it ` s purpose very well . The service was excellent and I would definately buy from this company again . The large display on these digital calipers are also a treat to use .
 I received the product in time . The product works great . I are very satisfied with the service .
 This was a great gift for all of the men in my family for Christmas . They all appreciated it and it was packaged quite nicely .
 As I spent over $ 300 on the first digital caliper I purchased , with the price of this unit being less than the shipping , this is very functional .
 This is a great little item for the price if you are a hobbyist or casual woodworker . What more can be asked for , inexpensive and accurate . Just remember to turn the unit off .
 This is a great tool ! it is quite accurate for a low price . not much more to say
 The item arrived fast . Battery was flat upon arrival -LRB- flashing display -RRB- but there was a fresh battery in the box so a simple change out fixed that . It will serve it 's purpose for the price . As a watch enthusiast , I need it for watch case sizing and I love the zero out start option . A great tool for the money .
 Great measuring stick for the price . Easy to read digital read out , smooth movement and the case is even decent looking .
 I was satisfied with this caliper right up to the point I accidentally dropped a carbide die on the LCD and shattered the glass . Caliper still works but unfortunately I have to replace it . I 'm going to pay slightly more this time around and get one with inch , mm , and fractions . I only hope it 's just as reliable as this one has been for the money . First thing I 'm going to do with the next one is put some clear tape over the display to help protect it .
 6 Inch LCD Digital Caliper with Extra Battery and CaseI bought this digital caliper about a month ago and using it everyday.It is not the sturdiest caliper but it is perfect for my woodworking jobs.And I am quite happy with the low price.After seeing it , my friends also wanted it . So I ordered five more.Two minor comments :1 -RRB- When I ordered it first time , Amazon sent me a caliper without any colorcoating . But five additional calipers I just received are black-coated asshown in the product photo . Functionwise , I believe they are the same .2 -RRB- I could not find any quality check certificate for any of them which wasmentioned by a reviewer.PS
 its a pretty well average caliper , but mine managed to shop up without the 2nd battery . but hell , it was like 16 somethin shipped , helluva lot cheaper than 60 or so at a store ... i can pay for plenty of batteries before the difference is met
 This is a handy item . It came in a protective case and works well . The extra batterys are a nice touch .
 This was a very cheap caliper and it definitely shows . Functionality-wise it is perfect for my Graphics Communication class but the case came in a white cardboard sleeve with nothing written on it . The inside of the case had slots for accessories that were n't included -LRB- they never said any accessories would be included but it 's unprofessional in my opinion -RRB- . Also , the caliper was covered in oil , presumably as a lubricant but even the digital read out was oily , I had to take a cloth to it before I could use it.Overall , you get what you paid for .
 the caliper is precise and well made . The case was broken in shipment and the batteries lasted about a week.for that price I just bought more new batteries and ignore the case thing . it works perfectly .
 The digital caliper is reasonably accurate and sturdy for the money . It does tend to go off calibration frequently but considering I bought it for a HVAC class it has done good work so far and I can live with having to reset it regularly . Also , the extra battery that was supposed to come with it got lost along the way , I never got it . Instead I bought a pack of ten batteries here at amazon for 2 bucks and I 'm happy with that . I would say that for the money this caliper is a good buy .
 It is a wonderful product at an unbelievably low cost . Enjoyed the buying experience very much . Expecting many more such low cost quality items in the years to come .
 I am glad I bought it . It was affordable and worked very well . It was easy to figure out how to use . I highly recommend this tool .
 Accurate and easy to read . I really like the feature that shuts itself off , yet comes back on with the slightest touch .
 Product works great . Came only with one battery but called the company and their service was excellent . Got a new battery in 3 days . Great value .
 For the price you can not beat this caliper . It gives measurements in both inches and metric and is accurate . I 've seen the same caliper out there for 5 times the price I paid on Amazon .
 Wow ! VERY precise and accurate ! The instruction sheet paper was .09 mm thick . It appears to have a standard 2-wire synchronous serial interface , but I have n't tried using it yet . I 'm probably not going to , I do n't have any automated projects that would use a caliper . I know some calipers have various modes activated by pulling the data pin high , but I ca n't seem to access any alternate modes . Perhaps my particular caliper has a different interface.It is very substantial feeling as well . It has a nice weight and feels very straight and sturdy . I ca n't really comment on durability as I have only had it for a few hours.My only complaint is the fact that the movement is a little gritty . This might be fixed by lubricant-I assume that the sensor is capacitive and this wo n't damage it.Also , this is a plus for micro-tools and amazon . I ordered this thing for $ 11.25 with free 2-day shipping -LRB- amazon prime -RRB- on wednesday IIRC . Scheduled delivery was saturday , I got it on friday . That 's really only 48 hours for no extra money . Very nice!Definitely worth what I paid so far .
 For years I have been using a mechanicl caliper , but the numbers were starting to wear and getting hard to read . With this digital calipeer there is no problem with trying to reead the numbers . Should have bought it years ago .
 I bought this Caliper because it 's essential in getting very accurate measurements with setting up a professional RC Helicopter . I shopped around at my local hardware stores as well as other online shops where they carry this very same set of digital calipers for two to three times the amount of money . These calipers just do n't disappoint . I 've also be finding myself needing them for many other projects . I just do n't know how to got along with out them.They come with everything seen in the picture . A great hard plastic case with foam a cutout . Though the picture was a bit misleading ... I thought it came with 2 extra batteries . Well it did . . one is already installed in the calipers . So do n't be shocked when you open up the package to find only one battery floating around.These are the best set of digital calipers for your money ! -LRB- One other person said he had a problem when he closed the case that it would push the ON button thus wearing out the battery . Let me just say ... I do n't have that problem at all . -RRB-
 I use this primarily to do quality control on handloaded ammunition , so accuracy is paramount . This works like a charm ... idiot-simple to use , large easy-to-read back-lighted display , and quality stainless steel construction throughout . The more that I use it , the more I 'm impressed with it . No `` cons '' ... all `` pros . '' It 's also extremely helpful that it comes in a hard case with custom-cut foam lining .
 I had one of these , and dropped it on the cement floor at a Michael 's . It kept on working . It was later that I discovered that the exposed arm for the `` inner dimension '' was bent . In a contest between concrete and Chinese steel , concrete wins . But , conversely , after a little quality time with a pair of pliers , discovering the joys of `` enhanced interrogation techniques '' , my baby was back in service . For those unfamiliar , it 's worth mentioning that these calipers can measure outer dimensions from 0 to almost 6 inches , inner width from about 1/2 an inch to about 6 inches , and the rod that protrudes from the end as you open the `` jaws '' allows you to measure depth . You do n't have to be a dentist to appreciate and use all three . Once you have one of these , and , yes , the word `` instrument '' applies , you will discover a whole world of things to measure . Did you know how thick a compressed wad of 50 one hundred dollar bills is , and whether it will fit in that hidden compartment in your briefcase ? And to anyone who ever uses tools to improve their surroundings , having a caliper makes all the difference between a successful and planned intervention and one of those sweaty concertos for hammer and broken screwdriver . Until I got a caliper I did n't realize tools could be used more than once . But clearly after its tumble , the inner width measurements were only as accurate as I could bend the arm back into position , i 'll leave that to your imagination . So I ordered another , after wasting time comparing various models . Whatever you order , it may or may not look like the photograph , and paying more will not fetch a better device . These are standard issue $ 10 Chinese calipers , and all these sellers will ship you whatever they happen to have received that week , with or without a spare battery etc. . And they are great . Clean it of oil when you get it , treat it reasonably gently , and you will find that they work , they are accurate and repeatable to the last digit on the display . If you happen to have received a lemon , get another.After my new one arrived , almost but not quite identical to the one that bit concrete , I was able to quite reasonably recalibrate the old one 's `` inner diameter '' arm by means of a long session with pliers , and now i have two . Much as you might not trust that wounded general with a whole regiment , not with that seeping bandage on his head and those silly tricks he does with his glass eye , he 's plenty good enough to lead a squad inside the green zone or probe for mines from the comfort of his wheelchair . So i leave my rehab ` ed caliper downstairs to measure the occasional harpsichord or bass string , to set the action on my ouds , and other routine tasks . The inch/millimeter switching is wonderful . I 've never gotten one with the fraction inches display , and rather think that 's carrying the absurdity of the `` English '' system a quarter smidge too far ! I have a 0.0001 '' analog micrometer that I used to consult like an oracle for verification when I first got my Chinese Wonder , but it was like reading animal entrails compared to the convenience and efficiency of the digital one , and I stopped checking , as it was always in spec . This is one of the most useful gizmos I own , right next to that hammer and screwdriver , and a great deal .
 First I 'm going to run through what came in the box and then I 'll describe each item :1 . The digital caliper2 . A spare battery3 . A case4 . Instructions5 . Certificate of calibration6 . Two copies of the MaxTool catalogFirst of all , I 'm impressed that they hand tested my caliper on 20 different test gauges and included a hand-written table of the amount of error in each coming to an average error of 0.02 mm . By the way , the certificate is 0.0055 in . thick : -RRB- Next , the instruction sheet shows a diagram of the tool and tells how to use each function.There 's a spare battery : -RRB- The case holds the caliper and the spare battery . Also , the case is rock-hard plastic with foam padding on the inside.The caliper itself is awesome . It measures in both inches and millimeters to a tolerance of 0.0005 in . or 0.01 mm . It is capable of being plugged into a computer -LRB- cable not included -RRB- . It has faces for measuring outside diameter , inside diameter , depth and a step -LRB- or height -RRB- . There are three buttons for toggling power , toggling SA and metric and zeroing -LRB- or tare -RRB- . This is a wonderful buy even if you do n't need it . I say this because there will eventually be a time where you 'll be doing something and realize that it 's the proper tool .
 It is no Mitutuyo -LRB- which retails for about $ 90 + -RRB- and it has one less digit ... BUT for most applications this nice little caliper is more than you need . You can have eight of these around the same price ! The price figures as a big plus in ranking it , of course , but it works well and it does what it is supposed to do . One small footnote , the steel in the jaws is not very hard -LRB- as in a more expensive caliper -RRB- ; it will bend and distort a bit more than you would like it to . But , then again , if you need a top-notch caliper , look at a Mitutoyo or the like . For the price , you can not beat this one .
 I bought this unit mostly because I figured I could n't lose much for so little money . I have since figured it was a great deal . I even recommended my company to buy one for the shop . They were glad I told them . Everyone I have shown this item has told me they are impressed with the quality of build and the very very low price . It came with everything necessary , such as the hard case -LRB- good quality -RRB- and extra battery . The instructions are all in English and clear . No need to worry about this one . This vendor shipped my caliper on time and I got it in good shape .
 Item does everything it claimed and is very precise . It measures depth as well as width and inside measurements . I used it to build a precise piece of furniture where depth and hole size had to be precise measurements . Everything turned out great the first time .
 I 've had these calipers for several years and they work very well . I have access to some much more expensive calipers at the office and I have used them to evaluate these with very favorable results . These seem to be good to 0.001 '' over the full range -LRB- at least my set is -RRB- . The construction quality is obviously not as good as high end calipers , but is unbelievably good for the price . Overall , highly recommended !
 This is by far one of the best digital calipers i have purchased thus far.Easy to read large display and the measurements are on the button.Guys this one is idiot proof . Get One !!!!!!!
 The first caliper we received did n't work , but the vendor responded immediately to my email and sent a new one out the next day . The new caliper works perfectly and is a very good value . This vendor highly recommended for their customer service and product pricing .
 I am very pleased with the this product . It gets the job done and works wonderfully and I 've had no problems so far .
 This is not Starret or Mitutoyo ... it 's made in China . No fancy polish ... just a simple accurate tool easy to use . Vendor is darned good on price and shipping . If you lose it on job you wo n't be crying ... just buy another one . Handy size for legnth/width and depth measurements . The jaw allows internal/external measurments of round objects like pipe and tubing . The projecting rod allows depth and height measurements like setting a circular saw blade . For the price , repetitive accuracy is excellent per zero set for the reloader checking case legnth . Most precision measurements do n't require beyond six inches so this tool is pocketable -LRB- IF you do n't drop it . -RRB- Tools like this do not come with a ` standard ' as they are not field calibrational ... what you do is keep a piece of steel around that you recorded measurement AFTER ZERO to track . Toss your micrometers and dial calipers away unless your building spaceships for NASA requiring traceable NIS history .
 I was surprised when I received this caliper . the quality for this caliper is comparable with the > $ 100.00 Mitutoyo I use at work . I compared accuracy , they are nearly the same . Read other people 's comment , they are explained very clear , I am just want to give a 5 star rating for the product .
 I bought this caliper for use in racing radio controlled cars . It is consistent and accurate for my needs . I 'm not sure if it would be accurate enough for a machinist , per se , but for most it is an excellent measuring tool .
 Nice Addition for my Mechanical Tools , Large Display Digital Awesome , Not Continually Lookimg for Glasses Any More , Saving Time . The Locking Set Screw Holds True From Piece to Piece for Meas ` g. Conversion in . / mm . Good Feature Also .
 I am very happy with the product . I measures inches of milimiters . Has funtions like max , min , average , tolerance , absolute and relative dimensions that I have not been used . It comes in a protective plastic box .
 The action is smooth , but as expected , an occasional re-zero is required . It will take some use before determining the durability of the accuracy , but out of the box , it appears very accurate and easy to use . At the price , one can only be surprized if the accuracy of the instrument lasts long .
 this is a great unit for the money measurements were precise and accurate return to zero after even after going out to full 6 inches the display is easy to read would recommend to anyone needing a presise caliper that does n't want to spend big bucks
 I got this to use with calibrating the cartridge on my turntable . It is very accurate and comes with a nice case as well . I 'm positive there is better out there , but for the casual user it 's great . The slider is very smooth and readings are dead on .
 The caliper come with a case an extra battery and instruction . It give pretty accurate readings and the build quality is pretty good for the price . The batteries that came with mine including the replacement seem to die out faster than I expected . The replacement I bought from cvs appears to last longer . August will be 3 years since I purchase this from amazon and it is still working today .
 I bought this unit mostly as a result of I figured I could n't lose a lot of for therefore little cash . I have since figured it had been a great deal . I even suggested my company to shop for one for the look . They were glad I told them . Everyone I even have shown this item has told me they are impressed with the quality of build and therefore the very terribly low worth . It came with everything necessary , like the onerous case -LRB- good quality -RRB- and further battery . The directions are all in English and clear . No would like to fret regarding this one . This vendor shipped my caliper on time and I got it in sensible form .
 expected quality for the price . Original battery was dead , had to use the `` extra '' battery . Seems to work fine , will do the job .
 If you consider the price these calipers are pretty good . They feel fairly sturdy and are accurate enough for what I need . I saw complaints about battery life in some of these calipers but my battery has held up well . The simple plastic case is fairly sturdy and well padded but you might need to put a rubber band around it to keep it closed if you want to throw it in a toolbox .
 For the money you ca n't really go wrong with this caliper . Its true accuracy is unknown to me , but it does repeat measurements with precision .
 I had been needing a caliper to work on projects for some time . I finally reached a point to where I could n't proceed without one . I ordered this one from Amazon and was surprized by the quality for such a low price .
 This caliper is a great product , and I would definitely recommend it to anyone . I use it for metal smithing purposes . It is easy to use and easy to understand . I found the measurements to be accurate . All around good solid piece .
 There is n't really much to say . It is a great pair of Calipers . Accurate , reliable and high quality . Definitely worth the money if you need a pair of digital calipers .
 How can you go wrong for $ 10 . The item works very good and comes with a case and extra battery but be careful the LCD will turn on if the jaws open so lock it and turn it off when in storage .
 This caliper seems to be as accurate , if not more than listed in the specs . It feels sturdy enough that I do n't feel like I 'm going to break it , and is very easy to use . The only downfall is that the `` extra '' battery needs to be used upon arrival . If you store the caliper with the battery in it , you will find a dead battery by the time you use it again . All-in-all , for the money it was a great deal .
 I do n't even remember what I paid for it . I have really been impressed with this thing . Easy to use - turns on automatically , turns off automatically , use the thumb wheel or just pull to use , can still be used even without batteries . Solid case .
 I was really impressed with the quality of this caliper and the case provided . I 've been using it quite a bit for the past few months and still have n't needed to replace the battery though they included a spare as well . A few coworkers ended up buying it based on my recommendation as well and I have n't heard any complaints yet .
 gave to my daughter for christmas she loves it . she uses it every day at work . and say it has helped her in many ways .
 I ordered this Maxwell caliper - at a very good price from an Amazon proprietor - to replace a flawed but higher priced Frankford Arsenal caliber . The previous device , even when calibrated , consistently had overestimated known .30 and .40 caliber diameters by more than 2/1000 's , no small mistake for my needs . This item appears to be the same product , battery compartment cover and all , as the Frankfort . The difference - this works perfectly and accurately ; complete with an installed battery and a spare . It is tight , easy to use and read - perfect for reloading .
 I use this tool almost as much as my tweezers and screwdrivers . It is the best insurance against making preventable mistakes !
 This caliper works great ! Love that it comes with a hard case and extra battery . It has been very accurate for me and so much easier than trying to read a standard caliper . You will not be disappointed !
 It 's apears to be a decient unit I have n't used it to meassure \ \ . . . . . . . . ... . .
 Amazing caliper for the price . I bought this for personal use as I do consulting - I compared it to the 300 caliper at work and it works exactly the same . Great buy .
 Critical measurements are necessary in reloading and this caliper does the trick . Easy to use and very accurate ! At this price you just ca n't beat it and comes with a spare battery -LRB- LR44 -RRB- . Love it !
 It works ok , some of the parts feel loose , the slider mainly , the case is easily broke . It fell from a three foot desk and a hinge broke first day I had it . Luckily the Caliper was n't in the case .
 The edges look kind of scratched up , but it works very well . I have been using it for a while now . Works great .
 Excellent caliper . I compared this caliper to my Mitutoyo and the measurements are within .001 '' of each other . The slider on the back on the caliper was a little gritty but I cleaned the groove with a Q tip and its all good . Great buy ! Highly recommended !
 I bought this tool mostly because it was on a big sale here on Amazon , without having a big purpose to use it . But I 'm sure it will become handy in all the DIY projects I 'm doing every summer around the house or with my cars.All I can say now , that for the price this tool is superb in quality and very accurate.I checked it with several objects that I had measured myself or knew the exact gauge before , and 90 % of tests it came right on point with the original measurements . The other 10 % were off by less than 0.5 mm !!! That 's great , but well that 's what it 's supposed to do right . I was just doubtfull about the craftmenship of this tool because of the super-low price I paid.It comes in a molded , black plastic case , padded insight with foam . The foam has cut outs for the spare battery -LRB- included -RRB- and maybe some small add-on 's -LRB- whatever it might be -RRB- . Overall , a great tool to have , because when you will need it there hardly anything that can substitude for it and for the price it 's just one of these Must Buy things that are good to have , even you do n't need them right now .
 I did n't expect much . It 's cheap . What I got is a very nice tool ; feels substantial , works great , nice case , extra battery . Very Happy !
 I grabbed these because they were cheap , mainly for hobby use . For ten bucks , these things do way better than expected . Play is limited to a bit of axial rotation about the slide . There are two set screws you can adjust to eliminate any play normal to the axis of the slide.I borrowed a pair of Mitutoyo 's at work and decided to compare their accuracy . These calipers were generally within a thousandth of the nicer pair , so their accuracy is well within what I need . They do not always come back to zero when I open and close them -LRB- + / - 0.001 '' -RRB- , but since they 're $ 10 I really do n't care that much . So for those of you that like things quantified , I would give them an accuracy of around + / - 0.001 '' . If you need to measure something with more accuracy , then a $ 100 pair of Mitutoyo calipers will probably suit your needs.All in all , a very decent pair of calipers for the money . Even came with an extra battery . We 'll see if these last long enough to use it ...
 I am happy that I purchased 2 each . I will give one of them to my boss for Christmas and keep one for myself.I checked it out . It works beautifully . I like the color and the nice case.I am very satisfied with this item . I did not mind paying a next day service . It came on time for Christmas .
 This is an excellent buy and is very accurate ... I can see shops buying this for all of their employees , where such a tool is needed . Definitely one of the best buys out there and one of the best purchases I ever made . I use it to size pipe both I.D. , O.D. and cell wall size for a product I manufacturer and the one I received works perfectly . Do n't let the price sway you , buy it , it 'll be the best ten bucks you 'll ever invest.I Luv Amazon ... LOL
 Every household should have one of these . You never realize just how frequently they can be used , until you have one . I 've been using it for luthier work , and in my home shop . It 's super easy to use . The included case is heavy duty . I think the accuracy is just fine for the average user . I have no reason to believe that this caliper will not last me the rest of my life -LRB- should only need to change batteries -RRB- .
 I have had this Caliper for 3 weeks and it works good and is easy to read .
 A very nice tool - regardless of price . Gives consistent readings between sessions , down to the thousandths of an inch . Buttons work well , and the auto on/off feature is nice to have.Adding this
 good price , fast shipping ! what more could you want ? it serves it 's purpose for simple around the house/shop measurements .
 dont expect it to be a really exact measurement but it works great for the typical tolerances measured on a daily basis .
 This is a really good caliper for the price . It is n't as nice as my Mitutoyo but at 1/10 the price I love it.I did have to adjust the battery contacts because the caliper would intermittently shut off while I was using it . A quick bend of the contact and it now works perfectly .
 I use this caliper to measure gemstone sizes from 2mm and up . So far , this caliper has been DEAD ON when used where I already knew the exact dimensions , and I have no reason yet to doubt the results I 've received for previously unknown measurements . For the price I bought it at , this caliper has already paid for itself and more in only a week .
 Now this is a great tool and the price was less than any other I checked out ... works great ...
 This product works well for my specific applications of measuring small items in mm 's . Its nice that it has an on/off switch as well as measuring in inches or mm 's . My husband has used it also without complaint !
 Unbelievable what a quality product this Caliper is . It even comes with 2 batteries . Awesome deal for the the price !
 Very practical caliper with the digital display and the mm/inch switch . The zeroing is also convenient for measuring differences in sizes , etc. . Also has autostart - as soon as you move it the display turns on .
 THIS DIGITAL CALIPER IS A GREAT TOOL!DISPLAY EASY TO READ , BIG NUMBERS , MM AND INCHES , INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL MEASURING JAWS , ZERO SWITCH , VERY CONFORTABLE THUMB ROLLER
 Lost my last set at the security check going thru the Hong Kong Airport . Bought three sets of this caliper to leave at different locations incase I can not carry in carry on luggage . Great tool and a even greater price . The set that was pulled from my bag in HK was Mitutoyo .
 Wow , I wish I would have bought one of these years ago . What a great little item , and a great price . Nice large display , and easily switchable between millimeters and inches , and a pretty nice case as well . And who gives you batteries these days , let alone an extra ! Fantastic . This is a no-brainer , buy it .
 It 's worth every cent for this thing , I 'm a scientific glassblower , and could n't live without it ! The case is convenient , as well as handy to keep in the tool box . I still ca n't believe the price , with the quality of this , I would 've expected a price tag of more like $ 35 .
 I got exactly what I expected from the product works just fine ! The extra battery is nice along with the plastic case .
 I had been thinking about getting one of these for a while . I like to work on old 10 speed bicycles and there can be a lot of variance in the sizing for the parts - French , British , Raleigh proprietary etc. . I went ahead and ordered this caliper and could not have been more pleased . The price was right , its very easy to use , readout is easy to see and read and the instructions are clear -LRB- not always a given -RRB- and its fit the bill perfectly . Great product
 Good accuracy and repeatable results . Quality is not great , but for the price and use I will need it is good enough .
 Very good quality , it cames with a box , extra battery , and runs very well either in cm and inches ... very good choise if you will use it as hobby .
 I was n't expecting much when I ordered these calipers . I just needed something to give me some measurements since all I had was rulers to measure by . The calipers soome to be accurate enough . I have n't had them calibrated -LRB- and they are not calibrated by the manufacturer -RRB- , but by all accounts , if it is off , it could n't be by more than a couple thousandths . They 're not real smooth to use , but I have been able to look past that.The extra battery was a nice plus , but the case is impressive . In my opinion , the $ 11 I paid for this set was worth it just to get the case . It 's a hard plastic case and I feel secure luggin my calipers around inside them.All-in-all , I have no problems using these calipers . For the price , I would recommend them to anyone that needed a pair , unless you need one for engineering that is calibrated .
 the battery died in the first week only used 3 times not sure if it was old or what i would say its worth the money if i wanted more out of one i would have paid a lot more and got a better one but i do n't work for NASA so this is fine
 No problems at all . Ranks up there with the costly ones we have at work . Good Buy .
 Reading all the reviews I expected the best maybe even more than what was advertised.I received the following :1 . The digital caliper with a battery installed2 . A spare battery3 . A plastic case4 . One page of instructionsThere was n't any1 . Certificate of calibration , catalogs , warranty , or any other paperwork included.What was right
 The build quality on this caliper is quite good -LRB- especially at the price -RRB- . Mine has no discernible play in the mechanism , came with an extra battery and a reasonably beefy plastic case , and zeros out steadily without any display jumpiness . The unit I received is branded `` Maxwell '' . Note that this caliper does * not * have fraction support in the display , and is therefore somewhat annoying to use compared to units that are only slightly more expensive.If you 're completely strapped or buying these in bulk for basic uses , you wo n't be unhappy with your purchase . If you 're a hobbyist looking for a single inexpensive but high-functionality unit , do yourself a favor and spend the extra few dollars to get one with fraction support .
 This is a decent pair , certainly not close to the Mitutoyo 's but it 's 10-15x less and does 90 % of the job . I did n't get a calibration certificate but I got the case , caliper and spare battery . If you just go to any store you 'll pay at least the same or more for a 3 '' generic caliper and for a generic 6 '' you 'll pay 25 + so this is an excellent deal for non controlled -LRB- 9001 -RRB- readings . The Carrera 's are a good low cost pair if you are doing UL/ISO regulated work . I got this for home use . It needed oiling pretty badly from the trip over the sea , and it does rub a bit when sliding on mine . Otherwise recommended !
 Super accurate . Great price . I work in body jewelry , production and sales . And this helps me ensure the customer recieves the right fitting product each time .
 have been using this for about 6 months now for relaoding . 2 of my friends -LRB- who reload also -RRB- have different ones both costing a WHOLE lot more than these . I have checked a round with mine and their high dollar calipers no difference in readings , still have the orignal battery in mine , they replace their batteries at least every 2 months . great value , especially with the extra batt . included . fast shipping Excellant Quality , Low price ca n't beat it
 Shipped within a week . Came with two batteries . Works great ! Definitely a good buy for the price . I would recommend it .
 Boxed excellently with an extra battery in a good , sturdy case . Seems like a good caliper , especially for the money !
 I would give it a 5 but I had to clean the battery it had a film on it and would n't get contact properly it keep flashing on and off other than that works fine
 It is a must have item especially to figure out thickness of items around the house or when making reqairs . I like to use it to figure out the outer and inner diamters of a specific tubing . 5 stars for coming with the extra battery .
 Very accurate , with a nice digital display . Just what I wanted . Needed a set for my reloading bench , and they are it .
 Not the best quality piece BUT it is accurate . I would purchase it again . It serves the purpose for it 's purchase
 So I bought this for my friend and he says it is working good , he receive the extra battery and case with it and the delivery time was great ...
 It is a very good product . I has been very useful , the battery lasts very long and is a good deal for the price .
 ... it has a battery issue . The battery in mine at least must be removed or it will drain quickly even with the caliper power button off . Otherwise it 's flawless and i love this thing . The review by Onyx Parrot citing it as not accurate is as dead wrong as can possibly be . I have used it on guitar strings and when i read a string like a .009 '' it literally reads that exact measurement , .009 '' , every time . Same for all the other gauges . that tells me that not only are guitar strings made very very accurately to their spec , but this caliper literally has not once been off by even one thousandth !!! Onyx Parrot should be sure before he bashes an item because when people give flawed reviews because of their personal dislike of a product , they make it harder for potential buyers to make a good decision.If MY example of this caliper is typical , your only concern is whether removing the battery after each use is too much trouble . If it 's worth the trouble to have a dirt cheap caliper that works flawlessley and is as accurate as most anyone is likely to need , then this is a great caliper to go with . If you use it daily it may be too much hassle removing the battery each time . Then again , i may simply have gotten one thats got this issue and others do n't , i do n't know . In any case you ca n't go wrong as far as accuracy and price .
 I knew what I was getting for the price , so I was not disappointed . This measured well , but the sliding mechanism is not that solid and is proned to drifting away from zero -LRB- about + / - 0.02 or 0.03 mm -RRB- when the measuring faces are completely closed -LRB- after zeroing -RRB- . This problem may not exist if you slide slowly . I did n't buy it to measure to this level of precision , so I 'm satisfied . Money well spent .
 Excelled quality for an inexpensive caliper . It has an all stainless body with a plastic gage . Measuring surfaces are stainless . Exacting measurments are good for me to visualize sizes from thousanths of an inch switched to milimeters . Many of the items I purchase , are metric . My expertise is in Thousanths . The case is cheap , but , adequately protects caliper against dropping -LRB- hard foam lined -RRB- . Thumb wheel is a little wobbly , but will wear in , with use . Reset and measurement switching is great .
 For the price this unit was exactly what I needed . Both batteries that came with it were in fine shape and the carrying case is a nice touch . I bought this for my reloading set but have found many more uses for it . Cheap and accurate what more could you ask for ?
 What can i say , the product was delivered on time and works exactly as i expected . I tried my friends caliper and realized my old caliper -LRB- which was non digital -RRB- was wayyyy outdated and very hard to read . Getting this for the price i paid was really unbelievable . It 's just what i wanted and makes measuring those things that need more accuracy than a straight one foot ruler much easier to measure . I do various things that require more than usual accuracy -LRB- without the need for micrometer grade accuracy -RRB- so this works perfect .
 For the cost , it 's a good product that does what I need it to do at the needed accuracy level . That said , the quality and build is not stellar . The finger wheel slider was extremely loose to the point that it would not move the caliper unless an undue amount of pressure was applied , which was going to annoy me to the point of not wanting to use it . I solved the problem by taking it apart and placing a small piece of rubber -LRB- cut from a grommet -RRB- underneath the wheel , which is kept firmly in place when the calipers were re-assembled . Now it works and feels almost as good as the expensive ones I use in the shop at work . Definitely worth 12 bucks if you 're willing to give it some extra attention . If not , spend the extra money and get a more expensive one .
 I purchased this to use in conjunction with my planer and drum sander to verify the thickness of materials . It works well and is easy to use . I do not have a method for verifying its accuracy down to the second or third digits , but if I close the jaws , zero it , open the jaws and then close them again it returns to zero which I assume means it is tracking properly . This has been very handy to have next to the planer and drum sander to quickly check thicknesses . I would buy it again and recommend it to others .
 This item was a great deal and its was very easy to use , excellent for measuring any small item and very accurate on reading .
 This caliper came on time and in good condition . I received the caliper , extra battery , and directions enclosed in a nice case with a soft formed interior . All the functions work great right out of the box and the measurements are right on . As stated in some other reviews , even if you do n't have an immediate need for this item , it 's a great buy and will come in handy for quite a few different applications .
 If you find yourself on a rare occasion to need a precision measurement this is a great tool to have in the drawer . There is a bit more slop in this tool that more expensive units , and certainly if you were trying to make a living with this tool I 'd think it would disappoint , but if you 're just wanting to take an occasional measurement on your own mechanical projects I think it 's hard to go wrong here . The case is nicer than I expected for the price , and they even include an extra battery to keep in the case .
 Very accurated and heavy duty . Did n't contain certification but compared readings with a much more expensive model and right on
 I mean ... c'mon . For around $ 15 you get a stainless steel caliper with digital readout in either inches or millimeters , that : - is pretty darn accurate . I do n't have a certified gauge block to check it against , but I did measure a few things I know the dimensions of , and it seems to be right on the money . - is easy to use and easy to read . The digital numbers are nice and big . It is easy to switch between SAE and Metric with the simple touch of a button . There is also a ZERO button for initial setting , and the ON/OFF button . - comes with two batteries , one preinstalled and one spare . - includes a decent plastic case with foam cut-out insert . - holds its calibration well . I zeroed it before the first use , and after a week of use measuring different things , it is still holding a perfect zero . I 'm impressed.Would I use this for precision machine or millwork ? Probably not . But for everyday use in the shop it 's great . Sometimes you just need to measure something that only a caliper can do properly . At this price , it is a no-lose purchase . Keep this caliper in the everyday toolbox or drawer , and keep your good expensive one locked away for special use .
 Has a good solid feel and works well . Except that the thumb roll has noticeable play . It does n't hurt the operation of the instrument , it just spoils the otherwise solid feel .
 Bought this as a loaner . It is just as good as units costing 2 -3 times as much under fancy brand name . Measurements were right on when checked against a set of gauge blocks . Did n't rate it 5 because the battery that was installed in it was dead .
 Came in time and works good , but the battery already inside the calipers was almost dead . Glad they put in the extra battery .
 Sure it 's not a 100 dollar caliper but perfect for the intended use . The price is the best -LRB- do n't care if it gets lost or stolen -RRB- . Came with nice case and extra battery . Works well . . so far .
 All the batteries supplied with this was too low in charge -LRB- it came with a set of spare one and a set installed -RRB- . It took me a while to figure out why i kept getting inaccurate readings , different even when measuring the same item . After replacing the batteries the measurement readings were much more stable . I compared this to a mm ruler I have and it seemed to be accurate . It measures in millimeters and inches . This is a great unit , for the price it can not be beat !
 Years ago I purchased an analog caliper for many times what this one sells for . I was surprised to find the caliper housed in a case with a cut-out in the foam to protect it from shock . An extra battery was also a nice touch . The body of the caliper is made of machined stainless steel . Accuracy if surprisingly good -LRB- see specs on Amazon -RRB- . This device should be fine for all of my projects and last a long time . I am very happy with this purchase .
 Sin problemas , para mi trabajo que me ha servido much&iacute;simo , es un alivio tremendo porque uso lentes y como me cuesta leer los calibradores .
 I have been using master craftsman tools for over 40 years . I found it hard to believe that for under $ 20 you could find an instrument that could do what some of my $ 100 instruments could do . I am impressed .
 If you find yourself on a rare occasion to need a precision measurement this is a great tool to have in the drawer . There is a bit more slop in this tool that more expensive units , and certainly if you were trying to make a living with this tool I 'd think it would disappoint , but if you 're just wanting to take an occasional measurement on your own mechanical projects I think it 's hard to go wrong here . The case is nicer than I expected for the price , and they even include an extra battery to keep in the case .
 I was surprised at the quality when I received the caliper . It is sturdy and very easy to use . The digital display is easy to read and it seems to be very accurate . The extra battery is nice also .
 Great price , very good quality , packaging was secure and robust . The item did take a little longer than I wuld have liked for it arrive but it was free .
 Just got this yesterday , and decided to test it out on some things that I know the dimensions of , and this was spot on each time . Very simple to figure out , can lock the slide in place , easy to zero at any point . If you have any use at all for a caliper of this sort , this one is worth getting .
 These are n't great calipers but for the price , they 're fine . The precision probably is n't top notch , but you 'd use a micrometer for that anyway . They 're durable enough when kept in their case that I have no problem throwing them into a backpack . They wo n't compare to a nice pair of Browne & Sharpe Calipers or something on that caliper but they 're good for the price .
 The item shipped as described and came quickly , great product . very precise and the digital readout works like a charm .
 I used it to check my rounds . It 's just one of those tools you cant do with out . the case it came with fit nice to protect it . I will tell my buddies about the great deals
 I have been using this for a couple of months now to design jewelry . I measure all of the findings to make notations for my suppliers . It has worked great . I love the auto shut off because I would never remember to turn it off .
 These calipers are really great for just around the house but they are cheaply made . I did n't pay very much for them so that would explain it but they work well and come with a decent case !
 I imagine that the accuracy is n't high precision so do n't go out and try to build a space shuttle with it but it is probably accurate enough for most home use . The slide is a little rough . I use a Starrett every day at work but I would n't pay that kind of money to measure stuff around the house . Measure bolts , pipes , tubes , nuts or whatever . I recommend this item , unless you are building a space shuttle .
 Out of the box , it 's a bit sluggish on the dial . With a bit of Teflon lubrication it slides better . I had to re-zero it fairly often before.Being a new tool , I felt the need to check it very often . In doing so , discovered it was not reliable after 1 minute . Maybe the batteries ? It came with 1 extra -LRB- thank you -RRB- , tried it , same results ... I have changed the battery type to a silver oxide battery , and have way better results . And consistency.Overall , I got a cheap digital caliper . Which is what I was looking for . But it really ended up being a pretty good instrument after some tweaks . Changed my previous rating to a 4 now .
 I use this LCD digital caliper just about every day I start a new project . For fine tuning my table saw or measuring the thickness of the wood . Wish the battery lasted longer though .
 I 'm not certain if some people received products from a different manufacturer or lot , but my product is excellent . It is very sturdy , strong construction and has tested as being accurate in it 's measuring ability . My original battery arrived working as well . I 've had no issues with it at all . For the price , this thing was a steal . I love having the nice case as well . * note-it only comes with instructions and an extra battery , not a certificate like another post listed .
 I bought this as a gift so I 'm not sure how well it will be liked but it arrived in good condition and seems to be in working order .
 I just got this today as an Xmas present . I also got a feeler guage set too.First impression was that the caliper seemed well built . Not cheap feeling or looking at all . Does n't look or feel like a $ 10 caliper . I tested its accuarcy using the feeler guage set . .025 -.010 was perfect . .008 -.005 was off by .001 Past that , the caliper was unusable , but that level of performance still far exceeds my needs and expectations . Anyone that needs a caliper to measure something smaller than .005 needs to spend more than $ 10 . I use mine primarily to measure brake components , set up guitars , and calibrate power tools . This caliper is MORE than capable of these functions . I 'm 100 % satisfied .
 I purchased this battery operated caliper for occasional use in measuring . In no way am I using machinist standards or using this on a daily basis . That 's why I chose to opt away from Starrett until I could really need a more durable and reliable one.Being made in China , I was n't expecting much , especially at the price . The slide moves somewhat roughly , but still smoothly enough to make good measurements . Everything you see in the picture is accurate , except one battery is already in the caliper . The case and foam are also nice , a bit better than I was expecting . Overall , I like the caliper for what it is , but I do n't expect it to last too long.BUYER BEWARE
 Not perfect , but for about twelve bucks , it 's just what I needed . Mine came with the case , two batteries , and instructions - and the rail was black . It was missing one of the hinge pins for the case , so I drilled out the holes at that end to receive a wire brad for a hinge pin -LRB- spending eight bucks for a piece of piano wire that fit the existing holes would have been silly -RRB- . I put one of the batteries in , and was happy to see that it gave the same readings as a micrometer I have , and that even running it out to 6 '' and back , it returned to zero . All good so far , but when I opened the case a week later to use it , tried to turn it on and found the battery dead . Cheap battery ? At least there was a a spare , so I put that in , and it worked as before . Turned it off , put it away - then had one of those thoughts , and reopened the case to find the caliper had turned itself back on . Turns out the buttons are a little too prominent , so when the case is closed , it can press on the on-off button just enough to turn it on . Kind of a nuisance to remove the battery each time , so I whittled a switch guard out of a sheet of acrylic plastic I had -LRB- see photo , if it posts -RRB- . Looks good , works good - but if you do n't want to do that sort of fiddling around , you might rate it a couple of stars lower . It 's Chinese , so you are the QA department , and the one you get might or might not work as well as mine .
 This product does n't have the grace and prestige of a Starrett or Mitutoyo -LRB- ? -RRB- but it is plenty accurate enough for an engineer checking parts and test stand work . The one button metric to inch is very useful too . Well worth the price .
 Muchas gracias , el calibardor me pareci&oacute; fabuloso , es una herramienta que me servir&aacute; bastante en mi labor como profesor de matem&aacute;ticas
 This is a good micrometer . You would not want to use it for something that really needs to be completely + / - .003 However , if you need to get in the ball park maybe even behind home plate these will do . I am guessing you could do worse , you could do better but for the price these will get the job done for most people .
 I have a set of these calipers . Well they look identical but I suspect the exact Chinese vendor changes from time to time . Either way , I have tested mine again gauge standards . They meet the rated accuracy . They are n't the smoothest slides but with a small touch of oil -LRB- Very small touch -RRB- they actuate quite nicely . The measuring surfaces are good but not perfect . They are MUCH better than the calipers I recently bought from harbor freight . Those had only one of 4 measuring surfaces properly machined.All in all these are n't high end but they are decent enough . The short battery life is the only draw back . I addressed that by buying a 20 pack of batteries -LRB- cheap off Amazon -RRB- and removing the battery when not in use for a long period of time.For the price they are hard to beat . If you have even the slightest need for calipers -LRB- but not enough to buy more expensive models -RRB- these are a good value .
 very happy worked straight out of the box , no dead batteries as other buyers claimed.so far it works and is very accurate i like the fact that it comes with a spare battery
 Based on some of the low numbered reviews I felt I was taking a chance ordering this , but have been quite pleased with it . For the price it 's a very nice tool and is a good value for the money.I should mention that I received no spare battery . There was no battery in the tool and only one in the case . Not a big deal , but a bit disappointing.The tool itself is well made and well calibrated . I have tested against several known size devices and have gotten precise readouts . I have not encountered and of the rough or sharp edges mentioned in other reviews . Everything is smooth and moves freely . The measuring edges of the caliber faces are a bit sharp , but they are supposed to be . That 's part of good tool design , precise measurements require a knife edge at the measurement surface . Both the printed scale and the digital readout have provided consistent , quite satisfactory measurements.It works like it supposed to and so far has not given me any problems . It 's not designed for the 24x7 use cycle of a precision machine ship , but for most contractor or home handyman occasional precision measurement needs , its just fine .
 For $ 12 . xx I was mildly skeptical on what I was going to receive , but the reviews were decent and I needed a cheap caliper . I also wanted digital one and this is the cheapest digital one I could find anywhere . Most other calipers I was looking at almost $ 30 then tax -LRB- or shipping if ordering online -RRB- . Well this thing was also Prime shipped so I got it in 2 days with free shipping.Anyways , on to the actual caliper : It 's made out of metal and feels pretty strong . Again , for $ 12 I would n't have been surprised if it felt flimsy and maybe not built to tight tolerances . This is not the case.Came with a spare battery AND a case!It seems to measure out very accurate , but then again , I 'm not building missiles so I do n't need to measure to 1/10 ,000 of an inch . I just use it to be a little more accurate than a ruler . One example would be measuring the inside bore of a carburetor.I bought it last summer and have actually ended up using it alot more than I thought I would . I 'm very pleased with my purchase .
 I remember when you had to spend big money to get something like this . I just needed to measure some wire diameters and this worked perfectly , what a steal at this price , it works just fine .
 I bought these calipers because I needed to be able to accurately measure the size of things , mostly diameters . You ca n't easily use a ruler to measure diameters with any accuracy . This is one of the most inexpensive calipers/micrometers you can buy . It has an English/metric button and it came with not one but TWO batteries and a nice plastic case with foam to protect the tool from damage . The display is large and easy to read . These calipers have a decent heft to them and do n't feel flimsy . I have no idea how accurate these are , but I did n't purchase them to measure to the nearest 0.001 . I 've had them for six months and I seem to be picking them up to measure all kinds of things around the house . Very handy . Love them . I do n't see how you can go wrong buying these calipers at this price !
 What can I say . It is simple , cheap and does what it was designed to do . My favorite combination.I using this in my RC Heli hobby and the result are quite accurat .
 This is a very good caliper , it comes with a spare battery , nice molded case , a very modest instruction sheet . Very easy to use . Cons
 Checked against a case length gauge that was machined to 1.760 and was right on , I guess they give weird readings when the battery gets low from other reviews . Its as good as can be expected for the price range . Battery cover was stiff but managed to remove it by sliding down about 1/8 inch then pulled out to expose battery
 This tool is very accurate , affordable and I use it all the time when I reload to verify each shell .
 I recommend everyone to buy because besides come within the promised time , my expectations were confirmed with the quality and finish of the piece .
 Received the item in perfect condition from HobbyToolSupply . From what I recall the item came wrapped with sufficient bubble wrap that was firmly wound around the case that the calipers came in.It was priced at $ 14.94 at the time I purchased it on 2/16/09 . Current price as of 10/01/09 from HTS is $ 11.89 . From the comparisons I 've made the measurements have always been spot on . As the type of person who is constantly making , modifying , and fixing things this tool has seen a lot of use in the time I 've had it . Due to the cheap price and where it 's made -LRB- China ... EEEK !!! -RRB- , I did n't have high expectations . I was very happy to find the accuracy and construction is of a satisfactory standard for a serious DIYer such as myself . This tool does n't have a flimsy `` I paid 15 bucks for this thing and it shows '' feel to it when I pick it up -LRB- it is largely stainless steel afterall -RRB- . There does n't appear to be an official model # marked on this item or the instructions that came with it . There was , however , a generic white sticker on the case that reads `` 784EC '' . I 'm the type of person who generally avoids low priced tools like the plague because 99 times out of a hundred you end up with a piece of junk . This has been one of the very few exceptions for me . I 'm glad I gave these low priced calipers a shot first before buying something very expensive . It not only saved me from paying a lot of money but a scolding from my wife !
 I stumbled upon this a few weeks ago , and bought it judging by the good reviews . That and I hated reading the vernier calipers in the machine shop in the college I go to.I read more reviews and my confidence slipped , some seemed fabricated or just not accurate . For example the top comment mentions a certificate of calibration that does not come with this device.When it arrived , I was super surprised . It is awesome ! For the $ 11.50 I paid , it was worth every penny.The caliper came with : - Hard Plastic Box with foam cutaway for the caliper-Digital Caliper -LRB- duh -RRB- - Instruction and features pamphlet/paper . Pros : - Build Quality - surprisingly sturdy caliper for $ 12-Accuracy - it can measure with a resolution of .0005 in . I tested several objects with a tried-and-tested micrometer , and it was accurate , occasionally slipping by a thousandth - and that goes for larger distances as well , using some of the larger micrometers in the shop.-Price - at less that $ 12 , it 's not comparable to the best money can buy , but the value is incredible.-Digital display - no more guessing which line lines up better than the other.-Zero button - Useful for resetting the caliper , also being able to zero the readout anywhere is great.-mm / in button - if I ever need to measure something in the metric system , I just need to press a button -LRB- resolution to .01 mm -RRB- - Plastic box - good quality , keeps the caliper from bumping around , or getting dirty when not in use -LRB- just do n't open it upside-down , or the caliper will fall out and possibly turn on accidentally.-Extra battery-Automatically turns on when you move the jaw-No `` Made in China '' sticker or wording on the caliper , even though it was made in China-Did I mention price?Cons : - Stiff movement - takes a good deal of force to move the measuring jaw , meaning setting the caliper to , for example , 2.000 '' is no easy task -LRB- though that is n't really the purpose of such a caliper anyway -RRB- The biggest problem occurs when measuring , since some force needs to be applied to get the jaw to correctly read the measurement . It 's not a lot , but the first impression is that you have to put too much pressure on the measured object . In other words , it takes getting used to . For this price though , I can not complain , it is inherent in the design . - Sometimes the jaw `` slips , '' meaning when you return the jaw to zero it does not read zero . This is inherent of digital calipers , especially inexpensive ones . If you need an accurate measurement , zero the caliper before measuring . And always measure twice before you cut , this caliper does not come with an undo button.-Build quality - This was a pro , and it still is , I just have some complaints
 My evaluation is simple
 Digital Calipers for under 10 bucks ? Seriously ? Nice . However , considering it 's 2011 and digital everything is everywhere , and it 's pretty cheaply constructed in China , I think it 's a fair deal . Until recently , I 've mostly used my Helios Dial Calipers , which are made by ze Germans , and of a much finer finish . The finish -LRB- or lack there of -RRB- on these new digitals , is obviously cheep and flimsy , BUT as far as accuracy is concerned , so-far they 're on-par with the Germans . They do come with a case , and extra battery though , so I figure , if I baby 'em a bit they 'll last me through a few years of moderate use . I do n't like that the power-button is n't recessed , but , again , it 's got a case , and if you put them back , the button wo n't get pressed . The Caliper locking screw on my copy is a little rough , and slightly bent , but it does n't detract from the slide or lock 's functionality . The `` USB Port '' really is n't anything worth mentioning , since , the appropriate socket was n't soldered in , on my copy at least . As with just about any machine tool , I recommend hitting it with some form of machine oil or rust inhibitor . For ten clams , I was n't expecting the world , and my expectations were pretty much met . Reasonably accurate digital calipers for under 10 bucks ... Acceptable.Pros : Under 10 dollarsReasonable accuracy -LRB- so far they 're as accurate as my Helios Dial Calipers -RRB- Comes with a padded caseCons : Very cheaply made , black plastic `` head '' looks like one good drop will break itUnprotected -LRB- raised -RRB- power buttonCame with a bent slide-lock knobBottom Line : If you want German level quality , look elsewhere , if you want a cheep digital caliper , with big , easy to read numbers , and reasonably accuracy , these are a fair deal .
 something as inexpensive works so well . Only had these for a short time but they are easy to use and work as advertised .
 sometimes i need to design templates to hold coins . i got tired of using my old , partly rusted caliper from Sears . i 've only had a chance to test it out with a few coins but so far it is accurate to within .02 mm ! i ca n't belive -LRB- at this time -RRB- it was only 11 bucks ! a coworker saw it and instantly became jealous . i love that it comes in a well-built HARD plastic case with an extra battery . it even has a line-out slot for something . -LRB- no , i did n't read the instructions . -RRB- if you need to replace you old busted caliper , i would suggest doing it with this .
 They delivered when they said they would -LRB- and quickly -RRB- , the product arrived in great condition , with easy to follow instructions . Best price we found ! Calipers were accurate and are very useful !
 My husband is using the caliper to measure his wood working projects . The caliper allows him to make sure that his wood working items are the exact same size on each end . He tells me that he likes it .
 I bought this caliper because I bought an electric helicopter and there are certain components that have to be put to precision . This item brings two battery , instruction and the case . It is really a very useful tool and economic with relation to others calipers . I recommend this tool a hundred percent.RS .
 I have had this caliper for about 7 months now . For my purposes I have been very happy with it . I needed the tips to be a little finer to get into tight spaces so I used a heatless stone to grind down the tips to make them more fine . I do not need it to be very accuate and 6 inches was a little long for me -LRB- wish I had gotten the 4 inches -RRB- . I recently had to change the battery - but it came with a replacement . Overall - happy with my purchase and the deal I got !
 I am in the lumber business and people pay $ 60 for this same exact item locally . It is made in china , but that is the only way to get a sub $ 10 caliper . Overall I am very happy
 Great tool for the money . Nice case . Extra battery . Gets the job done .
 When shopping online for a digital caliper , I came across this one and it has turned out to be a great little tool for quick accurate measurements . I would buy this one again if needed , and recommend it .
 This digital caliper is quite well made for the price , and surprisingly accurate as well . The very nice protective padded hard case is also a nice feature . I would recommend this caliper to anyone needing high accuracy without spending much more . It 's solid , it 's accurate , it 's a good bargain !
 Checked around before purchasing , this was the best price and shipping . Very pleased with quality and features , price was way less than similar offerings . Shipping was faster than expected . However they died after about 6 months and even the included extra battery would n't revive them .
 This is a quality burr that works really well on common steel . I only buy double cut , because the single cut burrs bounce and vibrate . If a burr bounces , it will chip it 's own cutting edges off . Use with a die grinder that spins from 16,000 to 22,000 rpm . These SAIT burrs are top quality and will hold up to heavy use .
 I was just needing some sturdy , basic , 1 prong hooks . I could n't believe how hard they were to come by since I needed them to be short in length to hang a storage device on my closet door . These were inexpensive and very sturdy !
 I have one of these that I picked up a while ago to carry in my purse . It is sooo handy ! I use it every time I go to use a public restroom that does n't have a coat/purse hook and you can hang your purse on the back of the movie theater seat in front of you -LRB- most of the time -RRB- . Also , I find that it comes in handy when out and about . A club I was at with several of my girls had a partial glass wall around the dance floor . I just put the hook on the top of the glass wall and hung my purse , my coat and another girl 's purse in sight while we danced . Well worth the price . I need to go ahead and get another in case I loose mine .
 When you use washers with rivets practice . It 's harder than just a rivet . But that will make a connection much stronger and last longer . I made a 40gal water heater stand 27x18 using rivets and washers . Those stainless washers and rivets will outlast heater and me ... . Amen .
 I have a special need for a stainless steel # 10 fender washer that 's 3/4 '' OD . It 's a good buy , and just what I needed .
 Great product ... . fyi make sure you get the arbor for it . Used for countertop t molding istallation . Not sure about the longevity of it , on used for one job so far .
 They fit my door well , and it 's still easy to close the door . They 're strong enough to hold my canvas organizers loaded w / papers & folders . What more can I say ? It works !
 Harvey A-6 Medium Bodied ABS Cement , BlackI was unable to find any ABS cement at local hardware and plumbing stores . Aco , Lowe 's , Home Despot , and even a specialty plumbing store -LRB- that was touted by all professional plumbers as the bee 's knees for plumbing supplies -RRB- had no clue what ABS was or why it needed cement . I did some research and apparently ABS piping was not really used past the 1960s with some exceptions . PVC and CPVC took the place of ABS , hence why PVC and CPVC cement is more popular . Oatey does make an all-purpose cement that is advertised as being compatible with ABS , however my intended application was different . The all-purpose cement does not contain ABS resin , and instead contains PVC and CPVC resin which can contaminate the ABS material.I needed an ABS cement that had both acetone and MEK because these tend to melt/dissolve ABS plastic . In addition , ABS cement also contains ABS resin which is useful for building new ABS structure . Motorcycle bodywork is made with ABS plastic , and as I have found out , damaged ABS bodywork can be repaired using just acetone , MEK , or a combination with ABS cement . It is not an adhesive but rather it allows the ABS plastic to fuse together again.After repairing a cracked front mudguard/fender using just 100 % acetone , I used the Harvey ABS cement to build up a few layers and to fill in some cracks on the fender . After waiting a few minutes , the acetone and MEK evaporated and the material solidified.The Harvey can was difficult to open at first , and the brush is really oversized in my opinion . I just needed a 4 ounce can , but no one had it in stock and ready to ship or purchase off the shelf . Amazon came to the rescue with this stuff in stock and eligible for Prime.Overall
 Great wall mount , very easy to install and packaged with compete set of 4 different size screws for all monitor applications .
 I bought the 2 inch bit to install RG6 and Cat 6 in our new home . The bore cuts very well , however the Makita 18V lithium cordless drill did not have enough power to force the bit through after the feed screw took hold . My solution was to drill a 3/8 '' pilot hole for the feed screw , then it worked fine . I 'm sure it would have worked alot better with a more powerful drill that was n't cordless . As it was , the WoodOwl made quick work of most of the holes and helped my installation job move along . I would recommend it if you have the right drill .
 Shipped :3 / 8 '' -16 7/8 '' length 100 count @ $ 1.65 . Package was labeled :1 / 4 '' -20 , 7/8 '' Length -LRB- Pack of 100 -RRB- Needed this size so am OK with it.Thanks ... Ken
 Heavy , rugged , precision hardware , and priced better than I could find anywhere else . A true bargain .
 This is a nice box of screws . I needed just this right size for some paintball applications . All the other have too wide a head to allow it to set in some recessed parts . The screws come in the box & have a thin layer of oil over each of the screws to help preserve them over time til they are ready for use .
 These not only look good but they are strong . I 'd buy these again for a future project that needed a decent quality bolt .
 These were the PERFECT match for the screws I needed for my old Atari Battlezone arcade machine handles . I do n't know if anyone else on the plant will need to know that , but if so , get these ! You will not find these in your local brick hardware store , trust me , I spent hours searching .
 Best price I have found and the screws did the job ! they seem hi quality metal and more than good enough for my needs .
 This screw was a great replacement for the screws that came with the Weaver scope mount . They were long enough to work with the NEF Pardner pump mounting . I am thoroughly happy with this purchase .
 Online metals is easy to order and deal with . Prices better than others I found with similar products.A 1/2 x 5 x 96 inch aluminum bar was $ 53.00 , but $ 57.00 elsewhere .
 These bits were absolutely amazing for both the price and the packaging . The wooden storage box keeps the bits and all the various pieces nicely organized and I know where to turn to when I need a tapered pilot hole . Some bit of marking to more easily distinguis the different sizes would have beeen nice , but overall for the quality , and price , of the item I think it 's great !
 I bought this wall mount and it fits the TV great . The only problem was if you want to tilt the monitor you either need a very long screwdriver or small hands . I was lucky my son was here and he could help me . So far so good and the price was right .
 Product is fine , nothing special , though these rods are not clean there is quite a bit of grease on 'em . However , the packaging and shipping of these to me deserves some comment . I ordered quantity 4 , each one came in a separate FedEx package , and each package is a giant cardboard tube about 2 '' diameter with 1/4 '' thick walls , inside each tube is stuffed with paper , and then another smaller plastic tube that contains the part.It will take me about an hour of work just to handle , unpack , cut up the packaging with a hacksaw -LRB- tough stuff and too big for the bin -RRB- ... would have been faster to drive to a warehouse on the edge of town where they sell stuff like this in bulk.Amazon / SmallParts -- please ship your stuff in a more sensible way .
 Purchased this indicator for use in industrial environment . I work for a contract company doing machine tool repair , accuracy is a must . Most indicators with this degree of of read only have .050 '' to .060 '' of total travel . With a throw of .500 '' this lends itself to many more and varied situations . I have no complaints and am well satisfied with my purchase .
 good quality , arrived on time , price was good -LCB- as cheap as other sellers , cheaper than some -RCB- , would like to see better photos with ads
 The company sent the product in a very timely manner . I was very pleased with them .

 This tubing is great . It telescopes with the diameters above and below it in size . Amazon had it for a great price too .
 This is very good quality tubing . The tolerances are rather tight . I have bought quite a few different sizes of this stuff and it has been very consistent . The length is always over spec by at least 1/4 '' and usually 1/2 '' . I do n't use this in the `` telescoping '' mode so I am not able to comment on that . Good stuff !!
 Used it on my 1915 Evinrude to replace the original brass tiller handle . Worked great . I 'll probably be buying more for my other antique engines .

 This is a decent indicator and does get the job done on many levels , but for a professional machinist , inspector or other you might look into Interapid , Brown & Sharpe , or Starrett . Reason being as stated in another review , the `` dial '' is almost all plastic - plastic lens is held on with an o-ring . I know for the same reason as the other poster - burst of air . It did go back together , VERY CAREFULLY mind you , but I felt kinda burned after that incident.Old Mitutoyo 's are a metal body , so a used one would be a fine choice or spend a couple bucks more for higher quality . For the price I paid , I expected a bit more but mine is still in use and reading accurately . I will say , any indicator I purchase in the future will be of higher end from now on though .
 The good :1 . Very good repeatability & accuracy -LRB- but not as good as Brown & Sharpe BesTest series -RRB- . Keep in mind that this dial test indicator -LRB- DTI -RRB- only reads accurately when the pointer is parallel to the measuring surface . In other words , the measuring force must be at 90 degrees from the work surface . This is the same as most DTIs except Interapid and certain Starrett models , which reads accurately when the pointer is at 12-15 degrees to the work surface . But then again , most users of DTIs are using them for comparative measurements only .2 . Tilted dial makes it easier to read .3 . Very clear/crisp markings/graduations .4 . Somewhat low measuring force -LRB- but not as low as Interapid .0005 '' series -RRB- .5 . Long range as Interapid -LRB- .06 '' - better than Brown & Sharpe BesTest series but not as long as my Compac 213GLA , which has a whopping .120 '' range -RRB- . As with all multiple-revolution DTIs , the longer the range , the less accurate they become .6 . Good craftsmanship -LRB- except the bezel -RRB- .7 . 3 dovetail mounts makes it a more versatile DTI . My horizontal Compacs only have 2 of them .8 . Anti-magnetic property . Unlike Compacs , BesTests or Interapids , this indicator is truly unaffected by magnets . There was a time when the only measurement I was able to take was to stick a very strong , flat rare-earth magnet to the part and measured the part using the edge of the magnet . This Mitutoyo needle was the only one that was n't sucked into the magnet . Interapid , BesTest and Compac needles was n't able to do this . Seems like the needle was made out of non-magnetic metals -LRB- 3 series stainless steel ? -RRB- The bad :1 . Bulky - bigger body than most Swiss-made DTIs -LRB- except vertical Compac models -RRB- .2 . PLASTIC BEZEL !!! While this make bezel replacement a breeze , it also make the bezel a lot more prone to breakage . Also , the bezel comes off too easily . A blow from the air-gun @ 90PSI is enough to knock it right off the dial face .3 . Solid stems . You wo n't be able to swivel the supplied stems to the angles that you want to use this DTI . Of course there are work-arounds but it would be nice if a swivel stem is supplied as standard.All in all , a very good DTI set at a good price -LRB- from Amazon - No tax to California -RRB- . I 've only had this for about 6 months with sporadic uses . Will update this later if something comes up .

 This is a really nice trash can and the automatic opening is great , BUT ... it is advertised as 13 gallons in the main heading and 12.6 gallons in the smaller print . It is acually 42 LITERS , which works out to just over 11 GALLONS . I was a little disappointed that I gave up some volume over my last trash can . That means that I will have to empty it more ofter , of course .
 We bought this trash can for our new house one year ago . It has worked perfectly until about a month ago . The open mechanism has become sluggish and now it really does not work any more . But , I found a replacement lid on another web site . -LSB- ... -RSB- I think we will buy the replacement lid . I like that it is rectangular and it is very nice looking .
 The garbage can has a really nice sensor on it . We got the garbage can around the time we got married so it has a lot of sentimental value to us . But really , it is the best garbage we have EVER used and it 's a sweet deal for only $ 71 . Life is great with this garbage can .
 We have loved this trash can for over two years - this morning the hinge broke for no apparent reason and I have been searching for a way to get a replacement lid . The original batteries are still working , no problems with it until today . We bought ours at Costco , so doubt I 'll get help there . The internet search has not turned up any way to reach the manufacturer . I do n't mind that it holds a little less than the bag size.Nine Stars DZT-42-1 Stainless-Steel Infrared 11-Gallon Trash Can

 I do n't know if the other reviewer even used it . But I picked up a box from Lowe 's -LRB- for $ 10 -RRB- on recommendation by Alton Brown . I use them to replace Brawney paper towels in the kitchen . I 've used them for everything from drying hands , cleaning surfaces to reoiling my cutting blocks/boards with food safe oil.It 's way tougher than Brawney paper towles -LRB- I used to use select-a-size -RRB- and more absorbant . You can do a lot of scrubbing . Only after major scrubbing does any lint start to appear . Way after a regular paper towel would start , though . Highly recommended for kitchen use.I would like to find a dispenser to put these in and hang it on my kitchen wall above the sink .
 We recently came to know about these rags . They are SO useful ! In many instances , paper towels no matter how great a quality , just wo n't do the job . These rags are perfect for cleaning up messes on the hard floor . We use one of these to 3-4 paper towels sheets .
 I was looking for some heavy duty rags that were disposable . . and came across the Rags-in-a-Box product . . I would describe these as paper towels on steroids -LRB- without the negative side effects like enlarged breasts , acne and violent temper , which is happens a lot with the `` other '' brands of rags -RRB- . Our housekeeper uses them and has no complaints.So for those on the fence about buying this product , the product is as advertised . .200 rags in the box ... does the job . . mission accomplished .
 Very convenient . Provides decent service for a piece of paper . And it is easy to keep around where it is easy to retrieve .
 These rags are probably the some of the best things I 've ever found for cleaning , polishing , drying , and using for about a thousand other purposes.They 're extremely tough , and do n't tear easily -LRB- probably 10x stronger than a standard paper towel -RRB- , so they 're great for wiping down rough surfaces -LRB- like metal , rubber , concrete , etc. -RRB- , and for laying down under a project to make sure screws and other loose bits do n't go wandering off.They absorb as much as a hand towel , so they 're great for sopping up messes , drying things , and placing under leaky things to catch drips.I 've used shop towels for staining , polishing , drying , cleaning , mopping , and dusting , and this box of 200 is good for at least 2-3 months in my usage . I bought a box for my garage and one for my workshop in the basement , and I use them frequently . Amazon offers a pretty good deal -- it 's about the same price here as it is at a local hardware store , and Prime shipping makes it a no-brainer .
 These lint free paper towels/rags are great . We keep the box in the garage and use them for quick spills , clean ups , wiping excess oil , glue , paint , etc. . It 's better than having to wash rags .
 I bought a box of these elsewhere on an impulse . Now , I find that they are actually cheaper than Basics type regular paper towels , as they are reusable . I have used them with various hydrocarbon solvents and they hold up very well . I also found them great for rubbed finishes , such as wood stains .
 got these as a gift for my greasemonkey father and he loves them . great for when you 're working with lots of grease or oil .
 Thanks to endcap placement in Home Depot , this is a very popular product . If it is really lint free , then it can be used to stain cabinets .
 This was the most economical way to buy this material , a great price combined with free shipping beat all the competition by a large margin.The only drawback is I do n't think Amazon stocks this size any longer .
 I use this product to cover my metal flower baskets that hang in my garden . I wish that it covered better and I did n't have to spray so many coats . Very time-consuming and uses product up quickly . However , does the job and I will purchase again .
 I used this spray on flexible plastic to seal a headlight connector on my truck that kept getting water in it . Product did a perfect job ! A week later I had to change out the bulb because I put electrical tape on the edge of the bulb and I had to unscrew the connector with the plastidip sprayed on it . I had no problem breaking the seal . Then I sprayed more plastidip on the connector and the seal has been watertight ever since !
 I used this stuff to change the color of my car emblems , , like how people do with the black . Did n't was n't black , because Camrys come with black badge nowadays . Just sprayed onto emblem , and peel away from sections you do n't want it -LRB- paint -RRB- .

 This material is hiighly reflective and increases my Honda 750 ACE 's visibility at night . However , if this is placed at an angle other than 90 degrees to the viewer the visibility is diminished a great deal . There is enough material to highlight more than one bike . You need a utility knife to cut this material , but it is easy to work with and comes with good instructions . Would have given a 5 rating if reflectivity was greater at a viewing angle of less than perpendicular . I think this is a good deal and would purchase again for safety 's sake . Shipping was very fast and all was as described .
 First I would like to say that the shipping on this item was outstanding . I received my item within 3 days after placing the order . Kudos to BikerHiway . Now for the review.The black reflective tape works as good as can be expected . It is BLACK , therefore it will not reflecte as much light as does white reflective tape . The same holds true for the Red reflective tape and any other non-white colors . I digress . The black tape does reflect light and is virtually unseen on black items . I have a black motorcycle and placed a few strips of this material at key spots and to the novice , would go unnoticed during the day . I used this on fiberglass and metal and the the material was easiy to apply ... just clean the spot first . I am not sure how well it will stick on soft items , such as saddlebags or seats.I would but this item again when needed . This is easily cut with sharp sissors .
 Product works great as advertised . I am a biker and applied it to my helmet to enhance my night visibility . Being that my helmet is black the tape is aesthetically compatible while still being highly reflective at night . Delivery also was timely . Good stuff !
 Works as advertised an I would order it again . Will save my life someday . I recommend it to any one
 Put this all over my bike , been on it for over a year and has n't even begun to peel or bubble . would buy again for sure .
 High visibility is a priority for riders especially at night and these stickers allow this in a more inconspicuous manner -LRB- as long as you have a black or dark area to attach them too -RRB- . Works well anywhere you want to be illuminated by oncoming lights . Picture in the example is not exaggerated these are good quality reflectors .
 Quick shipping , no issues . I put it on the back of my helmet - it 's easy to cut and flexible enough that it can be stretched a little to match the curves better . Shining a flashlight from about 20 feet away in a dark room makes it light up , I have n't tested it under car headlights yet . It disappears well enough in daylight , but you can still see it 's there so do n't expect it to vanish completely . It has n't been on long enough to see how it 'll hold up over time , but so far I like it .
 This product is wonderful ! I ran out of the tape before I ran out of places/things to apply it to . As other reviewers have stated it does not reflect as much when viewed straight on , AT CLOSE RANGE , but when viewed at over 100 ft , or so it seems to reflect quite well from all angles.This product is easily modified with sharpe scissors and have some fun with a sharpie pen to mask/draw on the tape as well.I applied it to my vinal wet weather gear and the back of my vinal seat , and it sticks very well and seems to hold up to a lot of bending.I definitely will buy more , and think it is a great product !
 The product seems to work as suggested ! I received it on time and I 'm very happy with it 's application.Thankschris
 Placed this on the sides of my truck bed & lower frame of my Harley & I can not believe how well they reflect light .
 received the item promptly and i t does what it says . it 's a semi gloss black and with a dark basement test at 20/30/40 feet with a flashlight , replaced to white/grayish white depending on the angle . i imagine a headlight would light it up . On my black bike I want to do some rear fender graphics that would only show at night . Cool stuff .
 Easy to use , works like they said , fair price , great shipping speed , what more can you ask ? I sure will recomend this product to my riding friends .
 This stuff is awesome , as far as reflective tape goes.I especially like the 4 '' wide - I cut out patterns and put them on the back of my saddlebags and riding jacket .
 I like to ride a largish scooter , and being seen is highly desirable , especially at night . This kit has a variety of sizes of highly reflective black tape . Initially , I decorated my helmet and my scooter with various pieces of black tape , by putting pieces of this product over surfaces which were already black . The various spots with an extra coat of black are almost invisible in daylight , but when lights hit any of them , the black tape turns bright white.Fortunately , I have had no problems with motor vehicles violating my space , so I hope the reflective tape is helping other motorists to see me.This seems to be a good product , so if you need to be seen on the roadway at night , this is the next best thing to active lighting .
 This is exactly what I was looking for.It 's black so it blends with my motorcycle helmet and hard hats , but reflects brightly at night .
 I just applied my reflective tape to my helmet , saddle-bags , and jacket and I am blow away by the quality of this tape ! I tested the helmet and jacket by placing them at the end of my 25 foot hallway , turning off all the lights , and shining a flashlight on the items . My helmet has a patch of white reflective tape and the white is brighter , but the black tape reflects almost as well . I tested the saddle-bags from my driveway and was also very very pleased , this will definitely make me more visible at night . Note that the tape is glossy and will stand out a little on a matte -LRB- flat -RRB- black surface , but it looks fine to me and is well worth it . I 'll be buying more soon to put on my vest and cold weather coat !
 I wish I found this product earlier . The reflectity of the tape supprised me when I tested it . Was enough to do both hard saddlebags and plenty left over for other areas of concern .
 Great product . Used it to make a few things just a bit more safe as well as to cover faux chrome making it not only black but reflective as well .

 This piece of tubing worked great for the project I built . The tubing arrived in great shape and is very straight .
 The bass tubing was a perfect fit for my project . The packaging was great No damage to the tubing and the service was fast .
 it was just as described . It arrived on schedule and I was able to start my project right away . I am very happy with this transaction .
 purchased to construct an alcohol restrictor tube for a vintage Optimus 111T multi-fuel stove ... the brass has the same quality construction as from K&S ; - i bought the thicker-walled material ... -LRB- btw , details are 1.75 '' length , two 5/32 '' holes 1/8 '' from nipple - stove now burns alcohol on the 'M ' -LRB- 0.03 mm/0 .012 '' -RRB- jet - a proper alcohol jet is 0.051 mm/0 .02 '' -RRB- fast shipping , good packaging - a good seller ! i 'll buy from them again !
 This tubing is great . It telescopes with the diameters above and below it in size . Amazon had it for a great price too .
 This is very good quality tubing . The tolerances are rather tight . I have bought quite a few different sizes of this stuff and it has been very consistent . The length is always over spec by at least 1/4 '' and usually 1/2 '' . I do n't use this in the `` telescoping '' mode so I am not able to comment on that . Good stuff !!
 Used it on my 1915 Evinrude to replace the original brass tiller handle . Worked great . I 'll probably be buying more for my other antique engines .

 Purchased this item to replace a wobbly lid that made you feel you are about to fall in and since this would be mainly used by a disabled person it had to go . The old one still had the same slow close feature so sturdy is all we needed . So far it is holding up very well and we could not be happier . Only time will tell if it stays sturdy and I will be sure to update if there are any shift problems . Would recommend based on performance so far .
 Great features : whisper close , easy-clean hinges , hard to find color -LRB- Tender Grey -RRB- , others with same features in this color cost $ 165 .
 Arrived on time . The seat proved easy to install . Great features ... whisper close , easy-clean hinges . You can by cheaper replacements , but you will be glad you spent the few extra dollars for what this product offers .

 My American Standard elongated light grey colored toilet is 26 years old , but the flimsy seat needed replacing . I was so pleasantly surprised to see this new seat 's color matched PERFECTLY and was very sturdy with no-slam feature . I looked at toilet seat replacements online and found some to be $ 300 because they were new and stored since 1986 . For less than $ 53 I got a a perfect product . We installed it in 5 mins -- LOVE IT !
 I really like this item . I researched these because I wanted to match seats in our other bathrooms with the soft close . We have a 2 yr old and I did n't want to have to worry about it slamming down on her hands or something . Again , very nice and looks expensive .
 Good quality , easy install - first time I have used these twist / snap fittings but they are very straightforward - will have to see if they loosen with time but so fat so good . Quiet close works well .
 product was as avertised and more . delivery was fast . completely satisfied . highly recommend this product to all in need of toilet seat . Elongated Plastic Seat
 Never even though of such a seat until I had kids and they pulled the seat down on their fingers . This works great . No more smashed fingers . Easy clean hinges are nice . Easy to install .
 I 'm amazed I got sure quality at such a price . It absolutely matched my commode . The seat closes slowly . No more slam . -LRB- Not that it ever gets closed except for company . -RRB- But it is impressive . Wh were lucky on this one .
 solid build , clever design elements enhance useability , such as beveled edges , American made , sturdy wooden box for storage . value for the money
 The slides are perfect ! I could not get them at Home Depot or Lowes . Price was spot on also.Good quality too .
 The dispenser was a little bulkier than I expected , but was very easy to install on a drywall surface . Good mounting hardware included . I also liked that there is a button verses key option for opening the dispenser to replace the towels . In my application there is no need to lock the unit -LRB- and subsequently loose the key -RRB- so you can replace the lock with a button which works great for me . Initially there was a lot of towel litter that appeared on the floor , but after the first replacement roll that seems to have disappeared . I only mention this because I contemplated returning the unit due to the mess the little towel bits were creating on the floor . It could have been user error in the way i installed the towels , because subsequent rolls of the same towels tear off cleanly .
 Our church preschool was going through a ton of c-fold towels every week . Most of the towels were just grabbed out of the dispenser then thrown away . I purchased this unit for its simplicity and cost and have found both to be the perfect unit .
 It 's better than similar products , quiet , and work gentlyThe size of sheet is perfect to dry your hands , and a full roll last for about 1.5 months in a 4 member family.Very satisfied .
 I 'm sorry to hear that some people have had bad results , but there seems to be some misunderstanding about what this tape is designed to do . It is a * delicate surfaces * painting tape and it 's intentionally manufactured with a lighter-than-normal adhesive . It 's for use for example on fragile old paint that would pull up when you removed conventional masking tape .3 M 's standard painting tape is called Scotch Blue * multiple surfaces * tape . It has a tackier adhesive and should be used in most cases . Use the delicate surfaces version only when you have to . They also make a high tack tape for jobs that required extra adhesive.That being said , this tape is a lifesaver when you ca n't use the regular tape . I live in a very old house and have to deal with fragile paint films and plaster that ca n't stand up to the regular tape . I 've found a surprising number of uses for this tape . The adhesive lasts almost forever without running or drying out . You can use it for temporary repairs or to stick things to the wall and it will still come off cleanly a year later , when other masking tapes would have melted , hardened , and bonded to the surface . I find myself using it for this kind of job all the time , more than I do for painting .
 As always , Scotch pulls through . What more can I say ? I needed to stencil something and needed to make sure the surrounding areas did not get spray painted . 2 '' tape certainly helps !
 I recently used this to paint my kids ' bedroom . It stuck to the ceiling , it held , and came off clean . 2 '' was the better size between it and the 1 '' .
 Product is fine , nothing special , though these rods are not clean there is quite a bit of grease on 'em . However , the packaging and shipping of these to me deserves some comment . I ordered quantity 4 , each one came in a separate FedEx package , and each package is a giant cardboard tube about 2 '' diameter with 1/4 '' thick walls , inside each tube is stuffed with paper , and then another smaller plastic tube that contains the part.It will take me about an hour of work just to handle , unpack , cut up the packaging with a hacksaw -LRB- tough stuff and too big for the bin -RRB- ... would have been faster to drive to a warehouse on the edge of town where they sell stuff like this in bulk.Amazon / SmallParts -- please ship your stuff in a more sensible way .
 Shipped :3 / 8 '' -16 7/8 '' length 100 count @ $ 1.65 . Package was labeled :1 / 4 '' -20 , 7/8 '' Length -LRB- Pack of 100 -RRB- Needed this size so am OK with it.Thanks ... Ken
 Heavy , rugged , precision hardware , and priced better than I could find anywhere else . A true bargain .
 This is a nice box of screws . I needed just this right size for some paintball applications . All the other have too wide a head to allow it to set in some recessed parts . The screws come in the box & have a thin layer of oil over each of the screws to help preserve them over time til they are ready for use .
 These not only look good but they are strong . I 'd buy these again for a future project that needed a decent quality bolt .
 These were the PERFECT match for the screws I needed for my old Atari Battlezone arcade machine handles . I do n't know if anyone else on the plant will need to know that , but if so , get these ! You will not find these in your local brick hardware store , trust me , I spent hours searching .
 Best price I have found and the screws did the job ! they seem hi quality metal and more than good enough for my needs .
 This screw was a great replacement for the screws that came with the Weaver scope mount . They were long enough to work with the NEF Pardner pump mounting . I am thoroughly happy with this purchase .

 The cover snaps on and does n't rotate up like a lid , and that works very well actually letting me remove the top when I need to in an even more compact space . The strap to tie-down the battery works well too . Great for my custom car project .
 The Vanguard BC53M250 Capacitor was purchased to replace a defective one -LRB- from another manufacturer -RRB- because of its rating and overall size . The recessed space that it had to fit into limited the size . It was shipped promptly , received undamaged and as installed performs flawlessly .
 My husband needed a pump for a one gallon container of garage soap and this is just the ticket . It has a large head on it so it is easy to pump the soap out . Just perfect for the garage . Well made and should last a long time .
 I used this hand pump to dispense A B foam from a 5 gallon bucket.The two part chemicals are somewhat think and sticky . The pumps make it easy to dispense the product without picking up the buckets and I can avoid getting the nasty stuff on my hands.Good quality and good price .

 I am an electrician by trade and I love these gloves . Great fit . Could n't be happier .
 these are the third pair of gel proframers ive bought . i am rough with my hands at work and have gone through other gloves in weeks , but i love the feel and the fit that the 150 's give the wearer . its like having another layer of skin but tough as nails . love this hand saving glove if you work with your hands -LRB- I mean really work with your hands -RRB- then these are the gloves for you ...

 The shop vac hose and accesaries is exactly what we needed and arrived in a timely manner . Thanks , a bunch .
 I purchased this hose to replace the smaller diameter hose that came with my shop vac . This hose arrived with multiple fitting ends that had not yet been attached . An instruction sheet was included in order to show which fitting end would be appropriate for your model vacuum . The fitting was easy to attach and fit my shop vac perfectly . Definitely happy with this purchase .
 I Bought this to replace my little 1 1/4 inch hose . Cleaning out my basement while we are finishing it , nothing gets sucked up and it kept getting clogged . This has solved my problem . I have also used it to clean leaves , and dust/dirt out of my garage .
 I received the products as advertised in proper condition and in the alloted time . All was well done .

 My Shop-Vac is a 12 Gallon Model 800L . In 2010 , I added a Trash Can Cyclone Lid w / a 5-gallon bucket to create a 2-stage system.After having a malfunction that clogged the paper filter , I browsed the Shop-Vac website for a solution . I equipped the 800L with aGore CleanStream-Gore HEPA Cartridge Filter -LRB- Shop-Vac 9034000 -RRB- and a Disposable Collection Filter Bag -LRB- 906-62-00 -RRB- . This created a 3-stage system that is effective for filtering all but the extremely finest dust.I also replaced the Reusable Disc Filter on my Mini-Vac with a Super Performance Dacron Cloth Filter -LRB- 901-15-00 -RRB- . I also purchased a Super Performance Dacron Reusable Disc Filter -LRB- 901-13-00 -RRB- and a 3-Pack of Reusable Disc Filters -LRB- 901-37-00 -RRB- as backup for both vacuums .
 While it 's not just-absolutely-wonderful quality , this brush is more than adequate for the job . I 've already put it through the dishwasher once -LRB- for general shop guck -RRB- and with shaping afterwards it came through like a champ . We 're very hard on these brushes , and they eventually get all clogged up with bent and broken bristles on the inside . Shop-Vac brushes last a little longer than others.Since we 're a half hour from any store that would carry them , where they might or might not be less expensive , it was well worth the purchase price to get it delivered in a timely manner from Amazon.For more delicate dusting around the house , especially lampshades , I recommend the -LRB- cheaper -RRB- Replacement Dusting Brushwith its soft natural bristles . Both fit our central vac -LRB- Stealth -RRB- as well as the shop vac .
 I bought a shop vac and two extra kits of shop vac tools and out of all the tools I now have for my shop vac , this one is my favorite . The bristles are great for `` scrubbing '' things that wo n't simply get clean by running the other vacuum attachments over it . I used it clean my wool coats and my hats , like a much more efficient clothes brush . The dust came off immediately . It even got dog hair off my clothes , which can usually only be done with those sticky tape rollers . I used it to scrub the built up dust off my bubble ceiling around the vents . It was rough enough to detach the dust but not so rough that it damaged the bubbles . Now the ceiling around my vents are white again . I used it to scrub the built up dust off my baseboards and around my windows.Since using mine to help clean my bathroom , I want another one to use exclusively as a clothes brush . I think one for cleaning dirt and dust and another one for clothes and hats are enough at once.I do n't agree with the review that stated that the bristles ought to be shorter . If he wants them to be shorter , he can always use a pair of scissors and cut them shorter . It 's not that hard to do . For me , if the bristles were shorter then they would be rougher , and I do n't think it would work as well for what I used it for . As I said before , it worked very well for all the tasks I put it to , so I 'm satisfied with it as it is . Yes , with enough use , the bristles could come loose , but that is to be expected . It happens with any brush.EDIT
 Great accessory . It came in quite handy for cobwebbing , cleaning the chairs , windows and all the little spaces . It is a very useful accessory .
 This is just the part that I needed . It was easy to find and the price was less than expected.I was completely satisfied with the speed of delivery as well .
 This a very usefull product unless you lose it.I did ... so I bought a new one . This is the placeto get your replacement parts for you wet-dry vac .
 Useful product that extends the use of our shop-vac . We can reach to areas that were not accessible before we purchased this product .
 I used these tubes to clean my wood shop . I attached them to my 2.5 inch diameter hose2 1/2 '' - 3 FT TO 20 FT E Z Flex Dust Collection Hose By Peachtree Woodworking PW515and then clean all over the place . I compared them to my current wet-dry vac tubes ; these are better made and fit my accessories better . My old tubes kept coming from each other and wobbled , but these tubes are solid .
 Excellent Vendor & Quick Shipper Too !!!! THANKS !!!!!! We will be back for more great buys soon ... Thanks
 An exact fit and all as described , prompt service , I should have bought two more for reaching and cleaning out roof valleys . Good stuff .
 The product is to replace 20 + year old 8 gallon Sears/Craftsman wet/dry vac wands that were lost . Could not find part in Sears Direct . These fit well to the original equipment hose and to the original equipment attachments.The vendor shipped well packaged . Arrived much faster than expected.If you need replacement wands , these are good value .
 I priced these at Lowes . They ranged from $ 7 - $ 10 each . This package was less than $ 15 with shipping . Be sure to check the size of your Shop Vac hose prior to purchasing .
 Great set for the price . Works just as I expected . Bristles not to stiff yet not too soft . . Perfect addition since my bristle brush broke from my Stanley set that can with the shop vac . .
 Fast delivery ! Great for cleaning upholstery and cars . You need these additional tools for any wet dry vacuum to make cleaning much faster and efficient .
 Excellent Vendor & Quick Shipper Too !!!! THANKS !!!!!! We will be back for more great buys soon ... Thanks
 WHAT CAN ONE SAY ABOUT SHOP VAC REPLACEMENT BAGS ? I LOVE MY MINI SHOP VAC ; I NEEDED BAGS ; I FOUND THEM ON AMAZON.COM , BOUGHT THEM AND THEY FIT MY VACUUM AND HOLD DIRT .
 GREAT PRODUCT & SERVICE , these bags are very hard to find and the price was very reasonable too.Thanks for great service and a very Merry Christmas
 Item was as described and shipped promptly . We have had some trouble finding these locally , finding them on Amazon was a pleasant surprise . This is why I love Amazon , it 's easy , correct and shipped right to me , on time , fairly priced . What more could you want .
 These bags are strong ! They hold a LOT of debris without shredding , even when picking up sharp objects . I 've gotten them wet too -LRB- I have a Shop-Vac 90340-00 CleanStream filter in the canister to permit water pickup -RRB- , and as long as you let it dry out before removing it from the canister , it wo n't fall apart on you . Even though they are so resilient , they breathe well . They do not strain the machine , even when they are getting full . By the way , I use them in this machine which I also highly recommend
 These filter bags are excellent if you need to vacuum fine particles such as dry wall dust . While they are not inexpensive , they will prevent what you are vacuuming from being blown out of the exhaust outlet They are a little difficult to install but if you carefully fllow the instructions printed on the bag , you should n't have any problems .
 By keeping the HEPA filter clean , these bags allow the shop vac to vacuum at full power until the bag is completely full . Changing bags is much less work -LRB- and done much less often -RRB- than cleaning the HEPA filter.There 's a trick to getting a full bag out of the vacuum . You have to spin the bag around 180 degrees so that the ends of the bag will slide past the hose connection .
 I use these along with a HEPA cartridge filter . This is a great combination to eliminate the fine dust health hazard . I use my Shop Vac with my router , biscuit joiner , table saw , and miter saw to collect chips and dust . With this bag the HEPA filter stays very clean and should last a long time .
 Pros : - A must have for cleaning up dusty messes - Seems to do a good job of filteringCons : - a bit pricey for what they are - require a bit of finagling to get a good fit - not easy to switch between these bags and a traditional filter . Best to just install and leave until it is fullThere is no substitute for these things . If you have a fine dusty mess -LRB- i.e. drywall -RRB- you got to have one . A traditional filter just wo n't cut it . In that sense they are a life saver . However , if you have small dusty mess it is not easy switch between the bag and the filter . Especially if the bag is a bit full it is hard to get it arranged correctly in the canister if you are switching it out between jobs . I usually just leave it in , but then end up using the bag for jobs where the bag really is n't needed which makes using the bags more expensive to use than if I were able to easily switch them .
 I use this bag along with the HEPA washable filter and I am amazed how well it works . I use this combination whenever I remove grout . I have been using a Dremal drill to remove old bathroom tile grout and replacing it with fresh clean white grout . It makes the bathroom look brand new like I just retiled . Before using these bags the vacuum blew out very fine dust which landed all over the furniture in the other room . But now , there is no dust at all . It all stays in the bag . Plus , the bag holds a large amount of debris so I can use it for many other jobs before having to replace the bag . If you work around fine dust or have to wear a mask then try these great bags .
 Does a great job in keeping drywall and plaster dust in the bag and my vacuum container clean . Well worth the money and convenience when emptying my vacuum , especially after a remodel project .
 I like this model as it has greater filtration than most Shop-Vac bags . They keep the dust inside the ShopVac . We moved into a newly built home when purchasing these and they were put to frequent use . They hold up well and perform as I expected . I would purchase again .
 I will definitely buy them again . The price is reasonable and the bags work great with my Shop-Vac to remediate sawdust in my workshop .
 I have been using these bags for years . The yellow high-efficiency bags are rated to filter dust better than the stock white bags . They are not HEPA but they filter more effectively when paired with theShop-Vac 9033300 Antimicrobial Cartridge Filter.BEWARE of cheap knock-offs/substitutes ! B&M ; Housewares sent unmarked , unlabeled , un-bagged white bags of unknown quality . They were white -LRB- instead of yellow -RRB- , had none of the familiar markings I have ALWAYS seen on Shop-Vac high-efficiency bags , and they felt lighter and thinner .
 Open mouth , insert foot ... my last review . Got them to work and they are fine . Beats the HECK out of cleaning the shop-vac when using on dry pick up !
 I bought this for aVacmaster VBV1210 Detachable Blower Wet/Dry Vacuum , 12 Gallon , 5 Peak HPwith aVacmaster VCFH Hepa Fine Dust Cartridge Vacuum Filter & RetaiWhat can I say - if you hate cleaning the junk you vacuumed , and if you like keeping your tools clean
 These High Efficiency bags are great . I `` help '' the bags before use by covering the end seams with duct tape to lessen the risk of blow out . It also helps to place a few rows of duct tape on the outside of the bag where you may see abrasion from picking up coarse material . These bags may cost a bit more , but they keep the dust in the bag where it belongs .
 Have not used this yet but all reviews state that it will really do the job well . Without specific instruction it will take a little time to install the collection bag into the shop vac .
 I bought the black Friday deal shop vac for $ 20 and these bags turned it into a high dollar wood shop dust collector , absolutely no dust , saw dust , or ashes come out of the exhaust anymore ! I am just here to buy more which I think is the best review .
 I use these to clean ashes out of my Komodo Kamado ceramic cooker . Just wait until the fire is totally out !!! These bags collect the fine ash cleanly and work perfect for this application .
 excellent from start to finish lots of action great acting very understandable story lines but final season blah not interesting wont purchase fifth and final season
 My vacuum did not come with bags originally but these retrofitted fine and keeps the fine dust from blowing out .
 These are a better grade of bag and do n`t rip so easily as the white ones . I save money by opening one end , emptying it , sealing it back up with tuck tape , and reusing these several times .
 I wish I had known about these from the beginning . Even works for graphite with no mess . Just toss the bag when full and you are done .
 This shop vac works great . I find it somewhat difficult to change the attachments , but that I had the same problem with my Kenmore.I like this shopvac better thannmy Kenmore . It has more attachments and does a better job.I highly recommend this product .
 We buy these high-efficiency bags for our aging shop vac , because they work the best . They collect every bit of dust , dirt , debris and fuzz and protect the filter from getting dirty too quickly , and the motor from damage.We do n't bother using less expensive `` regular '' bags , since these are large capacity and not that expensive -LRB- $ 6 each -RRB-
 I love it because it is just what I was looking for . It is really durable too and thats what I need
 Not much you can say about a piece of plastic ... great price , and worked fine for swimming pool vaccumn ! Would recommend for minor projects !
 What can I say , it works , it fits and it was the missing attachment for my 16 year old vaccuum .
 Product is good gauge plastic . Good for household and garage use . I wanted to use it to vacuum my car , but the crevices in the car are more narrow than the tool .
 i needed this for my shop vac to keep the deck cleaned off and the price was better than walmart .
 My wife got me a micro cleaning set for Christmas two years ago . Since then , I 've found it is one of the handiest tools in my shop . Simply put , it makes my shop vac much more useful . I can get into tight places and concentrate the suction power of my vac in a way that I could n't possibly do otherwise . Before changing the spark plugs in my truck , I used the micro cleaning tools to suck out all the dirt and debris around the old plugs , which otherwise would have fallen into to the engine . I 've used it to clean out tools and electronics equipment , and I have found it works great for doing a thorough cleaning of my car 's interior . I 've even used it to clean all the gunk out my chainsaws ! I 've been so happy with it that my wife is giving kits to her father and two brother-in-laws for Christmas this year .
 To use this you need Shop-Vac 906-85-00 2.5 '' to 1.25 '' Conversion Unit . Imagine the suction of your Shop-Vac pulling through the tip the size of a pencil ! That gives you an idea of the cleaning ability you can get with this add on kit . We had broken glass from a shattered windshield of our van - in the heater ducts , the recessed speaker enclosures , EVERYWHERE ! We used the micro kit in conjunction with our regular size Shop Vac and were able to get all of the glass from these hard to reach places . You can regulate the suction by how close or far away you hold it from the item to be cleaned . Extraordinarily functional for all kinds of needs .

 With the shop vac micro cleaning kit I can use the power of my shop vac to clean out the inside of my computer case . I had been wasting money every month on cans of air to blow dust off the heat sinks and fan blades or just to clean the keyboard but this kit turns my shop vac into the ultimate computer cleaning machine.The kit includes two extentions and two different sized brushes that also allow you to clean out a ps3 , xbox 360 or vcr . The first time I cleaned my 360 it blew a huge dust cloud out all over . I could n't believe how dusty it was inside!This kit pays for itself in the money it saves on canned air . I highly recommend it !
 $ 12.87 at Walmart in Buena Park , Ca.Sears Craftsman version is $ 14.99 . Come on Amazon , got ta get that pricing right . That is a huge difference percentage-wise .
 This is an excellent little kit for use of your Shop-Vac . You can get into crevices and the smallest areas of your John Deere tractor without damaging anything . Can be used on electronic equipment , too .
 I bought the micro tools to use on my computer and electronics , but I found that I LOVE them for getting into tight spaces in the car , especially the space between the seat and the door . I love the edging tool for vacuuming the edge of the carpet where it meets the car door frame . The tiny tools are also great for the spaces around seat belt buckles and along the metal seat sliders under the seat . I have two kids , so my back seat is always messy with crumbs , glitter , silty dirt from shoes , etc. . These tools help me to go the extra mile is making my car look clean and neat . The micro tool brushes are great for cleaning the buttons around the radio and A/C controls -- dust that my electrostatic duster did n't pick up . I highly recommend this purchase . And they 're great for the computer , too !
 Very good for hard to reach and hard to see places . Many uses !!
 I bought this for my mini shop vac and it is perfect for small places like under car seats or keyboards . Good price and works perfectly . Can buy a converter for larger hoses for a few dollars also .
 What a great little set of tools ! We have really enjoyed the micro cleaning set for both vacuuming in small spaces -LRB- even used it to suck water out of a pipe that needed soldering once ! -RRB- and blowing . Better than buying cans of air - just let the shop vac blow a little bit before you get it near something important as dust comes out first .
 I have had ShopVac vacuums before and they never disappoint me . This one it 's not the exception . When I received the package I thought it was too small , but as soon as I put it to work it was really up to the task . I vacuum my house and cars with this little marvel and it 's enough ! Great adquisition for the price and size ! However I have not used it for wet spills , just dry and regular dirt and dust at home , carpet , curtains , sofas , etc. . All in all great purchase !
 This comes in very useful when cleaning out the tiny area of your car . I use it with theBlack & Decker PAV1200W 12-Volt Cyclonic-Action Automotive Pivoting-Nose Handheld Vacuum Cleanerworks great with it .
 I bought these to go with my lil 2.5 HP Armor all dry vac and they work GREAT for cleaning ALL crevices in the car -LRB- even got up dog hair ! -RRB-
 I purchased this set to go along with my Milwaukee M18 Cordless Wet/Dry Vacuum . Let me tell you , it is a must have to clean in small places . Most vacuums have a 1 1/4 inch attachment to let you use this micro-cleaning set . I can put the brush heads on the end of my vacuum and run it over the keys of my laptop and it cleans everything ! Including all the dust and dirt UNDER the keypads . I 've used the other attachments to get to the hard to reach areas in my car . When going to the car wash and using the vacuum there , it is too big to get in the area on the floor of my car between the door and my seat . If you used this , you will have NO problem what-so-ever to get in there . I would recommend this product with 100 % certanity that you will find this product come in handy . Make sure your vacuum attachment will fit but I 'd say most will . Do n't be cheap and get a different brand . Just spend the extra 5 or 10 bucks and get this one . With Shop Vac you know you are getting a good brand and product !
 I bought a garage vac . and then added these to the deal . I do Old Vespa Scooter work and I love the compact reach of these tools .
 First off , as some other reviews have stated , these attachments are really small . Most are smaller in diameter than a pencil . The attachments work pretty well at getting into small areas , but the power of the shop vac is decreased when using the smaller attachments . Overall , I am pretty happy with the product though as it works great to suck or blow crap out of tight areas . If you do n't mind the small decrease in power , and need something to get into tight areas , then give these a try .
 I purchased this shop-vac for my daughter who lives in a condo & has several birds -LRB- one large -RRB- & she is big on treats for them . Consequently there are spilled seeds as well as special bird treats that hit the floor & though she has them confined to one room , keeping it neat was a big challenge . After reading how powerful this little vac is -LRB- + it used bags that would be simpler to dispose of as she lives on the 3rd floor ... stairs only -RRB- , so I gifted her with it & she loves it . A solidly good purchase/gift !
 Allot smaller than I thought when the package came . But the uses from these attachments cant be overlooked . For computers , side grills on microwaves , window sills or any other small area . A must if you buy the Mini Shop Vac .
 I bought this at Walmart for $ 11.97 yesterday . I was finally able to clean out from in between the front seats of my car and the console .
 I use it to clean leaves from the lower tracks on my rolling metal hurricane shutters . It makes a difficult job easy .
 I love this little kit , I have used it on my car , baseboards , vent covers , lamp shades , electronics , drawers and any other small area I want to vacuum . The brush attachment is extremely useful . These are some of the most used tools in the house now . BOTTOM LINE - Stop reading this review and buy them . You will use them !
 Nice micro vacuum cleaner accessories . I needed something to cleanup my computer keyboard as well as the internals . This accessory kit worked as expected . I would recommend this for anyone needing to clean around tight spaces .
 Bought these to go with a small shop vac to use in my vehicles . They mate up well with the shop vac and work great to get into the nooks and crannies .
 I was hoping for a powerful , but small shop vac and this is it . My garage clutter alarm sounded recently and storing this model helped to cure that issue ! Sturdy , well-made , convenient , multiple functions I can actually use and enough motor to work hard without dimming my lights . Just right as Goldilocks said !!
 we did n't know this was a micro set until we received the product . however glad we ordered these micro thingys real come in handy .
 I got these in a local store after reading about them on Amazon . I 'd wanted to clean my laptop for a while and thought this would be perfect for the job . I tried air cans but that only seemed to push the dust in . Cyber clean got some of the dust , but still just pushed a lot of it deeper in the ports.But when I went to clean my laptop with my Shop Vac , I found these micro tools did n't really matter much . I tried without attachments -LRB- the 1-1/4 '' Hose -RRB- , with the micro converter -LRB- one that made opening smaller for the attachments -RRB- , and then with the micro straight wand . For most of the job , it did n't really matter which I used and they all seemed to work just as good . Shrinking down the opening seemed to lessen the suction , or at best kept it the same as before.So for my task of cleaning a laptop , I feel the shop vac with no attachments -LRB- 1-1/4 '' Hose -RRB- would have worked fine without the micro tools . However , I did find the converter to be the most useful part when cleaning . It was better sized to fit over most of my ports than the hose 's normal opening . Also , when cleaning my keyboard I was a bit worried the 1-1/4 '' Hose would suck the keys off , but the converter cleaned without as much of a worry.Also , it was a bit awkward to hold at times . I had the hard plastic end of the hose , the converter , and then a micro tool . Trying to angle them to clean a laptop right in front of me was a bit tricky at times due to the size with all the attachments.The converter will be useful for certain tasks even if the rest are n't . I would assume the micro tools are more useful for getting into small places to clean than cleaning small places . So this set seems more for hard to reach places that the micro tools could fit into than small things like laptops or keyboards . But you may want to get it just for the converter for cleaning laptops or such even if you do n't use the micro attachments . Despite the tools not working well for my needs , I am still glad I got them and I think I will find more uses for them in the future .
 Product is fine , nothing special , though these rods are not clean there is quite a bit of grease on 'em . However , the packaging and shipping of these to me deserves some comment . I ordered quantity 4 , each one came in a separate FedEx package , and each package is a giant cardboard tube about 2 '' diameter with 1/4 '' thick walls , inside each tube is stuffed with paper , and then another smaller plastic tube that contains the part.It will take me about an hour of work just to handle , unpack , cut up the packaging with a hacksaw -LRB- tough stuff and too big for the bin -RRB- ... would have been faster to drive to a warehouse on the edge of town where they sell stuff like this in bulk.Amazon / SmallParts -- please ship your stuff in a more sensible way .
 This piece of tubing worked great for the project I built . The tubing arrived in great shape and is very straight .
 The bass tubing was a perfect fit for my project . The packaging was great No damage to the tubing and the service was fast .
 it was just as described . It arrived on schedule and I was able to start my project right away . I am very happy with this transaction .
 purchased to construct an alcohol restrictor tube for a vintage Optimus 111T multi-fuel stove ... the brass has the same quality construction as from K&S ; - i bought the thicker-walled material ... -LRB- btw , details are 1.75 '' length , two 5/32 '' holes 1/8 '' from nipple - stove now burns alcohol on the 'M ' -LRB- 0.03 mm/0 .012 '' -RRB- jet - a proper alcohol jet is 0.051 mm/0 .02 '' -RRB- fast shipping , good packaging - a good seller ! i 'll buy from them again !
 This tubing is great . It telescopes with the diameters above and below it in size . Amazon had it for a great price too .
 This is very good quality tubing . The tolerances are rather tight . I have bought quite a few different sizes of this stuff and it has been very consistent . The length is always over spec by at least 1/4 '' and usually 1/2 '' . I do n't use this in the `` telescoping '' mode so I am not able to comment on that . Good stuff !!
 Used it on my 1915 Evinrude to replace the original brass tiller handle . Worked great . I 'll probably be buying more for my other antique engines .
 I 've been looking for a pair of decent work gloves for awhile , came across these and am very happy with my purchase . I ordered the large for my long fingers . They fit nicely though are wide at the wrist like most gloves of their kind . Very soft on the inside . Thick enough to protect but not so thick that you ca n't feel anything when wearing them . High recommend , especially if you are looking for great quality at a reasonable price . I use them for everything from moving furniture to pulling thick weeds . High recommend .
 My husband uses these on the farm when lifting and loading bales of hay . They are rugged and hold up well under pressure .
 These are very nice gloves , and I was very pleased . They are well worth the money , fine comfortable leather & very good quality . These are far better gloves then you would find in the Quicky Mart . I also suggest a pair of cotton jersey gloves to be worn with these also for a fine warm comfortable feeling , if you buy these gloves , you will not be disappointed ...
 These Cat Work Gloves are great and for the price meet all the requirement of a Lather Hide Work Glove . They are not Padded but are great gloves for backyard work if using them when trimming the yard , picking up branches and all around work to protect your hands .
 The gloves arrived fine . Good condition , fit , and tough leather . However , one of the seams was unstitched upon arrival and requred a little work with a needle and some thread to repair before using .
 If you need a glove to do heavy work -LRB- or hold hot items briefly -RRB- these are the gloves for you . Use your Mechanix gloves -LRB- or whatever brand you prefer -RRB- for more delicate work but these for heavy work . They are sooo worth the weight even on long backpacking trips . I would n't even consider processing firewood without them .
 Good , comfortable gloves . I use these for work in the yard , as well as the garage . I think you 'll find them very serviceable .
 Very durable and tough work gloves . I 've gone through many pairs of work gloves , all purchased at the the big hardware stores . These are the the best that I have ever owned . For the price , they 're a steal at Amazon .
 I used these when cutting palm trees at my house , you get pretty good protection from thorns , etc. I accidentally wore them when I had a tiny rash -LRB- I have eczema -RRB- and these gloves turned it into a huge rash that I still have n't completely gotten rid of -LRB- it 's been 8 months with the dam rash -RRB- but that is my own fault hahaha.Great gloves , low price , good quality .
 A well made work glove , and stylish looking too.The fabric allows for greater flexibility , whilst the all leather index finger insures longevity .
 Being the cheap skate that I am , I buy a lot of the lighter duty work gloves . Those actually work pretty well , but they do n't have the thickness to last very long . These do .
 These Wells Lamont Kids suede gloves are not just for kids anymore . As a mature women with small hands , I found it impossible to find good work gloves for those heavy duty yard chores . These fit perfectly and wear like iron . I can do anything that needs to be done with these gloves . These may be the last pair of gloves you will ever have to buy .
 I do metal work and these are my polishing gloves . The reinforced fingers make them hold up much longer to the constant abrasion . They fit my hands really well . I will keep on buying them !
 If you insert a graphic card into a PC with a tower case , the cooling is on the bottom side of the card . This is bad design and forces the gpu cooler to work very hard to get the heat blown away from the card . The VM-101 uses a heatsink to bring the cooling to the backside -LRB- in a tower case top side -RRB- of the card . This is very ergonomic so the heat can easily be transported by the cpu - or chassis fan.My previously noisy Gainward GT220 Card became absolutely noiseless without any issue in temperature . Great!Unfortunately this product is not available in Germany . Even with the high transportation cost of 45 $ the product is not more expensive than any comparable gpu cooler available here , but it has the big advantage to transport the heat to the right side of the card .
 Shipped :3 / 8 '' -16 7/8 '' length 100 count @ $ 1.65 . Package was labeled :1 / 4 '' -20 , 7/8 '' Length -LRB- Pack of 100 -RRB- Needed this size so am OK with it.Thanks ... Ken
 Heavy , rugged , precision hardware , and priced better than I could find anywhere else . A true bargain .
 This is a nice box of screws . I needed just this right size for some paintball applications . All the other have too wide a head to allow it to set in some recessed parts . The screws come in the box & have a thin layer of oil over each of the screws to help preserve them over time til they are ready for use .
 These not only look good but they are strong . I 'd buy these again for a future project that needed a decent quality bolt .
 These were the PERFECT match for the screws I needed for my old Atari Battlezone arcade machine handles . I do n't know if anyone else on the plant will need to know that , but if so , get these ! You will not find these in your local brick hardware store , trust me , I spent hours searching .
 Best price I have found and the screws did the job ! they seem hi quality metal and more than good enough for my needs .
 This screw was a great replacement for the screws that came with the Weaver scope mount . They were long enough to work with the NEF Pardner pump mounting . I am thoroughly happy with this purchase .

 The dolly features sturdy construction , is lightweight , has good wheels , nice low height , and pushes/pulls well . I expected it to last for many years but after 6months one of the wheels would fall out because the plastic insert/collar/bushing between the metal wheel post and the plastic base broke . I called Rubbermaid Commercial Products and the nice lady on the phone found the part number in literally less than 10 seconds and immediately offered to send me a replacement part for free , no questions asked , and no fee -LRB- not even S/H -RRB- . I 'm impressed with the quality and customer service and will favor Rubbermaid products in the future .
 I waited until the last minute to order this for Christmas , and I had plenty of time to get it and wrap it . Great product , and the lowest price I could find .
 This cart is great . We used it around school for moving computers . I was stolen by another department and we could not live without it so we bought the one I am reviewing now . If going back and buying another one is not a good review then I do not know what is . The improvements since our first generation cart are a higher weight limit -LRB- 250 pounds -RRB- and the option of having all the wheels swivel instead of just two . It is a little loud when rolling it empty , however you can fold the handle in and it turns into a nice carrying handle .
 good quality . nice brassy color . looks exactly as pictured . I am using it to make a keychain out of a celebratory champagne cork . 1 -RRB- Screw into the cork 2 -RRB- unscrew 3 -RRB- drop some liquid super glue to the opening and a small amount to the screw 4 -RRB- replace screw in the cork opening 5 -RRB- let dry.This doubles as a floater for the keys .

 I do n't drive , and needed to caulk my porch before winter . Leave it to Amazon to sell this product and get it to my doorstep quickly . This is great indoor/outdoor caulk and paint adheres over it very well . It also does not have a horrible odor as with other caulk .
 These are nice gloves , but they do seem a little thinner than the ones I am replacing . Nice supple leather and easy to use the first day , not stiff at all . Very nice for clearing tumbleweed out of the pasture .
 Nice leather gloves for light yard care work , love the sninch strap on the back of the gloves -LRB- helps keep them on , snug and tight -RRB- . This is why I bought 4 pair ... never have to many . Highly recommend !

 This meter works great . It is a little sensitive for static electricity but if you leave the test leads hooked up to the lines you are trying to get a reading on it will give a good reading . The case quality is really cheap and not good quality .
 I needed to replace an antique R.S. multi-meter , at the same time wanting to expand my amperage measuring capabilities . I just inherited a diesel truck with some cold starting issues , and this meter seemed a good partner to tackle the job.The AC/DC amp ranges are 400A and 1000A and the hold feature allows you to clamp it in place , energize the system under test , then read the peak . Glo-plugs can be corporately and individually tested to compare for benchmark differences , helping to determine if all are working , and working together properly . Alternator output current measured during idle in loaded and unloaded conditions . Battery output current measured during glo-plug initiation , and then start up sequence to quantify the delivery of the Cold Cranking Amps that the batteries are rated for . -LRB- They should deliver at least half of the individual CCA rating for 15 seconds or be replaced . -RRB- When the engine starts you can see the reversal of the current flow and measure the rate of current going back into the battery , indicating whether it is properly recharging the batteries . My diesel system has two batteries connected in parallel and the DC amp-clamp helped to determine if both were contributing equally to the starting sequence , and receiving re-charge current equally . This helps to quickly determine if one battery is weaker and the other is doing more than it 's share of the work , or resolve wiring & connectivity issues.The meter comes with a set of test leads that are PVC , but still remain reasonably flexible down to 10 deg . F -LRB- coldest I 've had it -RRB- . AC amps readings seem very accurate - when testing a CF bulb stamped 390mA AC that 's exactly what it read -LRB- with the help of a X10 line separator - which multiplies small readings like this to 3.9 amps so the meter can read it -RRB- . The temperature in the room read two degrees higher than the thermometer on the wall , probably right , cold day = cool wall . Voltage readings are right on what you would expect -LRB- new `` AA '' battery 1.625 Vdc -RRB- -LRB- Wall socket 117 Vac tru-rms -RRB- -LRB- Hertz in the wall measures 59.99 Hz -RRB- . The Ohms scale corresponds well within tolerance while measuring 5 or 6 precision -LRB- 1 % -RRB- resistors I keep in my supplies . Capacitance also works well matching several caps I keep around . Continuity is indicated at measurements of less than 30 Ohms . Diode check shows the forward bias voltage and indicates `` OL '' when reversed.The back light on the display is useful in anything less than full daylight , which is when you need it . Display is large enough to read easily and the selector knob has an `` OFF '' position at both ends of the selection range , so you can go to whichever your closest to . Meter has a powerful enough spring in the clamp to easily hold it 's own weight and more , when clamping it and walking away to energize the part under test , and then returning to retrieve the measurement.It came with a padded vinyl carry case , test leads , K type temp probe , 9V battery , and instructions.I like this meter even more after working with it for the last several weeks and now have a good starting diesel to show for it , already paid for itself in savings ! Thanks Triplett !
 This is a great all around digital multimeter . The ability to measure current in a wire without interrupting the circuit is really useful . Works as advertised .
 EXCELLENT TEAM . . VERY MODERN . . . . FINE QUALITY IN CONSTRUCTION ... MANY FEATURES A LOW PRICE COMPARED TO OTHER SIMILAR ... . IS A GOOD BUY ... PRECISE IN MEASUREMENTS , HAVE ALL ACCESSORIES . .
 I bought this meter to check the DC amps in an automotive circuit . It performed as well as I had hoped . The light in the meter was a big help also . The Quality was good and I was well satisfied with the product .
 Shipped :3 / 8 '' -16 7/8 '' length 100 count @ $ 1.65 . Package was labeled :1 / 4 '' -20 , 7/8 '' Length -LRB- Pack of 100 -RRB- Needed this size so am OK with it.Thanks ... Ken

 Best price I have found and the screws did the job ! they seem hi quality metal and more than good enough for my needs .
 This screw was a great replacement for the screws that came with the Weaver scope mount . They were long enough to work with the NEF Pardner pump mounting . I am thoroughly happy with this purchase .
 My company performs varies types of construction services focusing primarily on bio-hazard related situations.Traditionally , we use 6 mil poly bags for remediation , concealment , or strength and durability . Sometimes we 'll even need to double bag 'em . Any caliber of bags in this category are pricey and sometimes hard to find so my company picks and chooses the actual need for them from job to job.I purchased the bags I 'm reviewing for two different reasons
 Standard size AGD type 2 indicator is very accurate . This model has hardened gears inside and 1 '' travel with removable tip . # 4-48 thread for accessories . From the at rest position to `` zero '' it out is about 15 thousands so it will retain accurate measurements and still retain the shock proof mechanism . Very smooth movement . You can feel the quality . Highly recommended .
 Great indicator , Starrett is mong the best . Movement is smooth and repeatable . The dual scale is perfect for my application of the gage .
 Works flawlessly and such a pleasure after using cheap crappy China imports . This is a lifetime precision tool . Unfortunately , most of the precision tool companies in the US are gone . Supporting Starrett is good for the US and NO ONE ever complains when using a fine tool -LRB- after the sticker shock wears off -RRB- .
 Starrett is the gold standard of precision measuring instruments . You will never be disappointed with the quality of this instrument .
 These hooks are much better looking than they appear in the picture . The wood they are mounted on is tapered , so that it 's thickest in the center and slightly thinner at either end -LRB- where the screws mount the hooks to the wall -RRB- . The hooks themselves are spaced nicely , with about 3 inches between each pair at the tops -LRB- where a sweatshirt or hat would sit -RRB- and 4 inches between each pair at the low part -LRB- where a jacket with a loop in the back or an umberella would hang -RRB- . Two screws mount each pair of hooks to the board and a screw on each end of the board holds the hooks to the wall . It comes with little wooden caps to put in the holes on the board where the screws hold it to the wall , so that they are hidden after it 's mounted .
 I purchased this epoxy for a white fiberglass shower pan repair , a small corner crack . This product worked well . When mixed together the epoxy has a thicker consistency and a tackiness so I was not able to make the repair `` glass smooth '' . I taped off an area for the repair , if you do this make sure to thin the edges of your repair epoxy at the tape or you 'll end up with a `` ledge '' . I used a plastic spoon for thinning the epoxy edges , it worked OK . The color is not arctic white but slightly off white . Overall a good product at a fair price . Loctite branded products generally work well .
 I was looking for a resin to bond 4 pieces of VERY hard plastic support bases to a VERY hard plastic support stand . I took a chance on this product solely based on the Amazon product description as well as the reviews here and am very pleased with the results.First , I made sure that I sanded both bonding surfaces to make them rough to the touch , as directed . The resin itself was very easy to mix . You simply cut the tip off the applicator and squeeze the contents of each tube simultaneously into a mixing tray -LRB- I used a clean piece of hard plastic -RRB- . I then mixed both resins together in the mixing tray for 2 minutes , using the mixing stick provided . After that , it was simply a matter of applying the mixture to the bonding surfaces and clamping them together until dry.First of all , the mixture does n't really start to set until about 5 minutes , giving you ample time to work with and apply the glue . This is a comfortable amount of time for most applications , a huge improvement over other products which only provide a minute or two or even just a few seconds to work with and apply the glue.The end result for me was 4 very solid plastic welds , fully repairing what had been an aggravating problem for a long time . The directions say to wait about 4 hours for the glue to fully cure but I found that I was able to apply stress to mine at about 1 hour . After 4 hours , I applied full stress to the glued parts and they have remained solidly glued for about 2 months now . Furthermore , there has been no indication whatsoever of any problems brewing with the welds.I would add however that the primary force applied to my welds is only a constant and low level SHEAR force . It has n't been subjected to any sudden , high force spikes or high torque stresses . I have no way of predicting how the bonds would react to those latter types of forces . One last point worth mentioning as that none of my welds are -LRB- or will be -RRB- subjected to any water at any time .
 Description is wrong , this glue does not sets in 50 minutes . It needs full 2 hours to cure -LRB- look at `` 2 '' painted on package -RRB- . So , take care !
 I hadd to fix a dragon boat paddle with a hole in it . This did the trick . It a ; so sanded down very well . No more hole !
 Used this to repair something that had been assembled with a silcone based adhesive . This dries white and appears to be as hard as rock .
 Like some others , I purchased and used this item to repair a crack in the floor of my 10 year old shower surround . The crack was actually about 5 inches long , but only about an inch of the crack was broken all the way through so that water could leak . I mixed up a small batch , then applied it to the entire length of the crack and about 1 cm . wide . After letting it set and dry for about 18 hours , we started using the shower again . So far the repair has held up great , even after a week of seeing two showers a day . The color is a slight off-white , but it 's about as white as you 're going to get with an epoxy . After drying , the surface of the epoxy is glass-smooth and very hard , so I have no real worries about dirt or cleaning agents discoloring it .
 Pick and ship was ahead of expectations.UPS tracking was right on .
 Shipped :3 / 8 '' -16 7/8 '' length 100 count @ $ 1.65 . Package was labeled :1 / 4 '' -20 , 7/8 '' Length -LRB- Pack of 100 -RRB- Needed this size so am OK with it.Thanks ... Ken
 Heavy , rugged , precision hardware , and priced better than I could find anywhere else . A true bargain .
 This is a nice box of screws . I needed just this right size for some paintball applications . All the other have too wide a head to allow it to set in some recessed parts . The screws come in the box & have a thin layer of oil over each of the screws to help preserve them over time til they are ready for use .
 These not only look good but they are strong . I 'd buy these again for a future project that needed a decent quality bolt .

 Product is fine , nothing special , though these rods are not clean there is quite a bit of grease on 'em . However , the packaging and shipping of these to me deserves some comment . I ordered quantity 4 , each one came in a separate FedEx package , and each package is a giant cardboard tube about 2 '' diameter with 1/4 '' thick walls , inside each tube is stuffed with paper , and then another smaller plastic tube that contains the part.It will take me about an hour of work just to handle , unpack , cut up the packaging with a hacksaw -LRB- tough stuff and too big for the bin -RRB- ... would have been faster to drive to a warehouse on the edge of town where they sell stuff like this in bulk.Amazon / SmallParts -- please ship your stuff in a more sensible way .
 Great product for the money . No problems so far , but I 've only used them for a couple months . Seriously look into these bits if you are a weekend warrior . You ca n't beat the price .

 I 've been working on things since I was a Kid . We would spend all day taking STUFF apart , just to see What was inside . We found Springs , Steel Balls , Copper wire etc. . Yes , the old Flat and Phillips screw drivers were used a lot . I was glad when they came out with the newer types/styles of nut and screw heads and Tools . The Hex head screw shown here is a Great and reliable part . This Hex Cup is a must , in my book , if you do n't want a set screw to strip out on you . If a screw strips out you are probably looking at a lot of Down-Time , someone is going to have to pay for . This Set Screw works great and a person specially a Mechanic needs to keep an assortment of sizes on hand at all times !!! AS a Mechanic , I 've used a lot and I mean a lot of them in the Rebuilding of Mining Equipment both Underground & on Surface Equipment . When I can replace a factory screw or bolt with a Hex I will . You must use the exact Grade of metal when replacing such Bolts and Screws . Go by the Manufacture 's List of Grades needed for each Type.There is another Type/Style I Love to use , I will give Feedback on it when I Order it !!! Thanks for a Great Part .
 If color is a factor when purchasing this item , know that it is black . This item worked perfectly to lower the turn signal lights on my 2009 harley sportster 883 iron . i used it in conjunction with a 1 in . long 5/16 '' -24 coupling nut .
 Every kid should play with a magnifier at some point , and this magnifier is a good one to play with
 I bought this for my daughter to use bug hunting and exploring in the yard . It 's sturdy and solidly constructed . I 'll probably buy another to add to my emergency/camping gear .
 I bought this for my 5 year old nephew who loves to measure things . He told his mom it 's his favorite present . He walks around with it all the time . Do n't know how sturdy it is since he 's only had it for a month . So far so good .
 Good Gaffers Tape . 60 Yards was way too much for our small production , but we have some left over for the future.If you have a small set 20 yards would be fine .
 This Gaffer 's tape sticks well and removes easily from floor , wall and most non-porous surfaces . That is what Gaffer 's tape is all about !
 I like using gaffer 's tape because it adheres well without leaving a gummy residue like duct tape or gorilla tape . It has a dull cloth-like appearance rather than the shiny plastic appearance of duct tape . This is a great buy on what looks and feels like a high-quality tape .
 Great price on excellent tape that is typically much more expensive . I 've used it to edge a carpet rug , hold down extension cords , and seal panelling . Love the mat finish , and it leaves no residue .
 I got this to make a fence on my garage door for halloween , and it worked great . Got lots of compliemnets . It was an easy on and very easy off process which is exactly what I needed .
 What really needs to be said here ? It 's a roll of tape , and it does its job incredibly well . No residue leftover as far as I have seen . Will be buying this again next time I need a roll of gaff .
 I use it on my DSLR and love it . It covers up areas that have white to reduce noticeability . Would recommend it to anyone .
 I have been a big fan of having duct tape for emergencies but it always leaves a gummy residue . I was concerned that the tape would n't have good holding power but the tape is excellent and high quality . Leaves no residue . It is not as strong as gorilla tape but that can be a mess to remove .
 It does the job . It stayed firmly stuck -LRB- about a week -RRB- where I put it and then came off clean -LRB- no residue -RRB- when I removed it .
 It sticks when you want it to . If you 're taping things to walls , make sure you peel the tape off slowly so you do n't rip the paint/wall off when you remove it .
 Ordered for our church A/V team . Very pleased with its quality and performance , and it is Made in the USA .
 Looking closely at the displayed picture , the picture is actually a smaller role of tape than what you are ordering . The label actually says 30 yards , whereas the product discription reads 60 yards . There is a number at the side of the bar code however that differs from the product discription.In any case you actually do get the 60 yard size , which adheres and molds reasonably well around items under the tape . The tape leaves minimal residue when removed even from smooth surfaces .
 If you have never used gaffers tape , you should have . I seem to have another new use for it almost daily . Much better than regular cloth or duct tape as it can be removed w/o residue .
 This tape is adequately strong and it adheres well.The backing offers about as much friction as the surface of a nylon parka . I had been hoping for a rubbery backing , for higher friction.I have had the tape roll for 2 years , and I do n't see or feel any deterioration.I keep the tape in a gallon zipper-lock bag , to keep debris from adhering to the side of the roll ; the tape does n't stick firmly to the bag.I would prefer tape that would require scissors or a knife to cut , for greater strength . I can tear this tape easily with my fingers . -LRB- Another reviewer had difficulty with tearing the tape using fingers , so here is an description . You probably know how to start a tear in cloth tape , so you may want to skip the following explanation . I grip the edge of the tape between the thumb and index finger of my left hand , with the edges of my fingernails pinching the tape . I do the same thing with my right hand . The back of my left fingernail is against the back of my right fingernail , and the back of my left thumbnail is against the back of my right thumbnail . I press one index finger and nail toward the glue side of the tape , while I press the thumbnail of the other hand toward the back of the tape . My nails focus the pressure into a small area , as do scissors , starting a tear in the cloth backing of the tape.Alternatively , I can just pull hard on the tape and make it tear , but the result is not as neat and controllable . -RRB-
 What 's not to like ? Same quality stuff I got from the camera store , at a better rate . Better than duct tape too .
 It 's good , reasonably priced gaffer 's tape . It 's easy to tear , sticky enough , and did n't leave residue . I 'm not sure what more you can say about it !
 I did n't want to spare any expense to get the best product to tape the edge of my glossy flat panel screen and reflecting speaker surfaces to reduce the glare without damaging the finish when I finally take it off.It is a bit of an expensive product but seems to be worth it if you need the best .
 this stuff is great for around the house and for use on the set . wont damage delicate things you stick this tape to . glad i bought it .
 This tape is the real deal . It is the strongest I have ever had , in fact . Although I purchased the tape for use in photography , it can be used in any situation where you need a STRONG yet removeable bond . I used it last Friday to secure 15 foot long banners to a pavillion wall at the golf course , which is located amidst a Windmill farm -LRB- literally -RRB- where there is a constant stream of wind -LRB- obviously -RRB- of 30 + mph . The banners had been rolled up and put away , after the event organizers * unsuccessfully * tried to mount the banner to the wall using silver duct tape . THe combination of hot metal walls and windy conditions resulted in the duct tape adhesive softening and delaminating , leaving the adhesive on the wall . Using 6 pieces of THIS gaffers tape , each 6 '' long -LRB- 1 in each corner , and one on the top and one on the bottom center -RRB- , the banners held securely for the duration of the golf tournament , and the auction , dinner , and entertainment following , in spite of the gusting winds and the 95 degree heat . When it was all over , we carefully pulled the tape off of the wall , which left no adhesive whatsoever , in spite of the heat . Amazing . This is a GREAT product .
 This is very nice tape and easy to apply . I gave it 4 stars only because it was n't quite as matte as I needed it to be . I was hoping for/needing something that does not reflect but absorbs light . This tape does have some reflection . Other than that , I have never really bought gaffer 's tape before , so I ca n't say how it measures up to other such product .
 If this is what you want , this roll is fabulous . I use it to tape the soles of dress shoes to turn them into dance shoes . It works great . I also use it for a lot of projects that could use the superior adhesion power of this type of tape where you do n't want a residue after removal . Otherwise , I would be more economical and use duct tape .
 It 's black and good for wrapping cables and you can mold it around anything easily , not quite as stiff or sticky as duct tape but does n't leave sticky stuff behind when you remove it . This is the first roll of this type of tape I have used so I ca n't say yet if it degrades and drys out over months and years like duct tape , but I liked this tape the first time I used it . If you need this type of tape this is the roll to buy .
 I work for a radio station and broadcast sports games so this tape is necessary to tape down wires . It works like a charm and would recommend it to anyone who is in a similar situation .
 This tape is as good as any other Gaffers tape out there but a lot less expensive . I used it to seal up a dryer duct for a few days while i had the pipe off it . When I took it off , it was still very sticky but left no residue . Could n't ask for more .
 This tape does everything it is supposed to do perfectly . I used it to secure several cables on carpet , brick , and concrete at a wedding this week and it held everything safely and securely in place . It pulled off each surface with no damage or residue very easily.I had to pack up in a hurry and ended up leaving one of my white extension cords covered with about 7 feet of this tape for 4 days in a hot room ... it peeled off completely cleanly with no glue residue or marking of any kind.This will be the tape I always purchase .
 We decided to create a haunted castle theme for our Halloween party , and ordered a rolls of dungeon and catacombs printed plastic to cover the walls . We tried the Sticky Tack recommended to hang the stuff , and even the small pieces would NOT stay up more than a few minutes ! We have smooth painted walls and wood crown moulding , and tried attaching it to both surfaces with no luck . We tried double-sided tape , with even worse results . After researching online , I found this gaffers tape . This stuff is what they use for set building and holding stuff for stage performances . I figured that , if it is good enough for a stage production , where you just ca n't have stuff falling down during a show , then it should work for our purposes . Eureka ! All of the wall rolls , scene setters , decorations went up and stayed up ! The tape is easy to work with , you can even tear it with your fingers , yet it is strong . It is matte black so does not reflect . For what I paid for this roll -LRB- and about 1/2 is still left after covering a lot of wall space ! -RRB- , I paid about as much for the other stuff that did not work , so Gaffers Tape is worth every penny . I wish I 'd had it before , as it would have eliminated wasted time and frustration ! I highly recommend this tape and will be ordering it again next year !
 This tape is great!The essential problem with tape is that it usually either sticks too much , or it sticks too little . It 's so hard to find tape that will hold something in place for as long as you need it there , then allow you to remove it without tearing everything up , pulling paint off of the wall or leaving a sticky residue . This tape solves that problem.Gaffers tape is the stuff that they use on the sets of plays and films to hold things together securely but temporarily . It does jobs like taping down wires and cables , attaching cloth to walls , securing corners of boxes , and so on . A small piece will hold almost anything where you need it to stick , then when you want to remove it , you just pull it up . No residue and no damage to what it was stuck to.The one real problem is finding gaffers tape at a reasonable price ; it 's not a standard item at the hardware store , and it 's usually not cheap . This product is the solution to both of those problems . It looks like it costs a lot , but you 'll find the roll lasts a VERY long time.Bottom line
 This tape is really good . It is really good for taping down cables and other things . It doesnt leave that gummy sticky residue like duct tape . And when it does leave residue , its really easy to take off . Its really just a matter of wiping it off with your fingers . Would recommend
 Well , I only need very small amount - but I could n't find anything cheaper on-line , so I bought this one.It seems to be the real deal . No residue after I stick it on a piece of painted plastic for about a month .
 I bought this tape to simulate the feeling of suede on my shoes soles for dancing . It was pretty smooth and helped in spinning better in my street shoes . I eventually bought a real pair of dance shoes because replacing this tape every week on my street shoes was getting pretty cumbersome . If you do n't stick them on properly , they might come off while you are dancing so make sure to set aside some time and try pasting them in a seamless fashion on the soles of your street shoes . This tape is cheaper on Amazon than many other sites and there is a lot more of it . I do n't know what to do with the rest of the tape roll ...
 It seems like it should n't need to be mentioned on a review of Gaffers Tape , but with so many companies selling non-gaffers tape as `` gaffers tape '' , I wanted to point out that this product IS real gaffers tape . A number of companies are re-branding duct tape or vinyl tape as gaffers tape , when there is a definite difference.Gaffers tape is similar to duct tape in terms of strength and the ability to easily tear it by hand -LRB- opposed to requiring scissors -RRB- . The strength is very strong - you can tape objects to walls , use it to mark spots on the ground , use it as general strong-adhesive tape . . but in the end be able to easily remove it without tearing objects or leaving adhesive.The tape is much more expensive than other types , but if you need a gaffers tape -LRB- which is usually for photographers , videographers or set designs -RRB- , it 's a great object to have.The intertape gaffers tape comes in a VERY large roll -LRB- much larger than it appears in the photo -- imagine a 6x6 '' roll of tape , about 2 '' thick -RRB- . Fortunately , you can re-package it to make it more portable -LRB- wrap it around a pencil , for example -RRB- . With 60 yards -LRB- about 180 feet -RRB- it should be enough to last a LONG time.The tape comes in a matte-black finish -LRB- opposed to glossy like you usually find on duct tape -RRB- , is very strong and does not leave any adhesive when removed . After going through a few other brands CLAIMING to be gaffers tape , it was a relief to find that this one lived up to the name . Quality is very good , but it is a bit pricey .
 This tape is wonderful ! I bought it for my son who is a musician would be able to tape down his various cords so he would n't trip over them on stage . I used it to tape the power cord for my treadmill down and it works great ! It does n't leave a sticky residue , it tears easily so scissors are n't needed , and it 's strong enough to hold even the most unruly cords in place . Keep rockin ' without tripping !
 So i got this gaff tape because it had good reviews and the reviewers said it was actually Gaff tape unlike some other products available . It is in fact gaff tape with a fabric mat black finish . It is a little cheaper quality wise then other gaff tape I 've used and that is why i gave it 4 stars . It seams a tad thinner and the adhesive does n't seem to stay on the fabric backing as long as it should . It is still quality tape and I would n't hesitate to use it on the XLR and DMX cables . I would n't keep it on the cables for longer then 10 days . Then a residue will most likely form . It 's still a far better option then any other tape for stage work .
 Just what I needed to keep cables out of the way . As a mobile DJ I needed something to keep my cables and wires aout of the way without leaving any residue behind . This gaffers tape was the answer .
 Came as described , used them to adjust triggers on xbox controllers ! I know it 'll be forever before I need to get more , but i 'd order these again in a heartbeat !
 These set screws were impossible to find at local big box stores , and even at local hardware stores , but -LRB- of course -RRB- they were easy to find on Amazon . They are of good quality , with nicely formed threads and a uniform black oxide coating . Note that they have a 1/16 '' hex key socket in the head .
 These Set Screws are manufactured well . The coating is consistent and I did not have any issues with deformed Allen Wrench recesses . I would order these fasteners again .
 I needed a couple of small setscrews and nothing remotely near this size was available locally . Enter Amazon , and their partner , Small Parts . I now have PLENTY of these setscrews for a very reasonable price , they were delivered promptly , and the only problem I had was that I did n't try buying online before I drove all over town looking in vain for these little screws .
 Brighton Best bolts are reliably well made , with clean threads , good finish , and hold up . The black Oxide keeps them from rusting .
 This piece of tubing worked great for the project I built . The tubing arrived in great shape and is very straight .
 The bass tubing was a perfect fit for my project . The packaging was great No damage to the tubing and the service was fast .
 it was just as described . It arrived on schedule and I was able to start my project right away . I am very happy with this transaction .
 purchased to construct an alcohol restrictor tube for a vintage Optimus 111T multi-fuel stove ... the brass has the same quality construction as from K&S ; - i bought the thicker-walled material ... -LRB- btw , details are 1.75 '' length , two 5/32 '' holes 1/8 '' from nipple - stove now burns alcohol on the 'M ' -LRB- 0.03 mm/0 .012 '' -RRB- jet - a proper alcohol jet is 0.051 mm/0 .02 '' -RRB- fast shipping , good packaging - a good seller ! i 'll buy from them again !
 This tubing is great . It telescopes with the diameters above and below it in size . Amazon had it for a great price too .
 This is very good quality tubing . The tolerances are rather tight . I have bought quite a few different sizes of this stuff and it has been very consistent . The length is always over spec by at least 1/4 '' and usually 1/2 '' . I do n't use this in the `` telescoping '' mode so I am not able to comment on that . Good stuff !!
 Used it on my 1915 Evinrude to replace the original brass tiller handle . Worked great . I 'll probably be buying more for my other antique engines .
 This bit is a masonary bit to be used in a hammer drill . It is a good quality bit from a company that is known for quality tools , esp . when it comes to hammer drills.If you were only making a small number of small holes in masonary , say for anchors , you might be able to use a standard drill with non hammering masonary bits . But if the job calls for larger quantities or larger holes , Step up to a hammerdrill with hammer masonary bits like this one.I have used this bit to drill through concrete block foundation walls in order to feed conduit and wires to exterior outlets . This bit when used in conjunction with a hammerdrill , made the holes needed much faster than a rotary non hammer masonary bit in a non hammer drill.Bosch bits seem to stand up to tough use better than the B&D ; / Dewalt bits that I had previously used . The Shank of the bit is reduced down to fit in the chuck of a 1/2 inch hammer drill . So you can not use this if your hammerdrill has a 3/8 inch chuck . Also , I use this bit in a Ridgid Hammerdrill that is rated for this size bit . Many other brands do not generate enough power or torque to turn this large of a bit , so check the specifications on your hammer drill before using it with this bit or you could risk damaging the tool . I would resist the temptation to try using this bit with a cordless drill for the same reason .
 I have used one of the smaller bosch bits for anchoring in my basement walls many many times . On the strength of that performance , I purchased this bit . I got this one for running some wire through my basement wall to the outside . I used it in my Milwaukee Cordless Hammer drill . Smooth as butter . I think this bit will last a long time . The price was right , the performance is good , and if it performs like other bits in this family , the longevity will be excellent .
 when used with a corded hammer drill , it goes through most concrete like butter . Older and harder concrete make the job tougher , but it still works great .
 I was very impressed with the high quality of this bit . It makes the hardware store brands look like toys . I was using -LRB- not for intended purpose -RRB- to drill hardened lawn mower blades and the hardware store bit completely failed -LRB- unusable -RRB- after one blade . This bit drilled eight before needing sharpening of the well mounted carbide tip .
 I have owned several pairs of the boxer model of C.L.C. I like the rubberized grips on the gloves to grip onto boxes and water bottles at work . They are perfect until the rubber dots wear off , which is about 2 months . Using them to grip anything after that is very difficult . I do use them as weight lifting gloves at the gym and they are great for that reason . I would recommend them for multiple purposes but not solely for grabbing boxes .
 These gloves are very comfortable & very grippy . I use them everyday & I love them . I have thought about buying another pair , just to keep for the day these come apart , but I will just wait it out & see actually how long I can get out of them , probably going to be a while .
 I recieved the gloves in a timely manner and they are still to this day in excellent shape . I even had many at work who like them and asked me to get them a pair for the job.I love these gloves
 I 've had these gloves for over three years . I 've never used them for work related situations until now . I 've used them for just the cold weather , these gloves actually work pretty well over 30 degree cold weather . I recently just started using them for work , they provide comfort as well as sensitivity so that you do n't have to actually take your gloves off to get something out of your pocket . Ideal especially if you work outdoors . I have to get them special ordered for some reason at brick & mortar Hardware stores . They do n't seem to carry this particular model which is better than all their other models . I wish it came completely black is the only bad part i feel about it .
 Shipped :3 / 8 '' -16 7/8 '' length 100 count @ $ 1.65 . Package was labeled :1 / 4 '' -20 , 7/8 '' Length -LRB- Pack of 100 -RRB- Needed this size so am OK with it.Thanks ... Ken
 Heavy , rugged , precision hardware , and priced better than I could find anywhere else . A true bargain .
 This is a nice box of screws . I needed just this right size for some paintball applications . All the other have too wide a head to allow it to set in some recessed parts . The screws come in the box & have a thin layer of oil over each of the screws to help preserve them over time til they are ready for use .
 These not only look good but they are strong . I 'd buy these again for a future project that needed a decent quality bolt .
 These were the PERFECT match for the screws I needed for my old Atari Battlezone arcade machine handles . I do n't know if anyone else on the plant will need to know that , but if so , get these ! You will not find these in your local brick hardware store , trust me , I spent hours searching .
 Best price I have found and the screws did the job ! they seem hi quality metal and more than good enough for my needs .
 This screw was a great replacement for the screws that came with the Weaver scope mount . They were long enough to work with the NEF Pardner pump mounting . I am thoroughly happy with this purchase .
 I was very happy with this product . I was unable to find it in the size that i needed at the store and was very frustrated . So I went online and found it for a fraction of the cost . With shipping I ended up paying the same amount but I was happy to be able to get my dresser fixed .
 I 've been working on things since I was a Kid . We would spend all day taking STUFF apart , just to see What was inside . We found Springs , Steel Balls , Copper wire etc. . Yes , the old Flat and Phillips screw drivers were used a lot . I was glad when they came out with the newer types/styles of nut and screw heads and Tools . The Hex head screw shown here is a Great and reliable part . This Hex Cup is a must , in my book , if you do n't want a set screw to strip out on you . If a screw strips out you are probably looking at a lot of Down-Time , someone is going to have to pay for . This Set Screw works great and a person specially a Mechanic needs to keep an assortment of sizes on hand at all times !!! AS a Mechanic , I 've used a lot and I mean a lot of them in the Rebuilding of Mining Equipment both Underground & on Surface Equipment . When I can replace a factory screw or bolt with a Hex I will . You must use the exact Grade of metal when replacing such Bolts and Screws . Go by the Manufacture 's List of Grades needed for each Type.There is another Type/Style I Love to use , I will give Feedback on it when I Order it !!! Thanks for a Great Part .
 If color is a factor when purchasing this item , know that it is black . This item worked perfectly to lower the turn signal lights on my 2009 harley sportster 883 iron . i used it in conjunction with a 1 in . long 5/16 '' -24 coupling nut .
 I thought the product worked very well . It was really helpful in buttoning up short sections of fence where there was n't a good anchor for a come-along . It ca n't fully replace a streching bar and come-along but it was very handy to have . The way the slots are angled , it keeps the tension bar from twisting when you pull the fence tight . It worked very well .
 I used this product to wire up a dog kennel . The post were set in concrete and the longest section of wire that I pulled tight was 10ft . It worked great and made it easy to pull the sections tight while I clamped the fence to the post . It hooks onto the tension bar and keeps it straight when pulled . The amount of slack that this device will pull is limited and I do not think that it will work for pulling long runs of chain link fence . It work great for my short pull application on the kennel .
 I put this on the side of my fridge and use for holding pot holders . I am very happy with it .
 Received 2 of these about a week ago . After downsizing to a much smaller house I faced the age-old problem of cramming 10 pounds of potatoes into a 5 pound sack . Even after donating a ton of stuff I still have numerous kitchen items that I ca n't bring myself to part with . My tiny kitchen with severely limited storage was giving me fits . This little rack is n't a panacea but it has allowed me to organize my favorite cooking utensils where they are handy instead of trying to dig them out of a crowded drawer . I 've overloaded my racks with lightweight plastic as well as metal utensils , potholders and hand towels . Even though I have doubled and tripled the number of items on each hook , the racks have not slipped 1 millimeter.These racks firmly adhere to both my 2008 textured Whirlpool fridge and my 2009 over-the-stove Hotpoint microwave oven . I mention the age and brand of my appliances because a number of people have reported problems with weak magnets and slippage . I do n't think the problem is with the textured coating but rather the structural material under the coating . Magnetic performance might be related to the age and composition of the appliance or the make and model . I presume that some fridges have more metal or less insulation than others . I tested my appliances with rare earth magnets before I purchased this product . They are inexpensive , sold by Amazon and accurately predicted the magnetic sensitivity of my appliances . I 've been using them to attach my kitchen knives to my fridge for a couple of years and they work great!I absolutely adore these racks and plan to buy a few more . I want to hang a couple on the side of my stove . They are space saving , attractive , low-profile storage for spatulas , whisks , large spoons , kitchen shears , hand towels , cheese graters and just about anything else fairly lightweight that can hang on a hook . -LRB- I would n't try to hang my cast iron on them ! -RRB- The little ` ball stops ' on the ends of the hooks are n't very large so most anything with a hole in it will fit . A terrific organizational tool particularly when space is limited .
 This thing is so cool ! The magnets are very , very strong and the thing does n't move around or slip once you have it where you want it . Lovely !
 I am using this on the side of my fridge and it is very reliable . I use it to hold utensils and mitten gloves -LRB- double loading i.e. , two items per hanger -RRB- and it is holding very well . The magnate is very strong , it never moves even when I am loading or unloading the items .
 I bought 2 of these and put them on my fridge . I use to dig through drawers looking for utencils . Not any more .
 My husband got a fancy grill from Lowe 's . The only drawback ... no place to hang our cooking utensils . I came across this hook rack on Amazon and thought I would give it a try . The price was great . We have had this for over a year now and it is perfect ! Holds up in strong winds and weather . It works great on our grill and holds all of the utensils we need !
 I shopped all over for a magnetic hook system to put on my frig . I also checked all over the internet . The only one that had it ... Amazon of course . It is very strong and looks good on my frig which is right next to my stove -LRB- I have a very small kitchen -RRB- . I use it for my measuring cups and spoons . It is handy and stops me for digging in my drawers to find my measuring utensils . Why did n't I think of this sooner ? One of the nicest looking and cheapest additions to my almost efficient tiny kitchen .
 I love this product ! I hestitated ordering it after reading the reviews saying that it did n't stick to textured surfaces , because that would be the only place I could use it . When I got it I loaded it up and it sticks like glue with no drifting down . I even have several things on two of the hooks . Finally I can open and shut my utensil drawer easily . The drawers in my kitchen are not deep at all and spatulas and utensils always catch , making it hard to open and shut the drawers . This has solved my problem completely . In fact , I like it so much that I ordered another one immediately . I will put one above the other on the side of the refrigerator and have all my utensils handy when cooking . Wonderful product !
 I think that these things are great . They hold five utensils on my fridge fine . Also good for holding measuring cups and spoons .
 Excellent product . We bought several types of magnets and they all worked well for different purposes . We read that this one would slide down a non-smooth refrigerator , but we have had no problem with it . The magnets are quite large and have more strength than we expected .
 These magnets are really powerful!I have them attached to the inside of a range hood , so the `` textured surface '' issue some have written about does n't apply to me.I think they are a sleep design and I am quite happy with them .
 I have metal cabinets and these magnets are outstanding ! Hold SOLIDLY to cabinets . Believe I could hang most anything on them and it would stick . Definitely recommend .
 This is an excellent product for your cooking utensils . It fits neatly on your refrigerator.Best of all it requires no nails or screws .
 I bought this and the magnetic paper towel holder . Both have very strong magnets and adhere robustly to the refrig . However , I did not have the same success with the magnetic towel holder . I later learned that there are various manufacturers of these magnetic space saving products and some make inferior ones . The magnetic hook strip -LRB- utensil holder -RRB- by Better Houseware Group is a very good product .
 The magnets on this are plenty strong enough to hold even a small frying pan . The issue is even a super strong magnet will slide down the side of the fridge -- the surface is just too slick . I secured it with a few dabs of hot glue , it 's not impossible to remove , problem solved . Maybe somebody will say , &#34; hey man just put nail polish on the back and it wo n't slide , it 's like backwards WD-40 . &#34; Do n't waste your money buying a neodymium magnet to hold this as they still slide all over the place . It 's like a bowling ball in a hockey rink .
 Got this to hold kitchen tools , whisks etc. . I read a lot of complaints about the magnets not being very strong on textured finish refrigerators . I do n't know what they were trying to hang but it works great on our textured fridge . I 'll grant you it wo n't hold a 12 '' cast iron skillet -LRB- I tried it ! -RRB- but it will hold anything within reason -LRB- at least it does for me -RRB- . I very highly recommend it .
 Great way to keep frequently used kitchen tools right at your fingertips on the side of the refrigerator . Does n't slip .
 I purchased this to hang my potholders and dish towel on since I didn &#34; t want to hang them on the stove door.the magnet is awsome it really stick to the frig .
 This super strong rack is now hanging on my fridge and it takes 2 hands to pull it off if I want to move it . I have every hook filled with cooking tools and could n't be happier . It 's also pretty . High quality !
 I read the reviews and to the ones that wrote that the magnets were n't strong enough I can only say `` What the heck were you trying to put on them ? '' I received mine today and put it straight to work . The magnets were very strong and stuck firmly to my refrigerator , which has a textured finish by the way . I hung utensils and dishcloths and aprons on it and it stuck like glue . It saved space in a space challenged kitchen and looks good while doing it . 5 stars from me . I 'll order more for friends who have the same issues .
 At my job we needed a strong magnetic hook bar to hold our commercial brand kitchen utensils which are heavy stainless steel.This hook bar is very , very strong & durable & great looking
 This is actually better than I thought it would be . The magnetics are heavy duty - but that does n't mean you can put super heavy pieces on it ! I have about 10 different utensils on this and the fact that it is on my fridge , helped me clean out a drawer !! Perfect for small kitchens !!!
 I am limited for space in cupboards , countertops and wall space . This is convient for me for extra places to put hot pads , measuring cups/spoons . etc. . Magnet is very strong .
 Looks really nice and I had no trouble putting it where I wanted . The magnets are super strong and seem to stick to any metal appliance . I really like it a lot . I highly recommend it to anyone who needs a magnetic hanger .
 I love the item , it 's just what I wanted . The rack kept slipping once I placed the utensils on it . I had to go to Home Depot to get a few additional magnets to resolve the problem . Otherwise , it 's nice !
 i bought this together with the magnetic papertowel holder . . and it works perfect . . i attached it to the side of my stove . . so it 's always handy for me ... it never slips . . stays in place securely ... thank u Amazon
 Hi . Got this item for my kitchen and thought I would use it on the metal panel over my stove since so many of the reviews stated it does n't hold on textured refrigerators -LRB- which I have -RRB- . I found out the back of my stove is plastic and not metal so I tried the fridge . It holds great . Not sure what all the comments about it falling off a textured fridge are about but in my experience it holds nice and strong . I love it .
 Absolutely UNIQUE & very useful product ... Loved it ! Safely packed & shipped quickly . Excellent seller ! Will recommend to others .
 I have a very small , old fashioned kitchen with very limited storage space as far as drawers and cabinets . There is not enough room to store my spatula 's , mixing spoons , etc. in the drawers , so I purchased 3 of these . I put 2 on the side of my refrigerator over the stove and one on the refrigerator door . This solution works for me and keeps what very limited counter space I have better organized . No more `` spatula/mixing spoon pile up '' on the counter . Also I want to mention that the magnets are very `` sticky '' and that it takes a real good yank to get them unstuck if you want to move them . Great idea , great product . Now , if they were manufactured in the USA I would have given them a 5 star rating instead of a 4 .
 I was ridiculously excited to have this thing when it came , and I got it out of the box , stuck it on the fridge , and the left side kept slipping down . I 'd fix it and the next time I was in the kitchen it had slipped again . If I still had the box I might have sent it back , but within a week it quit slipping . Do n't ask me to explain it , I 'm just the reporter here . Now it 's fine , my pot holders and measuring cups are handy , and I 'm pleased ...
 This is such a great addition to your kitchen ! The magnets are VERY strong - I 've had a hard time pulling them off actually when deciding on the best place for everything ! The hooks are semi close together , so things may not lay as pretty as you like , but function wise it 's great . These magnets are QUITE large which I was n't expecting , so just be aware . They also swivel so you can use it in different ways . We have it hanging on our exhaust for the stove , in the back , with all my measuring cups , spatulas , measuring spoons , turner and serving spoons on it . I wish I had more room in my kitchen where it could go because I 'd love to buy another one !
 I use my hook rack to hang my apron , pot holders and some cooking tools . Works quite well . Magnet is stong enough .
 We dont have a lot of space so this works great on are frig and is right next to the stove for easy use . I bought 2 more of these because they work great
 Arrived on time as described . The magnets are strong . I use it for my most used utensils and am pleased I purchased it .
 Love this product ! Holds things really well . My daughter has one and I loved hers so bought one for myself .
 Was concerned by reviews that suggest magnets are n't strong enough . But the magnets are super strong and I have it loaded with my stainless steel utensils . It was exactly what I was looking for ! Now I have my utensils right where I want them .
 Got this for my travel trailer - works great ! Space is limited so this gives me access to what I need and keeps it out of my way .
 As with the magnetic double towel rack we love this magnet hook system to hang our grilling tools and accessories . Works like a charm .
 I have an older home so some of the cupboards and drawers are in disrepair . The drawer I use for kitchen tools was overloaded and I had to come up with a solution . Since I found a few other organization items on Amazon , that 's where I searched . I found a Magnetic Hook Rack that I put on my fridge right next to the stove . AND I can put more than one item on some of the hooks . That 's what I call a really handy item ! Now they are right at my fingertips when cooking .
 I would definitely order again if necessary and especially give it as a gift . Very useful and sturdy . If you pull VERY hard it will obviously slide but the magnet is nice and strong.You should get it !
 This utensil rack has amazingly strong magnets and works just as it should . Perfect for hanging all those cool utensils I have .
 I bought my first Magnetic Utensil Hook when I moved in with my daughter . Her refrigerator was next to the stove and when I saw the magnetic utensil holder at a local store , I bought it . I was n't sure that the magnet would be strong enough to hold a bunch of utensils but it does and I have two utensils on each hook . I also bought one for my son-in-law for his BBQ and he loves it .
 This item was also ordered to get some utensils and pot holders out of much needed drawer space . Works well affixed to the side of my refrigerator . Very strong magnetic hold works well .
 Very attractive , and strong enough to hold utensils and potholders without sliding . The hooks are shaped correctly so that the utensils hang flat against the wall . Fits perfectly on the side of my microwave . Recommended !
 Ordered before I read reviews on magnets not working very well on textured surfaces - resigned myself to giving this away since it probably was going to slide down the fridge when fully loaded - but it did n't ! Although it may not hold a lot of heavier items , it 's working perfectly well for my purposes -LRB- several metal utensils and pot holders -RRB- .
 Honestly , I do n't know what people were thinking when they posted negative reviews on this product ! They clearly did n't buy the item I bought ... I currently have mine `` stuck '' on our bbq , and it 's holding 5 utensils perfectly . I used the word `` stuck , '' because when I wanted to test it on our textured fridge -LRB- another reviewer said it would n't `` stick '' there -RRB- , I had a hard time removing it from the side of the bbq , the magnets were so strong ! Needless to say , the hooks stuck perfectly to OUR textured fridge , with 5 utensils too . -LRB- Maybe the item has been re-manufactured ? Or are these naysayers just liars ? Who knows ? -RRB- Just ignore the negative peeps and get this puppy , cuz it 's super strong and does exactly what it 's supposed to do
 I bought these hooks to use on my stainless steel grill to hold my utensils while I 'm grilling , and it works perfectly . The magnets are nice and strong so they have no problem holding onto my heavy metal tongs , spatula , and other accessories . The stainless steel finish is also holding up to being outside in the Florida weather , no rust or discoloration .
 I purchased char-broil magnets for my grill to hold utensils while cooking . These hooks were too large to fit into the holding holes on most of my utensils . So I purchased this as an alternative and it worked great .
 i was looking for a magnetic rack strong enough to hold a broom and dustpan on my fridge . This one works great . I even added a duster and wisk broom . I recommend this to anyone who needs a strong magnetic rack .
 Just put this on the fridge , and I love it . It 's not too big and cumbersome , it 's sleek and low profile . I am not hanging very heavy things from it , but feel I could if I wanted to , the magnets are very strong .
 Another user suggested this product to me for my grill -LRB- also purchased on Amazon.com -RRB- in which my only complaint was the lack of utensil holders . Works great ! Magnets are very powerful and have no trouble holding large and heavy grill utensils ...
 Bought to use for storage on the side of our refrigerator . Would have given a five , but one of the magnets seems to be weaker than the other so if weight is iffy , one side tends to slide down slowly . Keep things light enough for the weakest link and product works fine .
 This little hook rack was just what I needed for my kitchen spoons . I liked it so much I bought two more for my measuring cups and spoons . They look great and work just right .
 The magnets are very powerful . I 'm using it for keys -LRB- lots of keys -RRB- but I expect it would easily hold several pots . The utensils pictured would be no challenge at all .
 All I can say is that this thing is awesome ! It is very strong and exactly what I needed . I wanted something to hang kids ' jackets on the side of a large metal desk . I wish I had enough margin in the budget to order a dozen more like it for every metal surface in the house because I can think of a lot of other ideas for how to use it . I ca n't imagine anyone being disappointed in this product .
 I purchased this along with the paper towel holder to free up some counter space . I love this rack ; it is holding up well on my textured fridge . I have each hook holding an item
 This product is perfect ! I bought two . Just what I needed to remove the clutter in my kitchen drawer . Now , my kitchen is a bit more organized , and I can actually find things .
 Anyone that wants to hang utensils from a metal/aluminum BBQ should buy this . Excellent price , magnets are strong enough to hold a decent amount of weight -LRB- do n't try to hang from it though lol -RRB- , and it complements the looks of my BBQ .
 A small box with fasteners as described . Worked just for my purpose wich was attaching some small drawer knobs.A lot cheaper than home depot at least around my house , tough I only needed 3 of them and had to buy a 100pc .
 It is what it is . The size was correct . It shipped fast and Amazon fulfilled the shipping from their warehouse so the shipping was free supposedly . I just checked the invoice and it said 7.29 shipping and handling . So I guess the super saver is n't really what it says it is , free shipping . If they start adding handling fees on it 's just like the lowlife eBay people that say free shipping and then tack on 10 bucks for handling.Other than that I wish Small parts had 1/2 '' stock . I need that too.John O'Donnell
 I 've been working on things since I was a Kid . We would spend all day taking STUFF apart , just to see What was inside . We found Springs , Steel Balls , Copper wire etc. . Yes , the old Flat and Phillips screw drivers were used a lot . I was glad when they came out with the newer types/styles of nut and screw heads and Tools . The Hex head screw shown here is a Great and reliable part . This Hex Cup is a must , in my book , if you do n't want a set screw to strip out on you . If a screw strips out you are probably looking at a lot of Down-Time , someone is going to have to pay for . This Set Screw works great and a person specially a Mechanic needs to keep an assortment of sizes on hand at all times !!! AS a Mechanic , I 've used a lot and I mean a lot of them in the Rebuilding of Mining Equipment both Underground & on Surface Equipment . When I can replace a factory screw or bolt with a Hex I will . You must use the exact Grade of metal when replacing such Bolts and Screws . Go by the Manufacture 's List of Grades needed for each Type.There is another Type/Style I Love to use , I will give Feedback on it when I Order it !!! Thanks for a Great Part .
 If color is a factor when purchasing this item , know that it is black . This item worked perfectly to lower the turn signal lights on my 2009 harley sportster 883 iron . i used it in conjunction with a 1 in . long 5/16 '' -24 coupling nut .
 I had worked and worked to get a 5/16 bolt extracted . After I got this set I was finished in about one minute . I do n't know if this is the highest quality or the strongest but it worked for me , therefore five stars . The set is in a sturdy metal case which will be very handy for storing and transporting it .
 Product is fine , nothing special , though these rods are not clean there is quite a bit of grease on 'em . However , the packaging and shipping of these to me deserves some comment . I ordered quantity 4 , each one came in a separate FedEx package , and each package is a giant cardboard tube about 2 '' diameter with 1/4 '' thick walls , inside each tube is stuffed with paper , and then another smaller plastic tube that contains the part.It will take me about an hour of work just to handle , unpack , cut up the packaging with a hacksaw -LRB- tough stuff and too big for the bin -RRB- ... would have been faster to drive to a warehouse on the edge of town where they sell stuff like this in bulk.Amazon / SmallParts -- please ship your stuff in a more sensible way .

 High quality , free machining alloy , nicely polished . Stock comes nicely packaged , and sealed from the environment so as not to get contaminated .
 Shipped :3 / 8 '' -16 7/8 '' length 100 count @ $ 1.65 . Package was labeled :1 / 4 '' -20 , 7/8 '' Length -LRB- Pack of 100 -RRB- Needed this size so am OK with it.Thanks ... Ken
 Heavy , rugged , precision hardware , and priced better than I could find anywhere else . A true bargain .
 This is a nice box of screws . I needed just this right size for some paintball applications . All the other have too wide a head to allow it to set in some recessed parts . The screws come in the box & have a thin layer of oil over each of the screws to help preserve them over time til they are ready for use .
 These not only look good but they are strong . I 'd buy these again for a future project that needed a decent quality bolt .
 These were the PERFECT match for the screws I needed for my old Atari Battlezone arcade machine handles . I do n't know if anyone else on the plant will need to know that , but if so , get these ! You will not find these in your local brick hardware store , trust me , I spent hours searching .
 Best price I have found and the screws did the job ! they seem hi quality metal and more than good enough for my needs .
 This screw was a great replacement for the screws that came with the Weaver scope mount . They were long enough to work with the NEF Pardner pump mounting . I am thoroughly happy with this purchase .

 Needed a number of these and did not like the small packages and high prices at the home center stores . Save some money buying online and quality seems fine .
 Standard size AGD type 2 indicator is very accurate . This model has hardened gears inside and 1 '' travel with removable tip . # 4-48 thread for accessories . From the at rest position to `` zero '' it out is about 15 thousands so it will retain accurate measurements and still retain the shock proof mechanism . Very smooth movement . You can feel the quality . Highly recommended .
 Great indicator , Starrett is mong the best . Movement is smooth and repeatable . The dual scale is perfect for my application of the gage .
 Works flawlessly and such a pleasure after using cheap crappy China imports . This is a lifetime precision tool . Unfortunately , most of the precision tool companies in the US are gone . Supporting Starrett is good for the US and NO ONE ever complains when using a fine tool -LRB- after the sticker shock wears off -RRB- .
 Starrett is the gold standard of precision measuring instruments . You will never be disappointed with the quality of this instrument .

 These hanger holders are heavy duty and well made . I have two and plan to buy two more . They work great .
 Exactly what you would expect from Starrett . This is accurate , easy to use , very well designed , and it feels like `` quality '' . I regularly measure plastic bag thicknesses down to 2-decimal mil thicknesses -LRB- ex . .00045 -RRB- , and this does the job well .
 High quality , free machining alloy , nicely polished . Stock comes nicely packaged , and sealed from the environment so as not to get contaminated .
 Product is fine , nothing special , though these rods are not clean there is quite a bit of grease on 'em . However , the packaging and shipping of these to me deserves some comment . I ordered quantity 4 , each one came in a separate FedEx package , and each package is a giant cardboard tube about 2 '' diameter with 1/4 '' thick walls , inside each tube is stuffed with paper , and then another smaller plastic tube that contains the part.It will take me about an hour of work just to handle , unpack , cut up the packaging with a hacksaw -LRB- tough stuff and too big for the bin -RRB- ... would have been faster to drive to a warehouse on the edge of town where they sell stuff like this in bulk.Amazon / SmallParts -- please ship your stuff in a more sensible way .

 * I bought these as a replacement for my normal duty gloves . The old pair had lasted for 25 years and finally were too worn to wear in public . * I must say that at first they fit a little too snugly . I made an effort to wear them for four or five hours and they have stretched to fit my hands . * I picked this cut of glove because they provide less of a chance of catching on my duty gear . The only thing I found was that they catch my forearm/hand hair , sometimes pulling my hair . * Beautifully made , soft , nice grip on my duty weapon .
 The gloves are a perfect fit . They do n't look or feel awkward . I would recommend them to anyone in a security/law enforcement position .
 I have owned these gloves for over 13 years of law enforcement and they are the best looking , best performing gloves I have ever owned .
 These gloves do the job . They fit great and work great and I 'd recommend them for duty use . I would n't use these for a true pat-down , but when it 's really cold these work nicely .
 Our son loved them as his Christmas gift He was looking for these for awhile . Very happy with the product - would buy again from company
 I have had this make of gloves for over ten years , during such time they dealt with biting dogs and biting people and everything in between . However after over ten years of service it was time to retire them and buy a new pair . Good quality - Good price
 I have had the same gloves before . They 're light , and last a long time . The only problem is that the fingers , especially the pinky , are tight . I wear a medium , and I think I have average size hands . Other wise great for what we use them for .
 As a Police Officer Ive used these gloves for years . Great protection from the fine upstanding citizens and scenes that Ive come in contact with . Highly recommended !!!!!
 I must say These gloves are wicked rad . The customer service was excellent due to me ordering the wrong size . they fixed the problem mid-transaction without a sweat . i 'm very very pleased . dare i say it ? ok i 'll say it . they fit like a glove ! nice . best gloves i own . and that says a lot !
 These are the greatest gloves ever.I work in a gun range for 8-10 hours a day & they hold up very wellMachine Gun Bebe

 Standard size AGD type 2 indicator is very accurate . This model has hardened gears inside and 1 '' travel with removable tip . # 4-48 thread for accessories . From the at rest position to `` zero '' it out is about 15 thousands so it will retain accurate measurements and still retain the shock proof mechanism . Very smooth movement . You can feel the quality . Highly recommended .

 Starrett is the gold standard of precision measuring instruments . You will never be disappointed with the quality of this instrument .
 The unit is accurate and works as advertised . Minor detail they DO N'T mention . You really want to calibrate it for the most accurate readings . To do this you need PH 4 and PH 7 solutions which are NOT included . Luckily I have a friend in the chem business so I got some free . Otherwise you are stuck having to buy a bottle of each . The unit does work out of the box , comes with batteries -LRB- little watch style , so will be $ $ to replace down the road , but hey the do give you batteries to start with -RRB- and does a decent job even without calibration .
 It 's only marginally more expensive than the Hanna pH Checker I had , but worth at least twice as much . The auto calibration feature works great -LRB- put it in a buffer solution , press `` Calibrate '' and it automatically detects the buffer pH level and calibrates itself -RRB- .
 I bought this for our business . Usually when inspector comes , he complains of the old PH meter that we used and it had to be calibrated manually . So , he thought that it was n't accurate and we were trying to cheat on him . Honestly , many of our staffs/chefs do n't know how to adjust up to the point . This helps so much and it automatically adjust and calibrate to the most common PH 7 and PH4 -LRB- depending on the buffer solution -RRB- . I strongly suggest to purchase this . The downside is the cost which is pretty much close to $ 90 and the not renewable part . The other model can renew the part but that model is more expensive than this . So , over all , it 's excellent and 4 stars item .
 OK , so PH meters are expensive . Most lab equipment is . If you need top of the line precision , this is n't your meter . But if you are , you are not looking for a meter on Amazon . For most of us , who need accuracy within a tenth or so , this is an amazing deal . I owned one of these , it stopped working after about 9 months , I called tech support , had a new one to me in days . Top notch service . Eventually I got tired of how long it took to get results , and getting inconsistent results on fabric . I stepped up to a $ 600 -LRB- Average Price for a low to mid level lab meter -RRB- Hanna Unit . First , Awful Customer service . Second , Exactly the same performance as my Extech ! Turns out that 's how long it takes , and that fabric itself is inconsistent . Much more expensive , and super delicate , The Probes for the Hana are between $ 150 and $ 200 to replace , broke mine in just a couple of months . Although , it turns out it was only supposed to be good for about 6-9 months anyway , before the fluid was spent . At Half the price for just a replacement Probe on the other unit , this thing is a steal -LRB- even with a $ 40 probe in 6 months , and worst case a new unit every year -RRB- , and I will not buy anything else in the future !
 Been working well for us in our indoor garden . Surprising quality for the price , definately helped figure out what is happening to our sickly tomatoes !
 Bought this to replace an HM Digital pH200 meter after going through 2 of those things in as many years . Excellent meter - fast , accurate , tells you when it needs calibration and when to get a new probe , and is water-tight . You ca n't ask for much more for the price , highly recommended . I use my meter for brewing all-grain beer and for growing hydroponic lettuce , basil , mint , and catnip . With a little care it will be a workhorse for you .
 The four stars are for the fact that when I called Extech to tell them the meter did n't work , they immediately told me to throw it away and they were sending a new one . Our problem was that it would n't hold a reading after a couple uses . The features seem good , but we will see if the next one actually works .
 Purchased for use on factory floor in routine mixing of industrial formulation . Works well and can be used by basically untrained personnel . Service life remains to be determined , initial experience is good . Made in China , but seems to be one of their better -LRB- export -RRB- products .

 High quality , free machining alloy , nicely polished . Stock comes nicely packaged , and sealed from the environment so as not to get contaminated .
 Used this product over the past several years . Their first formulation attracted dirt , even when painted . The new stuff is slightly shiny and sticky after 24 hours , but with a good acrylic paint primer , it becomes flat and nonsticky . It can be smoothed to a feather edge and pushed into a small crevice with a wet finger . Working time seems extended provided it is kept damp . I clean the extra , unwanted residue with a wet rag immediately because I do n't think paint sticks as well to a flat surface covered with a hazing of this product .
 Bought this paintable silicone siding caulking material because of the temperature range where I live - 0 to 105 deg . F through out the year , with some rain and snow . So far I have opened the cartridge and applied the caulk into the spaces between siding ends and around windows . These are spaces that I took old caulk out of . The caulk comes out of the cartridge easily -LRB- not too hard on the hand/arm and not too runny -RRB- . I applied green masking tape on each side of where the caulk is applied , used a puddy knife for siding or rubber gloved finger for windows to smooth the surface , then after several minutes I pulled up the tape . It leaves a straight line on each of the caulk . Looks great after painting . I usually waited till the next day to paint the caulk . Also , the cartridge comes with a pull off , stick-on cap that really works well . After each use you stick the cap on and when you are ready to use the tube again the cap comes right off and the caulk follows like it was new . Now , it has ** not ** been a year since I put this stuff on so I do n't know how well it will hold up over time so the 5 star rating is based on opening the tube , installing the caulk and painting over it . Thats it so far .

 Our Son asked for this product for Christmas , researched reviews on Amazon and chose the Extech RF20 . Our Son has a small 3-gallon captive coral reef . His exact words after using about a week ... Mom this works awesome !!!!
 I 'm using this unit to measure the salinity in my fish tank and for the first time I really know the real value of this important parameter . At first I was using a regular plastic hydrometer and was trusting the results I was getting , but then I bought a second hydrometer and the readings were totally different from the first one . That 's when I realized that I needed more precision , and this unit is of course more expensive , but the accuracy you get is worth the extra money . It turned out that the salinity in my tank was way too high and was the reason for several problems I was having with the aquarium . The unit it 's extremely easy to calibrate , all you need is destilled water and 10 seconds of your time , and is also very easy to use .
 It showed up out of the box calibrated and has n't needed any adjustment . The entire unit seems solidly built , and is very easy to use .
 This refractometer is great for keeping track of the salinity of my brackish puffer fish tank . Very accurate , and the price was great ! No need to look for something more expensive . This was a great buy and I would definitely recommend it to anyone .
 First let me say this is an absolutely excellent product . I finally know the exact salinity of my tanks in seconds . There are some great things that come with this Refractometer that are not mentioned in description . It comes with a little bottle of distilled water as well as a mini flat head screw driver to calibrate before your first use . It also comes with a nice mini microfiber cloth to wipe the prism between uses . This is by far the most accurate way to measure the salinity of your tanks water and I can assure you that you will not be disappointed .
 Worked awesome and easy to use . My 12 year old daughter used it for her science project . Well made !
 I used a hydrometer before this and noticed I always got 1.026 even when I have n't put in water for daily evaporation and then my anemone died and as soon as I got this it said my salinity was at 1.030 , very close to killing everything . Very accurate , very easy to use , not messy and does n't spill water every where like hydrometers do . Love it and plan on buying another if I ever need to .
 NICE . Well made , easily calibrated , very easy to use , nice case , ACCURATE . This is the one I 'd suggest for aquarist . WAY better than a lousy hydrometer , spend the 90 $ , well worth it .
 The refractometer came with calibration fluid and cleaning cloth . The unit was already calibrated when arrived , and it works great !
 This product is well built , it is so accurate and it is so easy to use . Calibration is simple . All you do is put a few drops of RO water on the lens one time and you are good to go . Awesome product , I highly recommend this item .
 I purchased this item 5-6 years ago . I use it once a year during grape harvest to take test samples of machine picked grapes and it has been accurate to .1 of a brix on every load that was tested . Taking your crop to a market that requires certain sugar standards in order to pass , this has been a highly valuable instrument and more than pays for itself after one season . Yes , I highly recommend this product , it has been extremely accurate in regards to the more expensive commercial type digital refractometers .
 I highly recommend this product to people who need to check sugar level in grapes to make wine by itself at home . You can check sugar level in wine , when it finishes boiling or during boiling . It works great !!!
 Exactly as listed and in perfect condition . Does the job easily . Have a home set up and have spent a lot creating my own wine . This was an excellent price for great quality that works !
 This refractometer is much cheaper than a lot of them , but is of excellent quality . Works as well for checking the Brix of grapes as my old one , which someone stole . Very pleased with it .
 This thing is super easy to use , and so much better than a stupid hydrometer . Nice to be able to check SG quickly while sparging instead of waiting for samples to cool .
 I use this refractometer for hard apple cider and wine making . Very simple to use , pretty accurate -LRB- do n't expect to be able to read to the tenth of a Brix -RRB- and comes in a good box convenient to carry and protect the device.Highly recommended for the price .
 This is an easy product to review . It was inexpensive to buy and it works . I 've had it about 6 years now and I 've `` trained '' lots of people to use it . Training takes about 3-5 seconds . The carry case does not close . It never did , but the refractometer works great .
 High quality , free machining alloy , nicely polished . Stock comes nicely packaged , and sealed from the environment so as not to get contaminated .
 I work as a custodian for a public school system . The new building has a chiller system for cool air . I need to be able to monitor the glycol concentration for proper operation . The Extech RF40 comes with excellent instructions and is easy to calibrate and use . All this at what I feel is a very fair price .
 As an RV tech , I use this tool to check the specific gravity of the house and chassis batteries on any RV that I am working on . Much more accurate than just using a DC Volt meter or hydrometer . Easy and quick to use . I can check all of the cells in just a few minutes . Highly recommended to anyone who deals with lead-acid batteries on a regular basis !
 Bought for use at my off-grid solar powered vacation home.Much easier to take and record accurate specific gravity readings on my batteries . With this easy to use tool I 'll be more diligent about watching out for my batteries ' health.Recommended .

 Used this to reseal my black kitchen counter backsplash . Applied a generous bead , since it shrinks on drying . Milky white for several days , then crystal clear when fully cured - like magic . The white color makes it easy to see what you are applying . It 's extremely flexible - excellent for joints that may experience some movement . Water cleanup and you can apply additional coats if needed . It does come in colors as well , if that 's what you need .
 I think that the reviewer that wrote that this product is not clear should read the label before being negative . You will find that the clear polyseamseal will actually be white for up to two weeks depending on the weather and humidity levels before turning clear . The reason I assume is so you can actually see where the seal was made and not leave parts of your project unsealed.I have been useing Polyseamseal products for several years and am very satisfied with the products . The tub and tile is particularly a great product . I previously was useing a silicone product around my tub and shower walls and finding that I had mildew growth within six months . I started searching for a product that was n't silicone based and found Polyseamseal Tub and Tile . This stuff gives me about two years or a little more before it starts to show small dark areas which is the start of a mold or mildew problem . At this point I remove part or all of it and reapply it . This process is easy and only takes less than an hour . The biggest problem is that you have to wait 24 hours before exposeing it to water.As far as the ALL-PURPOSE polyseamseal goes , I have been extremely happy with it . As a matter of fact , just today I looked at a rear basement window that I replaced the mouldings around on the outside . I would guess that I did the project six or eight years ago and the clear Polyseamseal looks great and still feels flexible.I would and have recommended this product to friends and family .

 This was the most economical way to buy this material , a great price combined with free shipping beat all the competition by a large margin.The only drawback is I do n't think Amazon stocks this size any longer .

 My wife and I do a haunted house each year for the last 14 years and invariably there is a need for last minute sticking stuff together.I find duck/duct tape very helpful when you have the time to ensure that the color wo n't be seen and the surfaces are mostly dry and ready to adhere . For some reason I have trouble with using it on an emergency basis regularly , whether it 's because something is a little wet or the color or just not being able to cut/rip it well.The black gaffer 's tape is more expensive but always my go-to item for repairs that need to be made quickly and reliably during the performances .
 After being burned by other brands of gaffers tape , this is by far the best ! Low reflectivity , very strong , and easy to tear . I 'd say it blocks out about 99 % of light .
 Bought a roll of this about 4 years ago , and finally used the last of it on a project . I finished the project using black duct tape - it is awful ! I did not realize how spoiled I have become by using gaffers tape . Ordered another roll from Amazon , read the reviews of some cheaper brands , and decided to stick with Pro Tapes Pro-Gaff - same great tape I bought 4 years ago , and I 'm a happy camper !
 I wanted gaffers tape to assist in muffling my drum heads , and this roll does the job . Seems good quality .
 I worked with this stuff for years . I went and `` adopted '' a roll from where I worked . They had a superfluous amount anyway so they did n't notice . It cuts easily and goes a long way . We used it for cables , spiking and randomly taping stuff on walls back stage . The only bad thing is I am running low D
 Love this stuff . It 's worth every penny ! I 've used gaffers tape in MANY ways . I just ordered a roll and used half of it at a photo gig to tape some light stands to concrete pillars -LRB- which allowed me not to extend the legs and take up space and cause a tripping hazard -RRB- . I 've used this stuff for years in many capacities - video productions , photoshoots , pro audio applications and even to cover the entire back passenger window on my car after it had been completely busted out by theif.I 've taped to painted walls , carpet , dresses , very hot light fixtures , audio and power cables , metal , painted metal , people , etc. . It 's awesome 99.9 % of the time and never leaves residue unless it 's your fault ... A few things to keep in mind : This does n't play well with moisture , but with the idea that it 's main design is for things that are electrical and/or electronic , that 's never been a huge issue for me anyway - just means you have to be careful on wet surfaces.This tape does n't play well with paper - I used it on seamless paper photo backdrops and it almost always pulls paper fibers up with it . Again , never been a huge deal.The only time I 've ever had this stuff leave residue was leaving it on stuff for VERY long periods of time and having them get heated , cooled , heated , cooled , etc. for a year or two first.I will say that I 've torn of this tape , stuck it to insides and outsides of photo bags , lighting bags and video bags and been able to remove and USE IT even a year or two after application - and it works like new when I do that !
 This tape rocks , has great strength , easy to tare a piece off but is super strong . Great for cable wrapping or almost whatever really . Love it , I got 10 rolls . : -RRB-
 Having tried several less expensive options , this is the only way to go . Excellent adhesion , good strength , and extremely low residue , even on cables
 We purchased the gaffers tape because it was good tape for our purposes . For the cost we were able to getmore tape to serve our uses .
 Pro gaff is better than all other gaff tape on the market . I am speaking with years of experience in the AV industry .
 Not cheap , but good gaff tape . Would purchase again . . It 's not the `` best '' , but it 's the next best thing ! Lol . Better than the cheap stuff ... U get what u pay for . This is also the house gaff tape they use @ the beau Rivage casino resort in Biloxi ... Played on that stage many times , they only use quality stuff there ... That 's why I bought pro gaff .
 It 's not duct tape . It 's Gaff . They are not interchangeable , and this is the stuff you want.Holds great , comes off clean . Dark black . Holds better -LRB- and longer -RRB- than duct tape .
 I used this stuff with our band , setting up a a different venue each time we play . This brand of gaff tape is top notch . My only complaint is the stuff is so darned expensive . I 've tried other less expensive substitutes and was always disappointed . This stuff tears easily , is super strong , stays put , and does n't leave a bit of residue .
 I have duct tape for heavy duty taping and 3M Blue tape for painting . However , I needed a heavy duty tape that can be removed when a job is finished without leaving adhesive residue . The gaffers tape fills this niche .
 I do a lot of spot welding on sheet metal fabrication . These Flap Disc work great . They they remove the flash from the spot weld and leave a nice surface good enough for powder coating .
 first off i could of purchased a new 0-1 '' mic for a few extra bucksthe micrometer i received was a starret and the serial number dated back to the 60si use this on turbine jobs and other crucial measuring and as old as this now vintage mic is it has not changed a bit and works as good as out of the box new , all it take proper care and it will last a life time buy it once !
 I have been using this set to bore 1.5 '' holes in structural steel with good results . The set is of Chinese manufacture , but it seems to be made well enough . The shanks are precision ground and the brazed carbide tips seem secure . Some of the machine work on the business end of the bars is coarse and obviously done by hand , but these complaints are just cosmetic . The set works just fine .
 I use these bits for plug boring on ipe . Best ones I can find . Need six more words bro head .
 Delrin is a great plastic for turning on a machine lathe . It is easy to turn , but it requires slow speeds . I use this stuff to make Scottish smallpipes chanters . I have purchased numerous items from Small Parts via Amazon . Small Parts always ships promptly and everything has been well packed . I have never had a problem with an order . Best of all Small Parts honors Amazon Prime -- free 2-day shipping .
 I bought a chunk of this material to make a reading stylus . I know it is n't recommended to use a stylus for speed reading , but I use one , it seems to act as a sort of ` momentum ' to keep me moving . I wanted some kind of plastic that would slide smoothly over the pages and I found it . This material is light weight and exhibits low friction , yet does n't wear inordinately . It worked easily enough on my wood lathe for the short piece I was turning , but it did tend to bend rather too easily for turning . You have to keep your length/width ratio pretty thick . I went ahead and bought the three foot piece -LRB- stylus only five inches -RRB- and I 'm sure I 'll find other useful applications for the remainder . Good stuff . Too the price from this supplier was something unusual , FAIR !
 Used this as tuning set for the mridangam , cut into 3.5 '' pieces . ideal replacement for wooden pegs .
 Acetal Round Rod , 2 '' OK - 12 '' length.I received this and a 1 '' x 12 '' piece of this product for use making jig bearings and slides for my woodworking project . Each piece was found to be of uniform thickness as expected and perfect for use in my shop .
 I 'm turning this stuff on a lathe to make different items from it . Machines decently enough , even for a novice .
 I received a hammered dulcimer as a gift . It had 2 missing plastic inserts to hold up the sire strings . This plastic tube fit the bill just right .
 Easy to machine on a hobby lathe -LRB- Harbor Freight -RRB- and inexpensive as well . I 've made bushings for bicycles and motorcycles . With the addition of this material to my inventory , my lathe has paid for itself
 Had a need for my halloween costume ... something to act as a low-friction pivot . This did the trick ! I have a little left and hope to find a project to use it on soon .
 Use this stuff to make non-maring punches and push tools in my machine shop . I did n't think it was hard enough , but is very durable . Worth the price I paid . Wish I could find some flat sheets that is as affordable .
 I have not used this acetal rod as of yet , but it is exactly what I expected . I anticipate excellent results when I use it .
 I milled pieces of this to replace the sissy plastic cleaning sticks that come with rental band instruments . My daughters band class has been quite happy w the results .
 Excellent price for a piece of hexagon brass bar . I used approximately 14 inches for a shift rod linkage on a custom chopper project . I had enough left over for the next project
 Nylon 6/6 Flat Washers # 8 0.177 '' ID 0.408 '' OD 0.062 ' thick washers for isolation from ground or vibration of screw heads . Pack of 100 round washers are handy for new installations where vibration from screwed source needs to be isolated from Hold down .
 These are nice , thick , strong nylon washers . They 're perfect for use with nylon bolts . Probably would work well with metal bolts on a project where you do n't want to mar the joined material .
 They are exactly what one would expect - work and fit as advertised . We used them for a project involving microwaves .
 These washers are the washers in the picture and function as such . Really not much to say other than they are as described .
 Seem to be fine . Used them as spacers for prototype Li-ion batteries . Nylon holds up well in glycol-based electrolytes . Not sure about long-term stability though .
 These washers are awesome . Yes ... an awesome nylon washer . I really needed to find a specific washer material and thickness , and these were perfect . I have found no defects , they are the correct thickness and size and they look great -LRB- no flashing or uneven thickness -RRB- . I have used around 30 of these with no problems , it 's great to find a product on Amazon that is perfect for my needs , and is delivered as described . I would definitely order these again !
 Bought these to attach screws through metal cabinet into wood subfranme so as not to damage paint on cabinet , work fine .
 Nylon Flat Washers , what else can I say ? They are flat made of nylon and have a hole in the middle ...
 I have 2 Miniature Schnauzers with bladder and kidney stones . I decided to purchase pH test strips to monitor their urine at home rather than paying $ 22 each time at the veterinarian 's office , especially since one has become very ill and requires daily testing and subcutaneous fluid replacement based on the results of pH and specific gravity testing of her first morning urine . I 've tried several kinds and so far this is the most accurate and easy to use.Ph Test Strips Dispenser - .2 Intervals for Accurate Saliva or Urine PH Testing - Immediate ResultsThere 's another type that a first seemed more economical because it came with 2 sets of tape , but the increments were 0.5 instead of this one 's 0.2 increments , so for Leilani 's sake this is better for her management.Pros for this item are : * The item description is correct ; the results are immediate . * Results are the same as testing done at the vet 's lab . * Less vet visits for the dogs ; the vet and I have set up protocols for how much fluid to give based on the results , so it saves me $ $ $ in the long run . * The 0.2 increments allow better management of their treatment than guessing at the 0.5 measurements , as well as accuracy comparable to lab results * Refills are available through Amazon.Cons
 Easy to use and it is easy to judge results using this ph paper . Saved me a trip to the vet !
 The picture is very deceiving on this product only because there isnt anything to compare its size to . the container that holds the roll is about the size of a fifty cent piece . you can use a smaller piece of the tape then it recommends but if you are doing the urine test i recommend wearing gloves since the tape is like tissue paper and the urine travels quickly !
 The dispenser is a lot smaller than I thought . It works well and gets the job done . I would order a different one .
 When I ordered this product , I was n't sure if it was good value , or a waste of money . There was really only one way to find out for sure , so I took the plunge , and voila ! I hit `` Pay dirt . `` This product was delivered faster than `` On time '' and does exactly what it is advertised to do . I have determined that it is a fair value . If it were a `` steal of a deal '' , something would be wrong , and I probably would have wasted money.Yes , I wish it were less expensive , but the fact is the price is competitive and the company selling it has to make a profit . If they did n't , they would be gone and I could n't get the product , which gives me good insight into my overall physical condition and susceptibility to medical problems.I am happy with the truthful advertising , fair price and great delivery . I am willing to buy this product again .
 I was happy with this product . It worked very well . i am able to monitor myself now and keep myself in check.Was very easy to use .
 They also included a sample of one of their health foods as well as other valuable related informetion .
 The PH Strips were a good value and the service was very good . The strips were delivered very quickly and just as described .
 I thought I was getting a reserve dispenser with this , but it 's a different type than the last one I got . It does n't seem to work quite as well and the strips are thicker , making fewer pieces . It 's fine for what I need it for , but a bit disappointing cost-wise .
 This product works great . I know instantly my ph levels . Colors show very clearly . I 've had other papers that did n't work at all .
 ... easy to use , convenient , quick results , graduated comparative test , cost effective , great for those striving for a more healthy alkaline diet/lifestyle
 These pH strips are great and are a great value . I 've bought some for friends and they all enjoy keeping track of their pH levels .
 I recommend these if you want to check pH. Sometimes , in between colors for reading , but gets the job done . This is a good price , under $ 10 . Fun to check pH of things like toothpaste , shampoo , HBA products , etc.It is good to eat an alkalizing diet like fresh fruits & vegetables . Lots of good books out there on the subject .
 I use it to test the PH of my saliva . It does exactly what I wanted it to do.Nothing fancy just a simple way to test PH
 I am concern with checking my PH balance each morning and I needed 5trips that would give me instant reading . These strips are it . They work very will . I am Please .
 Very easy to use . It is good to have something that can give results immediately . Also , I am glad it is not a precut strip . You can cut only the piece that you need . . Glad I bought this product .
 I check my number every day and this little ph strip is a wonder . It really lets me know from day to day or morning to evening how my alkaline diet is doing or not doing . I can tell what foods really work and what foods really need to be avoided . I just put it into my mouth for a second or two and check . I know websites say you need a blood test or such to be 100 % accurate on one 's ph but this little gauge does a good job from a day to day level in giving me a good idea how good I am doing or how poorly I am doing . If I eat something strong in corn syrup sweetener -LRB- example pumpkin pie or some fruit juices -RRB- my number the next day or later that evening has dropped . This is an excellent way to help anyone realize how they are doing with the alkaline diet or how badly they are acid . Cancer can not live in an alkaline body so I am really interested in making sure I keep a strong alkaline body with my veggies , fruit , and beans -- the natural diet . The processed diet of packaged `` foods '' , high processed juices , and strong corn based diets is a one way ticket to the acid body and acid reflux problems and a future life heading toward cancer , the end product of an acid diet . So I will continue to buy these strips . I 'm always elated to see my numbers in the 8 and higher colors ; those cultures with alkaline water as a lifestyle have body ph 's of 8 + and have no cancer and live healthy lifestyles well into their 90 's disease free . So that is my goal . This summer marks my first year of being strong alkaline and my body behaves so much different than other years of my life . It is an amazing difference from the high acid diet I used to life on . These strips have made it very clear what works and what does n't and cued me when I did n't eat right and what the price tag was or would be eventually . The differences in how my body works and behaves now is incredible for the diet changes made .
 I 've never tried any other brand of ph strips so I really have nothing to compare to but these little things are great . I really like that you can choose your own size . I use a tiny little square about an hour after every meal -LRB- like another reviewer said -RRB- to see how what I previously ingested affects my alkalinity . Also test the first pee of the day -LRB- they say that 's the most accurate representation of your alkalinity -RRB- . It 's kind of fun experimenting to see which foods make you more alkaline and more acidic -LRB- although it 's kind of a no-brainer of you know your nutrition -RRB- . The fact that it is a roll and not a bunch of paper sticks was my sell point . I feel like I 'm getting more bang for my buck . It also comes with a replacement roll which I think is really nice too . But if your anything like me and use the smallest piece possible you probably wo n't need that second roll for quite a while .
 They work , I get accurate results . They 're a great tool in managing my Ph balance .
 This product seems very sensitive and easier to read that other PH testing products . The fact you can get your reading instantly helps too . The only disadvantage is that if the roll gets wet , it is useless . Only wet the piece you are using to test.Anne Cecil
 This is great , especially for frugal folks like myself . I received it quickly . It 's a roll of PH test strips in a sturdy plastic dispenser which has a PH legend on it . You just have to tear off a tiny strip , although the directions instruct using a one inch strip , less can be used . I have probably used it enough times to equal to buying a couple of packages of the test strips with the white `` handles '' and I still have lots of the roll left . I highly recommend this . I think it 's fun to use , too ! It 's great to get a product that exceeds expectations .
 This is exactly what I need . It is easy to read , and I like the fact that you can tear off as large or as small a piece as you want .
 My only misgiving towards this product is that it is n't idiot-proof . I find it difficult , due to ` user interface error ' . Works though .
 This is by far the easiest and fastest way to test pH that I 've found . No calibrating solutions or tiny screws to adjust and no special storage requirements . Very easy to use and it 's cheap , there are a lot of uses on that roll .
 This is exactly what I was looking for . It was received how & when I expected . I 'm happy with this purchase .
 i have been using it for a while and i got ta say i enjoy this product . the lense itself is kinda small but the quality of the magnification and the lack of paralax is a huge plus when working with things like minerals . i dig it .
 very nice clearity . small , small view view hole . wish i could get this quality of lense with a 30x and with 1 '' view opening . that would be sweet
 *** EDIT 7/9/12 12:00 PM *** Well , I posted this review a couple of hours ago , and also notified Amazon about the issue .

 If you are trying to fix the XBOX3360 3RROD issue and you do n't have the equipment to re-flow the board ; then these are the steel washers to use . You would want to use these in conjunction with the following items to achieve the best results : Nylon Flat Washer , DIN , M5 , 5.30 mm ID , 11.00 mm OD , 1mm Thick -LRB- Pack of 100 -RRB- -LRB- Granted you do n't need 100 , but this will give you the specs you need.Stainless Steel 18-8 Metric Phillips Pan Head Machine Screw M5-0 .8 x 12mm Length -LRB- You should be able to get these at your local hardware store . -RRB- Arctic Silver 5 High-Density Polysynthetic Silver Thermal Compound 12g/3cc Tube -LRB- Get this if you plan on doing quite a few RROD repairs ; otherwise you can just get the smaller 5g tube . -RRB- With all of that stuff you should be well on your way to getting your xbox360 back up and running .
 I like ordering large quantity of parts from Amazon because of the great pricing , and these washers are no exception . However , I do wish Amazon would package small parts like these a little better . It came in a small cardboard box that was taped shut , but the small washers were apt to slip out the side . Other items , such as nuts were packaged in a sealed bag that ensured they would n't get lost.Regardless , I 'll still give the product itself 5-stars because they 're good quality , good quantity , and at a good price .
 I 've been working on things since I was a Kid . We would spend all day taking STUFF apart , just to see What was inside . We found Springs , Steel Balls , Copper wire etc. . Yes , the old Flat and Phillips screw drivers were used a lot . I was glad when they came out with the newer types/styles of nut and screw heads and Tools . The Hex head screw shown here is a Great and reliable part . This Hex Cup is a must , in my book , if you do n't want a set screw to strip out on you . If a screw strips out you are probably looking at a lot of Down-Time , someone is going to have to pay for . This Set Screw works great and a person specially a Mechanic needs to keep an assortment of sizes on hand at all times !!! AS a Mechanic , I 've used a lot and I mean a lot of them in the Rebuilding of Mining Equipment both Underground & on Surface Equipment . When I can replace a factory screw or bolt with a Hex I will . You must use the exact Grade of metal when replacing such Bolts and Screws . Go by the Manufacture 's List of Grades needed for each Type.There is another Type/Style I Love to use , I will give Feedback on it when I Order it !!! Thanks for a Great Part .
 If color is a factor when purchasing this item , know that it is black . This item worked perfectly to lower the turn signal lights on my 2009 harley sportster 883 iron . i used it in conjunction with a 1 in . long 5/16 '' -24 coupling nut .
 I use these for EZB and F1L o-rings . It beats slicing them from tubes . There are other sizes that may be more appropriate for other model classes using thicker motors .
 Came as described , used them to adjust triggers on xbox controllers ! I know it 'll be forever before I need to get more , but i 'd order these again in a heartbeat !
 These set screws were impossible to find at local big box stores , and even at local hardware stores , but -LRB- of course -RRB- they were easy to find on Amazon . They are of good quality , with nicely formed threads and a uniform black oxide coating . Note that they have a 1/16 '' hex key socket in the head .
 These Set Screws are manufactured well . The coating is consistent and I did not have any issues with deformed Allen Wrench recesses . I would order these fasteners again .
 I needed a couple of small setscrews and nothing remotely near this size was available locally . Enter Amazon , and their partner , Small Parts . I now have PLENTY of these setscrews for a very reasonable price , they were delivered promptly , and the only problem I had was that I did n't try buying online before I drove all over town looking in vain for these little screws .
 Brighton Best bolts are reliably well made , with clean threads , good finish , and hold up . The black Oxide keeps them from rusting .

 Used this as tuning set for the mridangam , cut into 3.5 '' pieces . ideal replacement for wooden pegs .
 Acetal Round Rod , 2 '' OK - 12 '' length.I received this and a 1 '' x 12 '' piece of this product for use making jig bearings and slides for my woodworking project . Each piece was found to be of uniform thickness as expected and perfect for use in my shop .
 I 'm turning this stuff on a lathe to make different items from it . Machines decently enough , even for a novice .
 I received a hammered dulcimer as a gift . It had 2 missing plastic inserts to hold up the sire strings . This plastic tube fit the bill just right .
 Easy to machine on a hobby lathe -LRB- Harbor Freight -RRB- and inexpensive as well . I 've made bushings for bicycles and motorcycles . With the addition of this material to my inventory , my lathe has paid for itself

 These are very nice flip flops . Several people have told me how cool the design looks on the shoe . I would say you might want to order a size up . Because I had to go one size up , and even then it was a close fit .
 I 'm your typical Californian . Lived up north in Santa Cruz , CA for a while , and learned how to really wear shorts , t-shirts , and sandals . Now I 'm addicted ! I ca n't walk around without sandals and shorts anymore , just does n't feel right.Anyhow , I ordered these guys because my old pair was wearing out . -LRB- The strap actually broke while I was driving , super lame . -RRB- These are pretty nice , casual sandals . Very lightweight , thin , and stylish . They do n't require any breaking in , they feel really comfortable at first wear . They are n't stiff , and bend nicely with your foot.I 'm giving them 4 out of 5 stars because I actually prefer a slightly thicker sandal . This will probably wear out within 2 months of everyday usage . They are definitely worth purchasing if you want something simple and stylish to wear around .
 This is a great all leather sandal . Very comfortable and perfect fit by size .
 Great leather flip flops ! Bought them for my husband and he really likes them . Great look , great fit . I wear Reef 's Ginger flip flops and want a pair like this too !
 Like the sandals , but unless you like them short and narrow SIZE UP ! I typically wear a 10.5 in most shoes . I sized up to an 11 and they were too small . Returned them and ordered a 12 .
 This is the second pair of the smoothies I have owned . I have nerve damage in my feet and many shoes cause my feet to ache . These are always comfortable from day one and the way the conform and fit my feet causes them to feel relaxed .
 These look like a good quality flip flop . It 's still winter , have n't had a chance to try them out yet .
 Just what I was looking for ! They look great and they 're very comfortable ! Sizing seems true to size . Not too big , not too small .
 I have loved Reef sandals from the womb , but I finally convinced my husband to try them ! He was comfortable from the moment he put them on and even said they are the only flip flops he will buy from now on also !!
 Im very happy with this sandal . Soft and confortable . With sandals its different size chart . if you are 10.5 you have to purchase 10 not 11 .
 This was ordered for a 18 year old teenager , who loves them . They were delivered on time , and kept me informed with emails from the time I paid for until they were delivered to my door . Would order this product again .
 I was so happy when I found these flip flops for so cheap . I looked around the malls and searched store to store and found nothing close to this price . I bought them for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves them . He wears them every day . I am so happy .
 These Reef Sandals are probably the fourth pair that I 've owned . I got my first pair as a gift from a girlfriend and I 've liked them , ever since . This pair has been the most comfortable pair that I have owned so far . They are extremely lightweight . This pair may not offer the same support as some of the thicker , heavier plastic sandals but , the lightweight and smooth leather insoles more than make up for it . They just feel great to wear . They are great sandals and they are extremely versatile . You can wear them anywhere and they look stylish and comfy . So far , all my Reef Sandals have proven to be comfortable , stylish , durable and relatively long-lasting . If they get a little dirty , just wash them , let them air-dry and they look almost new again.I recommend Reef sandals / flip-flops for guys and girls . There 's a great selection of girl 's and guy 's Reef Sandals . They also look great on the girls and they seem to love them too , especially here in FL where they can basically be worn year-round . They make a great gift for that special girl in your life . You ca n't go wrong by buying a girl a pair of shoes , they can never have too many pairs , right ? LOL : - -RRB-
 I have sweaty feet and have found that this is the only sandal -LRB- Reef Smoothy -RRB- that my sweaty feet will not slide out of when it is hot and I am walking . Plus they are comfortable , durable , and last for years . I have had one of my pears for seven years now and still wear them .
 im the kinda guy who wears flip flops 24/7 even in winter and these things seem very durable and fit to your feet well and i have very flat feet . However there are very obvious marks where my toes are they just look like wear and tear of leather and kind of add to the look i think . all in all these are aweesome flip flops and i would recommend them to anyone
 The most amazing flip flop a guy will ever wear . I wear a size 12 in other flips , but got a size 13 in these . Right out of the box they felt awesome - a few days of wearing and they were AMAZINGLY AWESOME ! They are so darn comfortable it is unbelievable . Plus the styling goes so well with both shorts , or in the cooler weather a pair of jeans.Don ' t waste money on more expensive flip flops when these guys go the distance . Remember guys , order one size up for best fit .
 Just got my pair and I love them . Well made , exactly the same color as I ordered , and they 're some of the most comfortable shoes I own . Ca n't go wrong here , so I 'm not sure where the negative reviews are coming from . I hesitated before buying because of some of the weird feedback on this site , but I 'm glad I went ahead with it . Great purchase . I wear size 10.5 , ordered size 11 , they fit perfectly . Love them .
 The slippers are true to the size and really comfortable . I only buy reef slippers because there good quality and last a long time .
 These sandals are just as better than my last pair of Rainbows at half the price . They look and feel awesome , and they are super comfy . The fit is exactly the same as a nike running shoe .
 Reef sandals are the only way to go ! Comfortable and stylish ! Great transaction ! Great price , product , and service . Amazon is a great place to shop !
 I ordered the Bronze/Brown leather Reefs to wear while working from home . They have a lighter-colored tread which does n't leave marks on our lighter colored carpet . They are very comfortable and very well built . I went with the recommendation of ordering one size larger than I normally wear . I usually wear a size 12 Asics shoe . Therefore , I ordered a size 13 reef sandal . They fit perfectly !
 I bought these for my boyfriend , who loved them . They do run a bit small . He wears an 11 1/2 and the 12 fit comfortably . Attractive and stylish as brown flip flops go .
 It 's good to know that if you 're considering this particular sandal , that the soles are thinner than some other Reef 's out there . That said , these feel and fit great as expected !
 Comfortable while walking , but bit soft sole and good apperance too , if u like soft sole i would recommend this
 They look great and should be even better once I break them in . They are on the smaller size when it comes to length . If you where a size 11 , your heel will be very close to the edge . So if you prefer to have a little bit more space between the heel and the back of the flop I would go a half size bigger . For me I prefer my heel to be almost flush with the back so I am happy with the product .
 Purchased for my son ; it 's a good looking slide that looks good on his feet . Great for easy days around the house or beach .
 The flip flops are fantastic , we love this brand . What 's not to like ? Comfy and casual - great year round footwear for Florida .
 not the exact color I thought it was but they are my favorite type of sandals.The only thing that would make it a 5 is if they added a bottle opener and a secret key compartment .
 I 've worn leather sandals for years that ranged from $ 10 at Target that last about 6 months then fall apart to nicer Rainbows at $ 45 that last a year or so . These sandals are by far the most comfortable I 've owned and have lasted 6 months so far with no problems ! Great purchase with years of use to come !
 Exactly what I thought I ordered . Very nice sandals . Had to exchange for a bigger size but this was my mistake .
 These flip flops are divine . The name is n't misleading at all -- the footbed is as smooth as can be . The straps are short enough that your feet do n't really `` flip '' or `` flop '' when walking , and durable enough that they do n't stretch . I have been complaining about stretching issues with reefs for years , but these do n't have that problem . Overall a great buy.Note
 This is my first leather sandal by Reef and it is growing on me . You need to break it in , unlike their other Reef sandals that are really comfortable from the getgo . This one is becoming more comfortable as I wear it . I am still not taking long walks but it might become one of my favorites .
 Really comfortable sandals . The bottom is sort of falling off though and I 've only had them for about three months .
 What more can be said about Reef Flip Flops ... Excellent quality , comfortable , looks great with shorts or pants . Ca n't go wrong . Perfect fit .
 I bought these for my husband ... he has n't worn them yet -LRB- they 're a Christmas gift -RRB- , but I 'm really hopeful that they 'll hold up to his abuse ! LOL : -RRB-
 These are the most confortable sandals i 've ever worn ! They are super durable . Would n't get anything other than reefs . Also look into their bottle opener sandals !
 Compr&eacute; estas sandalias para un regalo de cumplea & ntilde ; os de mi hermano , y cuando las recib&iacute; me gustaron mucho son de muy buena calidad y muy c&oacute;modas bastante suaves , el cuero el da un buen estilo . Las recomiendo yo quiero unas !
 Light and confortable style , leather look , strong design , also , arrived pretty soon ; they look bigger than they are . Good deal .
 First time wearing these I spent all day walking around Boston . Super comfy , and no issues . The last time I bought sandals I broke them in walking around Philadelphia and ended up getting blisters . Not the case this time , they even got wet and are still going strong .
 I received exactly what I ordered . They are of same quality of Reef 's that I 've bought in the store.My husband has worn them for over a month now and he has no complaints .
 I 've been working on things since I was a Kid . We would spend all day taking STUFF apart , just to see What was inside . We found Springs , Steel Balls , Copper wire etc. . Yes , the old Flat and Phillips screw drivers were used a lot . I was glad when they came out with the newer types/styles of nut and screw heads and Tools . The Hex head screw shown here is a Great and reliable part . This Hex Cup is a must , in my book , if you do n't want a set screw to strip out on you . If a screw strips out you are probably looking at a lot of Down-Time , someone is going to have to pay for . This Set Screw works great and a person specially a Mechanic needs to keep an assortment of sizes on hand at all times !!! AS a Mechanic , I 've used a lot and I mean a lot of them in the Rebuilding of Mining Equipment both Underground & on Surface Equipment . When I can replace a factory screw or bolt with a Hex I will . You must use the exact Grade of metal when replacing such Bolts and Screws . Go by the Manufacture 's List of Grades needed for each Type.There is another Type/Style I Love to use , I will give Feedback on it when I Order it !!! Thanks for a Great Part .
 If color is a factor when purchasing this item , know that it is black . This item worked perfectly to lower the turn signal lights on my 2009 harley sportster 883 iron . i used it in conjunction with a 1 in . long 5/16 '' -24 coupling nut .
 I found the tape to stick quite well and served the purpose I needed it for .
 It 's electrical tape , and performs as such . I 've successfully used it in a few applications , including in my computer case -LRB- just to tie up and tape off cables -RRB- and in my car -LRB- to wrap wires together for a new audio receiver -RRB- . No problems so far .
 Henkel Duck tape is superior to other brands . Durability and adhesive backing will not disappoint .
 I bought this tape to hold down speaker wire for my home theater system . I works ok . There 's some spots where it has popped up , but for the most part it has held the wire down . Pretty easy to use .
 It is better quality then most electrical tape . I thinks it 's a good value , but ultimately it is tape . What you see is what you get
 We have used this tape on numerous cords that were breaking apart . It not only protects the open area , but it does not peel off easily or unravel over time . We would recommend it to anyone .
 Well manufufactured , and holds very well . It is well worth the investment for every family to own a roll !
 Good friction tape for hockey sticks . Played 3 games as a goalie and my tape job looks like I just did it . 1 roll = 2 sticks on the nose .
 this is some great tape , it sticks to itself and a lot of other things . friction tape has been around for a long time and i use it for a lot of different things . get you some and you 'll surprise yourself how often you use it , good stuff
 I use these for EZB and F1L o-rings . It beats slicing them from tubes . There are other sizes that may be more appropriate for other model classes using thicker motors .

 I 've had lots of vacuums and this series is the best I 've owned . Easy maintenance and extreme reliability make this a must have for those wanting a tough vacuum !!
 This is quite an assortment of drills . They seem to hold up well with use . I wo n't use them frequently but trust they will work when I need them . They have worked well with both a power drill and rotary hand drill . Pretty good value that I 'd recommend to others for the light duty use I 'll have them for .
 very good experience , I recommend it widely , the shipment arrived on time.the product was exactly the that I wanted
 Drills look good , and come in a handy plastic storage case
 Quick delivery - fair price . I used this part on a project where safety was the concern and after 6 months of use , it has proven to be high quality.Do not use that junk that you buy at the home improvement stores . Stock up on this type of hardware that performs the way it is supposed to .
 My Mom has been looking for hairnets like this for a long time and was thrilled with them . She did say they were a little big , but she could adjust them to fit perfectly . Thank you .
 This valve was a perfect replacement for my failed 25 year old log-splitter valve . It works great and was American made , and at a great price.A quality replacement .
 I ordered this to use for a hook in the ceiling . The toggle bolt is constructed well and very heavy duty .
 Great tool , a must have ! Just what you would expect from fluke . Great for working in hard to access panels .

 I purchased these needing something to move my snowmobiles around . They work very well . Easy to use and easy to store .
 Christmas gift for my husband . He loves them . Very easy to put under sled and move around in garage . Excellent quality . Was packaged very good when shipped . Would recommend anyone with a sled have a set of these .
 The product is very heavy duty . The only thing they might do differently is line the grooves in the ski dollies and the flat dollie with some kind of non skid rubber . Overall the product is very handy .
 Nylon 6/6 Flat Washers # 8 0.177 '' ID 0.408 '' OD 0.062 ' thick washers for isolation from ground or vibration of screw heads . Pack of 100 round washers are handy for new installations where vibration from screwed source needs to be isolated from Hold down .
 These are nice , thick , strong nylon washers . They 're perfect for use with nylon bolts . Probably would work well with metal bolts on a project where you do n't want to mar the joined material .
 They are exactly what one would expect - work and fit as advertised . We used them for a project involving microwaves .
 These washers are the washers in the picture and function as such . Really not much to say other than they are as described .
 Seem to be fine . Used them as spacers for prototype Li-ion batteries . Nylon holds up well in glycol-based electrolytes . Not sure about long-term stability though .
 These washers are awesome . Yes ... an awesome nylon washer . I really needed to find a specific washer material and thickness , and these were perfect . I have found no defects , they are the correct thickness and size and they look great -LRB- no flashing or uneven thickness -RRB- . I have used around 30 of these with no problems , it 's great to find a product on Amazon that is perfect for my needs , and is delivered as described . I would definitely order these again !
 Bought these to attach screws through metal cabinet into wood subfranme so as not to damage paint on cabinet , work fine .
 Nylon Flat Washers , what else can I say ? They are flat made of nylon and have a hole in the middle ...
 I purchased this product to use in electrically isolating a 1/4 '' screw through a metal jar lid . It is ideal in this type of situation and I highly recommend it for similar applications .
 This is a 6/6 nylon electrical panel isolator that 's used singularly over the 8-32 screws in the 1948-64 -LRB- seat post -RRB- electrical terminal box , but the part number -LRB- -38 -RRB- is from 1938 and Harley used the shoulder washers on various parts of the bike until 1964 , perhaps beyond . The Harley 's and Davidson 's were Scotch/Irish and thrifty ! They kept some of the parts on their machines from 1915 to 1974 . Nobody else ever did -LRB- does -RRB- that . If so who?An OEM -LRB- fiber -RRB- shouldered washer was used for Harley 's 27/64th terminal post hole , in the 1/32 '' thick terminal box floor , and two isolators were used -LRB- face to face -RRB- in 27/64th holes in the 1/8 '' dash panel frame.I 'll test them when they arrive and report back . ******************************************************* They 're 0.005 '' thinner in the shoulder which works in my favor , because space is at a premium . Their footprint is smaller than the black fiber or plastic # 8 shoulder washer 's used on Colony 's replica terminal boxes . My only concern is radiant-heat on nylon . The only way I know is to test it and soon I will on it 's first 50 miles .
 I milled pieces of this to replace the sissy plastic cleaning sticks that come with rental band instruments . My daughters band class has been quite happy w the results .
 Excellent price for a piece of hexagon brass bar . I used approximately 14 inches for a shift rod linkage on a custom chopper project . I had enough left over for the next project
 Quick delivery - fair price . I used this part on a project where safety was the concern and after 6 months of use , it has proven to be high quality.Do not use that junk that you buy at the home improvement stores . Stock up on this type of hardware that performs the way it is supposed to .
 Typical of box of flat washers . Every washer was usable , none were deformed or not able to be used.Works great , just as described.Shipped fast .
 My what a wonderful , fine washer . Nice smooth ID , OD . And the surfaces , even smoother!I am being a bit facetious . After all , it 's just a flat washer.However , I was truly amazed that Amazon had these in stock . Consider the near infinite number of combinations of ID , OD , thickness and material . And Amazon seemed to have them all available . Truly impressive.I had tried to find this particular size before by surfing the web , with no success . Amazon did it .
 What can you say about a tap ? It is as advertised and priced right AND it comes with the correct drill bit ... a good bargian
 The bits work great for drilling in wood . They seem to drill faster and cleaner . I also like that the shanks are universal `` Quick Change '' . The company messed up my order and sent the spade bits instead . I called them and got the correct bits the next day and they let me keep the spade bits . Was very impressed with the TG Tool service . I would highly recommend the product .
 The item was just as described , arrive on time and the price was fair compared to the prices from the local shops aroud here that sells this item .
 I have been lucky enough to acquire a home with many -LRB- 20 + -RRB- mature rose bushes , which must be deadheaded every year . The only work gloves I have ever found to be flexible enough while protecting my hands against rose thorns have been goatskin , and these gloves are the best goatskin gloves I have ever seen . They have never been penetrated by a rose thorn .
 This states `` PACK of 20 '' my husband ordered these . What arrived is a large box and ONE hook . I called Ozbo the company and they said Amazon posted it wrong . Ozbo said they would refund the 5 bucks and change to ship ONE hook ! Had I been in a store and a wrong price was posted , I would have gotten the item for the price listed ! So needing a pack of hooks and only getting ONE wo n't help . Guess I will buy hardware from now on at the actual store !!!
 When I started looking for the Split Socket I did not even know exactly what to call them but , through a series of web searches I arrived at the correct nomenclature . We needed a replacement Split Socket to accept the tang on the ceramic caster for an old buffet . I was pleased and surprised to find these unique items on Amazon . The supplier shipped in good order and they arrived ahead of schedule . The Cast Iron Split Socket enabled me to affect the repair to the caster foot and restore stability to the buffet . I was quite please with the entire transaction for these items .
 This piece of tubing worked great for the project I built . The tubing arrived in great shape and is very straight .
 The bass tubing was a perfect fit for my project . The packaging was great No damage to the tubing and the service was fast .
 it was just as described . It arrived on schedule and I was able to start my project right away . I am very happy with this transaction .
 purchased to construct an alcohol restrictor tube for a vintage Optimus 111T multi-fuel stove ... the brass has the same quality construction as from K&S ; - i bought the thicker-walled material ... -LRB- btw , details are 1.75 '' length , two 5/32 '' holes 1/8 '' from nipple - stove now burns alcohol on the 'M ' -LRB- 0.03 mm/0 .012 '' -RRB- jet - a proper alcohol jet is 0.051 mm/0 .02 '' -RRB- fast shipping , good packaging - a good seller ! i 'll buy from them again !
 This tubing is great . It telescopes with the diameters above and below it in size . Amazon had it for a great price too .
 This is very good quality tubing . The tolerances are rather tight . I have bought quite a few different sizes of this stuff and it has been very consistent . The length is always over spec by at least 1/4 '' and usually 1/2 '' . I do n't use this in the `` telescoping '' mode so I am not able to comment on that . Good stuff !!
 Used it on my 1915 Evinrude to replace the original brass tiller handle . Worked great . I 'll probably be buying more for my other antique engines .
 Good quality J-Bolt . Depending on what you are going to use them for , you may want to consider a size larger in diameter than what you might think as it is not difficult to pull the J straight when tightening them down .
 This is exactly what I was looking for , very good quality , described exact , delivered in a timely manner , postage fair , Its hanging and looks GREAT!Thank you
 This does what it 's supposed to
 I use this tape around the edges of my watercolor paper which is stretched on a board while I am painting . It is great because it does n't damage the paper and if you clean off the paint it gives the effect of a white mat while working on it .
 Okay , it 's console tape . If you have already dozed off reading this , I totally understand . But if you want to know , here is the scoop :1 . It sticks to your console well enough but not TOO well -LRB- e.g. comes off when you need it to -RRB- .2 . Works great with the ubiquitous Sharpie that all engineers carry -LRB- ink wo n't smudge once you 've written on it -RRB- .3 . If you leave it on after your gig -LRB- BAD engineer ! -RRB- , it will come off clean days later -- no goopy glue residue .
 I know this is n't the original use for this tape , but having used it for my artwork in the past , I knew how it came clean after using . So , fed up with the cold air blowing in around my closed and locked windows , I taped the joints around where the windows and the window frames met and wallah ! No more cold air blowing in.So much easier than the shrink wrap plastic over the entire window . It comes off clean as a whistle in the spring when you want to open your windows again ! I have white painted window frames and I did n't want to rip the paint off , so this tape worked where I would n't dare try something more adhesive . It leaves no sticky residue , no pulled up paint . Yeah , duct tape would keep the wind out , but good luck with it next spring ! Measure all the way around your windows , so you buy enough tape . : -RRB-
 I used this tape during the Christmas season to create ` panes ' on my large windows . I used to use electrical tape but this is much cheaper & removes much more cleanly & easily . I will be buying more for Christmas 2012
 Very easy to apply and writing on it is a breeze ! Glad I finally purchased it to organize my soundboard .
 No residue left behind on clear vinyl window material used for fabricating marine boat enclosures ! Tried many different tapes that always had to be cleaned up after use ... . This one works !!! Just had to think outside the box ... It sure beats the only alternative - $ 100.00 + / roll tape !!!
 Works out great ! Use it on our audio boards to identify the wireless mics as well as tabletop mics for our meetings .
 No sticky mess , and Sharpie contrasts clearly against the stunning white . I laughed , I cried , I labeled the drum channels .
 This is standard issue Artist 's Tape , also known to audio engineers as Console Tape or Board Tape . Unlike other normal masking tapes -LRB- or other , weaker tapes calling themselves artist 's tape -RRB- , the adhesive on this tape is perfect for being applied , written on with a sharpy , removed and `` stored '' -LRB- stuck to the wall -RRB- , and then later re-applied , many times if needed , always sticking firmly without leaving ANY gross residue behind on the nice equipment . In the recording studio , this stuff is a real life saver . It is perfect for labeling mixing console channels , rack gear , microphones and stands ... really anything you can think of , even guitars , basses , amps and drums ! And I do n't just use it in the studio ; anything requiring a short-term removable label gets this . It can also work well to damp out drum heads in a pinch !
 This is good board tape . Used for a church that was using name tags on the console , after some cleaning and replacing with this everything looks nice and the tape comes right off three weeks later ! Will be ordering more as needed .
 Good thickness for writing . Adhesive releases easily leaving no residue . Not terribly affected by heat . A perfectly adequate product for temporary console labeling .
 This 3/4 '' white tape is perfect for using on a mixing console . Stays put but comes off easily without any residue , even after a couple weeks : -RRB-
 No audio engineer should be without some sort of guide.This board tape was the perfect solution to mark my board.Peel on and Peel off ! How easy is that ?
 working in a darkroom for traditional photography all of last semester , this stuff became invaluable to have at my disposal . its pricey as far as tape goes , but it sticks when it needs to and peels of clean , unlike some masking tapes . This is a good investment for you artist out there .
 I bought this tape to use for labeling audio equipment used in a recent show with a theatre group I am part of . Tape stuck well and left no reside when I pulled it off . No complaints !

 This is a great product for my family and I would buy it again . Thanks and keep up the good work .
 The parts arrived in a reasonable timeframe and were exactly as described . It was exactly what I needed for the job I had .
 just right for my need-made cooker hooks out of it , just cut into pieces , bend and sharpen then hang in smoker . much cheaper than buying hooks premade .
 Worked very well as an axle for my handcart . There truly is not much else to say , say , say , say .
 Needed the rod to build a jig for my router . I was surprised at the low price . Came EXCELLENTLY packaged , and worked perfectly for my project .
 Shipped promptly and arrived well packaged . It 's the grade of stainless steel I needed for a LOW PRICE . I 'll order again ! Thanks -
 this product was as advertised ; it was shipped promptly , well packaged and it performed as expected for its intended use
 Exactly as described , came in appropriate packaging and was shipped quickly . It helps that they are in Seattle and I am in Bothell , but getting something on the truck is the hardest part . I will definitely be ordering from them in the future .

 This is by far the best 4 cents i have EVER spent . This screw is even better than when I bought that paperclip I had been pining for , and infinately better than the Machine Screw 10-24 x 1/2 '' Round Head . As a bonus the good folks at Machine Screw throw in a lovely rosewood credenza for every 50,000 screws you buy . You do the math .
 Quick delivery - fair price . I used this part on a project where safety was the concern and after 6 months of use , it has proven to be high quality.Do not use that junk that you buy at the home improvement stores . Stock up on this type of hardware that performs the way it is supposed to .

 just right for my need-made cooker hooks out of it , just cut into pieces , bend and sharpen then hang in smoker . much cheaper than buying hooks premade .
 Worked very well as an axle for my handcart . There truly is not much else to say , say , say , say .
 Needed the rod to build a jig for my router . I was surprised at the low price . Came EXCELLENTLY packaged , and worked perfectly for my project .
 Shipped promptly and arrived well packaged . It 's the grade of stainless steel I needed for a LOW PRICE . I 'll order again ! Thanks -
 this product was as advertised ; it was shipped promptly , well packaged and it performed as expected for its intended use
 Exactly as described , came in appropriate packaging and was shipped quickly . It helps that they are in Seattle and I am in Bothell , but getting something on the truck is the hardest part . I will definitely be ordering from them in the future .

 4130 tube steel takes to diamond paste for hi luster fine , moving parts inside tube such as carbon fiber piston -RCB-
 Quick delivery - fair price . I used this part on a project where safety was the concern and after 6 months of use , it has proven to be high quality.Do not use that junk that you buy at the home improvement stores . Stock up on this type of hardware that performs the way it is supposed to .

 Nylon 6/6 Flat Washers # 8 0.177 '' ID 0.408 '' OD 0.062 ' thick washers for isolation from ground or vibration of screw heads . Pack of 100 round washers are handy for new installations where vibration from screwed source needs to be isolated from Hold down .
 These are nice , thick , strong nylon washers . They 're perfect for use with nylon bolts . Probably would work well with metal bolts on a project where you do n't want to mar the joined material .
 They are exactly what one would expect - work and fit as advertised . We used them for a project involving microwaves .
 These washers are the washers in the picture and function as such . Really not much to say other than they are as described .
 Seem to be fine . Used them as spacers for prototype Li-ion batteries . Nylon holds up well in glycol-based electrolytes . Not sure about long-term stability though .
 These washers are awesome . Yes ... an awesome nylon washer . I really needed to find a specific washer material and thickness , and these were perfect . I have found no defects , they are the correct thickness and size and they look great -LRB- no flashing or uneven thickness -RRB- . I have used around 30 of these with no problems , it 's great to find a product on Amazon that is perfect for my needs , and is delivered as described . I would definitely order these again !
 Bought these to attach screws through metal cabinet into wood subfranme so as not to damage paint on cabinet , work fine .
 Nylon Flat Washers , what else can I say ? They are flat made of nylon and have a hole in the middle ...
 I 've purchased at least four of these sets over the years , mainly for cabinet installation -LRB- mostly oak face frames and plywood rails -RRB- . I have snapped a couple of bits , and the countersinks dull faster than I 'd like . But for the price , this has been the best value overall . In the last 8 months or so I 've had a hard time finding them , and it looks like Hitachi may have stopped producing them . The price has gone up as well . Maybe it 's time to move on , but if I find more of these I 'll probably pick them up .
 I noticed the reviews were n't that great for this product ? ... I thought these counter-sinc bits were as good as any on the market ... they 're stong , they spin , and counter-sinc wood ... . what else are you looking for ?
 This is a great bag and does not restrict flow . I can still pick up rocks , nails , screws , bolts , etc. ... and the plus is when I pull the bag out , nothing has punctured through . I get my money out of these ... I let them get pretty full . Just be careful around the neck where the hose is inserted , as that can rip if your are not a little careful ... and of course , be careful , as nails will puncture through the paper bag once it is removed from the container ... e.g. if you step on it , through it around , etc. . .
 These bags are for the ShopVac 16 gallon wet-dry vac . They work just fine for their intended purpose . I would recommend them .
 On the plus side , these bags do a reasonable job of capturing dust during dry pickup so you 're not just blowing the fine stuff out the back end of the shop-vac . On the minus side , they 're pricey -LRB- c'mon , it 's just paper , guys -RRB- , and they tend to clog quickly when picking up fine particle dust -LRB- masonry residue comes to mind here -RRB- . They say James Dyson could n't sell his vacuum to Hoover because Hoover made their money selling vacuum bags . Waiting for the Dyson shop vac ...
 Great transaction , arrived fast and just as described . Installed and works great . Will return when I need to purchase replacements .
 These are great filter bags for general use . Easy to use and easy to dispose of when they get full .
 They 're vac bags . What can I say . they keep the stuff I vacuum up from exiting the vac until I decide it 's time
 I have an 18 Gallon vac and this fits it fine . I was a little worried the bag would fall off the inlet since it is n't very snug , but so far it has stayed on .
 If you are keying in `` V832 '' beware - that same number is also used on the shorter , 5 '' version . This is the 8 '' version . The shorter version is handy for doors with windows , and is not sold by Amazon at this writing - try local lumber yards -LRB- real ones , not Home Depot/Lowes -RRB- . This is a very burly bolt . The barrel pin is a full half inch . There is a place for a lock in the closed position . It 's intended to mount just as you see . If the small piece is a problem , you have two options . # 1 The kit includes a flat piece that mounts like a striker plate and provides a hole that sticks out . # 2 I have seen installations where they simply drill a hole in the door frame and the bolt extends into it .
 This does what it 's supposed to
 I use this tape around the edges of my watercolor paper which is stretched on a board while I am painting . It is great because it does n't damage the paper and if you clean off the paint it gives the effect of a white mat while working on it .
 Okay , it 's console tape . If you have already dozed off reading this , I totally understand . But if you want to know , here is the scoop :1 . It sticks to your console well enough but not TOO well -LRB- e.g. comes off when you need it to -RRB- .2 . Works great with the ubiquitous Sharpie that all engineers carry -LRB- ink wo n't smudge once you 've written on it -RRB- .3 . If you leave it on after your gig -LRB- BAD engineer ! -RRB- , it will come off clean days later -- no goopy glue residue .
 I know this is n't the original use for this tape , but having used it for my artwork in the past , I knew how it came clean after using . So , fed up with the cold air blowing in around my closed and locked windows , I taped the joints around where the windows and the window frames met and wallah ! No more cold air blowing in.So much easier than the shrink wrap plastic over the entire window . It comes off clean as a whistle in the spring when you want to open your windows again ! I have white painted window frames and I did n't want to rip the paint off , so this tape worked where I would n't dare try something more adhesive . It leaves no sticky residue , no pulled up paint . Yeah , duct tape would keep the wind out , but good luck with it next spring ! Measure all the way around your windows , so you buy enough tape . : -RRB-
 I used this tape during the Christmas season to create ` panes ' on my large windows . I used to use electrical tape but this is much cheaper & removes much more cleanly & easily . I will be buying more for Christmas 2012
 No residue left behind on clear vinyl window material used for fabricating marine boat enclosures ! Tried many different tapes that always had to be cleaned up after use ... . This one works !!! Just had to think outside the box ... It sure beats the only alternative - $ 100.00 + / roll tape !!!
 Works out great ! Use it on our audio boards to identify the wireless mics as well as tabletop mics for our meetings .
 No sticky mess , and Sharpie contrasts clearly against the stunning white . I laughed , I cried , I labeled the drum channels .
 This is standard issue Artist 's Tape , also known to audio engineers as Console Tape or Board Tape . Unlike other normal masking tapes -LRB- or other , weaker tapes calling themselves artist 's tape -RRB- , the adhesive on this tape is perfect for being applied , written on with a sharpy , removed and `` stored '' -LRB- stuck to the wall -RRB- , and then later re-applied , many times if needed , always sticking firmly without leaving ANY gross residue behind on the nice equipment . In the recording studio , this stuff is a real life saver . It is perfect for labeling mixing console channels , rack gear , microphones and stands ... really anything you can think of , even guitars , basses , amps and drums ! And I do n't just use it in the studio ; anything requiring a short-term removable label gets this . It can also work well to damp out drum heads in a pinch !
 This is good board tape . Used for a church that was using name tags on the console , after some cleaning and replacing with this everything looks nice and the tape comes right off three weeks later ! Will be ordering more as needed .
 Good thickness for writing . Adhesive releases easily leaving no residue . Not terribly affected by heat . A perfectly adequate product for temporary console labeling .
 This 3/4 '' white tape is perfect for using on a mixing console . Stays put but comes off easily without any residue , even after a couple weeks : -RRB-
 No audio engineer should be without some sort of guide.This board tape was the perfect solution to mark my board.Peel on and Peel off ! How easy is that ?
 working in a darkroom for traditional photography all of last semester , this stuff became invaluable to have at my disposal . its pricey as far as tape goes , but it sticks when it needs to and peels of clean , unlike some masking tapes . This is a good investment for you artist out there .
 I bought this tape to use for labeling audio equipment used in a recent show with a theatre group I am part of . Tape stuck well and left no reside when I pulled it off . No complaints !
 Heavy duty chisel works great for smaller areas . Hard material keeps a sharp edge for more precise scraping and scoring of cement .
 Good for deep or long bores ... clean holes ... I do carvings and I need this for custom pipes . This bit is easy to sharpen by hand .
 this tubing is thick wall . it can be used for many projects esp . ones that require a strong frame.looks to be top quality alum . would buy again .
 Quick delivery - fair price . I used this part on a project where safety was the concern and after 6 months of use , it has proven to be high quality.Do not use that junk that you buy at the home improvement stores . Stock up on this type of hardware that performs the way it is supposed to .
 I could not find any brass tubing this size at my local hardware . The item was shipped fast and was as described .
 I needed 3/8 '' OD brass tubing with a thick wall . Everything on the ` net is thin-walled hobby stuff . This product is wonderfully thick and * was * Prime at a great price . I bought 'em all out and the only inventory left as of this writing is an independent seller at a high price.But , you ca n't go wrong if you need a chunk of tube stock with a thick wall . Recommended .

 *** EDIT 7/9/12 12:00 PM *** Well , I posted this review a couple of hours ago , and also notified Amazon about the issue . Within about fifteen minutes , they issued a refund on the shipping charges , escalated the issue immediately with their shipping department and have a representative monitoring my order until it arrives on my doorstep .

That was definitely not the response I expected , and was very impressed ! *** Original Review *** This is the first time that I 've used the expedited shipping option to update my shipping option from 2-day Prime shipping to 1-day shipping , with an additional upcharge .

 Great product . Needed to receive the wingnuts for tradeshow spare parts on Wednesday . Placed the order on Friday and got it on Tuesday . Very trusty seller and the product is flawless !! Thumbs up !!!
 This is some good tubing . It is strong but slightly flexible . I definatley recommend it for any lightweight use . this is the end of my review
 I needed to make a very simple coolant manifold for my CNC and this did the trick.Cut it to length , drilled and tapped the holes to the correct size , installed two end caps and tada ! A coolant manifold with some extra material left over.Pros : Cheap.Cut very cleanly.Cons : None .
 The item was to my satisfaction , quick service -LRB- got it within 5 days -RRB- and safely packed . I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in this kind of product .
 This is what you want . Economical and high quality . Works perfectly . Great alternative to the factory or firearms products . 100 rounds test proved perfect performance .
 I ordered these orings to repair my ford 6.9 diesel engine . I used them on the injector leak-off jackets to reseal them . They worked great and were a great deal .
 I had been going through o-rings on our tube filling machine like crazy . I had to replace it once a week or more often . I decided to order this 25 pack since it was so inexpensive . It 's been a month and a half and I have not yet replaced the first one of these . They seem to be extremely durable so far .
 Fast service and product as described . Fits an old Remington 1100 perfectly at a fraction of the cost of Remington replacements . That 's about all - they are just O-rings .
 Used to replace broken o-ring on a Remington 1100 12 gauge . Product fits perfectly and is of very high quality . At this price you basically have a lifetime supply ! Highly recommend !
 I was looking for an o-ring for my Remington 1100 and other places were asking $ 9 for 1 . You get 50 of these for less than that . My great grandkids will still have these o-rings for the gun lol .
 I was having blow back issues with my 12gauge , and all the suggestions pointed to my gas ports , and the O ring . Now that I have replaced it , I need to get out and shoot again . Hopefully this was the fix . The only draw back with this product , is that you receive a &#34; Costco &#34; supply ; more than enough for a lifetime .
 Used this to replace my o ring on my BMW 's DISA valve . O ring is not available from the dealer . Worked perfectly and solved my vacuum leak .
 Dunno what to say about an o-ring , but they appear to be well-made , come nicely packaged , etc. .

 Fits my Remington 1100 Shotgun perfect ! Replaced my old hard worn out one . I dont think I will ever use all 50 of them , but maybe some friends will need some .
 It is just what you would expect . Works fine , looks like good stuff . I go through a bunch of these on camp fuel stoves and bottles . Viton lasts much longer than NBR .
 I bought this part to use on the fuel pump plate of my bmw r1150r . I think it 's also the same part for 1100 too . It works just as well at fraction of the cost quoted by dealerships
 This seal works for early BMW oil filter stand O-Ring , not available from dealer . Or you end up buying new style housing which is a lot more .
 Just what I needed to fix my pool fill valve . 25 is a lot but now I 'm covered .
 Yes , this is the one you 've been hunting , and yes , my 91 geo 1.0 quit leaking from there . What to do with the extra nine ? Well , I do n't know either , but its hard to beat the price !!!
 Thanks for stocking these O-rings ; I could not find them locally . Just what I needed . Still arrived ahead of a few other items I ordered at the same time from other venders here on Amazon so I changed my review to five stars .
 I 'm always running for o rings for something now I have a stock at home .

 Great product . Works good . It would be nicer if the spool was deeper as the strap sometimes starts to pile against the mechanism and keeps it from working correctly . Also the first thing i did to it when it arrived was ground the edges of the spool down to keep the strap from chafing on the sharp edges left there . Overall it was a great part and is well worth the price .

 Fits my Remington 1100 Shotgun perfect ! Replaced my old hard worn out one . I dont think I will ever use all 50 of them , but maybe some friends will need some .
 It is just what you would expect . Works fine , looks like good stuff . I go through a bunch of these on camp fuel stoves and bottles . Viton lasts much longer than NBR .
 I bought this part to use on the fuel pump plate of my bmw r1150r . I think it 's also the same part for 1100 too . It works just as well at fraction of the cost quoted by dealerships
 This seal works for early BMW oil filter stand O-Ring , not available from dealer . Or you end up buying new style housing which is a lot more .
 Just what I needed to fix my pool fill valve . 25 is a lot but now I 'm covered .
 Yes , this is the one you 've been hunting , and yes , my 91 geo 1.0 quit leaking from there . What to do with the extra nine ? Well , I do n't know either , but its hard to beat the price !!!
 Thanks for stocking these O-rings ; I could not find them locally . Just what I needed . Still arrived ahead of a few other items I ordered at the same time from other venders here on Amazon so I changed my review to five stars .
 I 'm always running for o rings for something now I have a stock at home .

 GREAT PRODUCT , HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT ! , GREAT GREAT GREAT THING YEAH ! GREAT THING YEAY!GREAT PRODUCT , HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT ! , GREAT GREAT GREAT THING YEAH ! GREAT THING YEAY !
 This is what you want . Economical and high quality . Works perfectly . Great alternative to the factory or firearms products . 100 rounds test proved perfect performance .
 I ordered these orings to repair my ford 6.9 diesel engine . I used them on the injector leak-off jackets to reseal them . They worked great and were a great deal .
 I had been going through o-rings on our tube filling machine like crazy . I had to replace it once a week or more often . I decided to order this 25 pack since it was so inexpensive . It 's been a month and a half and I have not yet replaced the first one of these . They seem to be extremely durable so far .
 Fast service and product as described . Fits an old Remington 1100 perfectly at a fraction of the cost of Remington replacements . That 's about all - they are just O-rings .
 Used to replace broken o-ring on a Remington 1100 12 gauge . Product fits perfectly and is of very high quality . At this price you basically have a lifetime supply ! Highly recommend !
 I was looking for an o-ring for my Remington 1100 and other places were asking $ 9 for 1 . You get 50 of these for less than that . My great grandkids will still have these o-rings for the gun lol .
 I was having blow back issues with my 12gauge , and all the suggestions pointed to my gas ports , and the O ring . Now that I have replaced it , I need to get out and shoot again . Hopefully this was the fix . The only draw back with this product , is that you receive a &#34; Costco &#34; supply ; more than enough for a lifetime .

 STARRETT MAKES GREAT TOOLS , DOES WHAT ITS SUPPOSED TO DO . GREAT QUALITY , I NEED 1 MORE TO COMPLETE MY SET AND IT WILL BE A STARRETT .
 What can I add ; the first project was a pair of large cabinet doors . I made them dead flush , quickly , and probably the best doors I have made . I 'm 4 square with the 5 star guys .
 Have used the Dowelmax with OUTSTANDING results . You will not believe that until you use one for yourself . The 1/4 '' steel drill guides replace the 3/8 '' guides so you can use smaller dowels when necesssary . The whole system works great . Well thought out and well manufactured for literally perfect results every time . You will NOT go back to other joining methods.If it were possible I would give the Dowelmax system 10 stars !!!
 Additional tools.This kit is to be used in the original system of 3/8 . It is an excellent product , but the price could be lower.I think it would sell more .
 The Dowel Max is really a great piece of precision metal work and it will allow you to start making very strong and very accurate doweled joints just as fast as you can get the box opened . I skipped the directions and got right to gluing up some cabinet face frames . Learning curve was about 1 minute . You can use it in the shop on the bench or out in the field in your hand while standing . It 's fast , accurate , and strong . It 's pretty much eliminated my need for pocket screws or biscuits . After I ordered the Dowel Max I had a bit of buyer 's remorse thinking I 'd just paid several hundred dollars for a piece of polished aluminum . But once I started using it I realized that this purchase was one of the best I 'd ever made . It looks like it belongs on a satellite or something , and it works beautifully .
 the 1/4 '' drill guide set is a perfect match to the fit and finish of the Dowelmax jig system . I 'm glad to have the benefit of the Dowelmax system with smaller projects . After the sting of the rather steep price , I 'm more than happy with the expanded capacity . I only wish that I 'd purchased the Dowelmax system years ago .
 Does everything as claimed , and a useful wood working tool . Only 4 stars -LRB- my opinion -RRB- , however , due to the stiff price . For example , although now over twice as expensive , not as useful or vesatile as my router ...
 For the longest time , I 've looking into ATG type tape dispensers and they seem to expensive to try . This one was perfect for my budget and it works FABULOUS . Oh , and it takes three sizes of tape !
 I bought this to use for scrapbooking . I got it with a roll of 1/4 in . tape . I was able to load the gun fairly easily and have not noticed any sliding of the tape on the dispenser . I was expecting the gun to be heavier and to my delight , it is very light . When I first received the box in the mail , my first thought was that it was empty . I am very happy with my purchase !
 I probably should not be giving a review just yet as I have not bought it but upon reading the directions it looks like I would need a lawyer to figure out how to put the tape in ??

 *** EDIT 7/9/12 12:00 PM *** Well , I posted this review a couple of hours ago , and also notified Amazon about the issue . Within about fifteen minutes , they issued a refund on the shipping charges , escalated the issue immediately with their shipping department and have a representative monitoring my order until it arrives on my doorstep . All I can say is , WOW ! That was definitely not the response I expected , and was very impressed ! *** Original Review *** This is the first time that I 've used the expedited shipping option to update my shipping option from 2-day Prime shipping to 1-day shipping , with an additional upcharge .

 Excellent stripe tape for car . Vivid color and very easy to install with no akward paper backing to fiddle with . Just roll the tape on for great pin striping both inside and outside car . Holds well with the quality 3M self-adhesive backing . Great value , too !

 The Dowelmax system creates perfect spacing . The one consideration is that with a system that has the capability of doweling all the way across the edge of a board for a table top , you need to realize that even with a thousandth of an inch accuracy , multiplied across such an expanse , it is advisable to have a slight variation in size of the hole the drill bit leaves . The 9.7 mm drill bit gives you that luxury . If you are using only two dowels , with a single setting of the jig , then a common 3/8 '' drill bit is advisable . If you are doing multiple dowels , for example 5 in a row , or more with the expansion capabilities , it is advisable to use the 9.7 mm bit . I bought two of them when I bought the kit . When they arrived I was glad that they were high quality , and had an adjustable depth collar on them that would not slip a setting . Overall highly recommended .
 EXCELLENT PRODUCT . LIKE THE DOWELMAX DRILLING FIXTURE , IT DOES COST MORE , BUT THE RESULTS ARE REALLY WORTH IT . I TRIED A LESS EXPENSIVE DRILL AND WOUND UP THROWING IT AWAY . EXCELLENT RESULTS DO COST MORE.EVERY TIME I USE THE DOWELMAX FIXTURE I AM AMAZED AND THANKFUL THAT I DID BUY THE BEST . HOW I LOVE GREAT RESULTS !!!!!!!!! I HAVE MADE SOME AMAZING DOWELED JOINTS IN NEW FURNITURE & IN REPAIRING EVEN ANTIQUES .
 Excellent stripe tape for car . Vivid color and very easy to install with no akward paper backing to fiddle with . Just roll the tape on for great pin striping both inside and outside car . Holds well with the quality 3M self-adhesive backing . Great value , too !
 Just standard O-rings . They work great for 5-gallon soda kegs used for home brewing . With the 100-pk , I wo n't have to buy more ... ever .
 I really like these instead of the rubber ones I replaced them for . I would do this again since silicone is forever
 This is a perfect replacement O ring for my Thermos Nissan insulated coffee mug . It fit perfectly and provided a tight seal .
 I used this and it worked for my application very good quality and good pricing and also packaging . It 's made well .
 O-rings were top quality , exactly as pictured . Prices are great for only a 10 pack . Exactly what I wanted and expected . What more would you need ?
 The O-rings arrived on time and look good . Amazon has a great selection , far better than any store I could find in town . They are marked in fractional inches , but that size is only approximate . Look in the product description and it will tell you the exact size in thousandths of an inch .
 I purchased these O-rings for replacing the drive belts for a rod dryer -LRB- fishing rods -RRB- . They 're stronger than the originals !
 After purchasing a lower quality product from the local hardware store for about twice the price , I was happy to see Amazon carrying the silicon type of this O-Ring and for a lower price . They are quality products for a great price .
 Looking for a better and cheaper alternative than buying the $ 5 each Omni Heavy Duty whole house filter o-rings ? This is it . The silicone is FDA approved and at $ 5 for 10 pieces !

 I bought these o-rings as a replacement on my Nissan spill proof travel mug . I use this mug all the time . It will keep a cup of freshly made tea or coffee hot for 3-4 hours if left closed , or at the right drinking temperature for a full hour . I tried to find a replacement for the o-ring at the Nissan website but could not . These o-rings are an excellent replacement . The mug closes water tight and works like new . Highly recommended for this application .
 These are very strong little o-rings , with plenty of tensile strength . I read a recent DIY article online about turning certain fountain pens -LRB- Platinum Preppy line -RRB- into eye dropper fountain pens using this size o-ring . I wanted to give it a try , and I must admit it worked like a charm . No leaks , perfect . Search online for `` eye dropper fountain pen '' and `` o-ring '' or perhaps `` make your own '' and you should be able to find it , if you 're interested . Fun , and a good use of the pen and the ink .
 I bought these based on the recommendation of a previous reviewer . The seal on my Nissan 14oz Leakproof Insulated Travel Mug broke when I was washing it , and without the seal , it was n't leakproof . These work great . Thanks , previous reviewer !
 My husband takes a Thermos travel mug of coffee with him every workday , and the o-ring was very stained . I also figured that eventually it would relax and no longer provide a tight , leakproof fit . I thought finding a replacement would be impossible , but , when it looks impossible ... try Amazon ! Found these , which are the exact size as the original . We 're set for a long time , now !
 I lost the original ring to my Nissan Stainless coffee cup , and was looking for a new one on Amazon , when Amazon suggested this o-ring to me . What a good suggestion ! Now my old cup has a new lease on life and I can lose the ring like 9 more times before I have to buy a whole new one : -RRB-
 I got these on a suggestion on an airsoft repair forum . They fit snugly into the fill valves , providing a better outer seal than most factory standard o-rings , and at a far better price than the exact same product when sold somewhere like Evike . The one problem I had was that my bag had 88 in it instead of 100 . I 'm not actually upset , since the price difference between it and other similar products still made this worth it , but a little more accuracy in the numbers would be appreciated.Pros - Great PriceFits snugly in placePlenty for more replacements lateCons - Did n't actually receive 100
 My favorite Nalgene 750ml bottle had turned into a `` dribble '' bottle . This ring is the correct size to fit over the neck and seal against the cap when the cap is screwed on . Not perfect - when you unscrew the cap , a little water that was sitting above the ring will drip . But I 'm not getting dripped on when I drink .
 WOW , researched `` O '' Rings off & online for awhile , almost bought one at another store online , but it was 5 times the price , I thought of amazon and I probably could have done even better , but I am pleased with these.Thank you again , Amazon has not let me down yet !! NO LEAKS!Tim
 excellent price and good delivery . the item will be used to seal pyrex glass tubes used for a solar boiler to create steam .
 This is an excellent heavy duty Dial indicator . I recommend this unit strongly . Strong robust construction throughout . Strong easily adjustable clamps . Large ~ dia heavily chrome plated solid steel posts . Large easy read dial . Dial settable for both Zero and Tolerance range . Dead on accuracy . Comes in a nice strong case . Even has multipage instructions that -LRB- if needed -RRB- are very easy to follow . Instructions are even written by someone who first language was obliviously English . I was initially looking at the Dial Indicator from the Girr ... . Company . The Grr . . unit was about 10 dollars cheaper , but many reviews here indicated flimsy construction . This is definitely not the case for the unit from Peachtree . I made the right choice , definitely worth the ten bucks more ! I also ordered the multiple tip set direct from Peachtree -LRB- not available from Amazon -RRB- for $ 16.00 , very reasonable .
 A power tool woodworker must be a machinist before being a woodworker . The machines must be set up and aligned as perfectly as the product to be produced by the woodworker . I dial indicator is a valuable contribution to the process.This particular product has an number of configurations in which it can be set up ; however , unlike every other product I have ever purchased , it arrives without any instructions whatsoever on how to to configure the device to accomplish any of its positions . An email to hartville resulted in a referral to an American Woodworker site which has some great advice as to how and why to use the dial indictor.I used it to align my jointer , which took some of the pain out of the job and improved the results dramatically .
 For the money -- This dial indicator and magnetic base is TOP quality ... . If your looking for something decent You need n't look any futher . . Do not waste your time and money on the absolute cheap systems ... Get this one !!!

 Typical of box of flat washers . Every washer was usable , none were deformed or not able to be used.Works great , just as described.Shipped fast .
 My what a wonderful , fine washer . Nice smooth ID , OD . And the surfaces , even smoother!I am being a bit facetious . After all , it 's just a flat washer.However , I was truly amazed that Amazon had these in stock . Consider the near infinite number of combinations of ID , OD , thickness and material . And Amazon seemed to have them all available . Truly impressive.I had tried to find this particular size before by surfing the web , with no success . Amazon did it .

 I lost the original ring to my Nissan Stainless coffee cup , and was looking for a new one on Amazon , when Amazon suggested this o-ring to me . What a good suggestion ! Now my old cup has a new lease on life and I can lose the ring like 9 more times before I have to buy a whole new one : -RRB-
 I got these on a suggestion on an airsoft repair forum . They fit snugly into the fill valves , providing a better outer seal than most factory standard o-rings , and at a far better price than the exact same product when sold somewhere like Evike . The one problem I had was that my bag had 88 in it instead of 100 . I 'm not actually upset , since the price difference between it and other similar products still made this worth it , but a little more accuracy in the numbers would be appreciated.Pros - Great PriceFits snugly in placePlenty for more replacements lateCons - Did n't actually receive 100
 My favorite Nalgene 750ml bottle had turned into a `` dribble '' bottle . This ring is the correct size to fit over the neck and seal against the cap when the cap is screwed on . Not perfect - when you unscrew the cap , a little water that was sitting above the ring will drip . But I 'm not getting dripped on when I drink .
 WOW , researched `` O '' Rings off & online for awhile , almost bought one at another store online , but it was 5 times the price , I thought of amazon and I probably could have done even better , but I am pleased with these.Thank you again , Amazon has not let me down yet !! NO LEAKS!Tim
 excellent price and good delivery . the item will be used to seal pyrex glass tubes used for a solar boiler to create steam .
 Just standard O-rings . They work great for 5-gallon soda kegs used for home brewing . With the 100-pk , I wo n't have to buy more ... ever .
 I really like these instead of the rubber ones I replaced them for . I would do this again since silicone is forever
 This is a perfect replacement O ring for my Thermos Nissan insulated coffee mug . It fit perfectly and provided a tight seal .
 I used this and it worked for my application very good quality and good pricing and also packaging . It 's made well .
 O-rings were top quality , exactly as pictured . Prices are great for only a 10 pack . Exactly what I wanted and expected . What more would you need ?
 The O-rings arrived on time and look good . Amazon has a great selection , far better than any store I could find in town . They are marked in fractional inches , but that size is only approximate . Look in the product description and it will tell you the exact size in thousandths of an inch .
 I purchased these O-rings for replacing the drive belts for a rod dryer -LRB- fishing rods -RRB- . They 're stronger than the originals !
 After purchasing a lower quality product from the local hardware store for about twice the price , I was happy to see Amazon carrying the silicon type of this O-Ring and for a lower price . They are quality products for a great price .
 Looking for a better and cheaper alternative than buying the $ 5 each Omni Heavy Duty whole house filter o-rings ? This is it . The silicone is FDA approved and at $ 5 for 10 pieces !
 Dunno what to say about an o-ring , but they appear to be well-made , come nicely packaged , etc. .

 Excellent stripe tape for car . Vivid color and very easy to install with no akward paper backing to fiddle with . Just roll the tape on for great pin striping both inside and outside car . Holds well with the quality 3M self-adhesive backing . Great value , too !
 This is some good tubing . It is strong but slightly flexible . I definatley recommend it for any lightweight use . this is the end of my review
 I needed to make a very simple coolant manifold for my CNC and this did the trick.Cut it to length , drilled and tapped the holes to the correct size , installed two end caps and tada ! A coolant manifold with some extra material left over.Pros : Cheap.Cut very cleanly.Cons : None .
 THIS SLIDE BOLT WORKS PERFECTLY , IS STUDY AND EASY TO INSTALL . WE USED THESE UP HIGH ON ALL OUR BACK DOORS TO KEEP OUR TODDLER DAUGHTER FROM GETTING OUTSIDE TO DECK AND STEPS . JUST ADDITIONAL SECURITY AND PEACE OF MIND .
 This is what you want . Economical and high quality . Works perfectly . Great alternative to the factory or firearms products . 100 rounds test proved perfect performance .
 I ordered these orings to repair my ford 6.9 diesel engine . I used them on the injector leak-off jackets to reseal them . They worked great and were a great deal .
 I had been going through o-rings on our tube filling machine like crazy . I had to replace it once a week or more often . I decided to order this 25 pack since it was so inexpensive . It 's been a month and a half and I have not yet replaced the first one of these . They seem to be extremely durable so far .
 Fast service and product as described . Fits an old Remington 1100 perfectly at a fraction of the cost of Remington replacements . That 's about all - they are just O-rings .
 Used to replace broken o-ring on a Remington 1100 12 gauge . Product fits perfectly and is of very high quality . At this price you basically have a lifetime supply ! Highly recommend !
 I was looking for an o-ring for my Remington 1100 and other places were asking $ 9 for 1 . You get 50 of these for less than that . My great grandkids will still have these o-rings for the gun lol .
 I was having blow back issues with my 12gauge , and all the suggestions pointed to my gas ports , and the O ring . Now that I have replaced it , I need to get out and shoot again . Hopefully this was the fix . The only draw back with this product , is that you receive a &#34; Costco &#34; supply ; more than enough for a lifetime .
 Used this to replace my o ring on my BMW 's DISA valve . O ring is not available from the dealer . Worked perfectly and solved my vacuum leak .
 Fits my Remington 1100 Shotgun perfect ! Replaced my old hard worn out one . I dont think I will ever use all 50 of them , but maybe some friends will need some .
 It is just what you would expect . Works fine , looks like good stuff . I go through a bunch of these on camp fuel stoves and bottles . Viton lasts much longer than NBR .
 I bought this part to use on the fuel pump plate of my bmw r1150r . I think it 's also the same part for 1100 too . It works just as well at fraction of the cost quoted by dealerships
 This seal works for early BMW oil filter stand O-Ring , not available from dealer . Or you end up buying new style housing which is a lot more .
 Just what I needed to fix my pool fill valve . 25 is a lot but now I 'm covered .
 Yes , this is the one you 've been hunting , and yes , my 91 geo 1.0 quit leaking from there . What to do with the extra nine ? Well , I do n't know either , but its hard to beat the price !!!
 Thanks for stocking these O-rings ; I could not find them locally . Just what I needed . Still arrived ahead of a few other items I ordered at the same time from other venders here on Amazon so I changed my review to five stars .
 I 'm always running for o rings for something now I have a stock at home .

 Nylon 6/6 Flat Washers # 8 0.177 '' ID 0.408 '' OD 0.062 ' thick washers for isolation from ground or vibration of screw heads . Pack of 100 round washers are handy for new installations where vibration from screwed source needs to be isolated from Hold down .
 These are nice , thick , strong nylon washers . They 're perfect for use with nylon bolts . Probably would work well with metal bolts on a project where you do n't want to mar the joined material .
 They are exactly what one would expect - work and fit as advertised . We used them for a project involving microwaves .
 These washers are the washers in the picture and function as such . Really not much to say other than they are as described .
 Seem to be fine . Used them as spacers for prototype Li-ion batteries . Nylon holds up well in glycol-based electrolytes . Not sure about long-term stability though .
 These washers are awesome . Yes ... an awesome nylon washer . I really needed to find a specific washer material and thickness , and these were perfect . I have found no defects , they are the correct thickness and size and they look great -LRB- no flashing or uneven thickness -RRB- . I have used around 30 of these with no problems , it 's great to find a product on Amazon that is perfect for my needs , and is delivered as described . I would definitely order these again !
 Bought these to attach screws through metal cabinet into wood subfranme so as not to damage paint on cabinet , work fine .
 Nylon Flat Washers , what else can I say ? They are flat made of nylon and have a hole in the middle ...
 Good quality bar of brass . I used this to make the hilt of a sword . it arrived fast and in perfect condition .
 Really good quality . I 'm not certain all the uses my husband has planned for this item , but I do know he used it to make an inscription plaque for a desk he built . The plaque turned out beautifully .
 Yup , it 's a 1/4 '' x 3/4 '' x 24L Brass Rectangular Bar . Not much more to say . Have a nice day !

 I am impressed with the price to quality with these bits . I ordered a couple extras because they were cheap , and I thought they might not last . I 've drilled about 8 holes so far with one bit and it looks to be in good shape yet .
 The item was to my satisfaction , quick service -LRB- got it within 5 days -RRB- and safely packed . I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in this kind of product .

 I bought these o-rings as a replacement on my Nissan spill proof travel mug . I use this mug all the time . It will keep a cup of freshly made tea or coffee hot for 3-4 hours if left closed , or at the right drinking temperature for a full hour . I tried to find a replacement for the o-ring at the Nissan website but could not . These o-rings are an excellent replacement . The mug closes water tight and works like new . Highly recommended for this application .
 These are very strong little o-rings , with plenty of tensile strength . I read a recent DIY article online about turning certain fountain pens -LRB- Platinum Preppy line -RRB- into eye dropper fountain pens using this size o-ring . I wanted to give it a try , and I must admit it worked like a charm . No leaks , perfect . Search online for `` eye dropper fountain pen '' and `` o-ring '' or perhaps `` make your own '' and you should be able to find it , if you 're interested . Fun , and a good use of the pen and the ink .
 I bought these based on the recommendation of a previous reviewer . The seal on my Nissan 14oz Leakproof Insulated Travel Mug broke when I was washing it , and without the seal , it was n't leakproof . These work great . Thanks , previous reviewer !
 My husband takes a Thermos travel mug of coffee with him every workday , and the o-ring was very stained . I also figured that eventually it would relax and no longer provide a tight , leakproof fit . I thought finding a replacement would be impossible , but , when it looks impossible ... try Amazon ! Found these , which are the exact size as the original . We 're set for a long time , now !

 Excellent stripe tape for car . Vivid color and very easy to install with no akward paper backing to fiddle with . Just roll the tape on for great pin striping both inside and outside car . Holds well with the quality 3M self-adhesive backing . Great value , too !

 Fits my Remington 1100 Shotgun perfect ! Replaced my old hard worn out one . I dont think I will ever use all 50 of them , but maybe some friends will need some .
 It is just what you would expect . Works fine , looks like good stuff . I go through a bunch of these on camp fuel stoves and bottles . Viton lasts much longer than NBR .
 I bought this part to use on the fuel pump plate of my bmw r1150r . I think it 's also the same part for 1100 too . It works just as well at fraction of the cost quoted by dealerships
 This seal works for early BMW oil filter stand O-Ring , not available from dealer . Or you end up buying new style housing which is a lot more .
 Just what I needed to fix my pool fill valve . 25 is a lot but now I 'm covered .
 Yes , this is the one you 've been hunting , and yes , my 91 geo 1.0 quit leaking from there . What to do with the extra nine ? Well , I do n't know either , but its hard to beat the price !!!
 Thanks for stocking these O-rings ; I could not find them locally . Just what I needed . Still arrived ahead of a few other items I ordered at the same time from other venders here on Amazon so I changed my review to five stars .
 I 'm always running for o rings for something now I have a stock at home .

 This is what you want . Economical and high quality . Works perfectly . Great alternative to the factory or firearms products . 100 rounds test proved perfect performance .
 I ordered these orings to repair my ford 6.9 diesel engine . I used them on the injector leak-off jackets to reseal them . They worked great and were a great deal .
 I had been going through o-rings on our tube filling machine like crazy . I had to replace it once a week or more often . I decided to order this 25 pack since it was so inexpensive . It 's been a month and a half and I have not yet replaced the first one of these . They seem to be extremely durable so far .
 Fast service and product as described . Fits an old Remington 1100 perfectly at a fraction of the cost of Remington replacements . That 's about all - they are just O-rings .
 Used to replace broken o-ring on a Remington 1100 12 gauge . Product fits perfectly and is of very high quality . At this price you basically have a lifetime supply ! Highly recommend !
 I was looking for an o-ring for my Remington 1100 and other places were asking $ 9 for 1 . You get 50 of these for less than that . My great grandkids will still have these o-rings for the gun lol .
 I was having blow back issues with my 12gauge , and all the suggestions pointed to my gas ports , and the O ring . Now that I have replaced it , I need to get out and shoot again . Hopefully this was the fix . The only draw back with this product , is that you receive a &#34; Costco &#34; supply ; more than enough for a lifetime .
 Used this to replace my o ring on my BMW 's DISA valve . O ring is not available from the dealer . Worked perfectly and solved my vacuum leak .
 I ordered several of these bits in order to insert some anchor bolts into concrete flooring . These bits are great , like a hot knife going through butter , when used with a good hammerdrill . Usual Amazon packaging , shipping , delivery ... with incident and timely .

 Used this to replace my o ring on my BMW 's DISA valve . O ring is not available from the dealer . Worked perfectly and solved my vacuum leak .
 Just standard O-rings . They work great for 5-gallon soda kegs used for home brewing . With the 100-pk , I wo n't have to buy more ... ever .
 I really like these instead of the rubber ones I replaced them for . I would do this again since silicone is forever
 This is a perfect replacement O ring for my Thermos Nissan insulated coffee mug . It fit perfectly and provided a tight seal .
 I used this and it worked for my application very good quality and good pricing and also packaging . It 's made well .
 O-rings were top quality , exactly as pictured . Prices are great for only a 10 pack . Exactly what I wanted and expected . What more would you need ?
 The O-rings arrived on time and look good . Amazon has a great selection , far better than any store I could find in town . They are marked in fractional inches , but that size is only approximate . Look in the product description and it will tell you the exact size in thousandths of an inch .
 I purchased these O-rings for replacing the drive belts for a rod dryer -LRB- fishing rods -RRB- . They 're stronger than the originals !
 After purchasing a lower quality product from the local hardware store for about twice the price , I was happy to see Amazon carrying the silicon type of this O-Ring and for a lower price . They are quality products for a great price .
 Looking for a better and cheaper alternative than buying the $ 5 each Omni Heavy Duty whole house filter o-rings ? This is it . The silicone is FDA approved and at $ 5 for 10 pieces !

 I bought these o-rings as a replacement on my Nissan spill proof travel mug . I use this mug all the time . It will keep a cup of freshly made tea or coffee hot for 3-4 hours if left closed , or at the right drinking temperature for a full hour . I tried to find a replacement for the o-ring at the Nissan website but could not . These o-rings are an excellent replacement . The mug closes water tight and works like new . Highly recommended for this application .
 These are very strong little o-rings , with plenty of tensile strength . I read a recent DIY article online about turning certain fountain pens -LRB- Platinum Preppy line -RRB- into eye dropper fountain pens using this size o-ring . I wanted to give it a try , and I must admit it worked like a charm . No leaks , perfect . Search online for `` eye dropper fountain pen '' and `` o-ring '' or perhaps `` make your own '' and you should be able to find it , if you 're interested . Fun , and a good use of the pen and the ink .
 I bought these based on the recommendation of a previous reviewer . The seal on my Nissan 14oz Leakproof Insulated Travel Mug broke when I was washing it , and without the seal , it was n't leakproof . These work great . Thanks , previous reviewer !
 My husband takes a Thermos travel mug of coffee with him every workday , and the o-ring was very stained . I also figured that eventually it would relax and no longer provide a tight , leakproof fit . I thought finding a replacement would be impossible , but , when it looks impossible ... try Amazon ! Found these , which are the exact size as the original . We 're set for a long time , now !
 I lost the original ring to my Nissan Stainless coffee cup , and was looking for a new one on Amazon , when Amazon suggested this o-ring to me . What a good suggestion ! Now my old cup has a new lease on life and I can lose the ring like 9 more times before I have to buy a whole new one : -RRB-
 I got these on a suggestion on an airsoft repair forum . They fit snugly into the fill valves , providing a better outer seal than most factory standard o-rings , and at a far better price than the exact same product when sold somewhere like Evike . The one problem I had was that my bag had 88 in it instead of 100 . I 'm not actually upset , since the price difference between it and other similar products still made this worth it , but a little more accuracy in the numbers would be appreciated.Pros - Great PriceFits snugly in placePlenty for more replacements lateCons - Did n't actually receive 100
 My favorite Nalgene 750ml bottle had turned into a `` dribble '' bottle . This ring is the correct size to fit over the neck and seal against the cap when the cap is screwed on . Not perfect - when you unscrew the cap , a little water that was sitting above the ring will drip . But I 'm not getting dripped on when I drink .
 WOW , researched `` O '' Rings off & online for awhile , almost bought one at another store online , but it was 5 times the price , I thought of amazon and I probably could have done even better , but I am pleased with these.Thank you again , Amazon has not let me down yet !! NO LEAKS!Tim
 excellent price and good delivery . the item will be used to seal pyrex glass tubes used for a solar boiler to create steam .
 Really good quality . I 'm not certain all the uses my husband has planned for this item , but I do know he used it to make an inscription plaque for a desk he built . The plaque turned out beautifully .
 Yup , it 's a 1/4 '' x 3/4 '' x 24L Brass Rectangular Bar . Not much more to say . Have a nice day !

 The item was to my satisfaction , quick service -LRB- got it within 5 days -RRB- and safely packed . I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in this kind of product .
 This product is a selection of sheet metal squares of varying thickness , not a set of uniform thickness squares . The set comes with a scrap of green paper giving the thicknesses included , which I tried to save for this review but alas , it has escaped , just as it did from the person who wrote the original product description . If I find it , I will update this review with the exact thicknesses of the sheet metal squares . Otherwise product is fine . Arrived without any rust .
 This is a high quality stainless steel sheet . Easy to cut , resistant to rusting . I do n't think the quality could be better .
 I ordered this to replace a piece of aluminium which was corroding badly due to the environment it was in , I have cut a piece off , painted it white and put it into service ... We 'll know how corrosion resistant it is in a few years !
 4130 tube steel takes to diamond paste for hi luster fine , moving parts inside tube such as carbon fiber piston -RCB-
 Quick delivery - fair price . I used this part on a project where safety was the concern and after 6 months of use , it has proven to be high quality.Do not use that junk that you buy at the home improvement stores . Stock up on this type of hardware that performs the way it is supposed to .

 I was looking for an o-ring for my Remington 1100 and other places were asking $ 9 for 1 . You get 50 of these for less than that . My great grandkids will still have these o-rings for the gun lol .
 I was having blow back issues with my 12gauge , and all the suggestions pointed to my gas ports , and the O ring . Now that I have replaced it , I need to get out and shoot again . Hopefully this was the fix . The only draw back with this product , is that you receive a &#34; Costco &#34; supply ; more than enough for a lifetime .
 Used this to replace my o ring on my BMW 's DISA valve . O ring is not available from the dealer . Worked perfectly and solved my vacuum leak .
 Fits my Remington 1100 Shotgun perfect ! Replaced my old hard worn out one . I dont think I will ever use all 50 of them , but maybe some friends will need some .
 It is just what you would expect . Works fine , looks like good stuff . I go through a bunch of these on camp fuel stoves and bottles . Viton lasts much longer than NBR .
 I bought this part to use on the fuel pump plate of my bmw r1150r . I think it 's also the same part for 1100 too . It works just as well at fraction of the cost quoted by dealerships
 This seal works for early BMW oil filter stand O-Ring , not available from dealer . Or you end up buying new style housing which is a lot more .
 Just what I needed to fix my pool fill valve . 25 is a lot but now I 'm covered .
 Yes , this is the one you 've been hunting , and yes , my 91 geo 1.0 quit leaking from there . What to do with the extra nine ? Well , I do n't know either , but its hard to beat the price !!!
 Thanks for stocking these O-rings ; I could not find them locally . Just what I needed . Still arrived ahead of a few other items I ordered at the same time from other venders here on Amazon so I changed my review to five stars .
 I 'm always running for o rings for something now I have a stock at home .
 Dunno what to say about an o-ring , but they appear to be well-made , come nicely packaged , etc. .

 Really good quality . I 'm not certain all the uses my husband has planned for this item , but I do know he used it to make an inscription plaque for a desk he built . The plaque turned out beautifully .
 Yup , it 's a 1/4 '' x 3/4 '' x 24L Brass Rectangular Bar . Not much more to say . Have a nice day !
 Quick delivery - fair price . I used this part on a project where safety was the concern and after 6 months of use , it has proven to be high quality.Do not use that junk that you buy at the home improvement stores . Stock up on this type of hardware that performs the way it is supposed to .

 I ordered these orings to repair my ford 6.9 diesel engine . I used them on the injector leak-off jackets to reseal them . They worked great and were a great deal .
 I had been going through o-rings on our tube filling machine like crazy . I had to replace it once a week or more often . I decided to order this 25 pack since it was so inexpensive .

 4130 tube steel takes to diamond paste for hi luster fine , moving parts inside tube such as carbon fiber piston -RCB-
 It is what it is . The size was correct . It shipped fast and Amazon fulfilled the shipping from their warehouse so the shipping was free supposedly . I just checked the invoice and it said 7.29 shipping and handling . So I guess the super saver is n't really what it says it is , free shipping . If they start adding handling fees on it 's just like the lowlife eBay people that say free shipping and then tack on 10 bucks for handling.Other than that I wish Small parts had 1/2 '' stock . I need that too.John O'Donnell
 I bought these o-rings as a replacement on my Nissan spill proof travel mug . I use this mug all the time . It will keep a cup of freshly made tea or coffee hot for 3-4 hours if left closed , or at the right drinking temperature for a full hour . I tried to find a replacement for the o-ring at the Nissan website but could not . These o-rings are an excellent replacement . The mug closes water tight and works like new . Highly recommended for this application .
 These are very strong little o-rings , with plenty of tensile strength . I read a recent DIY article online about turning certain fountain pens -LRB- Platinum Preppy line -RRB- into eye dropper fountain pens using this size o-ring . I wanted to give it a try , and I must admit it worked like a charm . No leaks , perfect . Search online for `` eye dropper fountain pen '' and `` o-ring '' or perhaps `` make your own '' and you should be able to find it , if you 're interested . Fun , and a good use of the pen and the ink .
 I bought these based on the recommendation of a previous reviewer . The seal on my Nissan 14oz Leakproof Insulated Travel Mug broke when I was washing it , and without the seal , it was n't leakproof . These work great . Thanks , previous reviewer !
 My husband takes a Thermos travel mug of coffee with him every workday , and the o-ring was very stained . I also figured that eventually it would relax and no longer provide a tight , leakproof fit . I thought finding a replacement would be impossible , but , when it looks impossible ... try Amazon ! Found these , which are the exact size as the original . We 're set for a long time , now !
 I lost the original ring to my Nissan Stainless coffee cup , and was looking for a new one on Amazon , when Amazon suggested this o-ring to me . What a good suggestion ! Now my old cup has a new lease on life and I can lose the ring like 9 more times before I have to buy a whole new one : -RRB-
 I got these on a suggestion on an airsoft repair forum . They fit snugly into the fill valves , providing a better outer seal than most factory standard o-rings , and at a far better price than the exact same product when sold somewhere like Evike . The one problem I had was that my bag had 88 in it instead of 100 . I 'm not actually upset , since the price difference between it and other similar products still made this worth it , but a little more accuracy in the numbers would be appreciated.Pros - Great PriceFits snugly in placePlenty for more replacements lateCons - Did n't actually receive 100
 My favorite Nalgene 750ml bottle had turned into a `` dribble '' bottle . This ring is the correct size to fit over the neck and seal against the cap when the cap is screwed on . Not perfect - when you unscrew the cap , a little water that was sitting above the ring will drip . But I 'm not getting dripped on when I drink .
 WOW , researched `` O '' Rings off & online for awhile , almost bought one at another store online , but it was 5 times the price , I thought of amazon and I probably could have done even better , but I am pleased with these.Thank you again , Amazon has not let me down yet !! NO LEAKS!Tim
 excellent price and good delivery . the item will be used to seal pyrex glass tubes used for a solar boiler to create steam .
 Just standard O-rings . They work great for 5-gallon soda kegs used for home brewing . With the 100-pk , I wo n't have to buy more ... ever .
 I really like these instead of the rubber ones I replaced them for . I would do this again since silicone is forever
 This is a perfect replacement O ring for my Thermos Nissan insulated coffee mug . It fit perfectly and provided a tight seal .
 I used this and it worked for my application very good quality and good pricing and also packaging . It 's made well .
 O-rings were top quality , exactly as pictured . Prices are great for only a 10 pack . Exactly what I wanted and expected . What more would you need ?
 The O-rings arrived on time and look good . Amazon has a great selection , far better than any store I could find in town . They are marked in fractional inches , but that size is only approximate . Look in the product description and it will tell you the exact size in thousandths of an inch .
 I purchased these O-rings for replacing the drive belts for a rod dryer -LRB- fishing rods -RRB- . They 're stronger than the originals !
 After purchasing a lower quality product from the local hardware store for about twice the price , I was happy to see Amazon carrying the silicon type of this O-Ring and for a lower price . They are quality products for a great price .
 Looking for a better and cheaper alternative than buying the $ 5 each Omni Heavy Duty whole house filter o-rings ? This is it . The silicone is FDA approved and at $ 5 for 10 pieces !

 Excellent stripe tape for car . Vivid color and very easy to install with no akward paper backing to fiddle with . Just roll the tape on for great pin striping both inside and outside car . Holds well with the quality 3M self-adhesive backing . Great value , too !

 I use these to move boat lifts so they are exposed to grime and moisture EVERY USE and not treated with much care . I dry them out before storage and lube the mechanism with WD40 every 3rd or 4th use . They work great and hold up well to our abuse !
 I have been very satisfied with this tie down . It is built very well and easy to operate . The webbing seems to be of high quality and lives up to its 10,000 LB rating . You might see similar model for less money , but be advised there are many cheap imports that will not work as well or as long as these . The only other thing to be aware of with this model is the strap is extremely long . You really do n't need a strap this long unless you have an extremely tall load .
 Great product , excellent price ! Tested towing a 6 ton truck as well ! Heavy duty for sure ! Recommended for all tie downs work
 I got this on sale it looks really heavy duty i do n't know if I would try to pull 10,000 lbs with it but it does the job of strapping just about anything down witch is what I wanted it for anyway . Over all a good buy .

 *** EDIT 7/9/12 12:00 PM *** Well , I posted this review a couple of hours ago , and also notified Amazon about the issue . Within about fifteen minutes , they issued a refund on the shipping charges , escalated the issue immediately with their shipping department and have a representative monitoring my order until it arrives on my doorstep . All I can say is , WOW ! That was definitely not the response I expected , and was very impressed ! *** Original Review *** This is the first time that I 've used the expedited shipping option to update my shipping option from 2-day Prime shipping to 1-day shipping , with an additional upcharge .

 I ordered these orings to repair my ford 6.9 diesel engine . I used them on the injector leak-off jackets to reseal them . They worked great and were a great deal .
 I had been going through o-rings on our tube filling machine like crazy . I had to replace it once a week or more often . I decided to order this 25 pack since it was so inexpensive . It 's been a month and a half and I have not yet replaced the first one of these . They seem to be extremely durable so far .
 Fast service and product as described . Fits an old Remington 1100 perfectly at a fraction of the cost of Remington replacements . That 's about all - they are just O-rings .
 Used to replace broken o-ring on a Remington 1100 12 gauge . Product fits perfectly and is of very high quality . At this price you basically have a lifetime supply ! Highly recommend !
 I was looking for an o-ring for my Remington 1100 and other places were asking $ 9 for 1 . You get 50 of these for less than that . My great grandkids will still have these o-rings for the gun lol .
 I was having blow back issues with my 12gauge , and all the suggestions pointed to my gas ports , and the O ring . Now that I have replaced it , I need to get out and shoot again . Hopefully this was the fix . The only draw back with this product , is that you receive a &#34; Costco &#34; supply ; more than enough for a lifetime .
 Used this to replace my o ring on my BMW 's DISA valve . O ring is not available from the dealer . Worked perfectly and solved my vacuum leak .
 Fits my Remington 1100 Shotgun perfect ! Replaced my old hard worn out one . I dont think I will ever use all 50 of them , but maybe some friends will need some .
 It is just what you would expect . Works fine , looks like good stuff . I go through a bunch of these on camp fuel stoves and bottles . Viton lasts much longer than NBR .
 I bought this part to use on the fuel pump plate of my bmw r1150r . I think it 's also the same part for 1100 too . It works just as well at fraction of the cost quoted by dealerships
 This seal works for early BMW oil filter stand O-Ring , not available from dealer . Or you end up buying new style housing which is a lot more .
 Just what I needed to fix my pool fill valve . 25 is a lot but now I 'm covered .
 Yes , this is the one you 've been hunting , and yes , my 91 geo 1.0 quit leaking from there . What to do with the extra nine ? Well , I do n't know either , but its hard to beat the price !!!
 Thanks for stocking these O-rings ; I could not find them locally . Just what I needed . Still arrived ahead of a few other items I ordered at the same time from other venders here on Amazon so I changed my review to five stars .
 I 'm always running for o rings for something now I have a stock at home .
 Dunno what to say about an o-ring , but they appear to be well-made , come nicely packaged , etc. .

 It is what it is . The size was correct . It shipped fast and Amazon fulfilled the shipping from their warehouse so the shipping was free supposedly . I just checked the invoice and it said 7.29 shipping and handling . So I guess the super saver is n't really what it says it is , free shipping . If they start adding handling fees on it 's just like the lowlife eBay people that say free shipping and then tack on 10 bucks for handling.Other than that I wish Small parts had 1/2 '' stock . I need that too.John O'Donnell

 I bought this as a door weight for the bottom of my dog door , but it was too heavy so I gave it to my mechanic friend . He was delighted to get it . It 's a handy piece of steel to have around , but I do n't have a torch or a welder .

 Good quality bar of brass . I used this to make the hilt of a sword . it arrived fast and in perfect condition .

 Really good quality . I 'm not certain all the uses my husband has planned for this item , but I do know he used it to make an inscription plaque for a desk he built . The plaque turned out beautifully .
 Yup , it 's a 1/4 '' x 3/4 '' x 24L Brass Rectangular Bar . Not much more to say . Have a nice day !
 Cheap , sometimes useful box . Very inexpensive , but Elenco cut lots of corners to get there -LRB- although , I would argue , for the most part , the right corners -RRB- . The PCB does n't have the pads tinned . The resistors -LRB- and this I would have done differently -RRB- are 5 % rather than 1 % . The box it comes with is much thicker than necessary . The single-layer PCB requires a couple of jumpers . The white pointers on the knobs can not line up quite right with the numbers -LRB- it 's off by about 1/3 of a number one way or the other -RRB- . Overall , though , I would say a good product for the very fair price .
 I do a little soldering with my dollhouse miniatures and am just starting to use the LED lights which need resistors . I honestly missed the `` kit '' part of the description , but I will have to say , `` It was great experience at soldering ! '' The instructions are excellent , easy for a beginner to follow and it went together like a charm . I would highly recommend it to anyone .
 This very nice but low-cost resistor box is available in both kit and assembled versions - and some wound up with the kit version instead of assembled . For some reason , the manufacturer does n't bother to use different part numbers for the two versions . I ordered an assembled one from the one supplier that carries both and clearly indicates `` kit '' and `` assembled '' in the product descriptions -- RTE Scientific .
 Bought this as a kit . It assembled very easily . The directions were well written . Finished product works great and is excellent .
 I love these Elenco kits !! The overall kit quality is very high - with very high quality parts . The kit integrity is the best I 've ever seen -LRB- all parts included exactly as described -RRB- ; and the instructions are PERFECT !! I have built a lot of electronic kits over the years - and none provide instructions this good . I built 5 of these kits in the last month - and there has not been 1 mistake ; not one omitted part ; not one wrong component value ; and not one awkward or incorrect or out-of sequence build instruction . They especially excel at pointing out places where care needs to be taken due to a future step in the same area . And - they provide additional instructional information at just the right places in the instructions -LRB- resistor charts / capacitor value info / polarization codes on components - etc -RRB- . Well done Elenco !!!
 Basic sub box . Easy to assemble with step by step check off instructions suitable for beginners . All parts are mounted on the PC board and locations are clearly marked . Prompt delivery . Adequate range of values for hobbyist , experimenter . or tech . school .
 easy to assemble and works ok , would be nice if the knobs would only go on in one position to take the guess work out . also would be nice if the resistors were a bit closer to tolerance . i wish i would have found a product to buy that had more adjustment for advanced projects and fine tuning instead of this . but overall i guess i ca n't complain too much because of the low price
 Item as advertized , Priced well within reason . Easy to put together , Worked well for my hobby use . I would recommend this item .

 It 's a whole bunch of roll pins in just about any size you 'd need in a handy plastic box so I do n't have to make a 20 mile round trip to the hardware store when I need one . I have n't checked them out thoroughly so I do n't know if they 're spring steel or mild steel or whether they 're slightly over spec or under spec in diameter . I 'd use them on any repair around the house and would use them in a gun that needed one , but might think twice before performing a field expedient repair on the space shuttle ... then again , maybe I would n't . They 're just fine . If you have use for roll pins from time to time and want to have a whole bunch of them in a handy compartmented plastic box , get them . Otherwise you may have to modify a nail to form a temporary rivet which you 'll have to drill out the next time you need to take apart whatever you fixed that really needed a roll pin in the first place .
 The item -LRB- s -RRB- were as advertised . Price is unbelievably low . Shipping was much faster than expected . Item fulfilled my needs perfectly . I am a gun-tinkerer -LRB- As opposed to a gumsmith -RRB- and need parts like this to replace lost or broken parts on relic guns I buy for my collection . Thanks for a good product .
 Product was as described . The roll pins came in a variety of sizes for all needs . Good product !
 Honestly I bought this to have just in case of needing a roll pin . For what it cost it is way easier to buy this and have a `` stock '' of them than to pay for gas to go to a store and TRY to find one and pay out the nose for it if I do . The local hardware stores like to stick it to you for things like this anywhere from $ .10 to $ 2 depending on the size so for less than $ 15 -LRB- which is less than a nickel a piece -RRB- this is a GREAT VALUE to have around.TRUE - MOST of the pins in this set are bigger than needed for weapons but this is still a good set to have - especially when you need one of the large pins - they ad up quick at the local hardware store.Just buy one - you know you may need one in the future - and for what gas costs that alone pays for this set .
 Good quality , quantity and selection.Nice to have when you have to have one.When nothing else will do this is what you need .
 These Neiko Tools `` 315 piece Roll Pin Assortment '' comes with a convenient plastic storage case and holds 30 common roll pin sizes . We are in the process of opening a small gun shop and already do a fair amount of gunsmithing that requires the use of roll pins , so wanted to have a selection of these on-hand . Most of the pins are longer than we need and have to be cut down , but that is not really an issue for us . We use the smaller roll pins often but I think the larger sizes are going to sit around awhile.This is a decent quality set and reasonable value.Recommended!CFH
 Good quality bar of brass . I used this to make the hilt of a sword . it arrived fast and in perfect condition .
 The item is just as described . It 's made by Stock Gear Inc. and resold by Small Parts Inc. . The face width is 3/8 inch . The gear I.D. is 5/16 inch . The hub diameter is about 11/16 inch and the hub projects about 3/8 inch beyond the gear on one side only . The hub is plain and must be drilled for a pin or set screw or else press fit to a shaft.I bought 5 of them at 20 cents each . Three days later , they are $ 3.52 each ! Same with many other gears I bought . What 's up with that ?
 Well made pins that work perfectly . The handle casting is slightly rough on one side of the T-Handle on both of the pins that i ordered but this does not effect how they work and i guess is a by-product of the casting process . Other than this very minor cosmetic point they are excellent pins an i would recommend them .

 When I was considering purchasing one of these I could n't find whether or not it had a set screw installed . Having gotten one , I now know that it does have a set screw . So in case anybody else is wondering ... now you know .
 I got this pulley for my project ... I attached with timing belt and motors together . It works perfectly . I got all the parts from same seller . They all coming in same package , it helps me alot . I had all the parts I need .

 I needed it for a few holes . I have a weird house that has a concrete floor supported by tiles and steel bar instead of plywood and joists . It is solid but a pain to run wires and pipes from the basement to the first floor . This bit was perfect with a deWalt hammer drill to get a long hole made to run some wire from a bedroom downstairs , so i could wire in an electric baseboard heater . Would recommend , it took about 2 minutes to get through , which i consider to be very fast for that task . would buy again if ever need a different size also !
 I 've been buying Bosch bits from Home Depot . Generally , drilling concrete , I was lucky to sink four holes before the bit became bent and useless -LRB- they would bend long before they became dull -RRB- . These bits are considerably less expensive and a better quality . If you have a similar problem , you might give these a try . I 'm happy .

 I bought these o-rings as a replacement on my Nissan spill proof travel mug . I use this mug all the time . It will keep a cup of freshly made tea or coffee hot for 3-4 hours if left closed , or at the right drinking temperature for a full hour . I tried to find a replacement for the o-ring at the Nissan website but could not . These o-rings are an excellent replacement . The mug closes water tight and works like new . Highly recommended for this application .
 These are very strong little o-rings , with plenty of tensile strength . I read a recent DIY article online about turning certain fountain pens -LRB- Platinum Preppy line -RRB- into eye dropper fountain pens using this size o-ring . I wanted to give it a try , and I must admit it worked like a charm . No leaks , perfect . Search online for `` eye dropper fountain pen '' and `` o-ring '' or perhaps `` make your own '' and you should be able to find it , if you 're interested . Fun , and a good use of the pen and the ink .
 I bought these based on the recommendation of a previous reviewer . The seal on my Nissan 14oz Leakproof Insulated Travel Mug broke when I was washing it , and without the seal , it was n't leakproof . These work great . Thanks , previous reviewer !
 My husband takes a Thermos travel mug of coffee with him every workday , and the o-ring was very stained . I also figured that eventually it would relax and no longer provide a tight , leakproof fit . I thought finding a replacement would be impossible , but , when it looks impossible ... try Amazon ! Found these , which are the exact size as the original . We 're set for a long time , now !
 I lost the original ring to my Nissan Stainless coffee cup , and was looking for a new one on Amazon , when Amazon suggested this o-ring to me . What a good suggestion ! Now my old cup has a new lease on life and I can lose the ring like 9 more times before I have to buy a whole new one : -RRB-
 I got these on a suggestion on an airsoft repair forum . They fit snugly into the fill valves , providing a better outer seal than most factory standard o-rings , and at a far better price than the exact same product when sold somewhere like Evike . The one problem I had was that my bag had 88 in it instead of 100 . I 'm not actually upset , since the price difference between it and other similar products still made this worth it , but a little more accuracy in the numbers would be appreciated.Pros - Great PriceFits snugly in placePlenty for more replacements lateCons - Did n't actually receive 100
 My favorite Nalgene 750ml bottle had turned into a `` dribble '' bottle . This ring is the correct size to fit over the neck and seal against the cap when the cap is screwed on . Not perfect - when you unscrew the cap , a little water that was sitting above the ring will drip . But I 'm not getting dripped on when I drink .
 WOW , researched `` O '' Rings off & online for awhile , almost bought one at another store online , but it was 5 times the price , I thought of amazon and I probably could have done even better , but I am pleased with these.Thank you again , Amazon has not let me down yet !! NO LEAKS!Tim
 excellent price and good delivery . the item will be used to seal pyrex glass tubes used for a solar boiler to create steam .
 Just standard O-rings . They work great for 5-gallon soda kegs used for home brewing . With the 100-pk , I wo n't have to buy more ... ever .
 I really like these instead of the rubber ones I replaced them for . I would do this again since silicone is forever
 This is a perfect replacement O ring for my Thermos Nissan insulated coffee mug . It fit perfectly and provided a tight seal .
 I used this and it worked for my application very good quality and good pricing and also packaging . It 's made well .
 O-rings were top quality , exactly as pictured . Prices are great for only a 10 pack . Exactly what I wanted and expected . What more would you need ?
 The O-rings arrived on time and look good . Amazon has a great selection , far better than any store I could find in town . They are marked in fractional inches , but that size is only approximate . Look in the product description and it will tell you the exact size in thousandths of an inch .
 I purchased these O-rings for replacing the drive belts for a rod dryer -LRB- fishing rods -RRB- . They 're stronger than the originals !
 After purchasing a lower quality product from the local hardware store for about twice the price , I was happy to see Amazon carrying the silicon type of this O-Ring and for a lower price . They are quality products for a great price .
 Looking for a better and cheaper alternative than buying the $ 5 each Omni Heavy Duty whole house filter o-rings ? This is it . The silicone is FDA approved and at $ 5 for 10 pieces !
 Dunno what to say about an o-ring , but they appear to be well-made , come nicely packaged , etc. .

 Excellent stripe tape for car . Vivid color and very easy to install with no akward paper backing to fiddle with . Just roll the tape on for great pin striping both inside and outside car . Holds well with the quality 3M self-adhesive backing . Great value , too !
 The item was to my satisfaction , quick service -LRB- got it within 5 days -RRB- and safely packed . I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in this kind of product .

The hub diameter is about 11/16 inch and the hub projects about 3/8 inch beyond the gear on one side only . The hub is plain and must be drilled for a pin or set screw or else press fit to a shaft.I bought 5 of them at 20 cents each . Three days later , they are $ 3.52 each ! Same with many other gears I bought . What 's up with that ?

 Fits my Remington 1100 Shotgun perfect ! Replaced my old hard worn out one . I dont think I will ever use all 50 of them , but maybe some friends will need some .
 It is just what you would expect . Works fine , looks like good stuff . I go through a bunch of these on camp fuel stoves and bottles . Viton lasts much longer than NBR .
 I bought this part to use on the fuel pump plate of my bmw r1150r . I think it 's also the same part for 1100 too . It works just as well at fraction of the cost quoted by dealerships
 This seal works for early BMW oil filter stand O-Ring , not available from dealer . Or you end up buying new style housing which is a lot more .
 Just what I needed to fix my pool fill valve . 25 is a lot but now I 'm covered .
 Yes , this is the one you 've been hunting , and yes , my 91 geo 1.0 quit leaking from there . What to do with the extra nine ? Well , I do n't know either , but its hard to beat the price !!!
 Thanks for stocking these O-rings ; I could not find them locally . Just what I needed . Still arrived ahead of a few other items I ordered at the same time from other venders here on Amazon so I changed my review to five stars .
 I 'm always running for o rings for something now I have a stock at home .

 This is what you want . Economical and high quality . Works perfectly . Great alternative to the factory or firearms products . 100 rounds test proved perfect performance .
 I ordered these orings to repair my ford 6.9 diesel engine . I used them on the injector leak-off jackets to reseal them . They worked great and were a great deal .
 I had been going through o-rings on our tube filling machine like crazy . I had to replace it once a week or more often . I decided to order this 25 pack since it was so inexpensive . It 's been a month and a half and I have not yet replaced the first one of these . They seem to be extremely durable so far .
 Fast service and product as described . Fits an old Remington 1100 perfectly at a fraction of the cost of Remington replacements . That 's about all - they are just O-rings .
 Used to replace broken o-ring on a Remington 1100 12 gauge . Product fits perfectly and is of very high quality . At this price you basically have a lifetime supply ! Highly recommend !
 I was looking for an o-ring for my Remington 1100 and other places were asking $ 9 for 1 . You get 50 of these for less than that . My great grandkids will still have these o-rings for the gun lol .
 I was having blow back issues with my 12gauge , and all the suggestions pointed to my gas ports , and the O ring . Now that I have replaced it , I need to get out and shoot again . Hopefully this was the fix . The only draw back with this product , is that you receive a &#34; Costco &#34; supply ; more than enough for a lifetime .
 Used this to replace my o ring on my BMW 's DISA valve . O ring is not available from the dealer . Worked perfectly and solved my vacuum leak .
 Excellent stripe tape for car . Vivid color and very easy to install with no akward paper backing to fiddle with . Just roll the tape on for great pin striping both inside and outside car . Holds well with the quality 3M self-adhesive backing . Great value , too !
 Just standard O-rings . They work great for 5-gallon soda kegs used for home brewing . With the 100-pk , I wo n't have to buy more ... ever .
 I really like these instead of the rubber ones I replaced them for . I would do this again since silicone is forever
 This is a perfect replacement O ring for my Thermos Nissan insulated coffee mug . It fit perfectly and provided a tight seal .
 I used this and it worked for my application very good quality and good pricing and also packaging . It 's made well .
 O-rings were top quality , exactly as pictured . Prices are great for only a 10 pack . Exactly what I wanted and expected . What more would you need ?
 The O-rings arrived on time and look good . Amazon has a great selection , far better than any store I could find in town . They are marked in fractional inches , but that size is only approximate . Look in the product description and it will tell you the exact size in thousandths of an inch .
 I purchased these O-rings for replacing the drive belts for a rod dryer -LRB- fishing rods -RRB- . They 're stronger than the originals !
 After purchasing a lower quality product from the local hardware store for about twice the price , I was happy to see Amazon carrying the silicon type of this O-Ring and for a lower price . They are quality products for a great price .
 Looking for a better and cheaper alternative than buying the $ 5 each Omni Heavy Duty whole house filter o-rings ? This is it . The silicone is FDA approved and at $ 5 for 10 pieces !

 I bought these o-rings as a replacement on my Nissan spill proof travel mug . I use this mug all the time . It will keep a cup of freshly made tea or coffee hot for 3-4 hours if left closed , or at the right drinking temperature for a full hour . I tried to find a replacement for the o-ring at the Nissan website but could not . These o-rings are an excellent replacement . The mug closes water tight and works like new . Highly recommended for this application .
 These are very strong little o-rings , with plenty of tensile strength . I read a recent DIY article online about turning certain fountain pens -LRB- Platinum Preppy line -RRB- into eye dropper fountain pens using this size o-ring . I wanted to give it a try , and I must admit it worked like a charm . No leaks , perfect . Search online for `` eye dropper fountain pen '' and `` o-ring '' or perhaps `` make your own '' and you should be able to find it , if you 're interested . Fun , and a good use of the pen and the ink .
 I bought these based on the recommendation of a previous reviewer . The seal on my Nissan 14oz Leakproof Insulated Travel Mug broke when I was washing it , and without the seal , it was n't leakproof . These work great . Thanks , previous reviewer !
 My husband takes a Thermos travel mug of coffee with him every workday , and the o-ring was very stained . I also figured that eventually it would relax and no longer provide a tight , leakproof fit . I thought finding a replacement would be impossible , but , when it looks impossible ... try Amazon ! Found these , which are the exact size as the original . We 're set for a long time , now !
 I lost the original ring to my Nissan Stainless coffee cup , and was looking for a new one on Amazon , when Amazon suggested this o-ring to me . What a good suggestion ! Now my old cup has a new lease on life and I can lose the ring like 9 more times before I have to buy a whole new one : -RRB-
 I got these on a suggestion on an airsoft repair forum . They fit snugly into the fill valves , providing a better outer seal than most factory standard o-rings , and at a far better price than the exact same product when sold somewhere like Evike . The one problem I had was that my bag had 88 in it instead of 100 . I 'm not actually upset , since the price difference between it and other similar products still made this worth it , but a little more accuracy in the numbers would be appreciated.Pros - Great PriceFits snugly in placePlenty for more replacements lateCons - Did n't actually receive 100
 My favorite Nalgene 750ml bottle had turned into a `` dribble '' bottle . This ring is the correct size to fit over the neck and seal against the cap when the cap is screwed on . Not perfect - when you unscrew the cap , a little water that was sitting above the ring will drip . But I 'm not getting dripped on when I drink .
 WOW , researched `` O '' Rings off & online for awhile , almost bought one at another store online , but it was 5 times the price , I thought of amazon and I probably could have done even better , but I am pleased with these.Thank you again , Amazon has not let me down yet !! NO LEAKS!Tim
 excellent price and good delivery . the item will be used to seal pyrex glass tubes used for a solar boiler to create steam .

 I hate getting something and realizing I ca n't use it until I get something else ! I 'm referring to alcohol wipes . In order to hang these , you need to clean the area first with an alcohol wipe . I think 3M could have afforded to throw a couple of them in with the hangers . They only cost about 2 cents each . Having said that , I have to go find my bottle of rubbing alcohol to put the hooks on the wall.I have used many of these , in various sizes , and for the most part they 're great , BUT if you have a texture to the wall , they MAY not stick .
 I love these hooks . I used them for hanging framed prints -LRB- not too huge , but much bigger than an 8 '' x 10 '' photo -RRB- on my walls , into which it is impossible to drive a nail or screw . I 've had them up for about a month and had no problems . They worked just as advertised . I have also bought , from the same brand , the huge hooks for hanging a mirror and the velcro-like strips for hanging smaller items . They all work great .
 I was a little skeptical about this item being that I had always hung things with the standard nail and hammer . However , I can truly say that I am completely satisfied with the ease of use and the value of this purchase . A must have for any home or office .
 These things are great . I bought a pack of two and then bought six more because I just needed hooks to hang up all my things . Multipurpose hooks that are removed easily and they do n't mark the walls so I wo n't get fined at my school.Definitely worth purchasing again if I ever need more hooks especially at just over a dollar a piece .
 Purchased these because the shower dispensers I bought and installed in my kids ' shower did n't have any type of hooks for their wash cloths to hang from . Installed with ease right onto their shower wall above the faucet area .
 These hooks were great , were delivered quickly and easy to install . I hang a bunch of different purses on these in my closet and they hold up well . They are great way to display and hang my purses without nailing a rack to the wall .
 These Command Medium Hooks are so handy and easy to use . They really do stick on the wall , they seem to be very sturdy holding things up . I got them at a great price and they really came fast !!
 Bigger than I thought but work great . They stick great and do what they should . I highly recommend these hooks .
 These hooks are easy on and off and can support a lot of weight . Perfect for the holiday season hangings !
 The product so far works well on walls for small objects and I think if one follows the instruction , the hooks can work for longer . The instruction is detailed and quite user-friendly with two color-labels .
 These hooks were great for my Christmas decorations . I hung my stockings on the fireplace , my wreath on the front door , and my advent calendars on the wall . These are easy to remove and do n't leave marks on the wall .
 these have proven very useful , but mind the limits of these things , try not to hang anything too heavy on them .
 We used these to hang holiday decorations temporarily . They worked well and I was pleasantly surprised that they were so simple to remove .
 These wall hooks work great there pretty strong , strong enought to hold a large jacket at least , no complaints easy to remove just push the hook up and pull the tab to negate the adhesive strip .
 Do you live in a small , cramped city apartment ? Well , so do I and these have been a great tool for me ! When you do n't have any more floor/counter/closet space , these allow you to take advantage of your wall space ! I hang towels from these in the kitchen , a -LRB- small -RRB- laundry bag from these in my bedroom , and my bathrobe hangs on one of these as well . They remove easily with a pull of the tab and do n't leave any adhesive behind . Highly recommended !
 They hold a lot of things i put on them . So far i have used them as coat hangers and pot and pan holders . great so far !
 These go up without a problem . So easy easy , a caveman could do it . Taking it down is easy as well , although I did tear some paint off the wall .
 So far the product works great for hanging a broom , a mop , a dust pan , and a kitty litter scooper.I am more impressed with the company that shipped the product . I ordered this on Friday afternoon and it arrived on Saturday morning . Two day shipping in less than one !
 Use these to organize things like hanging flashlights , small telescopes , keys , and so forth . They are easy to use and most important they stay right where you put them .
 Having moved into an apartment with little storage space , I needed places to put belts , umbrellas , bath robes , etc. . Trying not to damage the walls or doors , these provided the perfect solution for me . Easy to set up anywhere , and very strong once in place . My only problem is keeping myself in check with how many of these I put up . They come in many sizes -LRB- and strengths -RRB- and I used the small and medium ones to great effect .
 These are great and very sturdy . They hold heavy towels and bulky purses . They can also be removed very easily if you did not place it in the right place , and there are additional backs provided .
 My dorm room does n't have any hooks to hold up my jeans and pants . So I bought two packs of these Medium 6-Hooks , and stuck them on the wall . I made sure to exceed the instructions and press down on them for dear life till my fingers went purple . Then I waited for more than an hour -LRB- maybe about 5 hours -RRB- . And they work perfectly . I 've hung up all my jeans , shorts , pants , belts , a few dish cloths . I 'm totally buying these again if/when I need more .
 I have to say that 3M continues to bring out quality and innovative products.I have hooks up on my wall for a year now and still no issues.I use these hooks to hang keys as soon as i walk into the house as well as to hang my bath towel in the bathroom.I have had no issue with them coming off after an hour like others might claim.If you follow the instructions , they will work as advertised.Remember to :1 - Clean the area on the wall to be of any debris on the spot where you will stick the hook .2 - Apply pressure to the sticky for the 10 seconds as indicated on the instructions3 - Let the hook hang out for an hour on your wall before you put any pressure on it.As i stated before ... i use them on my wooden door in my bathroom and they have held up just find . They hold up a wet bath towel when just fineUsing these for over a year now and they have made hanging things much easier for me.Buy these with confidence .
 I actually bought my hooks from Lowe 's , not Amazon but they are the exact same size and brand and I love buying online so I thought I 'd share my experience.So glad to say these hooks stick a lot better than I thought they would - they were a last resort for hanging up my shoe organizer - I lost the original hooks which latched over the top of the door . I purchased some different over-the-door hooks , but they were too big for the holes . Luckily , the store clerk showed me these and said that a lot of customers actually come in to the store looking for them specifically.After 2 days , the shoe organizer is still hanging securely to the door even with several pairs of boots and other shoes on it .
 I use these in many places in my home where I do n't want to leave holes . I hang pictures , towels , jackets . Great product that holds well and does n't leave a mark .
 If you need hooks this is a real no-brainer . I rent the house I am in so the less damage I can do to the walls the better . I love these and highly recommend them to anyone bc they do exactly what they say they will and do n't leave any damage behind .
 I have used these ALL over our house.Used at Christmas for wreath on front door glass and to hold up stockings.Have used around the house to hold cords behind dressers or in utility closets for cleaning supplies or to hang dog collars or leashes on.Literally millions of household uses.I am buying another pack immediately .
 Box contains 6 hooks and 12 double stick pads to attach them to wall . Very easy to use . I am happy with htis purchase .
 I 'm deployed and my living area is about as big as two twin sized beds . These hooks , combined with hangars and survival cord has helped greatly in allowing me to maximize the space in my area . The hooks are easy to install and support a decent amount of weight .
 These handy hanging hooks are very convenient to use , require no skills to `` install '' and can handle a reasonable amount of weight without worry of a middle-of-the-night crash . I probably would not try to hang a sledge hammer from one but they have certainly been handy for small hand tools and kitchen utensils . No issues at all even in a very dry , high altitude environment .
 My husband is crazy when it comes to damaging our walls ... he does n't want to pound a nail in the wall . These hooks work great because they go on easy and do not damage the walls at all . I recently used these on my kids ' bedroom doors to hang some canvas I painted with their names on it -- it worked great !
 These work wonderful - no more nail holes in the ealls , but make sure you let them set for 1 hour before hanging
 I know these have been around for awhile now ... but I just tried them . I put up lights in my classroom and did n't want to put permanent hooks around the windows . These were easy to use , leave no trace residue and actually can handle more weight than I expected . I 'm impressed !!
 Nice item and works great ! If you are considering buying one such thing , this one must be a good buy .
 Very sticky , doesnt damage the paint , can move em around without much hassle . I live in a cinder block fortress so holes in the walls are n't an option ... These are actually better than nails .
 These are very useful for home use . i stick them behind my doors for towels or ropes and they dont fall off at all . They can actually hold very tightly . I also stick some in the kitchen to hold the swifer and other tools . Very very useful yet so cheap !
 When I first saw this product , I hoped it would be perfect for me . I wanted something that I could put up in the kitchen , and use to hang up my apron . My husband and I rent an apartment , and the landlord would n't approve of us drilling into the wall to put up permanent fixtures.I was a bit skeptical at first about this product when it arrived . The hooks were quite small , and the sticky pads were n't all that sticky . But I tried them anyways , and so far , -LRB- 1 week later -RRB- have n't had any complaints . The hooks support the weight of my apron very easily.The only thing I will say about this product -LRB- and this could be seen as both a good thing and a bad thing -RRB- is that the sticky pads come separately . This means that you have to peel off the backing , attach the pad to the hook , then peel off the other side and attach that to the wall . On the plus side , this means that if the pads should lose their stickiness you can always just stick on a new one and reuse -- on the other hand though , I found it a bit difficult to get the pads aligned onto the back of the hook -LRB- though I managed it eventually -RRB- . Overall though -- good product .
 The hooks have been great for hanging this and that around my apartment . I 've only ever tried the medium sized hooks and have never had an issue with them .
 These hooks are perfect , they arrived quickly and are just what i needed . I put them in my closet on a bare wall to hang purses . Thanks !
 HAD NO WALL SPACE TO PUT ANY HANGING DEVICE , JUST THE OUTSIDE OF A CLOSET DOOR . DID N'T WANT TO MAKE HOLES , SO THIS HOOK WAS THE PERFECT ANSWER . NO TOOLS , NO HOLES , EASY , ONE - STEP APPLICATION.TRUE TO ADS . LOVE IT3M Scotch Command Adhesive Hook Value Pack , Large , Holds 5 lb , White , 3 per Pack -LRB- 17003-VP-3PK -RRB-
 Yeah , the white color is a bit tacky , but you ca n't beat the value for the quantity AND quality . I wish they made value packs of the silver hooks !
 I have a textured surface shower in my apartment so suction cup hooks are not an option for hanging loofah 's etc. . These work great in the shower and I can easily remove them when I move out !
 We do n't have a ton of decent organizing space , so we 've hung these around the kitchen . They 're great for smaller skillets , strainers , and other lightweight kitchen products . They keep the medium-sized things ready at hand for use . Have n't had any fall or malfunction yet , and they are simple to remove when we want to rearrange . Absolutely a must for any apartment situation where you need to keep organized !
 I moved 4 months ago and used only command strips in the new place . I have hung up several picture frames , some larger multi-picture frames and one mirror , and 4 months later nothing has fallen . Great product !
 Good product works well , does n't fall off . It seems sturdy and looks cute.Not very large , so do n't expect to be able to hang purses on them but jackets , and necklaces would work well .
 I used these hooks to organize my closet to hang up my belts . I can see these being a must-have for college dorm rooms , tenants , or someone who does n't want to mess up their walls.I went to a local hardware store to purchase because it is difficult to imagine the actual size of items that it would hold by viewing online.The hooks are on the smaller side and it says they have a 3lb capacity . I 'm not sure how much a belt weighs , but they have n't budged or come loose at all . I 'm impressed for such a small strip of sticky glue that it works as well as it does . -LRB- it 's also super easy to install -RRB- It does seem kind of pricey when you compare to the standard screw in hooks , but it looks as though you can reuse them which is a nice perk . I was surprised to see there were extra strips included in the package for future use .
 I bought thirty packages of these ... Command 17001-VP-6PK Medium Plastic Hooks Value Pack ... They are great I use them to hang necklaces , scarves , hats and visors ... a great way to organize your stuff !
 Replaced my kitchen cabinets recently and did not want to damage them with nails . I bought these hooks at Lowe 's . They are sized medium and wo n't support anything in excess of 3lbs . I needed a hook for my apron and a hook for my calendar . Followed the instruction with one deviation . I did n't hang anything from them until the adhesive cured for a couple of hours . I did this after one hook came down on another occasion and it seems to have resolved that problem . From past experience , uninstalling is simple.The main reason I like the Command system is that it does n't leave marks or cause any damage . Tried similar items and they caused damage or left a sticky mess.My only gripe is that they are overpriced . I still have failed to find these bargain priced and I am a bargain shopper .
 Does what it is supposed to do . Very helpful . I hang about 2 to 3 pants on each hook and it holds up just fine .
 Out of the box , installation was simple and very easy . Throughout the use over the past several months , I 've had good but also mixed resultsSome thoughts : * Can certainly hold up to 3-5 lbs - be it jackets , umbrellas , keys , anything . * However , one or two of these fell , but that could partially be our error . * Saves a lot of space and looks good on the wall , or wherever you decide to place these . * Does n't hurt your wall and easy to take off.Overall , a good solution to not having to put holes into your walls . Just be wary that potentially , one or a couple of these hooks may need some adjustment to stay on the wall .
 It might sound silly that I would review something so small , so simply but it 's also so effective.I bought a 6Pack of Medium Command Hooks which came with 12 adhesive strips so that you can reuse the hooks . This is perfect when you do n't have any air tools and do n't want to leave a mess.Right now I 'm using 3 of them in my cook/shoe closet to hang up my broom , Swiffer and the previously mentioned Swiffer Duster . Because I have no space in my pantry and no other kitchen closet , I had to shove these items in my coat closet . However , the floor was already full of shoes so I decided to `` build up '' instead.Peel off the line on the adhesive strips , stick it to the hook , stick the hook on the wall and wait an hour . The medium sized hooks are meant to hold up to 3lbs but 3M makes hooks as small as mini and as large as jumbo as well as hooks with different shapes and even chrome hooks to add a little style.So far , I 've had no problems . The hooks stick wonderfully and my Swiffer Wet is probably over the 3lb limit -LRB- although the fluid bottle is not full -RRB- . When it comes time to take them down , all I need to do is push up on the hook and it will slide off , revealing the end of the adhesive tab . Removing them , which I have done before , is simply a matter of pulling the tab until it comes undone and your wall is free of damage and residue .
 I love these hooks ! I set them up throughout my dorm apartment , and they have never once failed me . I can hang a bath towel -LRB- pretty heavy , I would say ! -RRB- and hand towel onto one hook , and they will remain on it perfectly . I also use them to hang purses and totes , winter coats , belts , and a dry erase board . They have - never - `` sunk '' or loosened - all the hooks remain firmly in the position I set them up in -LRB- which , by the way , was a breeze ! -RRB- . I highly recommend these hooks and ca n't see why others did n't like them - maybe they messed up on adhering them to the wall ? Or maybe they just tried to hang too much - every product does have its limit , after all . But , with proper use , these hooks sure have been a valuable addition to my apartment !
 I have only used one of these so far , and while I do n't anticipate putting much weight on this hook there is one thing I must mention.They do NOT hold well on textured surfaces like dry-wall with said surface and latex paint . The first experiment showed that the surface had to be lightly sanded to give a more consistent surface texture , and then cleaned . I used a 400 grade sandpaper , and cleaned the surface with a rubbing alcohol swab.This time the connection is very tight , and I will always `` level '' a surface before I start putting one in place , if you are putting it on a smooth surface , just be sure to clean it with something like the rubbing alcohol.CCW .
 These things are rated at three pounds but it seems like they can hold a little more . They even work well on uneven wall surfaces . My room has walls made of the painted cinder block material and you can recall how bumpy it is . Not only do these adhere to the surface , but they remain strong . Very satisfied !
 First thing i do n't like is that the hooks coming off of it is way too big , needs to bed a little smaller . But this hanger surprised me by how well it held up with the adhesive to our walls which are textured sheet rock ! Kudos to 3M but geeze make some more that are not so large
 You really can put these anywhere . I tried a wood door and left it there and it does n't ruin the finish . It 's so much easier than the hammer and nail thing . You can hang them all over because there are different sizes and finishes . Make sure you check the size though . The large hooks are really big . They 're easy to install and uninstall .
 Great Product and good price ! I have gotten some from the stores before . They fall after 2 days . I have these on a rather rough surface now for about 2 weeks . They are still going strong . Love it .
 anything from kids towels to temporary coat hooks , potholder hooks , umbrella hook , possibilities endless !! love how easy to install/remove and hang on any surface !!
 Just as described , I do n't like being asked to write such a long answer for a very simple question . This should be optional and not a requirement .
 These did exactly what I was looking for . They are strong enough to hold carhartts and pea coats . I would definitely buy them again .
 We love these nifty little hooks . They really are super easy to hang and to remove when you 're done with them . We used ours to hang garland over our mantel at Christmas time . They worked wonderfully and were easy to remove from our -LRB- apartment -RRB- walls .
 These hooks are excellent , if you are not sure of your needs or do not want to drill holes . I needed hooks on the side of a bookcase and piano for my daughter to hand her bags . Drilling holes was not an option and these hooks are doing the job very well . You need to follow the instructions carefully and wait for 24 hours before hanging anything on them . They come out very easily -LRB- again follow the instructions on removing -RRB- without leaving any mark.The only negative is that they are aesthetically not that pleasing . Given the weight tolerance of these adhesive tapes , 3-M should be able to come up with with some real metal ones.Overall , a great product and would highly recommend it .
 I do n't have a mantel but do have a floor to ceiling wall of brick for my fireplace . I wanted to hang stockings on there so the little ones could n't grab hold of them this year . -LRB- normally hanging off a short wall in my livingroom -RRB- . It worked great ! I had 13 of them and not a one fell .
 i 've always liked 3M products , so this one gets 5 stars . i love how if you change your mind and want to pull off the sticky tab , it wo n't leave any residue on the surface either .
 It takes a second to figure out how to apply these , but once you do you 're good . Great for hanging relatively heavy things -LRB- though use common sense -RRB- in a snap . I used them on glass to hang a bunch of pictures -LRB- my office has glass walls , long story -RRB- . Highly recommended , especially for the price .
 Love all the command hooks and other products . They are great for hanging items on block walls where nails are not options .
 I 've bought all the sizes of these 3m command hooks and none of them have let me down . Easy to hang , never failed me yet , and easy to remove when its time to move out .
 This product is great for putting new hooks on my RV walls , without drilling holes or damaging the look of the RV . They hold most any item I wish to hang up , yet they are removable in the event of my rearranging or cleaning up to sell . This item will be purchased again some time .
 I have used these hooks for a couple months of holding hoodies and needed more for the rest of my hoodies . They can hold the weight and when I remove the hooks , they leave no marks on the walls .
 I purchased this item to hang some pictures on my walls because I did n't want the mess of having hole all over my walls . The hooks work good as long as you do n't live in a moist , humid environment . We put these up about a week ago and the other day , two of them failed , causing my pictures to smash to the ground . Needless to say , it was a moist day outside , and I think that 's what contributed to the hooks failing . However , overall the hooks do the job ... most of the time and are a great value and alternative to banging nails in walls .
 These hooks are easy to apply and come off cleanly like advertised . They hold a good amount of weight and feel pretty strong . If you are using it vertically , for example , on a wall , then it should work great . If you want to use it horizontally , for example , stick it on a ceiling and hang something from it that way , then the hook probably wont be able to hold it because the item will slip off since the hook `` angle '' isnt severe enough , if that makes sense.For most cases , this is a good , strong hook that will fit most people 's applications . The pack comes with extra strips so you can re-apply the hooks later .
 These hooks have worked great so far and it is nice that if they break you can slide a the broken one out and the new hook in with out having to peal sticky off .
 At our house , our landlord wo n't let us put holes in the walls . These hooks are the perfect solution ! They are easy to place , they hold a good deal of weight and they 're easy to take off with no mess left behind ! The only reason I did n't rate it a 5 is because of the price . I do think they could be a little cheaper considering they 're only plastic hooks but because of how effective they are , I 'll pay it anyway.Awesome product , would purchase again .
 These hooks work great . I 've been putting them around my office for both hanging jackets on my door to helping with cable control .
 fantastic product . i have nothing bad to say about these things at all . i have used these for several little things around the house including
 All my walls are concrete or tile . I used these to hang items in my kitchen , bathroom and entryways . I followed the directions and they worked great . Not one came loose , very happy with the hooks .
 I bought these to hang things in our baby 's nursery so as not to damage the walls - they are so easy to use and they stay in place and hold as they say they will - 3M is amazing !
 This is the best thing next to sliced bread.I used to hate putting holes in my walls to hang things up . These things , as well as the sticky strips have saved my ass more than I can imagine.Anything that I can hang on them , they go on . Just make sure you adhere to what they can hold and what they can not .
 Everything about command strips is awesome . These worked great for hanging coats , towels , etc. in my dorm room , where there were n't a lot of other options . If you follow the instructions , you wo n't damage the walls/paint either . If you just yank it off , though , you probably will mess something up . Love that these are reusable with more command strips .
 These are decent little hooks if applied to a clean and dust-free surface ; when they are removed they leave no damage or residue on the wall . Excellent for use in a temporary situation , they come with two pieces of double-sided tape so can be installed twice . Very handy .
 I love these things . First learned of them when I first moved into my new apartment and my roommate lent me one of hers . Do n't get the cheap packs of Dollar Store imitations unless you plan on hanging cheap , flimsy things from them . Nothing beats a metal hook screwed into a stud , but these are clean , fairly quick , removable , and considering how strong they are I 'd say they 're very much worth the price .
 I have used these before and they for hanging wall items without damaging the walls . They are worth the cost and the quantity as sold .
 These are great for a dorm room or small apartment where you need space . These come with twice as many sticky strips as hooks , which is great because the hooks are a reasonably sturdy enough plastic to be reusable for a couple years .
 These hooks are wonderful . I have set up my spice rack in the kitchen using them . It is magnificent that I can hang something up and change my mind and place it somewhere else without leaving holes in the wall .
 I have purchased this item locally before for use around the house . Purchasing this item from Amazon actually saved my about $ 5 , so if you have Amazon Prime and can wait a couple of days , you 'll definitely save money purchasing through Amazon .
 Price is great for the set of 6i pretty much used them around the house adn it is all great . I even have a couple spare.Excelent product
 These hooks are quick , convenient and do not require commitment . When you 're moving or have decided you do n't want the hook there any more , they 're easy to remove and do not leave residue . We 've added hooks on the inside of kitchen cabinets for oven mitts , in the garage for flashlights and umbrellas , inside of bathroom cabinets for mirrors , and inside closets for belts . They come in three sizes , but we 've found that medium is the best all-around size .
 THese work great . I have used them before and loved them . They do n't wreck the wall and hold a good amount of weight . -LRB- like my big robe -RRB- . This is a great price when you order $ 25 or more for free shipping . In the store this would be twice the price .
 I love these very good for what I needed I did n't research the price but I thought it was a good deal .
 I found this product while searching for something to organize my phone headset and the USB cables for my cameras , phone , etc. . I stuck several of them to the side of my desk and everything now hangs neatly without getting tangled . When I wanted to move one , it came off really easily after I read the instructions .
 Fits my Remington 1100 Shotgun perfect ! Replaced my old hard worn out one . I dont think I will ever use all 50 of them , but maybe some friends will need some .
 It is just what you would expect . Works fine , looks like good stuff . I go through a bunch of these on camp fuel stoves and bottles . Viton lasts much longer than NBR .
 I bought this part to use on the fuel pump plate of my bmw r1150r . I think it 's also the same part for 1100 too . It works just as well at fraction of the cost quoted by dealerships
 This seal works for early BMW oil filter stand O-Ring , not available from dealer . Or you end up buying new style housing which is a lot more .
 Just what I needed to fix my pool fill valve . 25 is a lot but now I 'm covered .
 Yes , this is the one you 've been hunting , and yes , my 91 geo 1.0 quit leaking from there . What to do with the extra nine ? Well , I do n't know either , but its hard to beat the price !!!
 Thanks for stocking these O-rings ; I could not find them locally . Just what I needed . Still arrived ahead of a few other items I ordered at the same time from other venders here on Amazon so I changed my review to five stars .
 I 'm always running for o rings for something now I have a stock at home .
 Dunno what to say about an o-ring , but they appear to be well-made , come nicely packaged , etc. .

 GREAT PRODUCT , HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT ! , GREAT GREAT GREAT THING YEAH ! GREAT THING YEAY!GREAT PRODUCT , HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT ! , GREAT GREAT GREAT THING YEAH ! GREAT THING YEAY !
 This is what you want . Economical and high quality . Works perfectly . Great alternative to the factory or firearms products . 100 rounds test proved perfect performance .
 I ordered these orings to repair my ford 6.9 diesel engine . I used them on the injector leak-off jackets to reseal them . They worked great and were a great deal .
 I had been going through o-rings on our tube filling machine like crazy . I had to replace it once a week or more often . I decided to order this 25 pack since it was so inexpensive . It 's been a month and a half and I have not yet replaced the first one of these . They seem to be extremely durable so far .
 Fast service and product as described . Fits an old Remington 1100 perfectly at a fraction of the cost of Remington replacements . That 's about all - they are just O-rings .
 Used to replace broken o-ring on a Remington 1100 12 gauge . Product fits perfectly and is of very high quality . At this price you basically have a lifetime supply ! Highly recommend !
 I was looking for an o-ring for my Remington 1100 and other places were asking $ 9 for 1 . You get 50 of these for less than that . My great grandkids will still have these o-rings for the gun lol .
 I was having blow back issues with my 12gauge , and all the suggestions pointed to my gas ports , and the O ring . Now that I have replaced it , I need to get out and shoot again . Hopefully this was the fix . The only draw back with this product , is that you receive a &#34; Costco &#34; supply ; more than enough for a lifetime .
 Used this to replace my o ring on my BMW 's DISA valve . O ring is not available from the dealer . Worked perfectly and solved my vacuum leak .
 Well made pins that work perfectly . The handle casting is slightly rough on one side of the T-Handle on both of the pins that i ordered but this does not effect how they work and i guess is a by-product of the casting process . Other than this very minor cosmetic point they are excellent pins an i would recommend them .

 Just standard O-rings . They work great for 5-gallon soda kegs used for home brewing . With the 100-pk , I wo n't have to buy more ... ever .
 I really like these instead of the rubber ones I replaced them for . I would do this again since silicone is forever
 This is a perfect replacement O ring for my Thermos Nissan insulated coffee mug . It fit perfectly and provided a tight seal .
 I used this and it worked for my application very good quality and good pricing and also packaging . It 's made well .
 O-rings were top quality , exactly as pictured . Prices are great for only a 10 pack . Exactly what I wanted and expected . What more would you need ?
 The O-rings arrived on time and look good . Amazon has a great selection , far better than any store I could find in town . They are marked in fractional inches , but that size is only approximate . Look in the product description and it will tell you the exact size in thousandths of an inch .
 I purchased these O-rings for replacing the drive belts for a rod dryer -LRB- fishing rods -RRB- . They 're stronger than the originals !
 After purchasing a lower quality product from the local hardware store for about twice the price , I was happy to see Amazon carrying the silicon type of this O-Ring and for a lower price . They are quality products for a great price .
 Looking for a better and cheaper alternative than buying the $ 5 each Omni Heavy Duty whole house filter o-rings ? This is it . The silicone is FDA approved and at $ 5 for 10 pieces !
 I bought these o-rings as a replacement on my Nissan spill proof travel mug . I use this mug all the time . It will keep a cup of freshly made tea or coffee hot for 3-4 hours if left closed , or at the right drinking temperature for a full hour . I tried to find a replacement for the o-ring at the Nissan website but could not . These o-rings are an excellent replacement . The mug closes water tight and works like new . Highly recommended for this application .
 These are very strong little o-rings , with plenty of tensile strength . I read a recent DIY article online about turning certain fountain pens -LRB- Platinum Preppy line -RRB- into eye dropper fountain pens using this size o-ring . I wanted to give it a try , and I must admit it worked like a charm . No leaks , perfect . Search online for `` eye dropper fountain pen '' and `` o-ring '' or perhaps `` make your own '' and you should be able to find it , if you 're interested . Fun , and a good use of the pen and the ink .
 I bought these based on the recommendation of a previous reviewer . The seal on my Nissan 14oz Leakproof Insulated Travel Mug broke when I was washing it , and without the seal , it was n't leakproof . These work great . Thanks , previous reviewer !
 My husband takes a Thermos travel mug of coffee with him every workday , and the o-ring was very stained . I also figured that eventually it would relax and no longer provide a tight , leakproof fit . I thought finding a replacement would be impossible , but , when it looks impossible ... try Amazon ! Found these , which are the exact size as the original . We 're set for a long time , now !
 I lost the original ring to my Nissan Stainless coffee cup , and was looking for a new one on Amazon , when Amazon suggested this o-ring to me . What a good suggestion ! Now my old cup has a new lease on life and I can lose the ring like 9 more times before I have to buy a whole new one : -RRB-
 I got these on a suggestion on an airsoft repair forum . They fit snugly into the fill valves , providing a better outer seal than most factory standard o-rings , and at a far better price than the exact same product when sold somewhere like Evike . The one problem I had was that my bag had 88 in it instead of 100 . I 'm not actually upset , since the price difference between it and other similar products still made this worth it , but a little more accuracy in the numbers would be appreciated.Pros - Great PriceFits snugly in placePlenty for more replacements lateCons - Did n't actually receive 100
 My favorite Nalgene 750ml bottle had turned into a `` dribble '' bottle . This ring is the correct size to fit over the neck and seal against the cap when the cap is screwed on . Not perfect - when you unscrew the cap , a little water that was sitting above the ring will drip . But I 'm not getting dripped on when I drink .
 WOW , researched `` O '' Rings off & online for awhile , almost bought one at another store online , but it was 5 times the price , I thought of amazon and I probably could have done even better , but I am pleased with these.Thank you again , Amazon has not let me down yet !! NO LEAKS!Tim
 excellent price and good delivery . the item will be used to seal pyrex glass tubes used for a solar boiler to create steam .
 When I was considering purchasing one of these I could n't find whether or not it had a set screw installed . Having gotten one , I now know that it does have a set screw . So in case anybody else is wondering ... now you know .
 I got this pulley for my project ... I attached with timing belt and motors together . It works perfectly . I got all the parts from same seller . They all coming in same package , it helps me alot . I had all the parts I need .
 It is what it is . The size was correct . It shipped fast and Amazon fulfilled the shipping from their warehouse so the shipping was free supposedly . I just checked the invoice and it said 7.29 shipping and handling . So I guess the super saver is n't really what it says it is , free shipping . If they start adding handling fees on it 's just like the lowlife eBay people that say free shipping and then tack on 10 bucks for handling.Other than that I wish Small parts had 1/2 '' stock . I need that too.John O'Donnell

 Excellent stripe tape for car . Vivid color and very easy to install with no akward paper backing to fiddle with . Just roll the tape on for great pin striping both inside and outside car . Holds well with the quality 3M self-adhesive backing . Great value , too !

Not perfect - when you unscrew the cap , a little water that was sitting above the ring will drip . But I 'm not getting dripped on when I drink .
 WOW , researched `` O '' Rings off & online for awhile , almost bought one at another store online , but it was 5 times the price , I thought of amazon and I probably could have done even better , but I am pleased with these.Thank you again , Amazon has not let me down yet !! NO LEAKS!Tim
 excellent price and good delivery . the item will be used to seal pyrex glass tubes used for a solar boiler to create steam .
 These magnets are quite strong and picked up lots of nails out of our fire pit . Would recommend .
 Wow ! The review guidelines for Amazon require at least 20 words about the product -LRB- does that mean these first 20 do n't count ? -RRB- . Anyway , it 's a magnet ! It magically sticks to steel ! Not stainless steel , but that is not the fault of the magnet , blame physics . Really . A swell magnet . I bought it to hold my curtains to the steel casement so the curtains do n't blow around when the A/C is on . One did the trick . The really great thing is I could browse on Amazon a few minutes and find what I want and not have to settle for what the local hardware store happens to have .
 This magnet is fairly strong . Not as powerful as they advertise but it works fine for picking up small dropped objects .
 This is a fine magnet , shiny and strong , but my only complaint is the shipping cost for this two dollar and fifty cent item , yes , truly affordable magnet , but unreasonably high shipping cost .
 No , this magnet will NOT lift 30lbs . I tried lifting a 10lb . weight with it and it could n't do that , although I 'd bet it could lift 5lbs . But that 's not what I bought this magnet for ... I bought it to pick-up nuts , screws , bolts , etc. when I drop them -LRB- typically in the bottom of my jetski hull -RRB- in hard or impossible to reach places . And it works GREAT for that ! For my purposes , exactly what I needed .
 these are funny if u hand them to a dumb friendi got 2 of them and i told a friend to put them on his nose and slide down slowly -LRB- u need 2 magnets -RRB- he got mad i laughed
 Product looks exactly like the picture . Customer service was great and personal . I did n't test if it will really hold 30 lbs .
 Fits my Remington 1100 Shotgun perfect ! Replaced my old hard worn out one . I dont think I will ever use all 50 of them , but maybe some friends will need some .
 It is just what you would expect . Works fine , looks like good stuff . I go through a bunch of these on camp fuel stoves and bottles . Viton lasts much longer than NBR .
 I bought this part to use on the fuel pump plate of my bmw r1150r . I think it 's also the same part for 1100 too . It works just as well at fraction of the cost quoted by dealerships
 This seal works for early BMW oil filter stand O-Ring , not available from dealer . Or you end up buying new style housing which is a lot more .
 Just what I needed to fix my pool fill valve . 25 is a lot but now I 'm covered .
 Yes , this is the one you 've been hunting , and yes , my 91 geo 1.0 quit leaking from there . What to do with the extra nine ? Well , I do n't know either , but its hard to beat the price !!!
 Thanks for stocking these O-rings ; I could not find them locally . Just what I needed . Still arrived ahead of a few other items I ordered at the same time from other venders here on Amazon so I changed my review to five stars .
 I 'm always running for o rings for something now I have a stock at home .

 GREAT PRODUCT , HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT ! , GREAT GREAT GREAT THING YEAH ! GREAT THING YEAY!GREAT PRODUCT , HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT ! , GREAT GREAT GREAT THING YEAH ! GREAT THING YEAY !
 This is what you want . Economical and high quality . Works perfectly . Great alternative to the factory or firearms products . 100 rounds test proved perfect performance .
 I ordered these orings to repair my ford 6.9 diesel engine . I used them on the injector leak-off jackets to reseal them . They worked great and were a great deal .
 I had been going through o-rings on our tube filling machine like crazy . I had to replace it once a week or more often . I decided to order this 25 pack since it was so inexpensive . It 's been a month and a half and I have not yet replaced the first one of these . They seem to be extremely durable so far .
 Fast service and product as described . Fits an old Remington 1100 perfectly at a fraction of the cost of Remington replacements . That 's about all - they are just O-rings .
 Used to replace broken o-ring on a Remington 1100 12 gauge . Product fits perfectly and is of very high quality . At this price you basically have a lifetime supply ! Highly recommend !
 I was looking for an o-ring for my Remington 1100 and other places were asking $ 9 for 1 . You get 50 of these for less than that . My great grandkids will still have these o-rings for the gun lol .
 I was having blow back issues with my 12gauge , and all the suggestions pointed to my gas ports , and the O ring . Now that I have replaced it , I need to get out and shoot again . Hopefully this was the fix . The only draw back with this product , is that you receive a &#34; Costco &#34; supply ; more than enough for a lifetime .
 Used this to replace my o ring on my BMW 's DISA valve . O ring is not available from the dealer . Worked perfectly and solved my vacuum leak .
 The item was to my satisfaction , quick service -LRB- got it within 5 days -RRB- and safely packed . I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in this kind of product .

 Excellent stripe tape for car . Vivid color and very easy to install with no akward paper backing to fiddle with . Just roll the tape on for great pin striping both inside and outside car . Holds well with the quality 3M self-adhesive backing . Great value , too !
 Just standard O-rings . They work great for 5-gallon soda kegs used for home brewing . With the 100-pk , I wo n't have to buy more ... ever .
 I really like these instead of the rubber ones I replaced them for . I would do this again since silicone is forever
 This is a perfect replacement O ring for my Thermos Nissan insulated coffee mug . It fit perfectly and provided a tight seal .
 I used this and it worked for my application very good quality and good pricing and also packaging . It 's made well .
 O-rings were top quality , exactly as pictured . Prices are great for only a 10 pack . Exactly what I wanted and expected . What more would you need ?
 The O-rings arrived on time and look good . Amazon has a great selection , far better than any store I could find in town . They are marked in fractional inches , but that size is only approximate . Look in the product description and it will tell you the exact size in thousandths of an inch .
 I purchased these O-rings for replacing the drive belts for a rod dryer -LRB- fishing rods -RRB- . They 're stronger than the originals !
 After purchasing a lower quality product from the local hardware store for about twice the price , I was happy to see Amazon carrying the silicon type of this O-Ring and for a lower price . They are quality products for a great price .
 Looking for a better and cheaper alternative than buying the $ 5 each Omni Heavy Duty whole house filter o-rings ? This is it . The silicone is FDA approved and at $ 5 for 10 pieces !

 I bought these o-rings as a replacement on my Nissan spill proof travel mug . I use this mug all the time . It will keep a cup of freshly made tea or coffee hot for 3-4 hours if left closed , or at the right drinking temperature for a full hour . I tried to find a replacement for the o-ring at the Nissan website but could not . These o-rings are an excellent replacement . The mug closes water tight and works like new . Highly recommended for this application .
 These are very strong little o-rings , with plenty of tensile strength . I read a recent DIY article online about turning certain fountain pens -LRB- Platinum Preppy line -RRB- into eye dropper fountain pens using this size o-ring . I wanted to give it a try , and I must admit it worked like a charm . No leaks , perfect . Search online for `` eye dropper fountain pen '' and `` o-ring '' or perhaps `` make your own '' and you should be able to find it , if you 're interested . Fun , and a good use of the pen and the ink .
 I bought these based on the recommendation of a previous reviewer . The seal on my Nissan 14oz Leakproof Insulated Travel Mug broke when I was washing it , and without the seal , it was n't leakproof . These work great . Thanks , previous reviewer !
 My husband takes a Thermos travel mug of coffee with him every workday , and the o-ring was very stained . I also figured that eventually it would relax and no longer provide a tight , leakproof fit . I thought finding a replacement would be impossible , but , when it looks impossible ... try Amazon ! Found these , which are the exact size as the original . We 're set for a long time , now !
 I lost the original ring to my Nissan Stainless coffee cup , and was looking for a new one on Amazon , when Amazon suggested this o-ring to me . What a good suggestion ! Now my old cup has a new lease on life and I can lose the ring like 9 more times before I have to buy a whole new one : -RRB-
 I got these on a suggestion on an airsoft repair forum . They fit snugly into the fill valves , providing a better outer seal than most factory standard o-rings , and at a far better price than the exact same product when sold somewhere like Evike .

 excellent price and good delivery . the item will be used to seal pyrex glass tubes used for a solar boiler to create steam .
 Good quality bar of brass . I used this to make the hilt of a sword . it arrived fast and in perfect condition .
 I purchased 3 flavors of Potentiometers from this store and they all came quickly and fully functional . Much cheaper than local RShack prices
 Really good quality . I 'm not certain all the uses my husband has planned for this item , but I do know he used it to make an inscription plaque for a desk he built . The plaque turned out beautifully .
 Yup , it 's a 1/4 '' x 3/4 '' x 24L Brass Rectangular Bar . Not much more to say . Have a nice day !
 I bought these pots to replace some noisy ones in a Telecaster guitar . I wanted to see if these would be a less expensive solution for replacement pots . These seem to be well made , they do n't feel flimsy and are n't noisy . They have a very tight positive feel when you turn them . They will probably loosen up with use . The pot body has a coating on it which must be sanded off in order to solder any ground wires to it . They work well and are very quiet . A great improvement to my instrument .

 When I was considering purchasing one of these I could n't find whether or not it had a set screw installed . Having gotten one , I now know that it does have a set screw . So in case anybody else is wondering ... now you know .
 I got this pulley for my project ... I attached with timing belt and motors together . It works perfectly . I got all the parts from same seller . They all coming in same package , it helps me alot . I had all the parts I need .

 WOW , researched `` O '' Rings off & online for awhile , almost bought one at another store online , but it was 5 times the price , I thought of amazon and I probably could have done even better , but I am pleased with these.Thank you again , Amazon has not let me down yet !! NO LEAKS!Tim
 excellent price and good delivery . the item will be used to seal pyrex glass tubes used for a solar boiler to create steam .
 Excellent stripe tape for car . Vivid color and very easy to install with no akward paper backing to fiddle with . Just roll the tape on for great pin striping both inside and outside car . Holds well with the quality 3M self-adhesive backing . Great value , too !
 Great hose . I did not give 5 stars because it kinks easily and cuts off water flow . The black rubber hoses seem to be a little better from that standpoint , but they can not take high temperature like this one . So I reserve this to drain the heater .
 This is what you want . Economical and high quality . Works perfectly . Great alternative to the factory or firearms products . 100 rounds test proved perfect performance .
 I ordered these orings to repair my ford 6.9 diesel engine . I used them on the injector leak-off jackets to reseal them . They worked great and were a great deal .
 I had been going through o-rings on our tube filling machine like crazy . I had to replace it once a week or more often . I decided to order this 25 pack since it was so inexpensive . It 's been a month and a half and I have not yet replaced the first one of these . They seem to be extremely durable so far .
 Fast service and product as described . Fits an old Remington 1100 perfectly at a fraction of the cost of Remington replacements . That 's about all - they are just O-rings .
 Used to replace broken o-ring on a Remington 1100 12 gauge . Product fits perfectly and is of very high quality . At this price you basically have a lifetime supply ! Highly recommend !
 I was looking for an o-ring for my Remington 1100 and other places were asking $ 9 for 1 . You get 50 of these for less than that . My great grandkids will still have these o-rings for the gun lol .
 I was having blow back issues with my 12gauge , and all the suggestions pointed to my gas ports , and the O ring . Now that I have replaced it , I need to get out and shoot again . Hopefully this was the fix . The only draw back with this product , is that you receive a &#34; Costco &#34; supply ; more than enough for a lifetime .
 Used this to replace my o ring on my BMW 's DISA valve . O ring is not available from the dealer . Worked perfectly and solved my vacuum leak .
 Fits my Remington 1100 Shotgun perfect ! Replaced my old hard worn out one . I dont think I will ever use all 50 of them , but maybe some friends will need some .
 It is just what you would expect . Works fine , looks like good stuff . I go through a bunch of these on camp fuel stoves and bottles . Viton lasts much longer than NBR .
 I bought this part to use on the fuel pump plate of my bmw r1150r . I think it 's also the same part for 1100 too . It works just as well at fraction of the cost quoted by dealerships
 This seal works for early BMW oil filter stand O-Ring , not available from dealer . Or you end up buying new style housing which is a lot more .
 Just what I needed to fix my pool fill valve . 25 is a lot but now I 'm covered .
 Yes , this is the one you 've been hunting , and yes , my 91 geo 1.0 quit leaking from there . What to do with the extra nine ? Well , I do n't know either , but its hard to beat the price !!!
 Thanks for stocking these O-rings ; I could not find them locally . Just what I needed . Still arrived ahead of a few other items I ordered at the same time from other venders here on Amazon so I changed my review to five stars .
 I 'm always running for o rings for something now I have a stock at home .

 It is what it is . The size was correct . It shipped fast and Amazon fulfilled the shipping from their warehouse so the shipping was free supposedly . I just checked the invoice and it said 7.29 shipping and handling . So I guess the super saver is n't really what it says it is , free shipping . If they start adding handling fees on it 's just like the lowlife eBay people that say free shipping and then tack on 10 bucks for handling.Other than that I wish Small parts had 1/2 '' stock . I need that too.John O'Donnell

 Good quality bar of brass . I used this to make the hilt of a sword . it arrived fast and in perfect condition .
 I bought these o-rings as a replacement on my Nissan spill proof travel mug . I use this mug all the time . It will keep a cup of freshly made tea or coffee hot for 3-4 hours if left closed , or at the right drinking temperature for a full hour . I tried to find a replacement for the o-ring at the Nissan website but could not . These o-rings are an excellent replacement . The mug closes water tight and works like new . Highly recommended for this application .
 These are very strong little o-rings , with plenty of tensile strength . I read a recent DIY article online about turning certain fountain pens -LRB- Platinum Preppy line -RRB- into eye dropper fountain pens using this size o-ring . I wanted to give it a try , and I must admit it worked like a charm . No leaks , perfect . Search online for `` eye dropper fountain pen '' and `` o-ring '' or perhaps `` make your own '' and you should be able to find it , if you 're interested . Fun , and a good use of the pen and the ink .
 I bought these based on the recommendation of a previous reviewer . The seal on my Nissan 14oz Leakproof Insulated Travel Mug broke when I was washing it , and without the seal , it was n't leakproof . These work great . Thanks , previous reviewer !
 My husband takes a Thermos travel mug of coffee with him every workday , and the o-ring was very stained . I also figured that eventually it would relax and no longer provide a tight , leakproof fit . I thought finding a replacement would be impossible , but , when it looks impossible ... try Amazon ! Found these , which are the exact size as the original . We 're set for a long time , now !
 I lost the original ring to my Nissan Stainless coffee cup , and was looking for a new one on Amazon , when Amazon suggested this o-ring to me . What a good suggestion ! Now my old cup has a new lease on life and I can lose the ring like 9 more times before I have to buy a whole new one : -RRB-
 I got these on a suggestion on an airsoft repair forum . They fit snugly into the fill valves , providing a better outer seal than most factory standard o-rings , and at a far better price than the exact same product when sold somewhere like Evike . The one problem I had was that my bag had 88 in it instead of 100 . I 'm not actually upset , since the price difference between it and other similar products still made this worth it , but a little more accuracy in the numbers would be appreciated.Pros - Great PriceFits snugly in placePlenty for more replacements lateCons - Did n't actually receive 100

 Just standard O-rings . They work great for 5-gallon soda kegs used for home brewing . With the 100-pk , I wo n't have to buy more ... ever .
 I really like these instead of the rubber ones I replaced them for . I would do this again since silicone is forever
 This is a perfect replacement O ring for my Thermos Nissan insulated coffee mug . It fit perfectly and provided a tight seal .
 I used this and it worked for my application very good quality and good pricing and also packaging . It 's made well .
 O-rings were top quality , exactly as pictured . Prices are great for only a 10 pack . Exactly what I wanted and expected . What more would you need ?
 The O-rings arrived on time and look good . Amazon has a great selection , far better than any store I could find in town . They are marked in fractional inches , but that size is only approximate . Look in the product description and it will tell you the exact size in thousandths of an inch .
 I purchased these O-rings for replacing the drive belts for a rod dryer -LRB- fishing rods -RRB- . They 're stronger than the originals !
 After purchasing a lower quality product from the local hardware store for about twice the price , I was happy to see Amazon carrying the silicon type of this O-Ring and for a lower price . They are quality products for a great price .
 Looking for a better and cheaper alternative than buying the $ 5 each Omni Heavy Duty whole house filter o-rings ? This is it . The silicone is FDA approved and at $ 5 for 10 pieces !

 The tank is state of the art - very nice/good . It however has a very noisy flush but it is thorough .
 After slipping and sliding in my bathroom floor I realized my wall-mounted toilet had a crack in it . I needed help fast . I got online and went directly to websites that sold this hard-to-find and very expensive type of toilet . Not only could I not find one within my price range but I could n't find one with the right measurements to fit into the bolts in my wall - then I thought to myself `` I 've heard Amazon sells everything '' and sure enough they had the exact toilet I needed at less than half the price I expected to spend . I got the tank and the toilet bowl within days . They both work great -LRB- much better than the one that cracked -RRB- and were easy to install . Thank you Amazon !

 This Potentiometer is very precise and inexpensive . I purchase a couple to try out and order again so you know its a good product
 First I must say that it arrived on time . Have been doing some self electronics education on my own and have found this to be a reliable Pot -LRB- potentiometer -RRB- . Sturdy and works well ! And , am learning at my own pace . Nice to know that this component is reliable , because the book I 'm currently training with is ment to alow shorts and burnouts ' to teach components limits as a way to re-enforce their tolerances.All and all Very Happy!I give this one a five star rating ! : -RRB-
 I have been using it for a . weeks now running a bit of current through it and it is holding up . I would buy these again
 Good quality bar of brass . I used this to make the hilt of a sword . it arrived fast and in perfect condition .

 It took a more torque than I had imagined would be needed to turn the potentiometer . Other than that it worked fine .
 I really do n't have any complaints . great product , low price . Does get a little warm on 12VDC circuits at higher resistances , as you would expect .
 This is a box of quality slides that I ordered when I purchased my Microscope . What can you really say about a glass slide ? They are nice slides for what I am planning on using them for and for the price you ca n't go wrong buying them . If you do n't want to purchase covers just put another slide on top . Try them . . You 'll like them . Just keep away from little kids as these are glass and can cut and be broken into little pieces .
 These arrived just as described , good quality glass , very neatly packaged with tissue between each slide . Ca n't go wrong buying these . If I happen to need more , I know where to come . Thanks , Michael J.
 the service was prompt and the product was just what I expected . thank you .
 This is the same thickness as memory glass and I am going to use this for charms using solder . Thanx .
 I 'll start out by saying that I 've read a lot of reviews on these slides . Everybody complaining about the packaging ! I think the packaging is just fine ! I bought the slides not the way their packaged . The slides are high quality and very nice to use . I 'm satisfied and think their a quality product !!
 What can I say ? It 's a pack of clear glass slides . They 're clear , well packaged , and reasonably priced . I especially like the tissues between each slide to minimize scratching . I would buy again .
 I 'm just an amateur who just began using a microscope . They seemed pretty good . Came with good tight packing .
 Excellent value . I bought these slide for my twin 8 year old grandsons for Christmas a year ago . They still view them today . The slides have been valuable in learning about items they can not readily see without a microscope .
 This product is of high quality for my son . He lovesI recommend this toy to everyone for their excellent design
 These slides were exactly what I wanted , and much cheaper than the ones at my school 's bookstore . They also shipped very quickly .
 Totally excellent product , fast shipment , A + + + + . Would buy again , again , again , and again . Thank you very much !! Very Excellent , excellent , excellent .
 This product came very quickly ! The packaging was wonderful and all slides are in working order . Thanks again , and I will definitely recommend this seller to friends and family . Thank you !
 These were also for my grandsons . They can make up their own slides to use under the scope . Excellent way to let them increase their grades in science .
 Excellent transaction . Received timely and in advertised condition . I would do business with this seller again .
 WE ordered this to go along with the microscope ordered from Amazon . A great purchase for the price . My son has been able to collect many items and has still not used all of the slides .
 Just got to have these guy 's if you want to use the microscope . Price was great and shippping was fast .
 Received in good condition , glad to have on hand for great-grandsons as they need them for school projects .
 Slides are good for viewing things under the microscope . Would have been nice if they came with slide covers
 Got these slides in record time . The seller is only a few towns away and that probably contributed to the speed of delivery , but it was FAST . Slides are good , got them for my son to use with his microscope . They do not include slide covers , though , so you will need to buy those separately if you need them . Overall great price on a quality item .
 I have a very curious 9 year old and he loves to examine everything . We bought some of the prepared slides and you can look at them , but nothing else . With the blank slides he is able to create his own .
 These slides come in a box with tissue paper in between , and it is very easy to place something on them and observe under the microscope . They are durable , too , holding up to being dropped on the carpet a few times . -LRB- Not so well under the shoes , though . : / -RRB- We really enjoyed putting hair , skin , onions , paper , etc on the slides and observing them .
 If I knew you had the slides whit the covers I would have ordered that instead of these slides , I did n't know you had them until I ordered the other ones .
 The slides arrived in record time and were exactly as described . I am very happy with this vendor .
 Excellent stripe tape for car . Vivid color and very easy to install with no akward paper backing to fiddle with . Just roll the tape on for great pin striping both inside and outside car . Holds well with the quality 3M self-adhesive backing . Great value , too !

 The item was to my satisfaction , quick service -LRB- got it within 5 days -RRB- and safely packed . I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in this kind of product .
 Not that big of a deal but they do n't come in a cool little box like this . They come in a crappy little 1 inch x 1 inch x 1 inch paper box . The cover slips themselves are fine .
 The plastic slide covers are exactly as I thought when purchasing , but the packaging is completely different from what is pictured on the site . I was buying these for my son 's birthday , and was hoping for something like the nice box pictured , but ended up with a chintzy cardboard deal , not even a quarter of the size shown in the picture I referred to when I was buying the product . They still will serve their purpose , but that storage box pictured would have been nice ...
 On the plus side , it is nice to have lots of clean quality slides in a convenient box holder . when you need them . The box keeps dirt and dust always and makes it easier to find a clean slide when you need one . The only , negative is that is is sometimes a pain to get a slide out without taking the rest with you . Seems like a slide sticks whenever I need to get one out of the box when I have rubber gloves on .
 These are what they say they are

I wanted to give it a try , and I must admit it worked like a charm . No leaks , perfect . Search online for `` eye dropper fountain pen '' and `` o-ring '' or perhaps `` make your own '' and you should be able to find it , if you 're interested . Fun , and a good use of the pen and the ink .
 I bought these based on the recommendation of a previous reviewer . The seal on my Nissan 14oz Leakproof Insulated Travel Mug broke when I was washing it , and without the seal , it was n't leakproof . These work great . Thanks , previous reviewer !
 My husband takes a Thermos travel mug of coffee with him every workday , and the o-ring was very stained . I also figured that eventually it would relax and no longer provide a tight , leakproof fit . I thought finding a replacement would be impossible , but , when it looks impossible ... try Amazon ! Found these , which are the exact size as the original . We 're set for a long time , now !
 I lost the original ring to my Nissan Stainless coffee cup , and was looking for a new one on Amazon , when Amazon suggested this o-ring to me . What a good suggestion ! Now my old cup has a new lease on life and I can lose the ring like 9 more times before I have to buy a whole new one : -RRB-
 I got these on a suggestion on an airsoft repair forum . They fit snugly into the fill valves , providing a better outer seal than most factory standard o-rings , and at a far better price than the exact same product when sold somewhere like Evike . The one problem I had was that my bag had 88 in it instead of 100 . I 'm not actually upset , since the price difference between it and other similar products still made this worth it , but a little more accuracy in the numbers would be appreciated.Pros - Great PriceFits snugly in placePlenty for more replacements lateCons - Did n't actually receive 100
 My favorite Nalgene 750ml bottle had turned into a `` dribble '' bottle . This ring is the correct size to fit over the neck and seal against the cap when the cap is screwed on . Not perfect - when you unscrew the cap , a little water that was sitting above the ring will drip . But I 'm not getting dripped on when I drink .
 WOW , researched `` O '' Rings off & online for awhile , almost bought one at another store online , but it was 5 times the price , I thought of amazon and I probably could have done even better , but I am pleased with these.Thank you again , Amazon has not let me down yet !! NO LEAKS!Tim
 excellent price and good delivery . the item will be used to seal pyrex glass tubes used for a solar boiler to create steam .
 Fits my Remington 1100 Shotgun perfect ! Replaced my old hard worn out one . I dont think I will ever use all 50 of them , but maybe some friends will need some .
 It is just what you would expect . Works fine , looks like good stuff . I go through a bunch of these on camp fuel stoves and bottles . Viton lasts much longer than NBR .
 I bought this part to use on the fuel pump plate of my bmw r1150r . I think it 's also the same part for 1100 too . It works just as well at fraction of the cost quoted by dealerships
 This seal works for early BMW oil filter stand O-Ring , not available from dealer . Or you end up buying new style housing which is a lot more .
 Just what I needed to fix my pool fill valve . 25 is a lot but now I 'm covered .
 Yes , this is the one you 've been hunting , and yes , my 91 geo 1.0 quit leaking from there . What to do with the extra nine ? Well , I do n't know either , but its hard to beat the price !!!
 Thanks for stocking these O-rings ; I could not find them locally . Just what I needed . Still arrived ahead of a few other items I ordered at the same time from other venders here on Amazon so I changed my review to five stars .
 I 'm always running for o rings for something now I have a stock at home .

 This is what you want . Economical and high quality . Works perfectly . Great alternative to the factory or firearms products . 100 rounds test proved perfect performance .
 I ordered these orings to repair my ford 6.9 diesel engine . I used them on the injector leak-off jackets to reseal them . They worked great and were a great deal .
 I had been going through o-rings on our tube filling machine like crazy . I had to replace it once a week or more often . I decided to order this 25 pack since it was so inexpensive . It 's been a month and a half and I have not yet replaced the first one of these . They seem to be extremely durable so far .
 Fast service and product as described . Fits an old Remington 1100 perfectly at a fraction of the cost of Remington replacements . That 's about all - they are just O-rings .
 Used to replace broken o-ring on a Remington 1100 12 gauge . Product fits perfectly and is of very high quality . At this price you basically have a lifetime supply ! Highly recommend !
 I was looking for an o-ring for my Remington 1100 and other places were asking $ 9 for 1 . You get 50 of these for less than that . My great grandkids will still have these o-rings for the gun lol .
 I was having blow back issues with my 12gauge , and all the suggestions pointed to my gas ports , and the O ring . Now that I have replaced it , I need to get out and shoot again . Hopefully this was the fix . The only draw back with this product , is that you receive a &#34; Costco &#34; supply ; more than enough for a lifetime .
 Used this to replace my o ring on my BMW 's DISA valve . O ring is not available from the dealer . Worked perfectly and solved my vacuum leak .

 GREAT PRODUCT , HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT ! , GREAT GREAT GREAT THING YEAH ! GREAT THING YEAY!GREAT PRODUCT , HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT ! , GREAT GREAT GREAT THING YEAH ! GREAT THING YEAY !
 I use this device with my come-along to stretch fence wire . I have n't found anything else as simple and reliable.It would be nice if the jaw teeth were a little bit sharper to bite into the run strands on anti-walk-down fencing . This wire is harder than standard barbed wire and tends to slip in the Wire Grip 's jaw .
 The name of this product , Maasdam Pow ' R Pull 8050 Wire Grip , is self explanatory . However , I was impressed with how solidly this tool is built . My guess is that it will handle forces well beyond its ton and a half specifications . Amazon 's pricing was the best I could find anywhere .
 This is really a great tool for tensioning -LRB- stretching -RRB- barbless fencing wire when used in conjuntion with a good sturdy come-a-long when fencing in horse or livestock pastures . It would work equally well for barbed wire , but that requires tougher gloves , clothes , and eye and face protection.Once you insert the wire in between the jaws and hold it in place until you get a little bit of tension with a come-a-long it will never come loose while you apply a lot more tension as needed until the wire almost sings . Then it 's a simple matter of stapling the wire to your corner or in-line heavy duty wooden fence post -LRB- RR tie -RRB- and releasing the come-a-long release lever.I used it for fencing a little over 7 acres with a perimeter of about 3200 ft. I used 10 plus rolls of 1/4 mile rolls of barbless fencing to get ` er done.Thats about 2 1/2 miles of wire and the Maasdam Pow ' r Pull 8050 got a grip and kept a grip .
 Worked perfectly when installing a chain linked fence . . Great price too !!!! I would recommend it to anyone that needs this type of help when installing wire .
 Besides the prompt delivery the tool is well made and indeed saves a lot of time and effort . I am well pleased with my purchase as I expected from a smart product .
 hAVE SOLD THESE WIRE GRIPPERS IN MY STORE SINCE 1975 . DO N'T KNOW WHY SOME OF MY WHOLESALER CA N'T PUT THEM IN THEIR INVENTORY .
 I found this on our Texas property about a year and a half ago and I had no idea what it was and how it was used . The one I have seems old but in great shape it was made in Burbank Ca . pat no 2-607-085 stamped inside are HE 7959 on the body and 7960 on the lever .
 The item was to my satisfaction , quick service -LRB- got it within 5 days -RRB- and safely packed . I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in this kind of product .

 Excellent stripe tape for car . Vivid color and very easy to install with no akward paper backing to fiddle with . Just roll the tape on for great pin striping both inside and outside car . Holds well with the quality 3M self-adhesive backing . Great value , too !

 Just standard O-rings . They work great for 5-gallon soda kegs used for home brewing . With the 100-pk , I wo n't have to buy more ... ever .
 I really like these instead of the rubber ones I replaced them for . I would do this again since silicone is forever
 This is a perfect replacement O ring for my Thermos Nissan insulated coffee mug . It fit perfectly and provided a tight seal .
 I used this and it worked for my application very good quality and good pricing and also packaging . It 's made well .
 O-rings were top quality , exactly as pictured . Prices are great for only a 10 pack . Exactly what I wanted and expected . What more would you need ?
 The O-rings arrived on time and look good . Amazon has a great selection , far better than any store I could find in town . They are marked in fractional inches , but that size is only approximate . Look in the product description and it will tell you the exact size in thousandths of an inch .
 I purchased these O-rings for replacing the drive belts for a rod dryer -LRB- fishing rods -RRB- . They 're stronger than the originals !
 After purchasing a lower quality product from the local hardware store for about twice the price , I was happy to see Amazon carrying the silicon type of this O-Ring and for a lower price . They are quality products for a great price .
 Looking for a better and cheaper alternative than buying the $ 5 each Omni Heavy Duty whole house filter o-rings ? This is it . The silicone is FDA approved and at $ 5 for 10 pieces !
 I bought these o-rings as a replacement on my Nissan spill proof travel mug . I use this mug all the time . It will keep a cup of freshly made tea or coffee hot for 3-4 hours if left closed , or at the right drinking temperature for a full hour . I tried to find a replacement for the o-ring at the Nissan website but could not . These o-rings are an excellent replacement . The mug closes water tight and works like new . Highly recommended for this application .

 excellent price and good delivery . the item will be used to seal pyrex glass tubes used for a solar boiler to create steam .
 If you know what grade 316 stainless is and are familiar with its proffered and how to machine it , all I can say its they delivered what was promised without any problems

 Hi there , We have a big yoga studio that we use it to clean up the floors . We love it as it covers a lot of space in a shorter amount of time . I recommend this product .
 Quick shipment . Worked as planned to reinforce a cracked member of the frame of my golf cart.Seem like good folks to deal with .
 I received my order in a timely time and in prefect condition , in spite of its 8-foot lengths . The 6061-T6 aluminum angles were very stiff ; much more so than the 6063 , thus giving me the stiffening that I was looking for on my project . If you need something better than what 's at your local home improvement store then I 'd recommend this product .
 My husband needed this and he is very happy with the purchase . It was exactly what he was looking for .
 The item is just as described . It 's made by Stock Gear Inc. and resold by Small Parts Inc. . The face width is 3/8 inch . The gear I.D. is 5/16 inch . The hub diameter is about 11/16 inch and the hub projects about 3/8 inch beyond the gear on one side only . The hub is plain and must be drilled for a pin or set screw or else press fit to a shaft.I bought 5 of them at 20 cents each . Three days later , they are $ 3.52 each ! Same with many other gears I bought . What 's up with that ?

 Just standard O-rings . They work great for 5-gallon soda kegs used for home brewing . With the 100-pk , I wo n't have to buy more ... ever .
 I really like these instead of the rubber ones I replaced them for . I would do this again since silicone is forever
 This is a perfect replacement O ring for my Thermos Nissan insulated coffee mug . It fit perfectly and provided a tight seal .
 I used this and it worked for my application very good quality and good pricing and also packaging . It 's made well .
 O-rings were top quality , exactly as pictured . Prices are great for only a 10 pack . Exactly what I wanted and expected . What more would you need ?
 The O-rings arrived on time and look good . Amazon has a great selection , far better than any store I could find in town . They are marked in fractional inches , but that size is only approximate . Look in the product description and it will tell you the exact size in thousandths of an inch .
 I purchased these O-rings for replacing the drive belts for a rod dryer -LRB- fishing rods -RRB- . They 're stronger than the originals !
 After purchasing a lower quality product from the local hardware store for about twice the price , I was happy to see Amazon carrying the silicon type of this O-Ring and for a lower price . They are quality products for a great price .
 Looking for a better and cheaper alternative than buying the $ 5 each Omni Heavy Duty whole house filter o-rings ? This is it . The silicone is FDA approved and at $ 5 for 10 pieces !

 I bought these o-rings as a replacement on my Nissan spill proof travel mug . I use this mug all the time . It will keep a cup of freshly made tea or coffee hot for 3-4 hours if left closed , or at the right drinking temperature for a full hour . I tried to find a replacement for the o-ring at the Nissan website but could not . These o-rings are an excellent replacement . The mug closes water tight and works like new . Highly recommended for this application .
 These are very strong little o-rings , with plenty of tensile strength . I read a recent DIY article online about turning certain fountain pens -LRB- Platinum Preppy line -RRB- into eye dropper fountain pens using this size o-ring . I wanted to give it a try , and I must admit it worked like a charm . No leaks , perfect . Search online for `` eye dropper fountain pen '' and `` o-ring '' or perhaps `` make your own '' and you should be able to find it , if you 're interested . Fun , and a good use of the pen and the ink .
 I bought these based on the recommendation of a previous reviewer . The seal on my Nissan 14oz Leakproof Insulated Travel Mug broke when I was washing it , and without the seal , it was n't leakproof . These work great . Thanks , previous reviewer !
 My husband takes a Thermos travel mug of coffee with him every workday , and the o-ring was very stained . I also figured that eventually it would relax and no longer provide a tight , leakproof fit . I thought finding a replacement would be impossible , but , when it looks impossible ... try Amazon ! Found these , which are the exact size as the original . We 're set for a long time , now !
 I lost the original ring to my Nissan Stainless coffee cup , and was looking for a new one on Amazon , when Amazon suggested this o-ring to me . What a good suggestion ! Now my old cup has a new lease on life and I can lose the ring like 9 more times before I have to buy a whole new one : -RRB-
 I got these on a suggestion on an airsoft repair forum . They fit snugly into the fill valves , providing a better outer seal than most factory standard o-rings , and at a far better price than the exact same product when sold somewhere like Evike . The one problem I had was that my bag had 88 in it instead of 100 . I 'm not actually upset , since the price difference between it and other similar products still made this worth it , but a little more accuracy in the numbers would be appreciated.Pros - Great PriceFits snugly in placePlenty for more replacements lateCons - Did n't actually receive 100
 My favorite Nalgene 750ml bottle had turned into a `` dribble '' bottle . This ring is the correct size to fit over the neck and seal against the cap when the cap is screwed on . Not perfect - when you unscrew the cap , a little water that was sitting above the ring will drip . But I 'm not getting dripped on when I drink .
 WOW , researched `` O '' Rings off & online for awhile , almost bought one at another store online , but it was 5 times the price , I thought of amazon and I probably could have done even better , but I am pleased with these.Thank you again , Amazon has not let me down yet !! NO LEAKS!Tim
 excellent price and good delivery . the item will be used to seal pyrex glass tubes used for a solar boiler to create steam .
 If you know what grade 316 stainless is and are familiar with its proffered and how to machine it , all I can say its they delivered what was promised without any problems
 Fits my Remington 1100 Shotgun perfect ! Replaced my old hard worn out one . I dont think I will ever use all 50 of them , but maybe some friends will need some .
 It is just what you would expect . Works fine , looks like good stuff . I go through a bunch of these on camp fuel stoves and bottles . Viton lasts much longer than NBR .
 I bought this part to use on the fuel pump plate of my bmw r1150r . I think it 's also the same part for 1100 too . It works just as well at fraction of the cost quoted by dealerships
 This seal works for early BMW oil filter stand O-Ring , not available from dealer . Or you end up buying new style housing which is a lot more .
 Just what I needed to fix my pool fill valve . 25 is a lot but now I 'm covered .
 Yes , this is the one you 've been hunting , and yes , my 91 geo 1.0 quit leaking from there . What to do with the extra nine ? Well , I do n't know either , but its hard to beat the price !!!
 Thanks for stocking these O-rings ; I could not find them locally . Just what I needed . Still arrived ahead of a few other items I ordered at the same time from other venders here on Amazon so I changed my review to five stars .
 I 'm always running for o rings for something now I have a stock at home .

 GREAT PRODUCT , HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT ! , GREAT GREAT GREAT THING YEAH ! GREAT THING YEAY!GREAT PRODUCT , HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT ! , GREAT GREAT GREAT THING YEAH ! GREAT THING YEAY !
 This is what you want . Economical and high quality . Works perfectly . Great alternative to the factory or firearms products . 100 rounds test proved perfect performance .
 I ordered these orings to repair my ford 6.9 diesel engine . I used them on the injector leak-off jackets to reseal them . They worked great and were a great deal .
 I had been going through o-rings on our tube filling machine like crazy . I had to replace it once a week or more often . I decided to order this 25 pack since it was so inexpensive . It 's been a month and a half and I have not yet replaced the first one of these . They seem to be extremely durable so far .
 Fast service and product as described . Fits an old Remington 1100 perfectly at a fraction of the cost of Remington replacements . That 's about all - they are just O-rings .
 Used to replace broken o-ring on a Remington 1100 12 gauge . Product fits perfectly and is of very high quality . At this price you basically have a lifetime supply ! Highly recommend !
 I was looking for an o-ring for my Remington 1100 and other places were asking $ 9 for 1 . You get 50 of these for less than that . My great grandkids will still have these o-rings for the gun lol .
 I was having blow back issues with my 12gauge , and all the suggestions pointed to my gas ports , and the O ring . Now that I have replaced it , I need to get out and shoot again . Hopefully this was the fix . The only draw back with this product , is that you receive a &#34; Costco &#34; supply ; more than enough for a lifetime .
 Used this to replace my o ring on my BMW 's DISA valve . O ring is not available from the dealer . Worked perfectly and solved my vacuum leak .
 Really good quality . I 'm not certain all the uses my husband has planned for this item , but I do know he used it to make an inscription plaque for a desk he built . The plaque turned out beautifully .
 Yup , it 's a 1/4 '' x 3/4 '' x 24L Brass Rectangular Bar . Not much more to say . Have a nice day !
 I needed it for a few holes . I have a weird house that has a concrete floor supported by tiles and steel bar instead of plywood and joists . It is solid but a pain to run wires and pipes from the basement to the first floor . This bit was perfect with a deWalt hammer drill to get a long hole made to run some wire from a bedroom downstairs , so i could wire in an electric baseboard heater . Would recommend , it took about 2 minutes to get through , which i consider to be very fast for that task . would buy again if ever need a different size also !
 I 've been buying Bosch bits from Home Depot . Generally , drilling concrete , I was lucky to sink four holes before the bit became bent and useless -LRB- they would bend long before they became dull -RRB- . These bits are considerably less expensive and a better quality . If you have a similar problem , you might give these a try . I 'm happy .

 I used this to make a couple of Heavy Duty saw horses . Steel adjustable legs and this makes the top . Smooth and flat , very strong but quite light . Easy to clean . Easy to clamp things to the saw horse as well . There were a few nicks on the edges so if you need a crisp clean edge you might have to do a little sanding .

 I bought this material to make survival knives with . It is extremely strong and has a density of only 4.5 times that of water or slightly more than half that of steel . Its melting point is 125 degrees centigrade HIGHER than that of iron . It is also extremely corrosion resistant.I am satisfied in all respects .
 Thick steel 15CM/6Inch machineist rule , 1/10th and 1/100 standard , 1mm and .5 MM markings for metric no fractions.If only they had a 30CM version -LRB- 12 inch -RRB-
 This is my perfect 6 '' ruler.It 's heavy enough not to fly around on the paper.It 's thick enough where I do n't need to worry about it bending.I love being able to feel the distance markers . The indicator lines and numbers are cut into the metal ever so slightly . I can even feel them with the pencil if I hold it the right way.The black ink is very easy to see , even against the gray background.Perfect .
 Really good quality . I 'm not certain all the uses my husband has planned for this item , but I do know he used it to make an inscription plaque for a desk he built . The plaque turned out beautifully .

 After purchasing a lower quality product from the local hardware store for about twice the price , I was happy to see Amazon carrying the silicon type of this O-Ring and for a lower price . They are quality products for a great price .
 Looking for a better and cheaper alternative than buying the $ 5 each Omni Heavy Duty whole house filter o-rings ? This is it . The silicone is FDA approved and at $ 5 for 10 pieces !

 I bought these o-rings as a replacement on my Nissan spill proof travel mug . I use this mug all the time . It will keep a cup of freshly made tea or coffee hot for 3-4 hours if left closed , or at the right drinking temperature for a full hour . I tried to find a replacement for the o-ring at the Nissan website but could not . These o-rings are an excellent replacement . The mug closes water tight and works like new . Highly recommended for this application .
 These are very strong little o-rings , with plenty of tensile strength . I read a recent DIY article online about turning certain fountain pens -LRB- Platinum Preppy line -RRB- into eye dropper fountain pens using this size o-ring . I wanted to give it a try , and I must admit it worked like a charm . No leaks , perfect . Search online for `` eye dropper fountain pen '' and `` o-ring '' or perhaps `` make your own '' and you should be able to find it , if you 're interested . Fun , and a good use of the pen and the ink .
 I bought these based on the recommendation of a previous reviewer . The seal on my Nissan 14oz Leakproof Insulated Travel Mug broke when I was washing it , and without the seal , it was n't leakproof . These work great . Thanks , previous reviewer !
 My husband takes a Thermos travel mug of coffee with him every workday , and the o-ring was very stained . I also figured that eventually it would relax and no longer provide a tight , leakproof fit . I thought finding a replacement would be impossible , but , when it looks impossible ... try Amazon ! Found these , which are the exact size as the original . We 're set for a long time , now !
 I lost the original ring to my Nissan Stainless coffee cup , and was looking for a new one on Amazon , when Amazon suggested this o-ring to me . What a good suggestion ! Now my old cup has a new lease on life and I can lose the ring like 9 more times before I have to buy a whole new one : -RRB-
 I got these on a suggestion on an airsoft repair forum . They fit snugly into the fill valves , providing a better outer seal than most factory standard o-rings , and at a far better price than the exact same product when sold somewhere like Evike . The one problem I had was that my bag had 88 in it instead of 100 . I 'm not actually upset , since the price difference between it and other similar products still made this worth it , but a little more accuracy in the numbers would be appreciated.Pros - Great PriceFits snugly in placePlenty for more replacements lateCons - Did n't actually receive 100
 My favorite Nalgene 750ml bottle had turned into a `` dribble '' bottle . This ring is the correct size to fit over the neck and seal against the cap when the cap is screwed on . Not perfect - when you unscrew the cap , a little water that was sitting above the ring will drip . But I 'm not getting dripped on when I drink .
 WOW , researched `` O '' Rings off & online for awhile , almost bought one at another store online , but it was 5 times the price , I thought of amazon and I probably could have done even better , but I am pleased with these.Thank you again , Amazon has not let me down yet !! NO LEAKS!Tim
 excellent price and good delivery . the item will be used to seal pyrex glass tubes used for a solar boiler to create steam .
 Quick shipment . Worked as planned to reinforce a cracked member of the frame of my golf cart.Seem like good folks to deal with .
 I received my order in a timely time and in prefect condition , in spite of its 8-foot lengths . The 6061-T6 aluminum angles were very stiff ; much more so than the 6063 , thus giving me the stiffening that I was looking for on my project . If you need something better than what 's at your local home improvement store then I 'd recommend this product .
 My husband needed this and he is very happy with the purchase . It was exactly what he was looking for .
 I bought a pair of these to upgrade the woofer section of my speaker crossover . These these are large and heavy caps , the leads are too short compared to the size of the cap though . I 've never been a fan of Solen , so I 'm recommending these for large value polypropylene caps ... The sound ? So far in my bass circuit they seem clean and tight . Obviously they got ta be superior to the electrolytics which are usually used in these values ...
 Excellent stripe tape for car . Vivid color and very easy to install with no akward paper backing to fiddle with . Just roll the tape on for great pin striping both inside and outside car . Holds well with the quality 3M self-adhesive backing . Great value , too !
 This is what you want . Economical and high quality . Works perfectly . Great alternative to the factory or firearms products . 100 rounds test proved perfect performance .
 I ordered these orings to repair my ford 6.9 diesel engine . I used them on the injector leak-off jackets to reseal them . They worked great and were a great deal .
 I had been going through o-rings on our tube filling machine like crazy . I had to replace it once a week or more often . I decided to order this 25 pack since it was so inexpensive . It 's been a month and a half and I have not yet replaced the first one of these . They seem to be extremely durable so far .
 Fast service and product as described . Fits an old Remington 1100 perfectly at a fraction of the cost of Remington replacements . That 's about all - they are just O-rings .
 Used to replace broken o-ring on a Remington 1100 12 gauge . Product fits perfectly and is of very high quality . At this price you basically have a lifetime supply ! Highly recommend !
 I was looking for an o-ring for my Remington 1100 and other places were asking $ 9 for 1 . You get 50 of these for less than that . My great grandkids will still have these o-rings for the gun lol .
 I was having blow back issues with my 12gauge , and all the suggestions pointed to my gas ports , and the O ring . Now that I have replaced it , I need to get out and shoot again . Hopefully this was the fix . The only draw back with this product , is that you receive a &#34; Costco &#34; supply ; more than enough for a lifetime .
 Used this to replace my o ring on my BMW 's DISA valve . O ring is not available from the dealer . Worked perfectly and solved my vacuum leak .

 Fits my Remington 1100 Shotgun perfect ! Replaced my old hard worn out one . I dont think I will ever use all 50 of them , but maybe some friends will need some .
 It is just what you would expect . Works fine , looks like good stuff . I go through a bunch of these on camp fuel stoves and bottles . Viton lasts much longer than NBR .
 I bought this part to use on the fuel pump plate of my bmw r1150r . I think it 's also the same part for 1100 too . It works just as well at fraction of the cost quoted by dealerships
 This seal works for early BMW oil filter stand O-Ring , not available from dealer . Or you end up buying new style housing which is a lot more .
 Just what I needed to fix my pool fill valve . 25 is a lot but now I 'm covered .
 Yes , this is the one you 've been hunting , and yes , my 91 geo 1.0 quit leaking from there . What to do with the extra nine ? Well , I do n't know either , but its hard to beat the price !!!
 Thanks for stocking these O-rings ; I could not find them locally . Just what I needed . Still arrived ahead of a few other items I ordered at the same time from other venders here on Amazon so I changed my review to five stars .
 I 'm always running for o rings for something now I have a stock at home .

 The item is just as described . It 's made by Stock Gear Inc. and resold by Small Parts Inc. . The face width is 3/8 inch . The gear I.D. is 5/16 inch . The hub diameter is about 11/16 inch and the hub projects about 3/8 inch beyond the gear on one side only . The hub is plain and must be drilled for a pin or set screw or else press fit to a shaft.I bought 5 of them at 20 cents each . Three days later , they are $ 3.52 each ! Same with many other gears I bought . What 's up with that ?
 Really good quality . I 'm not certain all the uses my husband has planned for this item , but I do know he used it to make an inscription plaque for a desk he built . The plaque turned out beautifully .
 Yup , it 's a 1/4 '' x 3/4 '' x 24L Brass Rectangular Bar . Not much more to say . Have a nice day !
 The advantage of using brass screws is that they are relatively easy to cut cleanly to length . Either use a screw cutter or thread a nut above the point to cut and cut the screw then unscrew the nut over the cut to straighten the thread area back out.The second advantage of brass is that it is relatively corrosion resistant - it will eventually darken but never rust.Brass is strong enough for most home uses - obviously for automotive or aircraft use stainless steel is required.These are well made brass screws at a reasonable price .
 These are a good deal . They 're adequately strong , and look pretty . Mostly , though , they 're pretty long - I bought these because they cost less than any shorter length , and I can just cut them to size .
 I 've been looking for a good source of brass 2-56 screws and these fit the bill . They certainly cost less than they would in the hobby or hardware store .
 It would have cost twice as much to buy half as many of these locally , I 'm a happy camper . I will certainly buy here again .
 Use them to fasten the HDDs to the computer case I built for my NAS from an old Compaq Deskpro case . The head is compatible with the original tool-less HDD attachment design of the case.Also worked great to fasten HDDs to standard cases
 I 'm not sure quite what to say about these . They work like any other machine screw , and are made very well . The length was correct . They are all brass -LRB- not brass plated -RRB- which is a nice plus .
 AS MENTIONED BEFORE , THESE ARE BLACK OXIDE SCREWS , NOT STAINLESS AS PICTURED . These are very high quality YFS screws . I 've ordered 1000 's of them and they come exactly as described . Very good value !
 The screws are black -LRB- not silver as pictured -RRB- . The heads are also wider than a normal screw . Otherwise no issues .
 I am turning these into vent liners for my muzzleloader . With new vent liners running $ 2 to $ 3 a piece , it 's a grat bargain to make my own with these screws .
 I used this screw to fix my car door latch when one of the originals fell off . It fit perfectly and held up well over the winter .
 Not some sloppy fit , these screws are rough and tough and coarse threaded . Unless the price is abnormally cheap , as it was when I purchased them , I 'm sure not many people are going to be reading this . But I will say I have successfully used some of these fasteners . They work as expected .
 1 . Shipping seemed a little much , but then again how else would you ship a sheet this size for a quick delivery and undamaged . -LRB- Great Job -RRB- 2 . Beautiful metal I ` am not an expert , but it 's what I was looking for in my project . -LRB- Great Metal -RRB- 3 . I 'm very happy with my project , and would reorder from this supplier again . -LRB- Great Work -RRB-
 My kids were asking why our apartment does n't have its own brass sign outside unlike all the other apartments . We live in San Francisco 's trendy South of Market district , where brass signs have become de rigueur in recent years . Signs with butterflies embossed on them that say `` The Nabokovs . '' Signs with monocles engraved that read `` Peter and Harriet . '' The lot . Yes , I know what it 's like to be a kid and to be ashamed of one 's parents for not providing one 's family with something it seems all the other kids have . And so , when I noticed that they were crying themselves to sleep over this issue , and that in the morning their pillowcases were wet with tears , I resolved to do something about it , so I ordered a few ultra slim 260 H02 sheets of brass from Amazon and decided to make myself a sign for `` The Killians . `` These brass sheets , less than .02 inches thick , are flexible enough for you , or your child , to wrap around a pole , massage into desired thickness , test for bugs , in any dimension you like . My kids wanted to paper the lintel with brass , and I let 'em . Might be hot on summer afternoons , but they 'll learn . In the meantime you can hammer out the font characters you want , plus some amusing design -LRB- we had tulips -RRB- cut to 36 '' x 12 '' so you will have a nice plaque right next to your doorbell . Or should you discover someone famous once lived in your building , and your HOA approves , you could whip up a sign to commemorate the achievement right away . Like we discovered that Samuel Delany and Marilyn Hacker once lived in our building and staged a production of Genet 's THE MAIDS on the three-flight stairwell , so that spectators stood on the street and craned their necks up to see the fun . Blam ! Another brass sign . At this price you 'll be buying brass like there 's no tomorrow .
 After searching the internet for days , this was the best priced product on the market and the quality is great ! Thank you !
 So like I said in the subject title , this is Good Brass . -LRB- eight more words required , eight more words required -RRB-
 This was a reasonable quantity for a specific project -LRB- new latch plates custom-sized for 1920s doors -RRB- . The packing was great , and the product as received was flat .
 This is what you want . Economical and high quality . Works perfectly . Great alternative to the factory or firearms products . 100 rounds test proved perfect performance .

 I use a cordless drill so much that I have a holster for it on my toolbelt . I have tried many different `` quick change '' bit holders . This is the only one that does n't get pushed back by the holster . All the other quick change type products are to big and would constantly get pushed back and release the bit causing it to fall out . It 's slim design is great . Why do the other manufactures make such big clunky ones ? BUY THIS IT RULES .

 Just standard O-rings . They work great for 5-gallon soda kegs used for home brewing . With the 100-pk , I wo n't have to buy more ... ever .
 I really like these instead of the rubber ones I replaced them for . I would do this again since silicone is forever
 This is a perfect replacement O ring for my Thermos Nissan insulated coffee mug . It fit perfectly and provided a tight seal .
 I used this and it worked for my application very good quality and good pricing and also packaging . It 's made well .
 O-rings were top quality , exactly as pictured . Prices are great for only a 10 pack . Exactly what I wanted and expected . What more would you need ?
 The O-rings arrived on time and look good . Amazon has a great selection , far better than any store I could find in town . They are marked in fractional inches , but that size is only approximate . Look in the product description and it will tell you the exact size in thousandths of an inch .

 I bought these o-rings as a replacement on my Nissan spill proof travel mug . I use this mug all the time . It will keep a cup of freshly made tea or coffee hot for 3-4 hours if left closed , or at the right drinking temperature for a full hour . I tried to find a replacement for the o-ring at the Nissan website but could not . These o-rings are an excellent replacement . The mug closes water tight and works like new . Highly recommended for this application .

I read a recent DIY article online about turning certain fountain pens -LRB- Platinum Preppy line -RRB- into eye dropper fountain pens using this size o-ring . I wanted to give it a try , and I must admit it worked like a charm . No leaks , perfect . Search online for `` eye dropper fountain pen '' and `` o-ring '' or perhaps `` make your own '' and you should be able to find it , if you 're interested . Fun , and a good use of the pen and the ink .
 I bought these based on the recommendation of a previous reviewer . The seal on my Nissan 14oz Leakproof Insulated Travel Mug broke when I was washing it , and without the seal , it was n't leakproof . These work great . Thanks , previous reviewer !
 My husband takes a Thermos travel mug of coffee with him every workday , and the o-ring was very stained . I also figured that eventually it would relax and no longer provide a tight , leakproof fit . I thought finding a replacement would be impossible , but , when it looks impossible ... try Amazon ! Found these , which are the exact size as the original . We 're set for a long time , now !
 I lost the original ring to my Nissan Stainless coffee cup , and was looking for a new one on Amazon , when Amazon suggested this o-ring to me . What a good suggestion ! Now my old cup has a new lease on life and I can lose the ring like 9 more times before I have to buy a whole new one : -RRB-

 My favorite Nalgene 750ml bottle had turned into a `` dribble '' bottle . This ring is the correct size to fit over the neck and seal against the cap when the cap is screwed on . Not perfect - when you unscrew the cap , a little water that was sitting above the ring will drip . But I 'm not getting dripped on when I drink .
 WOW , researched `` O '' Rings off & online for awhile , almost bought one at another store online , but it was 5 times the price , I thought of amazon and I probably could have done even better , but I am pleased with these.Thank you again , Amazon has not let me down yet !! NO LEAKS!Tim

 GREAT BITS!If you have n't used a step bit to drill sheet metal , you have no idea how nice they are.You know when you 're drilling sheet metal and when the drill punches through , the back side of the hole is really ugly and has sharp things -LRB- burrs -RRB- attached ? A step bit eliminates that , by drilling in steps - just a 1/16 '' at a time . Want a 7/16 '' hole ? Just count the number of steps , and drill that many . Simple.If you have variety of holes to drill of different sizes , you do n't have to change bits.Obviously they do n't work on thick material.They are pictured with a box -LRB- drill index -RRB- yet did n't ship with one . At over $ 50 a set , it would be nice to not have them in a tool box drawer getting banged around . Four stars for lack of a box , while advertising that there is one . The bits deserve five -LRB- and protection -RRB- .
 It is a great set to have , I wish I would have bought this many years sooner . The product shows a case , and mine did not come in a case .
 WOW , these cut like `` right now ! `` I hope they last.I 'll post another review after I have had a chance to use these more
 The item was to my satisfaction , quick service -LRB- got it within 5 days -RRB- and safely packed . I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in this kind of product .
 I am in the process of building a new deck . I purchased the Irwin 13 Piece set for this project . I used my impact drill and went through 4 '' of pressure treated lumber in seconds . Drilled many holes and the bits are still like new .
 Came almost a week earlier than predicted by the site . Turned out to be a 15 piece set and got it for $ 15 . Ca n't beat a dollar per bit .
 So excited to have a new set of bits ... so far so good .
 Excellent stripe tape for car . Vivid color and very easy to install with no akward paper backing to fiddle with . Just roll the tape on for great pin striping both inside and outside car . Holds well with the quality 3M self-adhesive backing . Great value , too !
 These are very high quality YFS screws . I 've ordered 1000 's of them and they come exactly as described . Very good value !
 The screws arrived on time and work well - just as advertised . We use them in a robotics class and the students often lose them or use too many . These replacements were an excellent buy , a lot less than those locally available . We do n't have anything like a `` mission critical '' application , more a simple classroom/hobbyist situation . They fit the bill fine .
 Arrived on schedule and did the job . We use a lot of these and are very pleased with the result & the product .
 Heavy , rugged , precision hardware , and priced better than I could find anywhere else . A true bargain .
 This is what you want . Economical and high quality . Works perfectly . Great alternative to the factory or firearms products . 100 rounds test proved perfect performance .
 I ordered these orings to repair my ford 6.9 diesel engine . I used them on the injector leak-off jackets to reseal them . They worked great and were a great deal .
 I had been going through o-rings on our tube filling machine like crazy . I had to replace it once a week or more often . I decided to order this 25 pack since it was so inexpensive . It 's been a month and a half and I have not yet replaced the first one of these . They seem to be extremely durable so far .
 Fast service and product as described . Fits an old Remington 1100 perfectly at a fraction of the cost of Remington replacements . That 's about all - they are just O-rings .
 Used to replace broken o-ring on a Remington 1100 12 gauge . Product fits perfectly and is of very high quality . At this price you basically have a lifetime supply ! Highly recommend !
 I was looking for an o-ring for my Remington 1100 and other places were asking $ 9 for 1 . You get 50 of these for less than that . My great grandkids will still have these o-rings for the gun lol .
 I was having blow back issues with my 12gauge , and all the suggestions pointed to my gas ports , and the O ring . Now that I have replaced it , I need to get out and shoot again . Hopefully this was the fix . The only draw back with this product , is that you receive a &#34; Costco &#34; supply ; more than enough for a lifetime .
 Used this to replace my o ring on my BMW 's DISA valve . O ring is not available from the dealer . Worked perfectly and solved my vacuum leak .
 Dunno what to say about an o-ring , but they appear to be well-made , come nicely packaged , etc. .

 GREAT PRODUCT , HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT ! , GREAT GREAT GREAT THING YEAH ! GREAT THING YEAY!GREAT PRODUCT , HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT ! , GREAT GREAT GREAT THING YEAH ! GREAT THING YEAY !
 Fits my Remington 1100 Shotgun perfect ! Replaced my old hard worn out one . I dont think I will ever use all 50 of them , but maybe some friends will need some .
 It is just what you would expect . Works fine , looks like good stuff . I go through a bunch of these on camp fuel stoves and bottles . Viton lasts much longer than NBR .
 I bought this part to use on the fuel pump plate of my bmw r1150r . I think it 's also the same part for 1100 too . It works just as well at fraction of the cost quoted by dealerships
 This seal works for early BMW oil filter stand O-Ring , not available from dealer . Or you end up buying new style housing which is a lot more .
 Just what I needed to fix my pool fill valve . 25 is a lot but now I 'm covered .
 Yes , this is the one you 've been hunting , and yes , my 91 geo 1.0 quit leaking from there . What to do with the extra nine ? Well , I do n't know either , but its hard to beat the price !!!
 Thanks for stocking these O-rings ; I could not find them locally . Just what I needed . Still arrived ahead of a few other items I ordered at the same time from other venders here on Amazon so I changed my review to five stars .
 I 'm always running for o rings for something now I have a stock at home .

 The advantage of using brass screws is that they are relatively easy to cut cleanly to length . Either use a screw cutter or thread a nut above the point to cut and cut the screw then unscrew the nut over the cut to straighten the thread area back out.The second advantage of brass is that it is relatively corrosion resistant - it will eventually darken but never rust.Brass is strong enough for most home uses - obviously for automotive or aircraft use stainless steel is required.These are well made brass screws at a reasonable price .
 These are a good deal . They 're adequately strong , and look pretty . Mostly , though , they 're pretty long - I bought these because they cost less than any shorter length , and I can just cut them to size .
 I 've been looking for a good source of brass 2-56 screws and these fit the bill . They certainly cost less than they would in the hobby or hardware store .
 It would have cost twice as much to buy half as many of these locally , I 'm a happy camper . I will certainly buy here again .
 Use them to fasten the HDDs to the computer case I built for my NAS from an old Compaq Deskpro case . The head is compatible with the original tool-less HDD attachment design of the case.Also worked great to fasten HDDs to standard cases
 I 'm not sure quite what to say about these . They work like any other machine screw , and are made very well . The length was correct . They are all brass -LRB- not brass plated -RRB- which is a nice plus .
 If you know what grade 316 stainless is and are familiar with its proffered and how to machine it , all I can say its they delivered what was promised without any problems
 Quick shipment . Worked as planned to reinforce a cracked member of the frame of my golf cart.Seem like good folks to deal with .
 I received my order in a timely time and in prefect condition , in spite of its 8-foot lengths . The 6061-T6 aluminum angles were very stiff ; much more so than the 6063 , thus giving me the stiffening that I was looking for on my project . If you need something better than what 's at your local home improvement store then I 'd recommend this product .
 My husband needed this and he is very happy with the purchase . It was exactly what he was looking for .
 1 . Shipping seemed a little much , but then again how else would you ship a sheet this size for a quick delivery and undamaged . -LRB- Great Job -RRB- 2 . Beautiful metal I ` am not an expert , but it 's what I was looking for in my project . -LRB- Great Metal -RRB- 3 . I 'm very happy with my project , and would reorder from this supplier again . -LRB- Great Work -RRB-
 My kids were asking why our apartment does n't have its own brass sign outside unlike all the other apartments . We live in San Francisco 's trendy South of Market district , where brass signs have become de rigueur in recent years . Signs with butterflies embossed on them that say `` The Nabokovs . '' Signs with monocles engraved that read `` Peter and Harriet . '' The lot . Yes , I know what it 's like to be a kid and to be ashamed of one 's parents for not providing one 's family with something it seems all the other kids have . And so , when I noticed that they were crying themselves to sleep over this issue , and that in the morning their pillowcases were wet with tears , I resolved to do something about it , so I ordered a few ultra slim 260 H02 sheets of brass from Amazon and decided to make myself a sign for `` The Killians . `` These brass sheets , less than .02 inches thick , are flexible enough for you , or your child , to wrap around a pole , massage into desired thickness , test for bugs , in any dimension you like . My kids wanted to paper the lintel with brass , and I let 'em . Might be hot on summer afternoons , but they 'll learn . In the meantime you can hammer out the font characters you want , plus some amusing design -LRB- we had tulips -RRB- cut to 36 '' x 12 '' so you will have a nice plaque right next to your doorbell . Or should you discover someone famous once lived in your building , and your HOA approves , you could whip up a sign to commemorate the achievement right away . Like we discovered that Samuel Delany and Marilyn Hacker once lived in our building and staged a production of Genet 's THE MAIDS on the three-flight stairwell , so that spectators stood on the street and craned their necks up to see the fun . Blam ! Another brass sign . At this price you 'll be buying brass like there 's no tomorrow .
 After searching the internet for days , this was the best priced product on the market and the quality is great ! Thank you !
 So like I said in the subject title , this is Good Brass . -LRB- eight more words required , eight more words required -RRB-
 This was a reasonable quantity for a specific project -LRB- new latch plates custom-sized for 1920s doors -RRB- . The packing was great , and the product as received was flat .
 shipping was great , seller was great , im sure the product is excellent , but the info online concerning size for bike fender bolts was wrong for my bike , not a universal size ,

 AS MENTIONED BEFORE , THESE ARE BLACK OXIDE SCREWS , NOT STAINLESS AS PICTURED . These are very high quality YFS screws . I 've ordered 1000 's of them and they come exactly as described . Very good value !
 The screws are black -LRB- not silver as pictured -RRB- . The heads are also wider than a normal screw . Otherwise no issues .
 I am turning these into vent liners for my muzzleloader . With new vent liners running $ 2 to $ 3 a piece , it 's a grat bargain to make my own with these screws .
 I used this screw to fix my car door latch when one of the originals fell off . It fit perfectly and held up well over the winter .
 Not some sloppy fit , these screws are rough and tough and coarse threaded . Unless the price is abnormally cheap , as it was when I purchased them , I 'm sure not many people are going to be reading this . But I will say I have successfully used some of these fasteners . They work as expected .
 If you know what grade 316 stainless is and are familiar with its proffered and how to machine it , all I can say its they delivered what was promised without any problems
 The item was to my satisfaction , quick service -LRB- got it within 5 days -RRB- and safely packed . I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in this kind of product .
 It works exactly as you would expect it to once you have purchased the tool , blade guide , blade and roller footplate . This whole package costs $ 400 + , but if you need this level of performance the cost is negligible.The Good : - Tool starts and stops smoothly with minimal vibration.-Smooth and even cutting , with perfectly smooth edges for many different foam types.-Footplate accessory -LRB- sold seprately -RRB- quickly and easily detaches and re-attaches for perfectly perpendicular cuts.The Bad : - Difficult to align the blade guide for attachment.-Cord could be longer-Does not include any blade guides or blades-Cost
 We have used this saw to cut thousands of lineal feet of both 4 & 2 '' foam . never let us down . Still using the first set of blades
 I was looking for a replacement foam cutter for my 15 year old Bosch . Never thought Amazon would be the one to provide it and low and behold they had the best price , best service and the best delivery . My shop was back up and running in two days and I did n't have to leave the office . Bosch foam cutters have proven their longevity.Bosch 1575A Foam Rubber Cutter

 I recently bought this cart from Pro-line via Amazon.com and I am very happy with its overall design and performance . It is large enough to hold six 5-gallon water bottles and the wheels & steering work pretty good , even with a heavy load . My only criticism would be that I thought -LSB- ... -RSB- the assembly instructions needed to include a version in English . Thankfully installing the wheels was n't that difficult . Overall , I 'm glad I purchased this cart . It has made my life a lot easier getting heavy water bottles from my car to my front door in one trip .
 I recently bought the foldable platform truck from Proline to help me with my move and to also use for when I go to Costco and need to move large groceries by myself . This truck is a lifesaver and has made my life soo much easier . I was able to load 5 heavy boxes onto the cart and manuever it easily by myself . Like other reviews say ... there are no instructions on how to put on the wheels . I stuck the stationary wheels in the back and the swiveling wheels in the front . Truck manuevers great . And to fold the handlebar , you step on the bottom bar.I def recommend this product !
 I purchased the foldable platform to help me cart musical equipment efficiently and smoothly . This cart works very well and stores easily . Easy to assemble . Product could use addition of some rings on the push frame and under the platform for attaching bungee cords or straps to securely hold multiple pieces or boxes in place while carting . Still , a good buy at a good price .
 Not much of a review that you can give a cart , but it definitely is what I wanted , a heavy duty cart that easily moves the extra heavy stuff around . I have not tested it for it 's rated weight , but doubt that I would ever put that much on it . It is the same type of cart we use at work for moving computers and funiture . It does it well , no complaints at all .
 This is the best cart I have ever had ! It makes it so easy for me to load and unload . The price was great too ! I was offered the 400 lb rated cart at a higher price than I paid for this one . Excellent Deal ! Thank you .
 While it has seen limited use so far it has met my expectations.Attaching the wheels was straight forward and not a problem.The only reason for the 4 out of 5 stars is that one of the swivel casters does n't quite swivel as freely as it should but I do n't think it will hinder the overall performance.The folding handle seems a little shaky but I will wait until I 've used the cart a few times with a heavy load before I judge that.So far I am very happy with it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a heavy duty hand truck that folds for compact storage at a reasonable price .
 I am a handicapped power wheel chair user who needed a tough and sturdy wheeled cart to move my belongings to a new home address approximately 3/4 miles away from former residence . The trips included multiple crossing of rough streets , bad curb cuts for access to sidewalks and generally uncooperative `` other '' people . After 12 circuits carrying from 150 to 350 lbs one way I am happy to report that the cart got the job done albeit aesthetically in worse shape than it started with . Since looks are not a criteria I care much about I am altogether happy with my purchase . The cart appears able to repeat the next similar task if one should come up .

 Just standard O-rings . They work great for 5-gallon soda kegs used for home brewing . With the 100-pk , I wo n't have to buy more ... ever .
 I really like these instead of the rubber ones I replaced them for . I would do this again since silicone is forever
 This is a perfect replacement O ring for my Thermos Nissan insulated coffee mug . It fit perfectly and provided a tight seal .
 I used this and it worked for my application very good quality and good pricing and also packaging . It 's made well .
 O-rings were top quality , exactly as pictured . Prices are great for only a 10 pack . Exactly what I wanted and expected . What more would you need ?
 The O-rings arrived on time and look good . Amazon has a great selection , far better than any store I could find in town . They are marked in fractional inches , but that size is only approximate . Look in the product description and it will tell you the exact size in thousandths of an inch .
 I purchased these O-rings for replacing the drive belts for a rod dryer -LRB- fishing rods -RRB- . They 're stronger than the originals !
 After purchasing a lower quality product from the local hardware store for about twice the price , I was happy to see Amazon carrying the silicon type of this O-Ring and for a lower price . They are quality products for a great price .
 Looking for a better and cheaper alternative than buying the $ 5 each Omni Heavy Duty whole house filter o-rings ? This is it . The silicone is FDA approved and at $ 5 for 10 pieces !
 I bought these o-rings as a replacement on my Nissan spill proof travel mug . I use this mug all the time . It will keep a cup of freshly made tea or coffee hot for 3-4 hours if left closed , or at the right drinking temperature for a full hour . I tried to find a replacement for the o-ring at the Nissan website but could not . These o-rings are an excellent replacement . The mug closes water tight and works like new . Highly recommended for this application .
 These are very strong little o-rings , with plenty of tensile strength . I read a recent DIY article online about turning certain fountain pens -LRB- Platinum Preppy line -RRB- into eye dropper fountain pens using this size o-ring . I wanted to give it a try , and I must admit it worked like a charm . No leaks , perfect . Search online for `` eye dropper fountain pen '' and `` o-ring '' or perhaps `` make your own '' and you should be able to find it , if you 're interested . Fun , and a good use of the pen and the ink .
 I bought these based on the recommendation of a previous reviewer . The seal on my Nissan 14oz Leakproof Insulated Travel Mug broke when I was washing it , and without the seal , it was n't leakproof . These work great . Thanks , previous reviewer !
 My husband takes a Thermos travel mug of coffee with him every workday , and the o-ring was very stained . I also figured that eventually it would relax and no longer provide a tight , leakproof fit . I thought finding a replacement would be impossible , but , when it looks impossible ... try Amazon ! Found these , which are the exact size as the original . We 're set for a long time , now !
 I lost the original ring to my Nissan Stainless coffee cup , and was looking for a new one on Amazon , when Amazon suggested this o-ring to me . What a good suggestion ! Now my old cup has a new lease on life and I can lose the ring like 9 more times before I have to buy a whole new one : -RRB-
 I got these on a suggestion on an airsoft repair forum . They fit snugly into the fill valves , providing a better outer seal than most factory standard o-rings , and at a far better price than the exact same product when sold somewhere like Evike . The one problem I had was that my bag had 88 in it instead of 100 . I 'm not actually upset , since the price difference between it and other similar products still made this worth it , but a little more accuracy in the numbers would be appreciated.Pros - Great PriceFits snugly in placePlenty for more replacements lateCons - Did n't actually receive 100
 My favorite Nalgene 750ml bottle had turned into a `` dribble '' bottle . This ring is the correct size to fit over the neck and seal against the cap when the cap is screwed on . Not perfect - when you unscrew the cap , a little water that was sitting above the ring will drip . But I 'm not getting dripped on when I drink .
 WOW , researched `` O '' Rings off & online for awhile , almost bought one at another store online , but it was 5 times the price , I thought of amazon and I probably could have done even better , but I am pleased with these.Thank you again , Amazon has not let me down yet !! NO LEAKS!Tim
 excellent price and good delivery . the item will be used to seal pyrex glass tubes used for a solar boiler to create steam .

Beautiful metal I ` am not an expert , but it 's what I was looking for in my project . -LRB- Great Metal -RRB- 3 . I 'm very happy with my project , and would reorder from this supplier again . -LRB- Great Work -RRB-
 My kids were asking why our apartment does n't have its own brass sign outside unlike all the other apartments . We live in San Francisco 's trendy South of Market district , where brass signs have become de rigueur in recent years . Signs with butterflies embossed on them that say `` The Nabokovs . '' Signs with monocles engraved that read `` Peter and Harriet . '' The lot . Yes , I know what it 's like to be a kid and to be ashamed of one 's parents for not providing one 's family with something it seems all the other kids have . And so , when I noticed that they were crying themselves to sleep over this issue , and that in the morning their pillowcases were wet with tears , I resolved to do something about it , so I ordered a few ultra slim 260 H02 sheets of brass from Amazon and decided to make myself a sign for `` The Killians . `` These brass sheets , less than .02 inches thick , are flexible enough for you , or your child , to wrap around a pole , massage into desired thickness , test for bugs , in any dimension you like . My kids wanted to paper the lintel with brass , and I let 'em . Might be hot on summer afternoons , but they 'll learn . In the meantime you can hammer out the font characters you want , plus some amusing design -LRB- we had tulips -RRB- cut to 36 '' x 12 '' so you will have a nice plaque right next to your doorbell . Or should you discover someone famous once lived in your building , and your HOA approves , you could whip up a sign to commemorate the achievement right away . Like we discovered that Samuel Delany and Marilyn Hacker once lived in our building and staged a production of Genet 's THE MAIDS on the three-flight stairwell , so that spectators stood on the street and craned their necks up to see the fun . Blam ! Another brass sign . At this price you 'll be buying brass like there 's no tomorrow .
 After searching the internet for days , this was the best priced product on the market and the quality is great ! Thank you !
 So like I said in the subject title , this is Good Brass . -LRB- eight more words required , eight more words required -RRB-
 This was a reasonable quantity for a specific project -LRB- new latch plates custom-sized for 1920s doors -RRB- . The packing was great , and the product as received was flat .
 Quick shipment . Worked as planned to reinforce a cracked member of the frame of my golf cart.Seem like good folks to deal with .
 I received my order in a timely time and in prefect condition , in spite of its 8-foot lengths . The 6061-T6 aluminum angles were very stiff ; much more so than the 6063 , thus giving me the stiffening that I was looking for on my project . If you need something better than what 's at your local home improvement store then I 'd recommend this product .
 My husband needed this and he is very happy with the purchase . It was exactly what he was looking for .

 This is what you want . Economical and high quality . Works perfectly . Great alternative to the factory or firearms products . 100 rounds test proved perfect performance .
 I ordered these orings to repair my ford 6.9 diesel engine . I used them on the injector leak-off jackets to reseal them . They worked great and were a great deal .
 I had been going through o-rings on our tube filling machine like crazy . I had to replace it once a week or more often . I decided to order this 25 pack since it was so inexpensive . It 's been a month and a half and I have not yet replaced the first one of these . They seem to be extremely durable so far .
 Fast service and product as described . Fits an old Remington 1100 perfectly at a fraction of the cost of Remington replacements . That 's about all - they are just O-rings .
 Used to replace broken o-ring on a Remington 1100 12 gauge . Product fits perfectly and is of very high quality . At this price you basically have a lifetime supply ! Highly recommend !
 I was looking for an o-ring for my Remington 1100 and other places were asking $ 9 for 1 . You get 50 of these for less than that . My great grandkids will still have these o-rings for the gun lol .
 I was having blow back issues with my 12gauge , and all the suggestions pointed to my gas ports , and the O ring . Now that I have replaced it , I need to get out and shoot again . Hopefully this was the fix . The only draw back with this product , is that you receive a &#34; Costco &#34; supply ; more than enough for a lifetime .
 Used this to replace my o ring on my BMW 's DISA valve . O ring is not available from the dealer . Worked perfectly and solved my vacuum leak .
 Fits my Remington 1100 Shotgun perfect ! Replaced my old hard worn out one . I dont think I will ever use all 50 of them , but maybe some friends will need some .
 It is just what you would expect . Works fine , looks like good stuff . I go through a bunch of these on camp fuel stoves and bottles . Viton lasts much longer than NBR .
 I bought this part to use on the fuel pump plate of my bmw r1150r . I think it 's also the same part for 1100 too . It works just as well at fraction of the cost quoted by dealerships
 This seal works for early BMW oil filter stand O-Ring , not available from dealer . Or you end up buying new style housing which is a lot more .
 Just what I needed to fix my pool fill valve . 25 is a lot but now I 'm covered .
 Yes , this is the one you 've been hunting , and yes , my 91 geo 1.0 quit leaking from there . What to do with the extra nine ? Well , I do n't know either , but its hard to beat the price !!!
 Thanks for stocking these O-rings ; I could not find them locally . Just what I needed . Still arrived ahead of a few other items I ordered at the same time from other venders here on Amazon so I changed my review to five stars .
 I 'm always running for o rings for something now I have a stock at home .
 Dunno what to say about an o-ring , but they appear to be well-made , come nicely packaged , etc. .

 Just standard O-rings . They work great for 5-gallon soda kegs used for home brewing . With the 100-pk , I wo n't have to buy more ... ever .
 I really like these instead of the rubber ones I replaced them for . I would do this again since silicone is forever
 This is a perfect replacement O ring for my Thermos Nissan insulated coffee mug . It fit perfectly and provided a tight seal .
 I used this and it worked for my application very good quality and good pricing and also packaging . It 's made well .
 O-rings were top quality , exactly as pictured . Prices are great for only a 10 pack . Exactly what I wanted and expected . What more would you need ?
 The O-rings arrived on time and look good . Amazon has a great selection , far better than any store I could find in town . They are marked in fractional inches , but that size is only approximate . Look in the product description and it will tell you the exact size in thousandths of an inch .
 I purchased these O-rings for replacing the drive belts for a rod dryer -LRB- fishing rods -RRB- . They 're stronger than the originals !
 After purchasing a lower quality product from the local hardware store for about twice the price , I was happy to see Amazon carrying the silicon type of this O-Ring and for a lower price . They are quality products for a great price .
 Looking for a better and cheaper alternative than buying the $ 5 each Omni Heavy Duty whole house filter o-rings ? This is it . The silicone is FDA approved and at $ 5 for 10 pieces !

 I bought these o-rings as a replacement on my Nissan spill proof travel mug . I use this mug all the time . It will keep a cup of freshly made tea or coffee hot for 3-4 hours if left closed , or at the right drinking temperature for a full hour . I tried to find a replacement for the o-ring at the Nissan website but could not . These o-rings are an excellent replacement . The mug closes water tight and works like new . Highly recommended for this application .
 These are very strong little o-rings , with plenty of tensile strength . I read a recent DIY article online about turning certain fountain pens -LRB- Platinum Preppy line -RRB- into eye dropper fountain pens using this size o-ring . I wanted to give it a try , and I must admit it worked like a charm . No leaks , perfect . Search online for `` eye dropper fountain pen '' and `` o-ring '' or perhaps `` make your own '' and you should be able to find it , if you 're interested . Fun , and a good use of the pen and the ink .
 I bought these based on the recommendation of a previous reviewer . The seal on my Nissan 14oz Leakproof Insulated Travel Mug broke when I was washing it , and without the seal , it was n't leakproof . These work great . Thanks , previous reviewer !
 My husband takes a Thermos travel mug of coffee with him every workday , and the o-ring was very stained . I also figured that eventually it would relax and no longer provide a tight , leakproof fit . I thought finding a replacement would be impossible , but , when it looks impossible ... try Amazon ! Found these , which are the exact size as the original . We 're set for a long time , now !
 I lost the original ring to my Nissan Stainless coffee cup , and was looking for a new one on Amazon , when Amazon suggested this o-ring to me . What a good suggestion ! Now my old cup has a new lease on life and I can lose the ring like 9 more times before I have to buy a whole new one : -RRB-
 I got these on a suggestion on an airsoft repair forum . They fit snugly into the fill valves , providing a better outer seal than most factory standard o-rings , and at a far better price than the exact same product when sold somewhere like Evike . The one problem I had was that my bag had 88 in it instead of 100 . I 'm not actually upset , since the price difference between it and other similar products still made this worth it , but a little more accuracy in the numbers would be appreciated.Pros - Great PriceFits snugly in placePlenty for more replacements lateCons - Did n't actually receive 100
 My favorite Nalgene 750ml bottle had turned into a `` dribble '' bottle . This ring is the correct size to fit over the neck and seal against the cap when the cap is screwed on . Not perfect - when you unscrew the cap , a little water that was sitting above the ring will drip . But I 'm not getting dripped on when I drink .
 WOW , researched `` O '' Rings off & online for awhile , almost bought one at another store online , but it was 5 times the price , I thought of amazon and I probably could have done even better , but I am pleased with these.Thank you again , Amazon has not let me down yet !! NO LEAKS!Tim
 excellent price and good delivery . the item will be used to seal pyrex glass tubes used for a solar boiler to create steam .
 The advantage of using brass screws is that they are relatively easy to cut cleanly to length . Either use a screw cutter or thread a nut above the point to cut and cut the screw then unscrew the nut over the cut to straighten the thread area back out.The second advantage of brass is that it is relatively corrosion resistant - it will eventually darken but never rust.Brass is strong enough for most home uses - obviously for automotive or aircraft use stainless steel is required.These are well made brass screws at a reasonable price .
 These are a good deal . They 're adequately strong , and look pretty . Mostly , though , they 're pretty long - I bought these because they cost less than any shorter length , and I can just cut them to size .
 I 've been looking for a good source of brass 2-56 screws and these fit the bill . They certainly cost less than they would in the hobby or hardware store .
 It would have cost twice as much to buy half as many of these locally , I 'm a happy camper . I will certainly buy here again .
 Use them to fasten the HDDs to the computer case I built for my NAS from an old Compaq Deskpro case . The head is compatible with the original tool-less HDD attachment design of the case.Also worked great to fasten HDDs to standard cases
 I 'm not sure quite what to say about these . They work like any other machine screw , and are made very well . The length was correct . They are all brass -LRB- not brass plated -RRB- which is a nice plus .
 The item is just as described . It 's made by Stock Gear Inc. and resold by Small Parts Inc. . The face width is 3/8 inch . The gear I.D. is 5/16 inch . The hub diameter is about 11/16 inch and the hub projects about 3/8 inch beyond the gear on one side only . The hub is plain and must be drilled for a pin or set screw or else press fit to a shaft.I bought 5 of them at 20 cents each . Three days later , they are $ 3.52 each ! Same with many other gears I bought . What 's up with that ?
 I used for building my dog door . I strapped some sheet metal strips around the rod and fastened them to the 1/4 &#34; plexiglass dog door . I can slide the rod in and out to remove the door .
 The 5 metal rods were delivered as specified . They were in excellent condition . They were used in a Science project to test how fast heat travels through different materials.Highly recommended.Ed perez
 This bar is great quality and the price was right . the finish on the bar was better than I expected it to be .
 It 's as advertised and shipped very fast . It 's cold rolled steel . Needed it for a project I was working on and works well .

 No problems really , other than it was n't a Simonds file . It was made in Pakistan or something like that . If you are selling a Simonds file , send a Simonds file ... just what I would think .

 AS MENTIONED BEFORE , THESE ARE BLACK OXIDE SCREWS , NOT STAINLESS AS PICTURED . These are very high quality YFS screws . I 've ordered 1000 's of them and they come exactly as described . Very good value !
 The screws are black -LRB- not silver as pictured -RRB- . The heads are also wider than a normal screw . Otherwise no issues .
 I am turning these into vent liners for my muzzleloader . With new vent liners running $ 2 to $ 3 a piece , it 's a grat bargain to make my own with these screws .
 I used this screw to fix my car door latch when one of the originals fell off . It fit perfectly and held up well over the winter .
 Not some sloppy fit , these screws are rough and tough and coarse threaded . Unless the price is abnormally cheap , as it was when I purchased them , I 'm sure not many people are going to be reading this . But I will say I have successfully used some of these fasteners . They work as expected .
 Just standard O-rings . They work great for 5-gallon soda kegs used for home brewing . With the 100-pk , I wo n't have to buy more ... ever .

 Fast service and product as described . Fits an old Remington 1100 perfectly at a fraction of the cost of Remington replacements . That 's about all - they are just O-rings .
 Used to replace broken o-ring on a Remington 1100 12 gauge . Product fits perfectly and is of very high quality . At this price you basically have a lifetime supply ! Highly recommend !
 I was looking for an o-ring for my Remington 1100 and other places were asking $ 9 for 1 . You get 50 of these for less than that . My great grandkids will still have these o-rings for the gun lol .
 I was having blow back issues with my 12gauge , and all the suggestions pointed to my gas ports , and the O ring . Now that I have replaced it , I need to get out and shoot again . Hopefully this was the fix . The only draw back with this product , is that you receive a &#34; Costco &#34; supply ; more than enough for a lifetime .
 Used this to replace my o ring on my BMW 's DISA valve . O ring is not available from the dealer . Worked perfectly and solved my vacuum leak .
 Fits my Remington 1100 Shotgun perfect ! Replaced my old hard worn out one . I dont think I will ever use all 50 of them , but maybe some friends will need some .
 It is just what you would expect . Works fine , looks like good stuff . I go through a bunch of these on camp fuel stoves and bottles . Viton lasts much longer than NBR .
 I bought this part to use on the fuel pump plate of my bmw r1150r . I think it 's also the same part for 1100 too . It works just as well at fraction of the cost quoted by dealerships
 This seal works for early BMW oil filter stand O-Ring , not available from dealer . Or you end up buying new style housing which is a lot more .
 Just what I needed to fix my pool fill valve . 25 is a lot but now I 'm covered .
 Yes , this is the one you 've been hunting , and yes , my 91 geo 1.0 quit leaking from there . What to do with the extra nine ? Well , I do n't know either , but its hard to beat the price !!!
 Thanks for stocking these O-rings ; I could not find them locally . Just what I needed . Still arrived ahead of a few other items I ordered at the same time from other venders here on Amazon so I changed my review to five stars .
 I 'm always running for o rings for something now I have a stock at home .
 Dunno what to say about an o-ring , but they appear to be well-made , come nicely packaged , etc. .

 This is what you want . Economical and high quality . Works perfectly . Great alternative to the factory or firearms products . 100 rounds test proved perfect performance .
 I ordered these orings to repair my ford 6.9 diesel engine . I used them on the injector leak-off jackets to reseal them . They worked great and were a great deal .

 No problems really , other than it was n't a Simonds file . It was made in Pakistan or something like that . If you are selling a Simonds file , send a Simonds file ... just what I would think .
 I 've used `` come-alongs '' for about 30 years for everything from taking down trees , installing chain link fence , moving sheds and pulling my truck out of the mud , but until about 10 years ago I always borrowed one when I needed it . When I decided to get my own , I was disappointed in the quality that I found available . Light-weight is n't a bad thing , but when I handled the ones available at local stores or the one my Dad got me as a present , I could n't see putting any real stress on them . They 're good for light-duty applications but I have no confidence they would hold up when I really needed them to.Continued research led me to Tuf-Tug , and while it was 3x the cost of what I found in Lowe 's or Home Depot I 'm more than happy to pay the price . What I got was without question heavy-duty . Just holding the handle you 'll be able to feel the difference . The 20 ' cable is twice as long as anything else I found , and there 's a tension spring to keep the cable tight around the wheel assembly . I also like that there 's a lever to engage or disengage the rachet . My old one has a springed tab that has to be held open when you want to move the handle without racheting the cable , but this one has 2 separate positions so it can all be done with one hand . Pulling out the cable is a little bit harder ; you need to anchor the cable and hold open the stop lever . I tried holding open the stop lever and pulling the cable by hand and I was unable to get the wheel to spin . But once anchored , even just by stepping on the swivel hook , the cable pulls out no problem.I also like that nothing is riveted . All parts are mounted with bolts , and a replacement parts list is provided so if anything breaks -LRB- I do n't see how -RRB- , you need to replace the cable or you run over it with a truck you can perform your own repairs/maintenance . And the Tuf-Tug is Made In USA , and does n't appear to have cut any corners to make it competitive with the cheap Made In China ones stocked in the big stores.If you 're just looking for a light-duty cable puller to stretch fencing , then this is over-kill and you should get something cheaper . But if you like buying a tool once and never having to buy another , then I recommend a Tuf-Tug . It 's heavier and more expensive than others on the market , but it feels like a product that wo n't break and will be reliable when it really matters .
 The Tuf-Tug puller is a heavy duty piece of equipment . I used this unit for the purpose of pulling tree stumps out of the ground in my front yard . I cut down twelve juniper trees that were over 20 ft tall with trunk diameters from seven to thirteen inches and one ash tree with a stump about ten inches in diameter.I read other reviews for less expensive units and decided against them . After the fact I am pleased to say that I am glad I made this decision.The idea of using a come-a-long type puller for tree stump removal is a very good one provided you purchase a puller of heavy duty construction because it will require a considerable amount of pull tension just to get the stump to move slightly . And I am referring to a stump that you have cut roots down to about almost two feet below the ground level.I secured one end to a bigger stump -LRB- I used a 5400 lb . rated chain -RRB- and the other to the weaker stump -LRB- I used a 7000 lb . rated nylon tow strap -RRB- that I want to remove , and I cut whatever remaining roots are left with a pick axe that has an axe on one end -- the ones designed for chopping . These other roots are under the stump and you will find them as the stump starts to move from its original position . Use water to soften the dirt . The only thing I may have needed would be a 15 lb . sledge hammer to get the stump to move faster.For safety , I also used 1/2 inch lag bolts -LRB- drill a hole and screw them into the stump -RRB- to secure the chain and strap because when the stump starts to move , you do n't want the strap slipping over the stump as it tilts toward the puller ! Two lag bolts over the strap and one through the chain does the trick . `` Safety First '' as the old saying goes.Five thousand pounds of pull tension is not something you take lightly because it can be a dangerous undertaking in the hands of a person who does not think the hazards through . The handle is designed to bend if the user decides to torque the unit beyond its pull rating , which means that it is designed correctly and with safety in mind.Yet , for the individual serious about doing the somewhat `` big '' job , this tool is made very well and will pull at the rated tension . Tuf-Tug does not over estimate the capabilities of its equipment as some other manufactures may claim . It is made in the USA and is a High Quality Tool and money well spent .
 There are just some items where corners should n't be cut , and come-alongs are one of them . This unit is the best by far I 've ever owned , or used for that matter.It is sooo nice to have 20 ft of cable to take up slack in long lines . By the time you get 75 ft of cable taught with a 6ft puller you 're out of room to pull ! Grrr ... And this is solid , no stamped steel handle here . Definitely know it 's there when you 're carrying it through the woods though ... I no longer have to worry about being stranded in the woods when wheeling or losing a tree logging , and to me that alone is worth the extra money .
 This Tool Make My Life Very Easy To Lift Refrigeration Compressors Up to 20ft No Problem When Lifting Easy to Used .
 A little more expensive than most but it is a superior product . I have burned up several off the shelf models but this one is a beast . It has incredible power . Make sure you eat your Wheaties before handling it as it is no lightweight . Totally worth the money and you will never have to buy another .
 No problems really , other than it was n't a Simonds file . It was made in Pakistan or something like that . If you are selling a Simonds file , send a Simonds file ... just what I would think .
 I bought these o-rings as a replacement on my Nissan spill proof travel mug . I use this mug all the time . It will keep a cup of freshly made tea or coffee hot for 3-4 hours if left closed , or at the right drinking temperature for a full hour . I tried to find a replacement for the o-ring at the Nissan website but could not . These o-rings are an excellent replacement . The mug closes water tight and works like new . Highly recommended for this application .
 These are very strong little o-rings , with plenty of tensile strength . I read a recent DIY article online about turning certain fountain pens -LRB- Platinum Preppy line -RRB- into eye dropper fountain pens using this size o-ring . I wanted to give it a try , and I must admit it worked like a charm . No leaks , perfect . Search online for `` eye dropper fountain pen '' and `` o-ring '' or perhaps `` make your own '' and you should be able to find it , if you 're interested . Fun , and a good use of the pen and the ink .
 I bought these based on the recommendation of a previous reviewer . The seal on my Nissan 14oz Leakproof Insulated Travel Mug broke when I was washing it , and without the seal , it was n't leakproof . These work great . Thanks , previous reviewer !
 My husband takes a Thermos travel mug of coffee with him every workday , and the o-ring was very stained . I also figured that eventually it would relax and no longer provide a tight , leakproof fit . I thought finding a replacement would be impossible , but , when it looks impossible ... try Amazon ! Found these , which are the exact size as the original . We 're set for a long time , now !
 I lost the original ring to my Nissan Stainless coffee cup , and was looking for a new one on Amazon , when Amazon suggested this o-ring to me . What a good suggestion ! Now my old cup has a new lease on life and I can lose the ring like 9 more times before I have to buy a whole new one : -RRB-
 I got these on a suggestion on an airsoft repair forum . They fit snugly into the fill valves , providing a better outer seal than most factory standard o-rings , and at a far better price than the exact same product when sold somewhere like Evike . The one problem I had was that my bag had 88 in it instead of 100 . I 'm not actually upset , since the price difference between it and other similar products still made this worth it , but a little more accuracy in the numbers would be appreciated.Pros - Great PriceFits snugly in placePlenty for more replacements lateCons - Did n't actually receive 100
 My favorite Nalgene 750ml bottle had turned into a `` dribble '' bottle . This ring is the correct size to fit over the neck and seal against the cap when the cap is screwed on . Not perfect - when you unscrew the cap , a little water that was sitting above the ring will drip . But I 'm not getting dripped on when I drink .
 WOW , researched `` O '' Rings off & online for awhile , almost bought one at another store online , but it was 5 times the price , I thought of amazon and I probably could have done even better , but I am pleased with these.Thank you again , Amazon has not let me down yet !! NO LEAKS!Tim
 excellent price and good delivery . the item will be used to seal pyrex glass tubes used for a solar boiler to create steam .
 Just standard O-rings . They work great for 5-gallon soda kegs used for home brewing . With the 100-pk , I wo n't have to buy more ... ever .
 I really like these instead of the rubber ones I replaced them for . I would do this again since silicone is forever
 This is a perfect replacement O ring for my Thermos Nissan insulated coffee mug . It fit perfectly and provided a tight seal .
 I used this and it worked for my application very good quality and good pricing and also packaging . It 's made well .
 O-rings were top quality , exactly as pictured . Prices are great for only a 10 pack . Exactly what I wanted and expected . What more would you need ?
 The O-rings arrived on time and look good . Amazon has a great selection , far better than any store I could find in town . They are marked in fractional inches , but that size is only approximate . Look in the product description and it will tell you the exact size in thousandths of an inch .
 I purchased these O-rings for replacing the drive belts for a rod dryer -LRB- fishing rods -RRB- . They 're stronger than the originals !
 After purchasing a lower quality product from the local hardware store for about twice the price , I was happy to see Amazon carrying the silicon type of this O-Ring and for a lower price . They are quality products for a great price .
 Looking for a better and cheaper alternative than buying the $ 5 each Omni Heavy Duty whole house filter o-rings ? This is it . The silicone is FDA approved and at $ 5 for 10 pieces !

 Fast shipping , was a great price but they have increased in price over 100 % . Good quality in these `` O '' rings though the bags are always short by 1-3 rings making it a question of why at this price . I got these for a specific purpose and they have gained some popularity for the specialized application I offer . Have bought 6 reorders at this point .
 I 'm always running for o rings for something now I have a stock at home .
 Given the product 's very simple design and construction it is no surprise that it arrived in exactly the form that I was expecting . Delivery time was good , too .
 It 's an O-Ring . It was round . It worked . -LRB- Why am I writing a review on this ... -RRB-
 Great quality , but I took away a star because it did n't fit my peanut lighter . I realize that 's not the product 's fault . It 's just frustrating that it 's difficult to buy exactly the correct size when you start dealing with small devices with little room for error . I probably would give it 5 stars if it fit like I expected it would .
 Ordered to try as replacement ball mill belt . Outlasts the `` official '' belt by 10X and at 7 cents apiece versus $ 6 . Need ball mill belts ? Can not go wrong with this one ! Works with the very popular 3 # and 6 # dual drum mill .
 The wide variety of ring sizes available allowed me to pick the precise ring for my unusual application . I used the o-rings to replace the drive belts on an old movie projector
 I 'm using these for a mixed-media art project . They 're VERY durable -LRB- tried to break one by stretching it , and it WO N'T break -RRB- , and the dimensions are exactly as described . Thanks ! ~ G
 THIS PRODUCT WAS EXACTLY AS I EXPECTED , I AM FAMILIAR WITH THESE ITEMS , I USE THEM IN SPECIAL APPLICATIONS IN MY HOBBIES
 Purchased to use as the Gasket for my Espresso machine . Works well . I bought the ten pack , which cost less than one of the Manufacturer 's Gaskets for the espresso machine .
 There 's not much to say about o rings , unless they do n't work . However , these are just fine . They appear to be well made and true to size . If you need them , buy them without worry .
 The o-rings are as described so what 's not to like . The price is reasonable and they arrived within a week . I 'll try this source again when looking for small parts .
 The product worked great and saved money compared buying from the dealer of the device it was used in.I expected only one and got a pack for less than two dollars . Since this is a replacable part I will be able to use the extras in the future .
 I use these in making paint thickness gauges . The price is great , quality is very good ; does exactly what it should ! I will be buying these again !
 This was a perfect size for what I needed and just as you would expect an O-Ring to be !!! I used it as a drive belt .
 These are very high quality YFS screws . I 've ordered 1000 's of them and they come exactly as described . Very good value !
 The screws arrived on time and work well - just as advertised . We use them in a robotics class and the students often lose them or use too many . These replacements were an excellent buy , a lot less than those locally available . We do n't have anything like a `` mission critical '' application , more a simple classroom/hobbyist situation . They fit the bill fine .
 Arrived on schedule and did the job . We use a lot of these and are very pleased with the result & the product .
 Heavy , rugged , precision hardware , and priced better than I could find anywhere else . A true bargain .

 This is what you want . Economical and high quality . Works perfectly . Great alternative to the factory or firearms products . 100 rounds test proved perfect performance .
 I ordered these orings to repair my ford 6.9 diesel engine . I used them on the injector leak-off jackets to reseal them . They worked great and were a great deal .
 I had been going through o-rings on our tube filling machine like crazy . I had to replace it once a week or more often . I decided to order this 25 pack since it was so inexpensive . It 's been a month and a half and I have not yet replaced the first one of these . They seem to be extremely durable so far .
 Fast service and product as described . Fits an old Remington 1100 perfectly at a fraction of the cost of Remington replacements . That 's about all - they are just O-rings .
 Used to replace broken o-ring on a Remington 1100 12 gauge . Product fits perfectly and is of very high quality . At this price you basically have a lifetime supply ! Highly recommend !
 I was looking for an o-ring for my Remington 1100 and other places were asking $ 9 for 1 . You get 50 of these for less than that . My great grandkids will still have these o-rings for the gun lol .
 I was having blow back issues with my 12gauge , and all the suggestions pointed to my gas ports , and the O ring . Now that I have replaced it , I need to get out and shoot again . Hopefully this was the fix . The only draw back with this product , is that you receive a &#34; Costco &#34; supply ; more than enough for a lifetime .
 Used this to replace my o ring on my BMW 's DISA valve . O ring is not available from the dealer . Worked perfectly and solved my vacuum leak .
 Just standard O-rings . They work great for 5-gallon soda kegs used for home brewing . With the 100-pk , I wo n't have to buy more ... ever .
 I really like these instead of the rubber ones I replaced them for . I would do this again since silicone is forever
 This is a perfect replacement O ring for my Thermos Nissan insulated coffee mug . It fit perfectly and provided a tight seal .
 I used this and it worked for my application very good quality and good pricing and also packaging . It 's made well .
 O-rings were top quality , exactly as pictured . Prices are great for only a 10 pack . Exactly what I wanted and expected . What more would you need ?
 The O-rings arrived on time and look good . Amazon has a great selection , far better than any store I could find in town . They are marked in fractional inches , but that size is only approximate . Look in the product description and it will tell you the exact size in thousandths of an inch .
 I purchased these O-rings for replacing the drive belts for a rod dryer -LRB- fishing rods -RRB- . They 're stronger than the originals !
 After purchasing a lower quality product from the local hardware store for about twice the price , I was happy to see Amazon carrying the silicon type of this O-Ring and for a lower price . They are quality products for a great price .
 Looking for a better and cheaper alternative than buying the $ 5 each Omni Heavy Duty whole house filter o-rings ? This is it . The silicone is FDA approved and at $ 5 for 10 pieces !

 I bought these o-rings as a replacement on my Nissan spill proof travel mug . I use this mug all the time . It will keep a cup of freshly made tea or coffee hot for 3-4 hours if left closed , or at the right drinking temperature for a full hour . I tried to find a replacement for the o-ring at the Nissan website but could not . These o-rings are an excellent replacement . The mug closes water tight and works like new . Highly recommended for this application .
 These are very strong little o-rings , with plenty of tensile strength . I read a recent DIY article online about turning certain fountain pens -LRB- Platinum Preppy line -RRB- into eye dropper fountain pens using this size o-ring . I wanted to give it a try , and I must admit it worked like a charm . No leaks , perfect . Search online for `` eye dropper fountain pen '' and `` o-ring '' or perhaps `` make your own '' and you should be able to find it , if you 're interested . Fun , and a good use of the pen and the ink .
 I bought these based on the recommendation of a previous reviewer . The seal on my Nissan 14oz Leakproof Insulated Travel Mug broke when I was washing it , and without the seal , it was n't leakproof . These work great . Thanks , previous reviewer !
 My husband takes a Thermos travel mug of coffee with him every workday , and the o-ring was very stained . I also figured that eventually it would relax and no longer provide a tight , leakproof fit . I thought finding a replacement would be impossible , but , when it looks impossible ... try Amazon ! Found these , which are the exact size as the original . We 're set for a long time , now !
 I lost the original ring to my Nissan Stainless coffee cup , and was looking for a new one on Amazon , when Amazon suggested this o-ring to me . What a good suggestion ! Now my old cup has a new lease on life and I can lose the ring like 9 more times before I have to buy a whole new one : -RRB-
 I got these on a suggestion on an airsoft repair forum . They fit snugly into the fill valves , providing a better outer seal than most factory standard o-rings , and at a far better price than the exact same product when sold somewhere like Evike . The one problem I had was that my bag had 88 in it instead of 100 . I 'm not actually upset , since the price difference between it and other similar products still made this worth it , but a little more accuracy in the numbers would be appreciated.Pros - Great PriceFits snugly in placePlenty for more replacements lateCons - Did n't actually receive 100
 My favorite Nalgene 750ml bottle had turned into a `` dribble '' bottle . This ring is the correct size to fit over the neck and seal against the cap when the cap is screwed on . Not perfect - when you unscrew the cap , a little water that was sitting above the ring will drip . But I 'm not getting dripped on when I drink .
 WOW , researched `` O '' Rings off & online for awhile , almost bought one at another store online , but it was 5 times the price , I thought of amazon and I probably could have done even better , but I am pleased with these.Thank you again , Amazon has not let me down yet !! NO LEAKS!Tim
 excellent price and good delivery . the item will be used to seal pyrex glass tubes used for a solar boiler to create steam .
 Excellent stripe tape for car . Vivid color and very easy to install with no akward paper backing to fiddle with . Just roll the tape on for great pin striping both inside and outside car . Holds well with the quality 3M self-adhesive backing . Great value , too !
 No problems really , other than it was n't a Simonds file . It was made in Pakistan or something like that . If you are selling a Simonds file , send a Simonds file ... just what I would think .
 AS MENTIONED BEFORE , THESE ARE BLACK OXIDE SCREWS , NOT STAINLESS AS PICTURED . These are very high quality YFS screws . I 've ordered 1000 's of them and they come exactly as described . Very good value !
 The screws are black -LRB- not silver as pictured -RRB- . The heads are also wider than a normal screw . Otherwise no issues .
 I am turning these into vent liners for my muzzleloader . With new vent liners running $ 2 to $ 3 a piece , it 's a grat bargain to make my own with these screws .
 I used this screw to fix my car door latch when one of the originals fell off . It fit perfectly and held up well over the winter .
 Not some sloppy fit , these screws are rough and tough and coarse threaded . Unless the price is abnormally cheap , as it was when I purchased them , I 'm sure not many people are going to be reading this . But I will say I have successfully used some of these fasteners . They work as expected .
 What can I say about a brass screw except it meets SAE specs and is a nice brass screw . Yep
 I needed something 1/4-20 and brass to make a 3d printer extrusion nozzle , i only needed a couple about 1inch long but these were actually cheaper and im cutting the heads off anyway so i got the 3 1/2 inchers.not really a whole lot to say other than they are 1/4-20 as described and they are brass , im sure you could polish them up if you wanted something decorative , that 's probably what ill end up doing with the extras next time i need to attach some hinges and have them look nice .

 Fits my Remington 1100 Shotgun perfect ! Replaced my old hard worn out one . I dont think I will ever use all 50 of them , but maybe some friends will need some .
 It is just what you would expect . Works fine , looks like good stuff . I go through a bunch of these on camp fuel stoves and bottles . Viton lasts much longer than NBR .
 I bought this part to use on the fuel pump plate of my bmw r1150r . I think it 's also the same part for 1100 too . It works just as well at fraction of the cost quoted by dealerships
 This seal works for early BMW oil filter stand O-Ring , not available from dealer . Or you end up buying new style housing which is a lot more .
 Just what I needed to fix my pool fill valve . 25 is a lot but now I 'm covered .
 Yes , this is the one you 've been hunting , and yes , my 91 geo 1.0 quit leaking from there . What to do with the extra nine ? Well , I do n't know either , but its hard to beat the price !!!
 Thanks for stocking these O-rings ; I could not find them locally . Just what I needed . Still arrived ahead of a few other items I ordered at the same time from other venders here on Amazon so I changed my review to five stars .
 I 'm always running for o rings for something now I have a stock at home .

 shipping was great , seller was great , im sure the product is excellent , but the info online concerning size for bike fender bolts was wrong for my bike , not a universal size ,
 The advantage of using brass screws is that they are relatively easy to cut cleanly to length . Either use a screw cutter or thread a nut above the point to cut and cut the screw then unscrew the nut over the cut to straighten the thread area back out.The second advantage of brass is that it is relatively corrosion resistant - it will eventually darken but never rust.Brass is strong enough for most home uses - obviously for automotive or aircraft use stainless steel is required.These are well made brass screws at a reasonable price .
 These are a good deal . They 're adequately strong , and look pretty . Mostly , though , they 're pretty long - I bought these because they cost less than any shorter length , and I can just cut them to size .
 I 've been looking for a good source of brass 2-56 screws and these fit the bill . They certainly cost less than they would in the hobby or hardware store .
 It would have cost twice as much to buy half as many of these locally , I 'm a happy camper . I will certainly buy here again .
 Use them to fasten the HDDs to the computer case I built for my NAS from an old Compaq Deskpro case . The head is compatible with the original tool-less HDD attachment design of the case.Also worked great to fasten HDDs to standard cases
 I 'm not sure quite what to say about these . They work like any other machine screw , and are made very well . The length was correct . They are all brass -LRB- not brass plated -RRB- which is a nice plus .
 Makes for a nice clean installation . Can be easily plugged in and removed from the On-Q box .

 Fast shipping , was a great price but they have increased in price over 100 % . Good quality in these `` O '' rings though the bags are always short by 1-3 rings making it a question of why at this price . I got these for a specific purpose and they have gained some popularity for the specialized application I offer . Have bought 6 reorders at this point .
 I 'm always running for o rings for something now I have a stock at home .
 Given the product 's very simple design and construction it is no surprise that it arrived in exactly the form that I was expecting . Delivery time was good , too .
 It 's an O-Ring . It was round . It worked . -LRB- Why am I writing a review on this ... -RRB-
 Great quality , but I took away a star because it did n't fit my peanut lighter . I realize that 's not the product 's fault . It 's just frustrating that it 's difficult to buy exactly the correct size when you start dealing with small devices with little room for error . I probably would give it 5 stars if it fit like I expected it would .
 Ordered to try as replacement ball mill belt . Outlasts the `` official '' belt by 10X and at 7 cents apiece versus $ 6 . Need ball mill belts ? Can not go wrong with this one ! Works with the very popular 3 # and 6 # dual drum mill .
 The wide variety of ring sizes available allowed me to pick the precise ring for my unusual application . I used the o-rings to replace the drive belts on an old movie projector
 I 'm using these for a mixed-media art project . They 're VERY durable -LRB- tried to break one by stretching it , and it WO N'T break -RRB- , and the dimensions are exactly as described . Thanks ! ~ G
 THIS PRODUCT WAS EXACTLY AS I EXPECTED , I AM FAMILIAR WITH THESE ITEMS , I USE THEM IN SPECIAL APPLICATIONS IN MY HOBBIES
 Purchased to use as the Gasket for my Espresso machine . Works well . I bought the ten pack , which cost less than one of the Manufacturer 's Gaskets for the espresso machine .
 There 's not much to say about o rings , unless they do n't work . However , these are just fine . They appear to be well made and true to size . If you need them , buy them without worry .
 The o-rings are as described so what 's not to like . The price is reasonable and they arrived within a week . I 'll try this source again when looking for small parts .
 The product worked great and saved money compared buying from the dealer of the device it was used in.I expected only one and got a pack for less than two dollars . Since this is a replacable part I will be able to use the extras in the future .
 I use these in making paint thickness gauges . The price is great , quality is very good ; does exactly what it should ! I will be buying these again !
 This was a perfect size for what I needed and just as you would expect an O-Ring to be !!! I used it as a drive belt .
 I bought this as a door weight for the bottom of my dog door , but it was too heavy so I gave it to my mechanic friend . He was delighted to get it . It 's a handy piece of steel to have around , but I do n't have a torch or a welder .

 These are a good deal . They 're adequately strong , and look pretty . Mostly , though , they 're pretty long - I bought these because they cost less than any shorter length , and I can just cut them to size .
 I 've been looking for a good source of brass 2-56 screws and these fit the bill . They certainly cost less than they would in the hobby or hardware store .
 It would have cost twice as much to buy half as many of these locally , I 'm a happy camper . I will certainly buy here again .
 Use them to fasten the HDDs to the computer case I built for my NAS from an old Compaq Deskpro case . The head is compatible with the original tool-less HDD attachment design of the case.Also worked great to fasten HDDs to standard cases
 I 'm not sure quite what to say about these . They work like any other machine screw , and are made very well . The length was correct . They are all brass -LRB- not brass plated -RRB- which is a nice plus .
 What can I say about a brass screw except it meets SAE specs and is a nice brass screw . Yep
 I needed something 1/4-20 and brass to make a 3d printer extrusion nozzle , i only needed a couple about 1inch long but these were actually cheaper and im cutting the heads off anyway so i got the 3 1/2 inchers.not really a whole lot to say other than they are 1/4-20 as described and they are brass , im sure you could polish them up if you wanted something decorative , that 's probably what ill end up doing with the extras next time i need to attach some hinges and have them look nice .
 If you have n't used a Multi-Kut or Nucut file yet then you 're really missing out . These files cut FAST , as fast as a bastard file and yet leave a smooth finish . This is the first file I reach for when I want to shape and refine steel .
 Excellent stripe tape for car . Vivid color and very easy to install with no akward paper backing to fiddle with . Just roll the tape on for great pin striping both inside and outside car . Holds well with the quality 3M self-adhesive backing . Great value , too !
 Just standard O-rings . They work great for 5-gallon soda kegs used for home brewing . With the 100-pk , I wo n't have to buy more ... ever .
 I really like these instead of the rubber ones I replaced them for . I would do this again since silicone is forever
 This is a perfect replacement O ring for my Thermos Nissan insulated coffee mug . It fit perfectly and provided a tight seal .
 I used this and it worked for my application very good quality and good pricing and also packaging . It 's made well .
 O-rings were top quality , exactly as pictured . Prices are great for only a 10 pack . Exactly what I wanted and expected . What more would you need ?
 The O-rings arrived on time and look good . Amazon has a great selection , far better than any store I could find in town . They are marked in fractional inches , but that size is only approximate . Look in the product description and it will tell you the exact size in thousandths of an inch .
 I purchased these O-rings for replacing the drive belts for a rod dryer -LRB- fishing rods -RRB- . They 're stronger than the originals !
 After purchasing a lower quality product from the local hardware store for about twice the price , I was happy to see Amazon carrying the silicon type of this O-Ring and for a lower price . They are quality products for a great price .
 Looking for a better and cheaper alternative than buying the $ 5 each Omni Heavy Duty whole house filter o-rings ? This is it . The silicone is FDA approved and at $ 5 for 10 pieces !

 I bought these o-rings as a replacement on my Nissan spill proof travel mug . I use this mug all the time . It will keep a cup of freshly made tea or coffee hot for 3-4 hours if left closed , or at the right drinking temperature for a full hour . I tried to find a replacement for the o-ring at the Nissan website but could not . These o-rings are an excellent replacement . The mug closes water tight and works like new . Highly recommended for this application .
 These are very strong little o-rings , with plenty of tensile strength . I read a recent DIY article online about turning certain fountain pens -LRB- Platinum Preppy line -RRB- into eye dropper fountain pens using this size o-ring . I wanted to give it a try , and I must admit it worked like a charm . No leaks , perfect . Search online for `` eye dropper fountain pen '' and `` o-ring '' or perhaps `` make your own '' and you should be able to find it , if you 're interested . Fun , and a good use of the pen and the ink .
 I bought these based on the recommendation of a previous reviewer . The seal on my Nissan 14oz Leakproof Insulated Travel Mug broke when I was washing it , and without the seal , it was n't leakproof . These work great . Thanks , previous reviewer !
 My husband takes a Thermos travel mug of coffee with him every workday , and the o-ring was very stained . I also figured that eventually it would relax and no longer provide a tight , leakproof fit . I thought finding a replacement would be impossible , but , when it looks impossible ... try Amazon ! Found these , which are the exact size as the original . We 're set for a long time , now !
 I lost the original ring to my Nissan Stainless coffee cup , and was looking for a new one on Amazon , when Amazon suggested this o-ring to me . What a good suggestion ! Now my old cup has a new lease on life and I can lose the ring like 9 more times before I have to buy a whole new one : -RRB-
 I got these on a suggestion on an airsoft repair forum . They fit snugly into the fill valves , providing a better outer seal than most factory standard o-rings , and at a far better price than the exact same product when sold somewhere like Evike . The one problem I had was that my bag had 88 in it instead of 100 . I 'm not actually upset , since the price difference between it and other similar products still made this worth it , but a little more accuracy in the numbers would be appreciated.Pros - Great PriceFits snugly in placePlenty for more replacements lateCons - Did n't actually receive 100
 My favorite Nalgene 750ml bottle had turned into a `` dribble '' bottle . This ring is the correct size to fit over the neck and seal against the cap when the cap is screwed on . Not perfect - when you unscrew the cap , a little water that was sitting above the ring will drip . But I 'm not getting dripped on when I drink .
 WOW , researched `` O '' Rings off & online for awhile , almost bought one at another store online , but it was 5 times the price , I thought of amazon and I probably could have done even better , but I am pleased with these.Thank you again , Amazon has not let me down yet !! NO LEAKS!Tim
 excellent price and good delivery . the item will be used to seal pyrex glass tubes used for a solar boiler to create steam .

 I had been going through o-rings on our tube filling machine like crazy . I had to replace it once a week or more often . I decided to order this 25 pack since it was so inexpensive . It 's been a month and a half and I have not yet replaced the first one of these . They seem to be extremely durable so far .
 Fast service and product as described . Fits an old Remington 1100 perfectly at a fraction of the cost of Remington replacements . That 's about all - they are just O-rings .
 Used to replace broken o-ring on a Remington 1100 12 gauge . Product fits perfectly and is of very high quality . At this price you basically have a lifetime supply ! Highly recommend !
 I was looking for an o-ring for my Remington 1100 and other places were asking $ 9 for 1 . You get 50 of these for less than that . My great grandkids will still have these o-rings for the gun lol .
 I was having blow back issues with my 12gauge , and all the suggestions pointed to my gas ports , and the O ring . Now that I have replaced it , I need to get out and shoot again . Hopefully this was the fix . The only draw back with this product , is that you receive a &#34; Costco &#34; supply ; more than enough for a lifetime .
 Used this to replace my o ring on my BMW 's DISA valve . O ring is not available from the dealer . Worked perfectly and solved my vacuum leak .

 Fits my Remington 1100 Shotgun perfect ! Replaced my old hard worn out one . I dont think I will ever use all 50 of them , but maybe some friends will need some .
 It is just what you would expect . Works fine , looks like good stuff . I go through a bunch of these on camp fuel stoves and bottles . Viton lasts much longer than NBR .
 I bought this part to use on the fuel pump plate of my bmw r1150r . I think it 's also the same part for 1100 too . It works just as well at fraction of the cost quoted by dealerships
 This seal works for early BMW oil filter stand O-Ring , not available from dealer . Or you end up buying new style housing which is a lot more .
 Just what I needed to fix my pool fill valve . 25 is a lot but now I 'm covered .
 Yes , this is the one you 've been hunting , and yes , my 91 geo 1.0 quit leaking from there . What to do with the extra nine ? Well , I do n't know either , but its hard to beat the price !!!
 Thanks for stocking these O-rings ; I could not find them locally . Just what I needed . Still arrived ahead of a few other items I ordered at the same time from other venders here on Amazon so I changed my review to five stars .

 Great set , only comes with 1 quick change head but that 's all you need anyways . Other drill bits pop in and out quickly and smoothly , no more twisting and tightening the drill bits to my drill . Used it to help build a fence in which I used wood screws . Made things so much faster especially when putting together wood with large screws that required many pilot holes first , saves a great deal of time switching back and forth from a phillips head and a drill bit . This would be a great gift to someone who works with a drill often as well as someone who needs more drill bits . I would rate this as one of the best purchases I 've ever made for around $ 25 , and am very glad that I 've made that investment as it has saved me a great deal of time and agony .
 I was n't looking for an amazing set of bits for constant use . Rather , I wanted a nice variety of bits that would get used occasionally . And for that , this is perfect .
 got this 3 months ago and never had a problem with it . All bits work great and use it for home repair and wood work .
 The drill bits are titanium coated high speed steel -LRB- HSS -RRB- . That 's the best part about this set but the titanium coating is very thin and will wear off the first time you drill through metal , also they snap very easily and look like carbon in the middle of the drill bit , instead of solid stainless steel appearance that high -LRB- more expensive -RRB- bits look like . The spade bits are fairly standard quality as are the bits , like dewalt/milwaukee low-cost sets . When using my impact drill in a torx head screw the bit was torqued in a clockwise direction after about 20 screws . It still works fine , but it 's noticeably deformed . The hammer drill bits are like vermont american quality . . the cheap vandium-chrome looking bits.Milwaukee shockwave fastener bits are superior in durability when using an impact drill , and sets of titanium coated dewalt twist bits are far superior to the drill bits in this kit . They are also about $ 1 per drill bit . And of course Bosch , Hilti and Milwaukee make the best masonry bits , the ones that you can drill through rocks with and one bit costs as much as this whole kit.For the price I paid , $ 15 - $ 20 , I 'm happy . There are are a lot of different bits in here for metal , wood , concrete , and fastening applications , and it 's good to have some bits you do n't care about snapping , rusting , or just trashing in general .
 The Hitachi 728704 quick change drill/drive set was delivered promptly from Amazon . The 71 piece set comes in a handy compact case . I have used the set several times since purchase . I have found the Hitachi set to be of good quality and worth the purchase price.Hitachi 728704 Quick Change 71-Piece Drilling and Driving Set
 Great drill . very powerful and compact . I have used it several times since purchase the initial charge is fine , I would probably recommend purchasing a second battery too .
 Kit has a nice selection of assorted drivers and drills . Comes in a very nice little accordian type case . I was a little disappointed that some of the drill bits have round shanks instead of hex shanks for my screw gun . Guess I 'll get a chuck adapter for those .
 It 's a good general set . Has most of the stuff you will need for any job and it 's comes in a easy to carry case .
 Hitachi drill that was previously purchased with these drill bits are the best . My husband is very happy with both products .
 Bought this to help us build a swing set . Everything we needed was in it . Love it !
 This `` kit '' is complete and its quality is excellent!If you need a quality drive set then this is the one to buy . Everything you need , and more , can be found in its convenient plastic case.I have been very pleased with all my Hitachi products and will continue to buy their well-built tools . If you are looking for quality tools and a quality drive set - do n't hesitate to buy this product because you wo n't be disappointed .
 this is a great little set of bits to carry around . The drill bits are pretty ordinary , but the various driver bits offer a good selection and are good quality .
 Does what it says . Sturdy and dependable - I got these mainly because I have a Hitachi lith-batt drill and want everything to match . There are of course cheaper solutions that will likely do the job , but I like there tools .
 A good quick-change drill and driver set . Makes drilling/driving tasks go much quicker , particularly when you need to change bits often . Drill bits are quite sharp and the driver bits seem to be made of semi-decent material that wont burr or wear away after driving a dozen screws . The quick change holder bit is also good quality .
 This handy little kit is great for replacing a lot of bulky tools used for light duty work .
 This item has everything you need for the job site or home use , in a compact carry around kit .
 I bought this set for taking with me when I do n't want to bring my entire set of tools with me . It works great , has most the common sizes and bits that I use the most , and comes in a sturdy compact case that I can leave in my truck or throw in a drawer in the garage . The dill bits have stayed sharp through a decent amount of use . The drivers seem to be made out of quality metal as they have not worn at all . The quick change system is also way better than Craftsman or Dewalt , as the mechanism does not accidentally release . I would recommend this set to anyone , and for the low price , it is hard to beat .
 Real nice set . lots of different bits and attachments . The drill bits break if you drop them . 4 stars due to quick change drill bit . would be nice if they made it so you could replace bits easily .
 Got this set , since it was such a good price . I 've used a couple of the bits off and on for home projects and they work great . I 've only used for wood , so ca n't comment if your trying to use them for other materials . The case is solid , locks shut , and securely holds all the bits in there right place .
 I bought this set as an accessory to the Hitachi hammer drill . I have n't used any of the pieces yet so I ca n't really comment on the quality . However , there are plenty of bits for any task and you will avoid an extra trip to the hardware store to find a bit that will work with the Hitachi hammer drill/driver . I gave four stars based on the convenience of the set .
 have n't used it much yet , but looks like a good mix of bits and drills .
 Just standard O-rings . They work great for 5-gallon soda kegs used for home brewing . With the 100-pk , I wo n't have to buy more ... ever .

 I had been going through o-rings on our tube filling machine like crazy . I had to replace it once a week or more often . I decided to order this 25 pack since it was so inexpensive . It 's been a month and a half and I have not yet replaced the first one of these . They seem to be extremely durable so far .
 Fast service and product as described . Fits an old Remington 1100 perfectly at a fraction of the cost of Remington replacements . That 's about all - they are just O-rings .
 Used to replace broken o-ring on a Remington 1100 12 gauge . Product fits perfectly and is of very high quality . At this price you basically have a lifetime supply ! Highly recommend !
 I was looking for an o-ring for my Remington 1100 and other places were asking $ 9 for 1 . You get 50 of these for less than that . My great grandkids will still have these o-rings for the gun lol .
 I was having blow back issues with my 12gauge , and all the suggestions pointed to my gas ports , and the O ring . Now that I have replaced it , I need to get out and shoot again . Hopefully this was the fix . The only draw back with this product , is that you receive a &#34; Costco &#34; supply ; more than enough for a lifetime .
 Used this to replace my o ring on my BMW 's DISA valve . O ring is not available from the dealer . Worked perfectly and solved my vacuum leak .
 Nice but kina expensive as most of Flukes stuff is . I am using these with the 224 leads . They are kinda long with the leads attached so I dismantle them before storing them with my meter .
 As expected from fluke the probes were of great quality and connect great with standard cables that came with my 179 kit .

 Fits my Remington 1100 Shotgun perfect ! Replaced my old hard worn out one . I dont think I will ever use all 50 of them , but maybe some friends will need some .
 It is just what you would expect . Works fine , looks like good stuff . I go through a bunch of these on camp fuel stoves and bottles . Viton lasts much longer than NBR .
 I bought this part to use on the fuel pump plate of my bmw r1150r . I think it 's also the same part for 1100 too . It works just as well at fraction of the cost quoted by dealerships
 This seal works for early BMW oil filter stand O-Ring , not available from dealer . Or you end up buying new style housing which is a lot more .
 Just what I needed to fix my pool fill valve . 25 is a lot but now I 'm covered .
 Yes , this is the one you 've been hunting , and yes , my 91 geo 1.0 quit leaking from there . What to do with the extra nine ? Well , I do n't know either , but its hard to beat the price !!!
 Thanks for stocking these O-rings ; I could not find them locally . Just what I needed . Still arrived ahead of a few other items I ordered at the same time from other venders here on Amazon so I changed my review to five stars .
 I 'm always running for o rings for something now I have a stock at home .

 I needed a small 7/8 &#34; diameter 12 &#34; long piece . This was a great way for me to not have to purchase a full length piece locally that I would not of used most of . Fast shipping .
 This is exactly what I needed and the item was shipped quickly and packed very well . I would definitely recommend it .
 This material has good machining characteristics . Easily drilled , cut , milled or turned in a lathe . 6061 aluminum can be welded as well .
 This product met my expectations when it arrived . Its straight , solid , and will make a perfect cooling rod for my muzzleloader .
 A solid choice , excellent depth , smooth finish . Hints of Manganese and Copper . I 'd give it 98 points of Aluminum . Fully aged , ready to go today !

 Just standard O-rings . They work great for 5-gallon soda kegs used for home brewing . With the 100-pk , I wo n't have to buy more ... ever .
 I really like these instead of the rubber ones I replaced them for . I would do this again since silicone is forever
 This is a perfect replacement O ring for my Thermos Nissan insulated coffee mug . It fit perfectly and provided a tight seal .
 I used this and it worked for my application very good quality and good pricing and also packaging . It 's made well .
 O-rings were top quality , exactly as pictured . Prices are great for only a 10 pack . Exactly what I wanted and expected . What more would you need ?
 The O-rings arrived on time and look good . Amazon has a great selection , far better than any store I could find in town . They are marked in fractional inches , but that size is only approximate . Look in the product description and it will tell you the exact size in thousandths of an inch .
 I purchased these O-rings for replacing the drive belts for a rod dryer -LRB- fishing rods -RRB- . They 're stronger than the originals !
 After purchasing a lower quality product from the local hardware store for about twice the price , I was happy to see Amazon carrying the silicon type of this O-Ring and for a lower price . They are quality products for a great price .
 Looking for a better and cheaper alternative than buying the $ 5 each Omni Heavy Duty whole house filter o-rings ? This is it . The silicone is FDA approved and at $ 5 for 10 pieces !
 I bought these o-rings as a replacement on my Nissan spill proof travel mug . I use this mug all the time . It will keep a cup of freshly made tea or coffee hot for 3-4 hours if left closed , or at the right drinking temperature for a full hour . I tried to find a replacement for the o-ring at the Nissan website but could not . These o-rings are an excellent replacement . The mug closes water tight and works like new . Highly recommended for this application .
 These are very strong little o-rings , with plenty of tensile strength . I read a recent DIY article online about turning certain fountain pens -LRB- Platinum Preppy line -RRB- into eye dropper fountain pens using this size o-ring . I wanted to give it a try , and I must admit it worked like a charm . No leaks , perfect . Search online for `` eye dropper fountain pen '' and `` o-ring '' or perhaps `` make your own '' and you should be able to find it , if you 're interested . Fun , and a good use of the pen and the ink .
 I bought these based on the recommendation of a previous reviewer . The seal on my Nissan 14oz Leakproof Insulated Travel Mug broke when I was washing it , and without the seal , it was n't leakproof . These work great . Thanks , previous reviewer !
 My husband takes a Thermos travel mug of coffee with him every workday , and the o-ring was very stained . I also figured that eventually it would relax and no longer provide a tight , leakproof fit . I thought finding a replacement would be impossible , but , when it looks impossible ... try Amazon ! Found these , which are the exact size as the original . We 're set for a long time , now !
 I lost the original ring to my Nissan Stainless coffee cup , and was looking for a new one on Amazon , when Amazon suggested this o-ring to me . What a good suggestion ! Now my old cup has a new lease on life and I can lose the ring like 9 more times before I have to buy a whole new one : -RRB-
 I got these on a suggestion on an airsoft repair forum . They fit snugly into the fill valves , providing a better outer seal than most factory standard o-rings , and at a far better price than the exact same product when sold somewhere like Evike . The one problem I had was that my bag had 88 in it instead of 100 . I 'm not actually upset , since the price difference between it and other similar products still made this worth it , but a little more accuracy in the numbers would be appreciated.Pros - Great PriceFits snugly in placePlenty for more replacements lateCons - Did n't actually receive 100
 My favorite Nalgene 750ml bottle had turned into a `` dribble '' bottle . This ring is the correct size to fit over the neck and seal against the cap when the cap is screwed on . Not perfect - when you unscrew the cap , a little water that was sitting above the ring will drip . But I 'm not getting dripped on when I drink .
 WOW , researched `` O '' Rings off & online for awhile , almost bought one at another store online , but it was 5 times the price , I thought of amazon and I probably could have done even better , but I am pleased with these.Thank you again , Amazon has not let me down yet !! NO LEAKS!Tim
 excellent price and good delivery . the item will be used to seal pyrex glass tubes used for a solar boiler to create steam .
 The item is just as described . It 's made by Stock Gear Inc. and resold by Small Parts Inc. . The face width is 3/8 inch . The gear I.D. is 5/16 inch . The hub diameter is about 11/16 inch and the hub projects about 3/8 inch beyond the gear on one side only . The hub is plain and must be drilled for a pin or set screw or else press fit to a shaft.I bought 5 of them at 20 cents each . Three days later , they are $ 3.52 each ! Same with many other gears I bought . What 's up with that ?

I read a recent DIY article online about turning certain fountain pens -LRB- Platinum Preppy line -RRB- into eye dropper fountain pens using this size o-ring . I wanted to give it a try , and I must admit it worked like a charm . No leaks , perfect . Search online for `` eye dropper fountain pen '' and `` o-ring '' or perhaps `` make your own '' and you should be able to find it , if you 're interested . Fun , and a good use of the pen and the ink .
 I bought these based on the recommendation of a previous reviewer . The seal on my Nissan 14oz Leakproof Insulated Travel Mug broke when I was washing it , and without the seal , it was n't leakproof . These work great . Thanks , previous reviewer !
 My husband takes a Thermos travel mug of coffee with him every workday , and the o-ring was very stained . I also figured that eventually it would relax and no longer provide a tight , leakproof fit . I thought finding a replacement would be impossible , but , when it looks impossible ... try Amazon ! Found these , which are the exact size as the original . We 're set for a long time , now !
 I lost the original ring to my Nissan Stainless coffee cup , and was looking for a new one on Amazon , when Amazon suggested this o-ring to me . What a good suggestion ! Now my old cup has a new lease on life and I can lose the ring like 9 more times before I have to buy a whole new one : -RRB-
 I got these on a suggestion on an airsoft repair forum . They fit snugly into the fill valves , providing a better outer seal than most factory standard o-rings , and at a far better price than the exact same product when sold somewhere like Evike . The one problem I had was that my bag had 88 in it instead of 100 . I 'm not actually upset , since the price difference between it and other similar products still made this worth it , but a little more accuracy in the numbers would be appreciated.Pros - Great PriceFits snugly in placePlenty for more replacements lateCons - Did n't actually receive 100
 My favorite Nalgene 750ml bottle had turned into a `` dribble '' bottle . This ring is the correct size to fit over the neck and seal against the cap when the cap is screwed on . Not perfect - when you unscrew the cap , a little water that was sitting above the ring will drip . But I 'm not getting dripped on when I drink .
 WOW , researched `` O '' Rings off & online for awhile , almost bought one at another store online , but it was 5 times the price , I thought of amazon and I probably could have done even better , but I am pleased with these.Thank you again , Amazon has not let me down yet !! NO LEAKS!Tim
 excellent price and good delivery . the item will be used to seal pyrex glass tubes used for a solar boiler to create steam .
 Just standard O-rings . They work great for 5-gallon soda kegs used for home brewing . With the 100-pk , I wo n't have to buy more ... ever .
 I really like these instead of the rubber ones I replaced them for . I would do this again since silicone is forever
 This is a perfect replacement O ring for my Thermos Nissan insulated coffee mug . It fit perfectly and provided a tight seal .
 I used this and it worked for my application very good quality and good pricing and also packaging . It 's made well .
 O-rings were top quality , exactly as pictured . Prices are great for only a 10 pack . Exactly what I wanted and expected . What more would you need ?
 The O-rings arrived on time and look good . Amazon has a great selection , far better than any store I could find in town . They are marked in fractional inches , but that size is only approximate . Look in the product description and it will tell you the exact size in thousandths of an inch .
 I purchased these O-rings for replacing the drive belts for a rod dryer -LRB- fishing rods -RRB- . They 're stronger than the originals !
 After purchasing a lower quality product from the local hardware store for about twice the price , I was happy to see Amazon carrying the silicon type of this O-Ring and for a lower price . They are quality products for a great price .
 Looking for a better and cheaper alternative than buying the $ 5 each Omni Heavy Duty whole house filter o-rings ? This is it . The silicone is FDA approved and at $ 5 for 10 pieces !
 Dunno what to say about an o-ring , but they appear to be well-made , come nicely packaged , etc. .

 this angle is great , bought it to make a barbq grill , been outside for a couple of months and no signs of rust . A +
 The item was to my satisfaction , quick service -LRB- got it within 5 days -RRB- and safely packed . I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in this kind of product .

 Ordered to try as replacement ball mill belt . Outlasts the `` official '' belt by 10X and at 7 cents apiece versus $ 6 . Need ball mill belts ? Can not go wrong with this one ! Works with the very popular 3 # and 6 # dual drum mill .
 The wide variety of ring sizes available allowed me to pick the precise ring for my unusual application . I used the o-rings to replace the drive belts on an old movie projector
 I 'm using these for a mixed-media art project . They 're VERY durable -LRB- tried to break one by stretching it , and it WO N'T break -RRB- , and the dimensions are exactly as described . Thanks ! ~ G
 THIS PRODUCT WAS EXACTLY AS I EXPECTED , I AM FAMILIAR WITH THESE ITEMS , I USE THEM IN SPECIAL APPLICATIONS IN MY HOBBIES
 Purchased to use as the Gasket for my Espresso machine . Works well . I bought the ten pack , which cost less than one of the Manufacturer 's Gaskets for the espresso machine .
 There 's not much to say about o rings , unless they do n't work . However , these are just fine . They appear to be well made and true to size . If you need them , buy them without worry .
 The o-rings are as described so what 's not to like . The price is reasonable and they arrived within a week . I 'll try this source again when looking for small parts .
 The product worked great and saved money compared buying from the dealer of the device it was used in.I expected only one and got a pack for less than two dollars . Since this is a replacable part I will be able to use the extras in the future .
 I use these in making paint thickness gauges . The price is great , quality is very good ; does exactly what it should ! I will be buying these again !
 This was a perfect size for what I needed and just as you would expect an O-Ring to be !!! I used it as a drive belt .
 Fast shipping , was a great price but they have increased in price over 100 % . Good quality in these `` O '' rings though the bags are always short by 1-3 rings making it a question of why at this price . I got these for a specific purpose and they have gained some popularity for the specialized application I offer . Have bought 6 reorders at this point .
 I 'm always running for o rings for something now I have a stock at home .
 Given the product 's very simple design and construction it is no surprise that it arrived in exactly the form that I was expecting . Delivery time was good , too .
 It 's an O-Ring . It was round . It worked . -LRB- Why am I writing a review on this ... -RRB-
 Great quality , but I took away a star because it did n't fit my peanut lighter . I realize that 's not the product 's fault . It 's just frustrating that it 's difficult to buy exactly the correct size when you start dealing with small devices with little room for error . I probably would give it 5 stars if it fit like I expected it would .

 i thought mitutoyo was a good name so bought this ruler ... but it came in the mail today and its really flimsy and thin ... it cost me freaking 8 bucks and its a piece of crap . worst purchase ever and will never buy from this company again.edit
 I bought these on sale for $ 5.99 . No typos . For this price the bit set comes in a handsome case and is worth the price . I have n't tested them out yet but will in the near future .
 I bought these o-rings as a replacement on my Nissan spill proof travel mug . I use this mug all the time . It will keep a cup of freshly made tea or coffee hot for 3-4 hours if left closed , or at the right drinking temperature for a full hour . I tried to find a replacement for the o-ring at the Nissan website but could not . These o-rings are an excellent replacement . The mug closes water tight and works like new . Highly recommended for this application .

 The wide variety of ring sizes available allowed me to pick the precise ring for my unusual application . I used the o-rings to replace the drive belts on an old movie projector
 I 'm using these for a mixed-media art project . They 're VERY durable -LRB- tried to break one by stretching it , and it WO N'T break -RRB- , and the dimensions are exactly as described . Thanks ! ~ G
 THIS PRODUCT WAS EXACTLY AS I EXPECTED , I AM FAMILIAR WITH THESE ITEMS , I USE THEM IN SPECIAL APPLICATIONS IN MY HOBBIES
 Purchased to use as the Gasket for my Espresso machine . Works well . I bought the ten pack , which cost less than one of the Manufacturer 's Gaskets for the espresso machine .
 There 's not much to say about o rings , unless they do n't work . However , these are just fine . They appear to be well made and true to size . If you need them , buy them without worry .
 The o-rings are as described so what 's not to like . The price is reasonable and they arrived within a week . I 'll try this source again when looking for small parts .
 The product worked great and saved money compared buying from the dealer of the device it was used in.I expected only one and got a pack for less than two dollars . Since this is a replacable part I will be able to use the extras in the future .
 I use these in making paint thickness gauges . The price is great , quality is very good ; does exactly what it should ! I will be buying these again !
 This was a perfect size for what I needed and just as you would expect an O-Ring to be !!! I used it as a drive belt .
 Fast shipping , was a great price but they have increased in price over 100 % . Good quality in these `` O '' rings though the bags are always short by 1-3 rings making it a question of why at this price . I got these for a specific purpose and they have gained some popularity for the specialized application I offer . Have bought 6 reorders at this point .
 I 'm always running for o rings for something now I have a stock at home .
 Given the product 's very simple design and construction it is no surprise that it arrived in exactly the form that I was expecting . Delivery time was good , too .
 It 's an O-Ring . It was round . It worked . -LRB- Why am I writing a review on this ... -RRB-
 Great quality , but I took away a star because it did n't fit my peanut lighter . I realize that 's not the product 's fault . It 's just frustrating that it 's difficult to buy exactly the correct size when you start dealing with small devices with little room for error . I probably would give it 5 stars if it fit like I expected it would .
 This is the bearing you need for your Subaru SVX AC idler pulley . Fit is perfect . The bearing is sealed . Not sure if the grease it comes packed in is shipping grease or high temp grease so I popped out the seal and packed it with a good high temp grease and set the seal back in .
 this angle is great , bought it to make a barbq grill , been outside for a couple of months and no signs of rust . A +
 The item was to my satisfaction , quick service -LRB- got it within 5 days -RRB- and safely packed . I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in this kind of product .

 Just standard O-rings . They work great for 5-gallon soda kegs used for home brewing . With the 100-pk , I wo n't have to buy more ... ever .
 I really like these instead of the rubber ones I replaced them for . I would do this again since silicone is forever
 This is a perfect replacement O ring for my Thermos Nissan insulated coffee mug . It fit perfectly and provided a tight seal .
 I used this and it worked for my application very good quality and good pricing and also packaging . It 's made well .
 O-rings were top quality , exactly as pictured . Prices are great for only a 10 pack . Exactly what I wanted and expected . What more would you need ?
 The O-rings arrived on time and look good . Amazon has a great selection , far better than any store I could find in town . They are marked in fractional inches , but that size is only approximate . Look in the product description and it will tell you the exact size in thousandths of an inch .
 I purchased these O-rings for replacing the drive belts for a rod dryer -LRB- fishing rods -RRB- . They 're stronger than the originals !
 After purchasing a lower quality product from the local hardware store for about twice the price , I was happy to see Amazon carrying the silicon type of this O-Ring and for a lower price . They are quality products for a great price .
 Looking for a better and cheaper alternative than buying the $ 5 each Omni Heavy Duty whole house filter o-rings ? This is it . The silicone is FDA approved and at $ 5 for 10 pieces !
 I bought these o-rings as a replacement on my Nissan spill proof travel mug . I use this mug all the time . It will keep a cup of freshly made tea or coffee hot for 3-4 hours if left closed , or at the right drinking temperature for a full hour . I tried to find a replacement for the o-ring at the Nissan website but could not . These o-rings are an excellent replacement . The mug closes water tight and works like new . Highly recommended for this application .
 These are very strong little o-rings , with plenty of tensile strength . I read a recent DIY article online about turning certain fountain pens -LRB- Platinum Preppy line -RRB- into eye dropper fountain pens using this size o-ring . I wanted to give it a try , and I must admit it worked like a charm . No leaks , perfect . Search online for `` eye dropper fountain pen '' and `` o-ring '' or perhaps `` make your own '' and you should be able to find it , if you 're interested . Fun , and a good use of the pen and the ink .
 I bought these based on the recommendation of a previous reviewer . The seal on my Nissan 14oz Leakproof Insulated Travel Mug broke when I was washing it , and without the seal , it was n't leakproof . These work great . Thanks , previous reviewer !
 My husband takes a Thermos travel mug of coffee with him every workday , and the o-ring was very stained . I also figured that eventually it would relax and no longer provide a tight , leakproof fit . I thought finding a replacement would be impossible , but , when it looks impossible ... try Amazon ! Found these , which are the exact size as the original . We 're set for a long time , now !
 I lost the original ring to my Nissan Stainless coffee cup , and was looking for a new one on Amazon , when Amazon suggested this o-ring to me . What a good suggestion ! Now my old cup has a new lease on life and I can lose the ring like 9 more times before I have to buy a whole new one : -RRB-
 I got these on a suggestion on an airsoft repair forum . They fit snugly into the fill valves , providing a better outer seal than most factory standard o-rings , and at a far better price than the exact same product when sold somewhere like Evike . The one problem I had was that my bag had 88 in it instead of 100 . I 'm not actually upset , since the price difference between it and other similar products still made this worth it , but a little more accuracy in the numbers would be appreciated.Pros - Great PriceFits snugly in placePlenty for more replacements lateCons - Did n't actually receive 100
 My favorite Nalgene 750ml bottle had turned into a `` dribble '' bottle . This ring is the correct size to fit over the neck and seal against the cap when the cap is screwed on . Not perfect - when you unscrew the cap , a little water that was sitting above the ring will drip . But I 'm not getting dripped on when I drink .
 WOW , researched `` O '' Rings off & online for awhile , almost bought one at another store online , but it was 5 times the price , I thought of amazon and I probably could have done even better , but I am pleased with these.Thank you again , Amazon has not let me down yet !! NO LEAKS!Tim

 AS MENTIONED BEFORE , THESE ARE BLACK OXIDE SCREWS , NOT STAINLESS AS PICTURED . These are very high quality YFS screws . I 've ordered 1000 's of them and they come exactly as described . Very good value !
 The screws are black -LRB- not silver as pictured -RRB- . The heads are also wider than a normal screw . Otherwise no issues .
 I am turning these into vent liners for my muzzleloader . With new vent liners running $ 2 to $ 3 a piece , it 's a grat bargain to make my own with these screws .
 I used this screw to fix my car door latch when one of the originals fell off . It fit perfectly and held up well over the winter .
 Not some sloppy fit , these screws are rough and tough and coarse threaded . Unless the price is abnormally cheap , as it was when I purchased them , I 'm sure not many people are going to be reading this . But I will say I have successfully used some of these fasteners . They work as expected .

 shipping was great , seller was great , im sure the product is excellent , but the info online concerning size for bike fender bolts was wrong for my bike , not a universal size ,
 This is what you want . Economical and high quality . Works perfectly . Great alternative to the factory or firearms products . 100 rounds test proved perfect performance .
 I ordered these orings to repair my ford 6.9 diesel engine . I used them on the injector leak-off jackets to reseal them . They worked great and were a great deal .
 I had been going through o-rings on our tube filling machine like crazy . I had to replace it once a week or more often . I decided to order this 25 pack since it was so inexpensive . It 's been a month and a half and I have not yet replaced the first one of these . They seem to be extremely durable so far .
 Fast service and product as described . Fits an old Remington 1100 perfectly at a fraction of the cost of Remington replacements . That 's about all - they are just O-rings .
 Used to replace broken o-ring on a Remington 1100 12 gauge . Product fits perfectly and is of very high quality . At this price you basically have a lifetime supply ! Highly recommend !
 I was looking for an o-ring for my Remington 1100 and other places were asking $ 9 for 1 . You get 50 of these for less than that . My great grandkids will still have these o-rings for the gun lol .
 I was having blow back issues with my 12gauge , and all the suggestions pointed to my gas ports , and the O ring . Now that I have replaced it , I need to get out and shoot again . Hopefully this was the fix . The only draw back with this product , is that you receive a &#34; Costco &#34; supply ; more than enough for a lifetime .
 Used this to replace my o ring on my BMW 's DISA valve . O ring is not available from the dealer . Worked perfectly and solved my vacuum leak .

 Fits my Remington 1100 Shotgun perfect ! Replaced my old hard worn out one . I dont think I will ever use all 50 of them , but maybe some friends will need some .
 It is just what you would expect . Works fine , looks like good stuff . I go through a bunch of these on camp fuel stoves and bottles . Viton lasts much longer than NBR .
 I bought this part to use on the fuel pump plate of my bmw r1150r . I think it 's also the same part for 1100 too . It works just as well at fraction of the cost quoted by dealerships
 This seal works for early BMW oil filter stand O-Ring , not available from dealer . Or you end up buying new style housing which is a lot more .
 Just what I needed to fix my pool fill valve . 25 is a lot but now I 'm covered .
 Yes , this is the one you 've been hunting , and yes , my 91 geo 1.0 quit leaking from there . What to do with the extra nine ? Well , I do n't know either , but its hard to beat the price !!!
 Thanks for stocking these O-rings ; I could not find them locally . Just what I needed . Still arrived ahead of a few other items I ordered at the same time from other venders here on Amazon so I changed my review to five stars .

 I bought these o-rings as a replacement on my Nissan spill proof travel mug . I use this mug all the time . It will keep a cup of freshly made tea or coffee hot for 3-4 hours if left closed , or at the right drinking temperature for a full hour . I tried to find a replacement for the o-ring at the Nissan website but could not . These o-rings are an excellent replacement . The mug closes water tight and works like new .

 My favorite Nalgene 750ml bottle had turned into a `` dribble '' bottle . This ring is the correct size to fit over the neck and seal against the cap when the cap is screwed on . Not perfect - when you unscrew the cap , a little water that was sitting above the ring will drip . But I 'm not getting dripped on when I drink .

 Just standard O-rings . They work great for 5-gallon soda kegs used for home brewing . With the 100-pk , I wo n't have to buy more ... ever .
 I really like these instead of the rubber ones I replaced them for . I would do this again since silicone is forever
 This is a perfect replacement O ring for my Thermos Nissan insulated coffee mug . It fit perfectly and provided a tight seal .
 I used this and it worked for my application very good quality and good pricing and also packaging . It 's made well .
 O-rings were top quality , exactly as pictured . Prices are great for only a 10 pack . Exactly what I wanted and expected . What more would you need ?
 The O-rings arrived on time and look good . Amazon has a great selection , far better than any store I could find in town . They are marked in fractional inches , but that size is only approximate . Look in the product description and it will tell you the exact size in thousandths of an inch .
 I purchased these O-rings for replacing the drive belts for a rod dryer -LRB- fishing rods -RRB- . They 're stronger than the originals !
 After purchasing a lower quality product from the local hardware store for about twice the price , I was happy to see Amazon carrying the silicon type of this O-Ring and for a lower price . They are quality products for a great price .
 Looking for a better and cheaper alternative than buying the $ 5 each Omni Heavy Duty whole house filter o-rings ? This is it . The silicone is FDA approved and at $ 5 for 10 pieces !
 Ordered to try as replacement ball mill belt . Outlasts the `` official '' belt by 10X and at 7 cents apiece versus $ 6 . Need ball mill belts ? Can not go wrong with this one ! Works with the very popular 3 # and 6 # dual drum mill .
 The wide variety of ring sizes available allowed me to pick the precise ring for my unusual application . I used the o-rings to replace the drive belts on an old movie projector
 I 'm using these for a mixed-media art project . They 're VERY durable -LRB- tried to break one by stretching it , and it WO N'T break -RRB- , and the dimensions are exactly as described . Thanks ! ~ G
 THIS PRODUCT WAS EXACTLY AS I EXPECTED , I AM FAMILIAR WITH THESE ITEMS , I USE THEM IN SPECIAL APPLICATIONS IN MY HOBBIES
 Purchased to use as the Gasket for my Espresso machine . Works well . I bought the ten pack , which cost less than one of the Manufacturer 's Gaskets for the espresso machine .
 There 's not much to say about o rings , unless they do n't work . However , these are just fine . They appear to be well made and true to size . If you need them , buy them without worry .
 The o-rings are as described so what 's not to like . The price is reasonable and they arrived within a week . I 'll try this source again when looking for small parts .
 The product worked great and saved money compared buying from the dealer of the device it was used in.I expected only one and got a pack for less than two dollars . Since this is a replacable part I will be able to use the extras in the future .
 I use these in making paint thickness gauges . The price is great , quality is very good ; does exactly what it should ! I will be buying these again !
 This was a perfect size for what I needed and just as you would expect an O-Ring to be !!! I used it as a drive belt .
 Fast shipping , was a great price but they have increased in price over 100 % . Good quality in these `` O '' rings though the bags are always short by 1-3 rings making it a question of why at this price . I got these for a specific purpose and they have gained some popularity for the specialized application I offer . Have bought 6 reorders at this point .
 I 'm always running for o rings for something now I have a stock at home .
 Given the product 's very simple design and construction it is no surprise that it arrived in exactly the form that I was expecting . Delivery time was good , too .
 It 's an O-Ring . It was round . It worked . -LRB- Why am I writing a review on this ... -RRB-
 Great quality , but I took away a star because it did n't fit my peanut lighter . I realize that 's not the product 's fault . It 's just frustrating that it 's difficult to buy exactly the correct size when you start dealing with small devices with little room for error . I probably would give it 5 stars if it fit like I expected it would .
 What can I say about a brass screw except it meets SAE specs and is a nice brass screw . Yep
 I needed something 1/4-20 and brass to make a 3d printer extrusion nozzle , i only needed a couple about 1inch long but these were actually cheaper and im cutting the heads off anyway so i got the 3 1/2 inchers.not really a whole lot to say other than they are 1/4-20 as described and they are brass , im sure you could polish them up if you wanted something decorative , that 's probably what ill end up doing with the extras next time i need to attach some hinges and have them look nice .
 You get exactly what you see in the pic . The screws are very golden yellow . It works and I got 100 in a sealed bag .

 I bought these o-rings as a replacement on my Nissan spill proof travel mug . I use this mug all the time . It will keep a cup of freshly made tea or coffee hot for 3-4 hours if left closed , or at the right drinking temperature for a full hour . I tried to find a replacement for the o-ring at the Nissan website but could not . These o-rings are an excellent replacement . The mug closes water tight and works like new . Highly recommended for this application .
 These are very strong little o-rings , with plenty of tensile strength . I read a recent DIY article online about turning certain fountain pens -LRB- Platinum Preppy line -RRB- into eye dropper fountain pens using this size o-ring . I wanted to give it a try , and I must admit it worked like a charm . No leaks , perfect . Search online for `` eye dropper fountain pen '' and `` o-ring '' or perhaps `` make your own '' and you should be able to find it , if you 're interested . Fun , and a good use of the pen and the ink .
 I bought these based on the recommendation of a previous reviewer . The seal on my Nissan 14oz Leakproof Insulated Travel Mug broke when I was washing it , and without the seal , it was n't leakproof . These work great . Thanks , previous reviewer !
 My husband takes a Thermos travel mug of coffee with him every workday , and the o-ring was very stained . I also figured that eventually it would relax and no longer provide a tight , leakproof fit . I thought finding a replacement would be impossible , but , when it looks impossible ... try Amazon ! Found these , which are the exact size as the original . We 're set for a long time , now !
 I lost the original ring to my Nissan Stainless coffee cup , and was looking for a new one on Amazon , when Amazon suggested this o-ring to me . What a good suggestion ! Now my old cup has a new lease on life and I can lose the ring like 9 more times before I have to buy a whole new one : -RRB-
 I got these on a suggestion on an airsoft repair forum . They fit snugly into the fill valves , providing a better outer seal than most factory standard o-rings , and at a far better price than the exact same product when sold somewhere like Evike . The one problem I had was that my bag had 88 in it instead of 100 . I 'm not actually upset , since the price difference between it and other similar products still made this worth it , but a little more accuracy in the numbers would be appreciated.Pros - Great PriceFits snugly in placePlenty for more replacements lateCons - Did n't actually receive 100
 My favorite Nalgene 750ml bottle had turned into a `` dribble '' bottle . This ring is the correct size to fit over the neck and seal against the cap when the cap is screwed on . Not perfect - when you unscrew the cap , a little water that was sitting above the ring will drip . But I 'm not getting dripped on when I drink .
 WOW , researched `` O '' Rings off & online for awhile , almost bought one at another store online , but it was 5 times the price , I thought of amazon and I probably could have done even better , but I am pleased with these.Thank you again , Amazon has not let me down yet !! NO LEAKS!Tim
 excellent price and good delivery . the item will be used to seal pyrex glass tubes used for a solar boiler to create steam .
 I needed a small quantity of aluminum U-channel in an unusual shape
 A nice 5-foot long Aluminum U-Channel that will work perfectly for my project . The flat base is 1-inch across and the inside channel is 3/4-inch -LRB- not counting the 1/8-inch legs -RRB- . It 's hard to find 1/8 '' thick material at the local hardware stores as they typically only stock the thinner 1/16 '' thick materials . Was glad to find it available here on Amazon.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the piece of aluminum that I received had several scratches , a few small nicks , and some black marks where it must have rubbed against something on the flat outside 1-inch wide surface . The inside of the channel was clean and hopefully all the marks will buff out . Depending on your application , the flat surface may be hidden and this would be a non-issue . For my application , the flat surface will be displayed along the perimeter of my project , so it is in a more obvious position . If I look down the aluminum lengthwise , or lay it on a flat surface there is also a slight bow up on the ends . Since I will be cutting this into smaller pieces , this should not have an adverse effect on my project . It shipped quickly in a thick , sturdy , round tube ... top notch shipping !
 This product was exactly what I expected and worked exactly as I planned . I was able to cut , weld and thread this aluminum and it was of excelent quality .
 This Aluminum U-Channel was ordered to construct grooved retainers for the carpet covered plywood covers forward of the transom in my 19 ' aluminum boat . The product arrived in a cardboard tube in perfect condition and in less than a week . It will fulfill its intended purpose quite well . I am very pleased with this transaction and would buy from this seller again .
 Trying to find custom -LRB- relative -RRB- Al U-channel is almost impossible to find locally -LRB- Lowes/HD/Metal shop -RRB- without it costing a million dollars or having to purchase more than you need . This channel was shipped in a strong tube , with no bends or kinks - great transaction .

 AS MENTIONED BEFORE , THESE ARE BLACK OXIDE SCREWS , NOT STAINLESS AS PICTURED . These are very high quality YFS screws . I 've ordered 1000 's of them and they come exactly as described . Very good value !
 The screws are black -LRB- not silver as pictured -RRB- . The heads are also wider than a normal screw . Otherwise no issues .
 I am turning these into vent liners for my muzzleloader . With new vent liners running $ 2 to $ 3 a piece , it 's a grat bargain to make my own with these screws .
 I used this screw to fix my car door latch when one of the originals fell off . It fit perfectly and held up well over the winter .
 Not some sloppy fit , these screws are rough and tough and coarse threaded . Unless the price is abnormally cheap , as it was when I purchased them , I 'm sure not many people are going to be reading this . But I will say I have successfully used some of these fasteners . They work as expected .
 *** EDIT 7/9/12 12:00 PM *** Well , I posted this review a couple of hours ago , and also notified Amazon about the issue . Within about fifteen minutes , they issued a refund on the shipping charges , escalated the issue immediately with their shipping department and have a representative monitoring my order until it arrives on my doorstep . All I can say is , WOW ! That was definitely not the response I expected , and was very impressed ! *** Original Review *** This is the first time that I 've used the expedited shipping option to update my shipping option from 2-day Prime shipping to 1-day shipping , with an additional upcharge .

 Fits my Remington 1100 Shotgun perfect ! Replaced my old hard worn out one . I dont think I will ever use all 50 of them , but maybe some friends will need some .
 It is just what you would expect . Works fine , looks like good stuff . I go through a bunch of these on camp fuel stoves and bottles . Viton lasts much longer than NBR .
 I bought this part to use on the fuel pump plate of my bmw r1150r . I think it 's also the same part for 1100 too . It works just as well at fraction of the cost quoted by dealerships
 This seal works for early BMW oil filter stand O-Ring , not available from dealer . Or you end up buying new style housing which is a lot more .
 Just what I needed to fix my pool fill valve . 25 is a lot but now I 'm covered .
 Yes , this is the one you 've been hunting , and yes , my 91 geo 1.0 quit leaking from there . What to do with the extra nine ? Well , I do n't know either , but its hard to beat the price !!!
 Thanks for stocking these O-rings ; I could not find them locally . Just what I needed . Still arrived ahead of a few other items I ordered at the same time from other venders here on Amazon so I changed my review to five stars .

 This is what you want . Economical and high quality . Works perfectly . Great alternative to the factory or firearms products . 100 rounds test proved perfect performance .
 I ordered these orings to repair my ford 6.9 diesel engine . I used them on the injector leak-off jackets to reseal them . They worked great and were a great deal .
 I had been going through o-rings on our tube filling machine like crazy . I had to replace it once a week or more often . I decided to order this 25 pack since it was so inexpensive . It 's been a month and a half and I have not yet replaced the first one of these . They seem to be extremely durable so far .
 Fast service and product as described . Fits an old Remington 1100 perfectly at a fraction of the cost of Remington replacements . That 's about all - they are just O-rings .
 Used to replace broken o-ring on a Remington 1100 12 gauge . Product fits perfectly and is of very high quality . At this price you basically have a lifetime supply ! Highly recommend !
 I was looking for an o-ring for my Remington 1100 and other places were asking $ 9 for 1 . You get 50 of these for less than that . My great grandkids will still have these o-rings for the gun lol .
 I was having blow back issues with my 12gauge , and all the suggestions pointed to my gas ports , and the O ring . Now that I have replaced it , I need to get out and shoot again . Hopefully this was the fix . The only draw back with this product , is that you receive a &#34; Costco &#34; supply ; more than enough for a lifetime .
 Used this to replace my o ring on my BMW 's DISA valve . O ring is not available from the dealer . Worked perfectly and solved my vacuum leak .
 Received my order in 48hrs . Nice looking meter . Quality supurb to the Workman 3P ! You get what you pay for . Modulation meter portion works well and is great to have . Great addition !
 The Astatic 600 5000Watt SWR / Power Meter is a clear winner . Well lite and easy to read . Nice to be able to see everything at sametime .
 if your thinking of buying these meters i would say heck yeah !! these are the best meters i have ever owned.they are easy to use and have a bright light.and they are easy to read.and there made good and heavy a little bigger than what i expected but they work great . .
 I have not recieved This meter -LRB- Astatic 600 -- 5000 watt swr/power meter -RRB- -- so I ca n't say much at all , jus send it to me

 The o-rings are as described so what 's not to like . The price is reasonable and they arrived within a week . I 'll try this source again when looking for small parts .
 The product worked great and saved money compared buying from the dealer of the device it was used in.I expected only one and got a pack for less than two dollars . Since this is a replacable part I will be able to use the extras in the future .
 I use these in making paint thickness gauges . The price is great , quality is very good ; does exactly what it should ! I will be buying these again !
 This was a perfect size for what I needed and just as you would expect an O-Ring to be !!! I used it as a drive belt .
 Fast shipping , was a great price but they have increased in price over 100 % . Good quality in these `` O '' rings though the bags are always short by 1-3 rings making it a question of why at this price . I got these for a specific purpose and they have gained some popularity for the specialized application I offer . Have bought 6 reorders at this point .
 I 'm always running for o rings for something now I have a stock at home .
 Given the product 's very simple design and construction it is no surprise that it arrived in exactly the form that I was expecting . Delivery time was good , too .
 It 's an O-Ring . It was round . It worked . -LRB- Why am I writing a review on this ... -RRB-
 Great quality , but I took away a star because it did n't fit my peanut lighter . I realize that 's not the product 's fault . It 's just frustrating that it 's difficult to buy exactly the correct size when you start dealing with small devices with little room for error . I probably would give it 5 stars if it fit like I expected it would .
 The advantage of using brass screws is that they are relatively easy to cut cleanly to length . Either use a screw cutter or thread a nut above the point to cut and cut the screw then unscrew the nut over the cut to straighten the thread area back out.The second advantage of brass is that it is relatively corrosion resistant - it will eventually darken but never rust.Brass is strong enough for most home uses - obviously for automotive or aircraft use stainless steel is required.These are well made brass screws at a reasonable price .
 These are a good deal . They 're adequately strong , and look pretty . Mostly , though , they 're pretty long - I bought these because they cost less than any shorter length , and I can just cut them to size .
 I 've been looking for a good source of brass 2-56 screws and these fit the bill . They certainly cost less than they would in the hobby or hardware store .
 It would have cost twice as much to buy half as many of these locally , I 'm a happy camper . I will certainly buy here again .
 Use them to fasten the HDDs to the computer case I built for my NAS from an old Compaq Deskpro case . The head is compatible with the original tool-less HDD attachment design of the case.Also worked great to fasten HDDs to standard cases
 I 'm not sure quite what to say about these . They work like any other machine screw , and are made very well . The length was correct . They are all brass -LRB- not brass plated -RRB- which is a nice plus .
 I bought these o-rings as a replacement on my Nissan spill proof travel mug . I use this mug all the time . It will keep a cup of freshly made tea or coffee hot for 3-4 hours if left closed , or at the right drinking temperature for a full hour . I tried to find a replacement for the o-ring at the Nissan website but could not . These o-rings are an excellent replacement . The mug closes water tight and works like new . Highly recommended for this application .
 These are very strong little o-rings , with plenty of tensile strength . I read a recent DIY article online about turning certain fountain pens -LRB- Platinum Preppy line -RRB- into eye dropper fountain pens using this size o-ring . I wanted to give it a try , and I must admit it worked like a charm . No leaks , perfect . Search online for `` eye dropper fountain pen '' and `` o-ring '' or perhaps `` make your own '' and you should be able to find it , if you 're interested . Fun , and a good use of the pen and the ink .
 I bought these based on the recommendation of a previous reviewer . The seal on my Nissan 14oz Leakproof Insulated Travel Mug broke when I was washing it , and without the seal , it was n't leakproof . These work great . Thanks , previous reviewer !
 My husband takes a Thermos travel mug of coffee with him every workday , and the o-ring was very stained . I also figured that eventually it would relax and no longer provide a tight , leakproof fit . I thought finding a replacement would be impossible , but , when it looks impossible ... try Amazon ! Found these , which are the exact size as the original . We 're set for a long time , now !
 I lost the original ring to my Nissan Stainless coffee cup , and was looking for a new one on Amazon , when Amazon suggested this o-ring to me . What a good suggestion ! Now my old cup has a new lease on life and I can lose the ring like 9 more times before I have to buy a whole new one : -RRB-
 I got these on a suggestion on an airsoft repair forum . They fit snugly into the fill valves , providing a better outer seal than most factory standard o-rings , and at a far better price than the exact same product when sold somewhere like Evike . The one problem I had was that my bag had 88 in it instead of 100 . I 'm not actually upset , since the price difference between it and other similar products still made this worth it , but a little more accuracy in the numbers would be appreciated.Pros - Great PriceFits snugly in placePlenty for more replacements lateCons - Did n't actually receive 100
 My favorite Nalgene 750ml bottle had turned into a `` dribble '' bottle . This ring is the correct size to fit over the neck and seal against the cap when the cap is screwed on . Not perfect - when you unscrew the cap , a little water that was sitting above the ring will drip . But I 'm not getting dripped on when I drink .
 WOW , researched `` O '' Rings off & online for awhile , almost bought one at another store online , but it was 5 times the price , I thought of amazon and I probably could have done even better , but I am pleased with these.Thank you again , Amazon has not let me down yet !! NO LEAKS!Tim
 excellent price and good delivery . the item will be used to seal pyrex glass tubes used for a solar boiler to create steam .
 Just standard O-rings . They work great for 5-gallon soda kegs used for home brewing . With the 100-pk , I wo n't have to buy more ... ever .
 I really like these instead of the rubber ones I replaced them for . I would do this again since silicone is forever
 This is a perfect replacement O ring for my Thermos Nissan insulated coffee mug . It fit perfectly and provided a tight seal .
 I used this and it worked for my application very good quality and good pricing and also packaging . It 's made well .
 O-rings were top quality , exactly as pictured . Prices are great for only a 10 pack . Exactly what I wanted and expected . What more would you need ?
 The O-rings arrived on time and look good . Amazon has a great selection , far better than any store I could find in town . They are marked in fractional inches , but that size is only approximate . Look in the product description and it will tell you the exact size in thousandths of an inch .
 I purchased these O-rings for replacing the drive belts for a rod dryer -LRB- fishing rods -RRB- . They 're stronger than the originals !
 After purchasing a lower quality product from the local hardware store for about twice the price , I was happy to see Amazon carrying the silicon type of this O-Ring and for a lower price . They are quality products for a great price .
 Looking for a better and cheaper alternative than buying the $ 5 each Omni Heavy Duty whole house filter o-rings ? This is it . The silicone is FDA approved and at $ 5 for 10 pieces !
 Dunno what to say about an o-ring , but they appear to be well-made , come nicely packaged , etc. .

 I needed a small quantity of aluminum U-channel in an unusual shape
 A nice 5-foot long Aluminum U-Channel that will work perfectly for my project . The flat base is 1-inch across and the inside channel is 3/4-inch -LRB- not counting the 1/8-inch legs -RRB- . It 's hard to find 1/8 '' thick material at the local hardware stores as they typically only stock the thinner 1/16 '' thick materials . Was glad to find it available here on Amazon.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the piece of aluminum that I received had several scratches , a few small nicks , and some black marks where it must have rubbed against something on the flat outside 1-inch wide surface . The inside of the channel was clean and hopefully all the marks will buff out . Depending on your application , the flat surface may be hidden and this would be a non-issue . For my application , the flat surface will be displayed along the perimeter of my project , so it is in a more obvious position . If I look down the aluminum lengthwise , or lay it on a flat surface there is also a slight bow up on the ends . Since I will be cutting this into smaller pieces , this should not have an adverse effect on my project . It shipped quickly in a thick , sturdy , round tube ... top notch shipping !
 This product was exactly what I expected and worked exactly as I planned . I was able to cut , weld and thread this aluminum and it was of excelent quality .
 This Aluminum U-Channel was ordered to construct grooved retainers for the carpet covered plywood covers forward of the transom in my 19 ' aluminum boat . The product arrived in a cardboard tube in perfect condition and in less than a week . It will fulfill its intended purpose quite well . I am very pleased with this transaction and would buy from this seller again .
 Trying to find custom -LRB- relative -RRB- Al U-channel is almost impossible to find locally -LRB- Lowes/HD/Metal shop -RRB- without it costing a million dollars or having to purchase more than you need . This channel was shipped in a strong tube , with no bends or kinks - great transaction .
 *** EDIT 7/9/12 12:00 PM *** Well , I posted this review a couple of hours ago , and also notified Amazon about the issue . Within about fifteen minutes , they issued a refund on the shipping charges , escalated the issue immediately with their shipping department and have a representative monitoring my order until it arrives on my doorstep . All I can say is , WOW ! That was definitely not the response I expected , and was very impressed ! *** Original Review *** This is the first time that I 've used the expedited shipping option to update my shipping option from 2-day Prime shipping to 1-day shipping , with an additional upcharge .

 Fits my Remington 1100 Shotgun perfect ! Replaced my old hard worn out one . I dont think I will ever use all 50 of them , but maybe some friends will need some .
 It is just what you would expect . Works fine , looks like good stuff . I go through a bunch of these on camp fuel stoves and bottles . Viton lasts much longer than NBR .
 I bought this part to use on the fuel pump plate of my bmw r1150r . I think it 's also the same part for 1100 too . It works just as well at fraction of the cost quoted by dealerships
 This seal works for early BMW oil filter stand O-Ring , not available from dealer . Or you end up buying new style housing which is a lot more .
 Just what I needed to fix my pool fill valve . 25 is a lot but now I 'm covered .
 Yes , this is the one you 've been hunting , and yes , my 91 geo 1.0 quit leaking from there . What to do with the extra nine ? Well , I do n't know either , but its hard to beat the price !!!
 Thanks for stocking these O-rings ; I could not find them locally . Just what I needed . Still arrived ahead of a few other items I ordered at the same time from other venders here on Amazon so I changed my review to five stars .
 I 'm always running for o rings for something now I have a stock at home .

 GREAT PRODUCT , HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT ! , GREAT GREAT GREAT THING YEAH ! GREAT THING YEAY!GREAT PRODUCT , HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT ! , GREAT GREAT GREAT THING YEAH ! GREAT THING YEAY !
 This is what you want . Economical and high quality . Works perfectly . Great alternative to the factory or firearms products . 100 rounds test proved perfect performance .
 I ordered these orings to repair my ford 6.9 diesel engine . I used them on the injector leak-off jackets to reseal them . They worked great and were a great deal .
 I had been going through o-rings on our tube filling machine like crazy . I had to replace it once a week or more often . I decided to order this 25 pack since it was so inexpensive . It 's been a month and a half and I have not yet replaced the first one of these . They seem to be extremely durable so far .
 Fast service and product as described . Fits an old Remington 1100 perfectly at a fraction of the cost of Remington replacements . That 's about all - they are just O-rings .
 Used to replace broken o-ring on a Remington 1100 12 gauge . Product fits perfectly and is of very high quality . At this price you basically have a lifetime supply ! Highly recommend !
 I was looking for an o-ring for my Remington 1100 and other places were asking $ 9 for 1 . You get 50 of these for less than that . My great grandkids will still have these o-rings for the gun lol .
 I was having blow back issues with my 12gauge , and all the suggestions pointed to my gas ports , and the O ring . Now that I have replaced it , I need to get out and shoot again . Hopefully this was the fix . The only draw back with this product , is that you receive a &#34; Costco &#34; supply ; more than enough for a lifetime .
 Used this to replace my o ring on my BMW 's DISA valve . O ring is not available from the dealer . Worked perfectly and solved my vacuum leak .
 AS MENTIONED BEFORE , THESE ARE BLACK OXIDE SCREWS , NOT STAINLESS AS PICTURED . These are very high quality YFS screws . I 've ordered 1000 's of them and they come exactly as described . Very good value !
 The screws are black -LRB- not silver as pictured -RRB- . The heads are also wider than a normal screw . Otherwise no issues .
 I am turning these into vent liners for my muzzleloader . With new vent liners running $ 2 to $ 3 a piece , it 's a grat bargain to make my own with these screws .
 I used this screw to fix my car door latch when one of the originals fell off . It fit perfectly and held up well over the winter .
 Not some sloppy fit , these screws are rough and tough and coarse threaded . Unless the price is abnormally cheap , as it was when I purchased them , I 'm sure not many people are going to be reading this . But I will say I have successfully used some of these fasteners . They work as expected .
 These are very high quality YFS screws . I 've ordered 1000 's of them and they come exactly as described . Very good value !
 The screws arrived on time and work well - just as advertised . We use them in a robotics class and the students often lose them or use too many . These replacements were an excellent buy , a lot less than those locally available . We do n't have anything like a `` mission critical '' application , more a simple classroom/hobbyist situation . They fit the bill fine .
 Arrived on schedule and did the job . We use a lot of these and are very pleased with the result & the product .
 Heavy , rugged , precision hardware , and priced better than I could find anywhere else . A true bargain .
 This tubing is perfect for my project - building saddlebag supports for my motorcycle.The tubing has a nice , thick wall , which is perfect for bending -LRB- and holding its shape -RRB- , and for welding or threading for screws/bolts .6061 Aluminum will also shine up nicely with a few minutes on a polishing wheel.Get the durability and rigidity of stainless , smoothness of chrome -LRB- not the luster -RRB- , without the cost!They 'll be behind the bags anyway , so who needs chrome plating ... a little polish and shine ... they 'll look great!Best part is the cost ... this tube was almost 1/2 the price of my local distributor , and none of theirs had 0.035 '' wall ... only 0.020 ''
 I 'm glad this item is carried on Amazon as I needed to make long custom standoffs for # 8 screws . Other places carry it too , but shipping price is usually more than actual product.Tube was nicely packed and of a good quality . It 's very ugly on the outside -LRB- looks dark oxidation -RRB- , however buffs great to a chrome like shiny finish ! Now I just need to figure out how to cut it to precise length pieces : -RRB-
 Tubing is very important to me and I must say , this is really good tubing ! It is nice to know that there are still people around who care about craftmanship . Thank you . Thank you .
 shipping was great , seller was great , im sure the product is excellent , but the info online concerning size for bike fender bolts was wrong for my bike , not a universal size ,
 Ordered to try as replacement ball mill belt . Outlasts the `` official '' belt by 10X and at 7 cents apiece versus $ 6 . Need ball mill belts ? Can not go wrong with this one ! Works with the very popular 3 # and 6 # dual drum mill .
 The wide variety of ring sizes available allowed me to pick the precise ring for my unusual application . I used the o-rings to replace the drive belts on an old movie projector
 I 'm using these for a mixed-media art project . They 're VERY durable -LRB- tried to break one by stretching it , and it WO N'T break -RRB- , and the dimensions are exactly as described . Thanks ! ~ G
