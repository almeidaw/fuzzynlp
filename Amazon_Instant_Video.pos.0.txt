 I initially bought the movie just because Stephen Colletti -LRB- who I 'm in love with -RRB- was one of the leads ... and I really did n't expect much from what looks to be a low-budget indie horror flick . But , I really did like it ! The lead girl who plays Jennifer -LRB- Nikki DeLoach -RRB- is really good . I ca n't believe I 've never seen her in anything before ? Maybe I have , but I did n't know !?! It was cool to see the guy from Weekend at Bernie 's -LRB- Terry Kiser -RRB- ... he is a really good actor . Too bad he was dead the whole time in both movies I saw him in , lol . Anyways , this was a cool movie and I 'm glad I got it !
