 These pants were way too big -LRB- looked about 2 sizes larger -RRB- , and they were incredibly stiff . They would have been very uncomfortable for my daughter to wear all day .
 I have bought dockers for years but these are cut smaller than they usually are . Even with the `` stretch '' waist band they are tight . So much for an `` extra '' inch . Beware . Try these in a store before you buy .
 I DID NOT GET THE SLACK THAT HAD THE WAISTBAND . I GOT SLACK WITH NO WAISTBAND , SO I SEND THEM BACK AN WAS TRYING TO GE A 42 29 BUT I RECEIVED A E MAIL STATETING THAT THE PRODUCT WAS NO LONGER AVABILITY . SO FAR I ` AM NOT SURE WERE MY REFUND WENT . PLEASE LET ME KNOW.TOM ATKINSON
 I agree , these are cut small ... Buy an inch or two larger than you normally do . The waist band does NOT stretch .
 I got the shippment quickly . But wrong items was sent . I have to return it to the seller . I got the refund pretty quick , but only for the value of product . I spent about & 10 for two way shipping without geting anything .
 Did not like the pants at all , and threw them in the trash rather than pay return postage . Flimsy , smelled of dye , cheap fabric , etc. . Too bad .
 Merchant was out of stock on the second pair of pants , so when it was shipped I was charged $ 9 again when the second pair was in stock weeks later.Will not buy from Amazon vendors again .

 Dockers are Dockers , so that 's not the problem . Just be sure you do n't trust the images if you choose to buy these via Amazon . `` Cafe , '' for example , should be `` Coffee .

 I have worn these pants for years ; my size is the same as always . I could n't get them on ; they were so tight I could n't get the button buttoned around the waist . What is going on ? These pants seemed to be cut for a skinny 25 year old , not someone who is a little on the hefty side . Further , the shipping and handling charges are just out of sight ... $ 16.95 above and beyond the already rather pricy product . I would not recommend doing business with this seller at all . You can go to other outlets and get the same thing without the shipping and handling , and there are `` deals '' out there from major store chains . I was really disappointed in this product and the seller . Go to WalMart and get their khakis ; they are very inexpensive and wear like iron .
 We purchased this bag for a vacation we were taking a cruise and we wanted to use it when we left the ship . The bag was convenient to carry , however the faux leather began peeling . At first it was n't so bad but then it became annoying because it then began flaking all over your skin and clothes . I would have rather the bag been a cloth bag with no flaking than the faux leather that I had to keep wisking away from my skin and clothes .

 I received this in the mail and followed the measurements on the site to get my size ... when it arrived I could not fasten it as it was too small ... AND THERE IS NO REFUND ... So I did n't wear it or use it ... and I am out $ 35.00 plus ... for the privilege of not getting the product I asked for ... one I could wear and use ... will not buy from this seller again
 i have had two children , the last one being born at over 10 lbs , so my ab muscles are stretched beyond self-repair . unfortunately , the only way i can get back my pre-pregnancy tummy back is with a tummy tuck . because i do n't know if i want to go such a dramatic -LRB- and expensive -RRB- route , i opted to try this based on other customer reviews . i am 5 '11 and 165lbs -LRB- size 12/14 -RRB- , back to my pre-pregnancy weight but i look about 5 months pregnant because my ab muscles are so stretched out . i do n't have any weight to loose , i just wanted something to slenderize my tummy area.to be fair to this product , it does help to hold my tummy in , although not all the way . i wore it every day for over a month and did n't loose a single inch -LRB- again , not that i have weight to loose , but what woman would n't take a smaller waist regardless of her size ?! -RRB- now , maybe it helps drop inches if someone does have weight to loose , but logically , would n't the same inches come off with a reduced diet and/or exercise ? i just do n't see how you can loose inches just by wearing it -LRB- although i hoped it would be a side-effect ... guess i was naive -RRB- . if it was really that easy , would n't the medical profession picked up on it by now & prescribed this instead of diet and exercise?anyway , the boning is uncomfortable ; i ended up cutting it out . the cincher still worked fine , and with the boning gone it was more comfortable . it kept me warmer -LRB- i 'm one of those people who are almost always cold -RRB- , but when i 'd take it off it felt wet and bleh from the perspiration it causes . kinda gross . overall i 'd say it gives the same slenderizing result any good quality cincher/shaper would give .
 I ordered the item according to the chart that was associated with the size and it ended up being to big . The item is also like it is made from rubber , but because I needed it for this weekend I do n't know what I am going to do at this point .
 I wore this for my wedding since I had n't lost all of my pregnancy weight . It was great for a little bit . But then started getting a crease around my waist . I ca n't wear it anymore . Plus it made me feel very sick if I wore it for more than a couple hours . They suggest wearing it 8 hours ? I could n't do it . As soon as I take it off I am instantly better .
 I think the concept is great but with this particular product , they have these sections that are thicker rubber -LRB- or whatever the material is -RRB- and it literally pushed into my ribs every time I sit down . I commute a lot and have a desk job so its not a very pleasant experience to have that pushing and bruising your rubs every day . It would 've been nice except for those thicker lines of rubber that are n't very flexible .
 After trying three different sizes , I still could n't find one that fit . I first ordered a medium and it would n't even come close to hooking so I went up to size to xlarge which was waaay to big , my last possible option would be a large and it was still huge , wish I would have sent it back but was just tired of the whole process and kept it . The hooks are a pain as well and it is way over priced ... there is a zippered option on amazon that is much cheaper .
 When I received this , not only was it way too small for me , the first and only thing I noticed was the horrible smell that came out of the packaging ! It was unbearable , sort of like a burnt rubber smell . There 's no way I would recommend this to anyone . There are definitely other products on the market that do the job !!
 The product did what it was `` supposed to '' which was to give me a waist , but it kind of just redistributed my fat . My waist was super tiny , but above and below -LRB- mostly below -RRB- I bulged like crazy , so I ended up just looking really oddly proportioned . My husband thought that I looked a little like an arthropod , so definitely not the sexy curvy lady that I wanted to be ... I guess this product worked for other ladies , but for me , it just looked really unnatural and odd .
 Please note that I ordered three of these items as gifts and was surprised to see that only one arrived in its original packaging -LRB- with plastic cover and without any signs of it being worn -RRB- . The other two had no plastic cover and had obvious streaks on the material . All three were advertized as `` New '' on Amazon site . Before you decide to buy new item , beware that you may be receiving item that someone else has returned so please inspect for any signs of item being worn -LRB- if fabric is stretched or not in its original plastic cover -RRB- . These items should be advertized correctly and not sold as `` New ''
 I 've been wearing the waist clincher for the last two years . I purchased a new one recently and it 's not the same type of material of the previous ones i 've brought . I thought maybe because i had lost weight , so i brought a smaller sizer , but that one did n't fit the same either . I thought i found a miracle when i first purchased the girldle through Amazon , but i have found my recent purchase has surely let me down ...
 When I first received this product I was plenty happy , I thought I had finally -LRB- after 8 years of switching from cincher to cincher -RRB- found the right one . It squeezed my belly enough that it actually got me to `` right-sized '' eating -LRB- whereas a lot of times I would get seconds , I found when I wore this cincher I could only eat one serving -RRB- , which of course is wonderful . I did n't mind that sometimes it bunched up , I did n't mind that sometimes it left welts -LRB- that went away shortly after I removed the cincher -RRB- , however , after about two weeks , on of the metal prongs came out , making the cincher essentially useless because it does n't hold it 's form . Even the cheap cinchers at Walmart held up better than this and cost only a fraction of what this cost .
 With the type of closures and the amount of compression it is meant to give it 's really difficult to put on . You need a hand to pull it closed in order to actually be able to close each of the 20 some odd hooks .
 I ordered according to the size chart for my measurements and it was way to small !! Very uncomfortable.I returned it ,
 The sizing is perfect and a medium fits just right . I am 5 ' 2 size 4 137 lbs before baby and i gained about 35 lbs during pregnancy , just an idea for sizing but keepin mind that everyone has different fat distributions on their bodies . I do n't like how my post baby fat was getting pushed up the top and makes me look like I have back boobs . The shape wear crunched up after you sit or bent over and so it does n't feel smooth all over . Squeem makes a vest version too so maybe that one will be a better choice for better coverage . If you do decide to purchase this product it 's easier to squeeze in if you lay on your bed and suck in your guts .
 I am 7 months postpartum with twins and still have a ways to go . I am 5 ' 4 &#34; , generally weigh around 135 but got all the way to 210lbs with the twins -LRB- they were BIG -RRB- . Right now I am hovering between 155-160lbs . I got the medium because my waist is right at 33 &#34; now -LRB- it 's usually 25-26 &#34; -RRB- . I had tried to use a different compression garment after the babies were born but it bunch up horribly around the waist . Additional stays were put in it - and it still did n't help . And it did n't do any good being all bunched around my middle . So after reading LOTS of GREAT reviews on this product - I decided to give it a try.I put it on as soon as I got it and had no difficulties getting into it . In fact , I was thinking I might should have gotten the small because it was n't THAT hard to get into . It was nice and snug , but it would n't have taken long for me to order the next size down . However , all it took was bending over to pick a baby up once and the bunching began . Within 15 minutes , it was completely bunched up all in the back and was starting to have a crease in the front as well . So - it took minutes to do what the Gabriella binder had taken several hours to do . The stays that are supposed to help it not roll and stay put are extremely flimsy . Needless to say - I printed out my return label that night and sent it back . I guess I 'm going to have to try a more body-suit type compression garment to keep from everything gathering around my waist . If you are naturally curvy - I do n't think this will work for you .
 I really wanted to like this . After all , I spent a pretty penny on it . I 'm 5 ' 9 '' and I 'm fairly thin . I 've had several children and wanted something to help cinch the midsection and prevent muffin-top . I have now worn this item for two full days . I so wanted to love this after reading other reviews , but in my case this device creates a bulge both above the `` girdle '' and below . As in , a little bulge of flesh protrudes between my bra and this device , which makes for an unflattering contour , not to mention painful pinching . Also , a chunk of flesh will sneak out below the device/above my jeans . So that essentially means I have an even more unnatural looking muffin top . As I said , I am 5 ' 9 '' . I 'm at most 130lbs . I went to their website and made sure to purchase the correct size . Still , it seems to be meant for a shorter woman . I imagine that if it came up to my bra and also met with or was below the waist of my pants , it might be better . But as it is I really think this device is designed with medium to short women in mind . I would NOT recommend this to taller or long-waisted women . Plus it bunches when I sit and creates a bubble appearance in my lower abdomen . As in , wrinkles in the girdle after sitting , plus a bubbling appearance in the lower abdomen . I have a fairly flat tummy and this creates bloat I do n't even really have ! Yuck ! NOT flattering to my figure . :-LRB- I 'm sorry I wasted the money . I found myself constantly adjusting it and eventually taking it off in a restaurant bathroom because it made me look worse than when I was n't wearing it at all . Not cool .
 I have ordered the Squeem on three different occasions , trying a large , medium and small as my size changed after having twins . Unfortunately , I was disapointed every time and I returned it after trying it on . I do n't know why I kept trying aside from desperation . It just gave me a very weird shape . Sure , it cinched in my waist at the sides but what I needed was to flatten my muffin top . I basically felt as if it squeezed my waist in and pushed all my &#34; excess &#34; down into the lower half of my torso making my muffin top even worse . I 'm giving the product the benefit of the doubt with two stars thinking maybe it 's just my body type that is the problem . I have a long torso at 5 '10 and 140lbs . Great product in concept but did n't work at all for me .
 This product does suck you in Great !! But the bones in here tore back back up , I had all kinds of bruising when I took this off after wearing it all day , they need to make one smooth with out the bones .
 I ordered this waist cincher specifically to wear on my wedding day with my beautiful sleeveless dress . Unfortunately , they shipped the WRONG thing , and now I am stuck with a big , bulky and hideous vest ! It has very ugly racerback straps , and I will definitely not be able to wear this under my dress . And the worst part , I 'm out the money ! I ca n't even return it for a refund , even though I have n't opened the box . VERY disappointed in this company . Buyer beware !
 I measure as a Small and the Small and Medium did NOT fit . Update
 I ordered a 3X , because that 's the size that the website said to order , it came and lacked about 8 inches closing ... so I looked at the package and it says I should have ordered a 5x ... seemed extreme , but I exchanged it.I was very impressed with the speed of the exchange , I 'll say that ... However , when the 5X arrived , it 's so big it just gaps and falls off ? So , was the 3X mislabeled , or is this 5x mislabeled ? I 'm needing something with some firm support for post surgery care ... so I really do n't know what to do at this point ?
 This corset makes me Sweat like a hog , I am not I 'm a petite woman just looking for structure to maintain a flat stomach . Theres no doubt it gave me a fantastic shape , was flawlessly discreet under my clothes but I was forced to stop wearing it , because by the end of the day it was very uncomfortable , hot and sweaty underneath . This was bad for my skin too , it made it dry and would have gotten red and irritated if I kept wearing it and for longer periods . It got to the point where it was pointless to wear because the was no breathing for my skin underneath it and I 'd want to take it off immediately , so I never wore it , and just gave up and returned it . Still looking for a perfect corset , this however is NOT it . Do n't waste your time .
 I made a lot of research on what kind of girdle should I get . I wanted to get it because I was about to give birth and a lot of people told me girdle is very helpfull getting your shape back . I had vaginal delivery and after that my belly was a mush . I asked for nurse to give me a hospital girdle and it was so awsome . I felt great with that . It was strechy fabric with velcro . This item I wanted wear out of the hospital , I took it off immediately cuz hooks were digging in and it was so thick underneath my clothes and had rubbery smell -LRB- I washed and dried it nicely prior to using it -RRB- anyways I gave another week later , it felt better but still thick . I wore it around the house and it was impossibble to care for baby , sit down , nurse or do whatever . it also had creased so I stop wearing it around the house and wore my hospital girdle . I wore it only to outside going out . It itched , made me sweat and smell like a rubbery sailor . I 'm in california but I ca n't even imagine wearing this during winter . It is just not worth the money you spend on this . I would recommend wearing a support girdle . Makes you feel better , I dunno if it contributes to getting your figure back but I 'm almost the same but this product did not help me at all . Simple cheap girdle from hospital did the job .
 I purchased this squeem after loving the squeem vest . I purchased the vest 1 week post partum . The smell did not bother me at all . It was very sturdy , strong and I loved how it made me look . There is a huge difference in my stomach from last child to this one . My last child left me still looking pregnant where this time I used the squeem and though I am the same pound wise , I no longer look pregnant which is quite nice . The vest sucks in your back fat so wonderfully . The only bad thing that I can complain about is that the hooks can be seen so easily under shirts and also that the boning after one month no longer seem to be holding the shape they once used to . Its rather uncomfortable to wear the vest now with the boning no longer doing its job . I purchased the regular squeem because it was 20 dollars cheaper . I was worried that I would go down a size as quick as I did with the vest . It is awful . It pushes all of my back fat up to the top and it looks rediculous . It rolls from the top and bottom . It is beyond uncomfortable . Nothing like the vest . The vest and its support were so welcome after my csection . If you are going to purchase this , purchase the vest if you are at all obese .
 Perhaps I got a bad one ? A factory second ? For the first 3-4 days I wore mine , it was great , just as advertised , helped me fit into those pants that are just a tiny bit too snug around the waist . I was very happy and it helped me concentrate on my posture , too , although it was very difficult to turn in the car seat when backing out of a parking space ! However , I put it on today , and while my left side is all smooth and nicely held in , the support thing -LRB- bone or whatever -RRB- under my right breast seems to have lost all its firmness . My entire right front is pushing outwards on that , making a vertical bulge ; whereas my left side is still firm and compressed . I do n't know what could be happening .
 It holds things together but the boning gets uncomfortable , would have been better without it . It also folds in with the fold of my stomach , which I did n't want , so it does n't get that pooch area as well as I would 've liked . I guess if you just want to tuck things in to wear a dress this would be good , thats about it .
 The Sizes run really small , It flips up even though , they said it would not and the hooks do n't hold . I am very dissapointed .
 I purchased this item to wear postpartum . I love how it fits and how well it smooths things out post baby . The major downside to this is the poor quality . The eye portion of about five of the hook/eye closures has come out entirely . I know that this is not a sizing issue because I followed the sizing for the product and it 's only select ones that appear to not have been sewn as well as the rest . Very disappointing for what would have otherwise been an awesome product that I could recommend to others , to instead be a waste of my money !
 This would be great if it had boning in it . I am not sure if this os because i have a very pronounced hour glass figure , but when I put it on , the fabric slides the the waist and it has the same effect as if I had a rubber band aroun my waist , forming a bulge above and below my waist . Too bad - I had hoped this would work based on reviews .
 My size medium was true to size . This made my waist smaller and while I had it on , I did n't eat as much because of the pressure , it makes me feel full ; however , all of the cinchers do this as it is its purpose . I did like the fact that it 's shorter from the lower back and a bit longer on the tummy ... BUTTT ... a HUGE BUT for me ... What I did n't like was that it made big bulges of fat on my upper back -LRB- eewww ! -RRB- ... and I do n't even have back fat !!! So to me this defeats the whole purpose ! All it did was cover my stomach fat but GAVE me back fat !!! Also , what 's going on with the price increase ?? I just bought this 3 weeks ago for $ 30 , now it 's $ 45 !
 The product overall was comfortable and did shape nicely . The problem is that after only 1 day of wearing the product was bunched at the waist and the interior supports were bent without repair . I contacted the company and they did say I had the correct size and to wear a tank under the Squeem to help with bunching . This did n't help the bent supports and I returned the product .
 I own the vest squeem and I absolutely love it !!!!! But this waist cincher is not for me . I 'm not gon na say do n't buy it because alot of women are shaped different.I just got it yesterday and I 'm sending it back . It fit well until my back fat overlapsed over the top of the cincher and thats not attractive at all . So if you know you have more than enough back fat , this is not for you . I tried to adjust it by pulling it up or down and that didnt even help . I wear a size medium , so its my correct size . But it doesnt give me the full coverage support that the vest gives me . The vest covers all the back fat and everything . But I still give Squeem thumbs up though !!! : - -RRB-
 I think this product provided a great fit . I was able to hook on the first row by myself within about 5 mins max . It was n't quite as difficult to get on as I thought it might be , although it is n't particularly easy either . I tried it on and wore for about 2 hours , and then the 2nd time I wore it had it on for about the same period of time . I took it off and one of the metal boning pieces had popped through and was hanging out at the bottom . This product is far too expensive to have something like that happen . The fit on me was snug , but I am sure I had the correct size . Now I have to figure out how to get this resolved .
 The package says it goes from lower belly to just under bust . I am a short woman and it does n't reach my ribs leaving me with two huge rolls of fat on the front and back . It takes me in great , love that about it but because it is n't long enough I ca n't wear it anywhere : -LRB-
 Held my tummy in when I tried it on but was way too stiff ... the boning and the hooks showed through , so could not even wear it inside a tshirt . Was tough to wear and I was scared of pinching myself while wearing it
 I bought this product based on the positive reviews . I wish I had n't bought this waist cincher . The bottom of the cincher ends in a weird triangle , which goes about 4 inches on my thigh , the bottom wrinkles up and looks ugly , it is extremely visible under a normal t-shirt , and it looks TERRIBLE if you sit down while wearing it . This looks decent -LRB- barely -RRB- when you 're standing up , and you might as not wear it if you ever need to sit down . The length is way off , it goes 4 inches down to my thigh and up to an inch from my armpits . I 'm 5 ' 3 and weight 125 lbs . This looks terrible and I 'm sending it back the same day it was delivered . Save your money .
 I bought a pink rubber squeem which had a seperate cotton cloth . That worked well , but i wonder why i dint buy the same and ended up with this . This product hurts me on my left hip and i got scars on my left hip . . : -LRB-
 Product is as shown but they didnt have it in stock and it took them almost a month to ship . And then instead of sending next day to compensate they sent it regular mail so it took another week to receive . Not too happy with their customer service .
 So to begin with , I 'm quite skinny but have always suffered from a large belly , which makes me look 4 months pregnant . I finally decided to look for a shape wear after one of my managers at work asked me if I was pregnant . The reviews for this product were amazing and I decided to give it a try . I had High hopes for it . Let me just say that the shape wear folds upon itself every time I wear it , so that there are visible lines which you could see through my clothes . It does an okay job of holding my belly in -LRB- could be tighter -RRB- but anyone looking at me can tell that I 'm wearing this underneath which defeats the purpose of wearing it in the first place . Also , it tends to be slightly too long for me and has become even looser upon wearing it frequently . Now it could be that I should have chosen a Small and this is too big for me . But , I did follow the size guidelines prior to ordering it . I normally wear a size 6-8 so I thought a medium would suit me best . I 'm somewhat disappointed with my purchase . I would want to give the small a try but hesitant to waste another 50 bucks on a useless product .
 I went by the Squeem chart and my waist measurements to find the correct size but to my suprise the waist cincher did not fit . Warning , you can not return for a refund ; only merchandise credit/exchange . Also , the cincher smelled like burnt rubber . Very bulky and will be visible through clothing so you can not wear with tight fitting clothing .
 I bought this to slim down my tummy under a bridesmaid dress . First , it smelled horrific and still stunk like rubber after washing . Second , it did almost nothing to slim me down , even though I bought the suggested size . Third , after about a half hour of wearing it , it was absorbing sweat and making me feel clammy and uncomfortable . It was extremely uncomfortable to sit down in , and the boning showed through the relatively thick cotton of the dress . I abandoned it completely and felt much better .
 Too tight , wanted to help me get back in shape after my baby , could n't even close the whole thing!Returned it ASAP
 The product states that inches will be removed after 30 days of use and I have worn this item everyday for at least 12 hrs per day and I have not seen any kind of difference.For the price of the item , it is disappointing when it advertises and does not comply .
 The shape wear is difficult to put on and you can see the seams through your clothes . It is hard to bend over , especially as a school teacher ! I would definitely like to try Brooke Burke 's Belly Taut instead of this old school shapewear !
 This product sucks!It does n't completely suck ... the 2 days I was able to wear it before the boning snapped in half it did compress pretty tight . As many people have noted , it is HELL to get into this the first time.I liked that this was n't a body suit and the rubber on the outside would keep my shirt from sliding up.BUTThis garment :1 -RRB- Rides up - if you move a lot it will eventually slide up your waist2 -RRB- Leaves a huge crease on the skin above your waist -- and it hurts3 -RRB- Makes you look like a sausage when you sit down
 It was really easy to put the Squeem on , but once it was on I could n't wait to get it off !! It was n't too tight or anything . The problem was that once I stood up straight it bunched up in the hip/mid back area and pinched my skin ! It was so painful ! No matter how I positioned it , it would bunch up ! Really disappointed since it was a waste of $ 50 . .
 i 've only worn it for 2 days to work -LRB- ~ 8 hours the first day , ~ 11 hours the second -RRB- and i really wished this had worked out . the first day i wore it i noticed it gave me a muffin top on top , so i had a roll of fat over the top of the cincher - not flattering at all . i wore a cami shapewear over it to smooth it out , which worked fine , and my coworkers/friends said it definitely gave me a smaller waist when i told them i was wearing the cincher . the entire day , however , it gave me a stomachache - not the &#34; need to go to the bathroom &#34; kind , not even really cramps , but the &#34; i feel nauseous , &#34; almost flu-like type of stomachache . very unpleasant . it also dug into me uncomfortably whenever i was sitting down . the second day i decided to wear the cincher over the cami , hoping it would be a little better . it was not . same unpleasant stomachache , same bunching and digging into my sides whenever i sat down . on top of that i got a rash -LRB- probably just from the first day , since it was worn over something else the second day -RRB- and now my stomach and back is all itchy and red = / it definitely cinches your waist , but as other reviews have mentioned , can just end up giving you a muffin top , and a rash from just one day of wear . and for me , it made me feel sick without actually being sick . very unfortunate as now i have to look for other shapewear to try : -LRB-
 This shape-wear is the best I 've had until now regarding easiness to wear and put-on . It does a great job at keeping the post-pregnancy flabby belly under control . However , after about 2 months of daily use , the metal that gives the support is coming out from the fabric . It seems that the metal is rubbing out the fabric and thins it enough to come out . I wish there was a better designed support for this binder . Otherwise , it is awesome - good looking for such lingerie . So , if you buy it , expect 2 months of wearing it without problems ...
 I really wanted this item to work because everybody seemed to love it . It did n't hold anything in on me and it gave me back boobs . Waste of money for me .
 Ugh . I wore this cincher for about two months before chucking it to the garbage . It seemed to work fine for the first few weeks but eventually it 'd get more and more bunched up at my waist and would pinch my skin like crazy -LRB- the brand name should be `` Scream '' rather than `` Squeem '' ; yes , it 's that bad -RRB- . Also , this will only compress your soft tissues so it will eventually give you a `` cut in two '' look with the aforementioned bunching up . Since these things are important for the sake of comparison , I do n't have a lot of fat around my abdomen but my waist is not naturally very shapely.If you are interested in waist reduction or body shaping , get a corset . Really , they have decent ones for as low as $ 99 and not only they will be way more comfortable , but also give you a nice tapered hourglass shape . You do n't even have to wear it every day . Cinchers like the one on this page have plastic boning which warps and deforms with the heat of your body so your expensive piece of formwear gets reduced to a useless crumpled mess with normal use . Modern corsets on the other hand , have flexible steel boning which stays firm while gently molding to your shape . You can also put them on in about 3 minutes so you do n't need a maid like in the olden days to cinch you up.Having worn a corset pretty much every day for the last three months and being very happy with it , I 'm glad I dumped this Squeem cincher for good .
 When I ordered this I thought it would allow me to wear some clothes that I have n't been able to do in a while because of my weight gain.I am a woman who has size 40D in breasts so I wear a large in tops and I wear a size 8 in pants , and weight 140lbs . It is suppose to clinch your waist and give you a nice looking figure . Well , it did hug my waist , but it also gave my a muffin top . Not a shape a woman wants to have . I looked better without wearing it . It folds into your folds creating a bigger fold at the top of your body . I would say this item is more for the extremely skinny female who has small breasts ' , no hips , or ass . Not for a woman who has large breast , hips , and ass . Not for women who are going through post-pregnancy either . For a product thats is suppose to make you feel good about yourself , it failed .
 Squeem Shapewear definitely does the job of sucking you in . However , I found that the rods painfully poked me on the side and ultimately resulted in a wound . Not worth the pain .
 I think this is a case of my expectations being too high . I was so encouraged by the great reviews of this product , I really was expecting a miracle . After only wearing this twice , it is stretched out . At first , I thought perhaps it would regain it 's shape after a few hours but nope ! It 's no better than a cheap , fashion corset . It will smooth things out so there 's less bulging under the clothes but I was looking for a real `` waist trainer '' , something that would go on tight and STAY tight . Considering I found this product when I searched specifically for `` waist trainer '' , I would say the claims of this product are misleading . It is shapewear , it is NOT a `` cincher '' or a `` trainer '' .
 I washed it before used it for the first time . The next day I wore it , I found my skin were itchy all over place on my stomach . And I feel that the heat on my body trapped on that .
 The squeem is a great idea but the construction is not the best . While the product compresses your stomach , the inner metal spines bend and then protrude at the ends . I have had to sew the ends repeatedly but the spines keep poking through . At one point , the spine developed some sort of crack and when it poked through the bottom , it scraped my stomach and I took it off immediately . I have never washed the product in the washing machine ... I have always handwashed it . So , the manufacturer ca n't say that I did n't take good care of it .
 I ordered this product to slim down my stomach . I was looking for something I could wear all day with my jeans as well as underneath my dresses . I wore the squeem to work occasionally and then I would take it off when I got home . When I would take it off , I felt sore around my sides and my back , I washed the squeem several times and even wore it on the other side thinking this would help but it did n't . One night after work me and some of my coworkers went out for drinks so I ended up keeping the squeem on for about 14hours instead of my normal 9 hours . That night when I took the squeem off I had blisters and bruising on my side and back which have now left black marks -LRB- I 'm black -RRB- on my body . I read other review before I purchased the squeem and I did n't see anything that alerted me not to buy it . Not sure why this happened but if you read this and it happens to you do n't say I did n't warn you !
 Before purchasing this , I saw where at least several other reviewers commented on the plastic boning -LRB- the plastic strips that run down inside of the cincher to give it shape -RRB- bending or breaking . You always think that maybe they just got flukes -- but the two front bonings on mine broke the first day I wore it . I know that I got the correct size because I also consulted the sizing charts on Squeem 's independent product site . I am also not particularly large -- I ordered the medium because my natural waistline is 33 inches post baby . It may be that this is a good product if you plan to wear it for only an hour or two and mainly standing up -- but if you sit for any length of time , the cincher will bow in at your waist and put a good deal of pressure on those plastics pieces . The pieces broke exactly where that pressure mainly occurred . The independent website stated that the cincher can be worn 8-10 hours -- but apparently it is n't actually made to withstand any duration . Or , perhaps mine was a fluke . But you have to wonder just how resilient thin plastic strips are really going to be on what is essentially a corset ? Thumbs down from me -- I will be contacting the company because this product is not fit for the purpose for which it is advertised and sold .
 I am 5 ' 6 '' , approximately 230lbs , and most of that is in my bust , hips , and booty . This leads to my back having a rather severe curve where my butt starts , making my torso seem shorter than it is.I was hoping for firm all around control with the Squeem so I would look fabulous in my Halloween costumes for various events . I got a bit less than that.The Squeem shipped on time , packaged in a nice box and clear bag . There was a faint rubber/latex smell when I first unwrapped it , but that 's expected . The product has four PLASTIC bones , two at the front-flank and two in back , which are heralded as incredibly flexible in reviews . They are , but for us big girls that is n't a good thing . I could n't find anywhere on the product page that mentioned the boning as plastic , either.The material between bones is strong but deceptively stretchy . The material , the flexible boning , and the distance between the bones all conspire to roll with your rounded bits instead of flattening them out , which creates an even bigger mess if you ever bend over or do more than walk and stand upright.I wore mine for about three hours on errands , and I had to stop to take it off , because the Squeem had shifted as I moved ; the bones curved in , digging into my back in a pinched U-shape , and the material had wrinkled painfully against my back . The product has mostly kept the wrinkles , and the bones are quick to curve into me again when I 've tried it on since . Besides that , it simply does n't give me any sort of attractive shape . It bulges oddly at my back and sides , does n't tuck my tummy much , and sometimes gaps right under my bust.It also did n't have the sweating effect that other women seem to have had , but I did n't buy the Squeem for that , so it does n't strike me as a flaw . What is a flaw is that the two neoprene exercise wraps I own make me look better than this shapewear , sadly . Big gals , spring for a steel-boned waist cincher instead , and leave this one to the girls with a bit of spare tummy .
 The Squeem is a great idea , but their quality is second rate , and their customer service is worse than useless . I 'd owned mine for about 4 weeks and worn it only a few hours a day when I noticed that a seam was coming unstitched . The threads are n't frayed ; they 're unstitching from the seam.Contacting customer service has been an exercise in futility . They 've asked for pictures of the damage , and then failed to respond to the pictures , or any further attempts to contact them.For what this costs , it needs to last longer than 4 weeks .
 I was really unhappy with this . I followed what others said and ordered based on my prepregnancy size . It was WAY too small at 7 weeks post-pardum . I 'm ten weeks post-pardum and may try it again but it was a real self-esteem crusher initially . I 'm a size 0 pre-pregnancy and so I thought it was fair to order the XS but I guess not .
 Hello ! I am a woman nearing my 60s , and my waist certainly is n't getting any smaller ! I purchased this product in the hopes that it would shrink my ever-growing belly . To accommodate for my girth , I bought the Squeem `` Magical '' Lingerie Shapewear in XXXXX-Large , the largest size available . WELL , here 's a bit of magic for ya , sisters . The second I snapped the first two hooks together , the tightness was unbearable . It felt like it was squeezing my waist fat straight down to my giant ass . Fortunately , the discomfort did n't last long , since the hooks flew off and therefore ruined the Squeem altogether . These things need to come in larger sizes . Not even worthy of 1 star . More worthy of steaming diarrhea .
 But the Lord said to Samuel , `` Do not look at his appearance or at his physical stature , because I have refused him . For the Lord does not see as man sees ; for man looks at the outward appearance , but the Lord looks at the heart . `` 1 Samuel 16:7 This is the verse I read this morning before getting the squeem delivered . I 'm so glad God 's truth was fresh in my mind . Because once I put the squeem on I was light headed & got instant acid reflux . It made me realize that the worlds opinion of me does n't matter , epecially in light of God 's truth.Origionally I thought I could wear the squeem to help pull my abs together during exercise . It became clear to me that this device was not intended to be worn during exercise . It 's for looks only . Personally , if looking `` good '' according to someone 's superficial standard was the goal , score . But what is the price we are willing to pay to deceptively impress others ? Is this really worth it ? Why?If I want to impress others I will not be worried how my stomach looks in my clothes . I will be looking to help others , to be kind or to share an encouraging word . LADIES & GENTS if you truly and honestly want to impress others , take your eyes off yourself . The reality is that no one is really thinking about how you look in a tight shirt anyways , they are too busy thinking about themselves . Beauty comes from within . SMILE , LAUGH and be JOYFUL . That is true beauty .
 I liked how it pulled everything in ! I felt fantastic for about 2 hours . it really flattens the tummy area , which is all I really want , but you can see the hooks threw clothes :-LRB- I felt like that ruined it for me , also I had to keep pulling it up . It bunches in the back , and really smells like rubber . After about 5 or 6 days one of the `` bones '' on the inside broke and was stabbing me in the side ! it really hurt . I would not recommend this product .
 Packaing process took days , but the shipping was super fast -LRB- I got mine yesterday -RRB- . I love the color and washing was n't a big deal . I was aware of the sizing since I never order any clothing online but the reviews said to order one size smaller than my normal size , so I ordered a small . The booklet said to wear only for one hour for starters and gradually build up the hours as days go by . Putting on the cincher was n't a problem but feeling my ribs being crushed like a sandwich was a problem . And my back -LRB- kind of -RRB- feels sore -LRB- and this is suppose to make a back feel more supported ? Eh ... -RRB- after removal . Well obviously it 's suppose to compress but I 'm not so sure if it 's even ok to have my ribs squeezed like a bottle of ketchup -LRB- and ending up feeling quite sore from the squeeze as if I had finished a hard core ab work out for 2 hours straight -RRB- . I should have ordered a medium , but maybe the cincher will wear out after many uses . For now , I 'll just use this cincher for a short period of time and see if there will be any change -LRB- s -RRB- . **** Minor Edit **** I 've discovered wrinkles around my tummy area after wearing this . ... Not very happy to see that coming . **** Minor Edit # 2 **** The wrinkles were temporary . I suppose my body is n't used to being compressed this much . Anyway , I have been using this sparingly and I am -LRB- a little -RRB- content about losing a few inches off my waist . However , my flabby tummy is n't getting much results . Hmm , maybe I 'll wait for a while longer .
 It did n't do much to slim the midsection and all it does is pretty much push everything up to the top , making your breasts and back look MUCH wider . If I do continue to wear it , it will be around the house or under loose clothes/jackets .
 The product worked fine on the first day and now it does n't work as described on the advert . I 've never been so sore -LRB- both side -RRB- in my entire life . I can not wear it for more than 2h . Other then the product itself , the delivery system was also misleading I choose a 5-8 days delivery when i placed the order but the product was delivered a month later . What made me even more annoyed was the fact that I had to pay for the post charges because apparently the sender did n't use correct stamp or pay the full charge . : @
 the first day , -LRB- 8 hours wearing it -RRB- it hurt me so bad , my skin was torned , itched , swell , deep red . I tried to wear other side , after few hours , I got deep burned both on the right and left belly , the skin was torned , swell , bleeding , lot of cross cut on the skin , itched for a week until now . It looked like I was beaten up or have skin disease ... I am scared to dead when I look at it now . I do n't know why I got it , I used something like this before , but I did n't get any bad thing . or the rubber hurt me ?
 My wife loves it but we unfortunately perchaced the wrong size . She made a coment about the sizing chart being in dress sizes and she picked the size she is and we received it and the apparel was way too small . We have been meaning to exchange it but its tough to get time being as we have new born twins . That 's why she wanted the apparel . She was really excited to receive the part and was disappointed when it did n't fit .
 So according to the size chart on the box size small is for waistline 28-31my waist is 28 so i got the smallit does not even come close to being able to close and clasp!maybe it 's just me but i am terribly disappointed
 I read up on belly-wrapping after my c-section and bought a couple compression tank-tops from Wal-Mart , which worked nicely . I wanted something without straps and something with more compression and purchased the Squeem Perfect Waist on Amazon after reading rave reviews . When I received it and tried it on , it felt disgusting on my skin . It was uncomfortable and totally noticeable -LRB- even without a super-tight or thin shirt on -RRB- , especially when I sat down . The seams and the boning are all very noticeable , and the rubber makes clothes catch and stick in a really weird way , like something would stick to you if you were really sweaty . I have wore corsets for years , and this is by far the grossest feeling and least comfortable thing I have ever put on my body . I returned it immediately .
 Felt great until it dug into my waist while sitting causing damage to my surgical site . Now I 'm in pain with and without it on .
 This product was not what I expected so I returned it . Too tight , sizing was misleading . I 'll stick with my Spanx .
 Usually a size XS to S but this girdle 's small did not fit true to size . Had to return back to Amazon .
 Just to state , I am using the Squeem for waist shaping , not weight lose . So I ca n't say how great it works for that.I 've had mine about three weeks now . I wear it at least 12 hours a day , which is more than recommended . But so far , I 'm already starting to slowly keep the shape in my waist . I love it ! It keeps me looking my best in clothes and does n't show too much even if I wear it under tight , thin clothing . I 'm actually not ashamed to wear it , and I 'll wear belly shirts with this under it . It 's a great fashion item that every woman should have . After most women keep the shape over time , they stop wearing it every day and only wear it for maintenance . However , this has been GREAT for my scoliosis . I have n't had a day of back pain since buying it ! I plan to wear these wonderful things for the rest of my life!At first , it was pretty tight and hard to move around in , but now it 's so comfortable I can even do my ab workouts in it -LRB- it gives you that extra burn during a workout ! -RRB- I 'm so glad I bought this over a corset , because it 's so easy to put on and take off . You can wear it for anything.My friend also bought one when I did , but hers had some messed up stitching and tore pretty bad down the side . We contacted Squeem and they seem like they 're going to send her a new one . Hopefully it is n't a common problem.Do NOT buy one from the seller Lord Shopping . They did n't put mine in the mail until three weeks later after I e-mailed him , and then made it seem like it had been lost in the mail the entire time , as if I ca n't see the timestamps on every action he does on Amazon . Terrible seller . Will definitely be buying direct from amazon next time . *** EDIT *** USELESS FAKES BEING SOLD *** BEWARE !!! *** I 've had my Squeem about three weeks and it is BROKEN . One of the bonings came out , so now my much-needed back support is non-existent and it completely rides up on my side . When I looked at the boning , it was also rusted . I realize now that this is NOT A TRUE SQUEEM , but a cheap rip-off sold for about the same price . I will buy from one of the websites listed at Squeem.net now to assure I get the real deal . This explains why my friend 's ripped in half so easily , too . Also , despite how consistently I 've worn it , it has n't done much to shape my body , even though the official Squeem promises losing at least 1 inch in a month . With this , I have n't lost anything and still have a wide midsection . This does n't even conceal my lower stomach pouch that I had , and it did n't start to go away until I made even more intense dieting and exercise changes . A REAL Squeem would have at least brought it in a little bit , and while this is tight around my curves , it just sits on top of my lower belly.Thankfully , Amazon was great and refunded my money . It has still caused me so much trouble however . I was trying to get a little bit more curve to my shapeless body before bikini season , and with the time I 've wasted on this thing , I still feel insecure with my body and summer is here.Not all sellers here are putting out knock-offs with a Squeem tag , but I would go to Squeem 's website just to be sure you get the right item .
 It 's pretty awesome for such a price ! It definitely gives you great posture , I was sitting up straight like no other ! although i wish they could improve on the rubber smell otherwise it 's wonderful ! ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ was my review when i had it for 15-20 days , now -- after ordering it on Jan , 21 , 2012 -- it 's SO useless . I 've washed it with care , it smells like rubber , and it 's pretty nasty . I 'd rather pay $ $ $ and buy something that works the way it should .
 The German Pinscher is a wonderful Family pet and this type of comments makes them sound dangerous . I own 3 German Pinschers and they are wonderful pets . I resent this type of product .
 I agree , these are cut small ... Buy an inch or two larger than you normally do . The waist band does NOT stretch .
 I got the shippment quickly . But wrong items was sent . I have to return it to the seller . I got the refund pretty quick , but only for the value of product . I spent about & 10 for two way shipping without geting anything .
 Did not like the pants at all , and threw them in the trash rather than pay return postage . Flimsy , smelled of dye , cheap fabric , etc. . Too bad .
 Merchant was out of stock on the second pair of pants , so when it was shipped I was charged $ 9 again when the second pair was in stock weeks later.Will not buy from Amazon vendors again .
 If you search for Super Saver shipping this advertisement comes up , but this product is not shipped by Amazon is does not go out with the Super Saver shipping , and the cost of shipping is nearly 20 % the cost of the pants .
 I have bought dockers for years but these are cut smaller than they usually are . Even with the `` stretch '' waist band they are tight . So much for an `` extra '' inch . Beware . Try these in a store before you buy .
 I DID NOT GET THE SLACK THAT HAD THE WAISTBAND . I GOT SLACK WITH NO WAISTBAND , SO I SEND THEM BACK AN WAS TRYING TO GE A 42 29 BUT I RECEIVED A E MAIL STATETING THAT THE PRODUCT WAS NO LONGER AVABILITY . SO FAR I ` AM NOT SURE WERE MY REFUND WENT . PLEASE LET ME KNOW.TOM ATKINSON
 I have worn these pants for years ; my size is the same as always . I could n't get them on ; they were so tight I could n't get the button buttoned around the waist . What is going on ? These pants seemed to be cut for a skinny 25 year old , not someone who is a little on the hefty side . Further , the shipping and handling charges are just out of sight ... $ 16.95 above and beyond the already rather pricy product . I would not recommend doing business with this seller at all . You can go to other outlets and get the same thing without the shipping and handling , and there are `` deals '' out there from major store chains . I was really disappointed in this product and the seller . Go to WalMart and get their khakis ; they are very inexpensive and wear like iron .
 Dockers are Dockers , so that 's not the problem . Just be sure you do n't trust the images if you choose to buy these via Amazon . `` Cafe , '' for example , should be `` Coffee . '' Despite the fact that the image for `` Cafe '' shows a stone or very light gray color , `` Cafe '' is actually dark brown . So the product is n't defective , but IS misleading
 The band was far too thin and would roll down my leg continuously . I returned all pairs I bought for a refund . Very disappointing for a Jobst product .

 Purchased these socks looking for the right balance of light construction and cushioning . I found only the light construction part . While they seem durable enough , the socks are way too light to provide an adequate barrier between my shoes and my feet . It 's easy to earn a blister on anything more than a short run.These may be just right for someone who does not punish their feet with marathons and triathlons , but just not substantial enough for me .
 These pants were way too big -LRB- looked about 2 sizes larger -RRB- , and they were incredibly stiff . They would have been very uncomfortable for my daughter to wear all day .

 I read a previous review that said hers got a run the first time she used them and I figured I 'd just be more careful ... mine got a run the second time I used them ! Unless you 're desperate , do n't bother . I expected better quality for the price I paid !
 I tried these Jobst 15-20 mmHg pantyhose in my search for high quality therapeutic support pantyhose for a severe circulation problem in one of my legs . I did find them a little difficult to put on , but once they were on they stayed in place nicely and provided great support.The only problem I had was , like the other review stated ... they ran the second time I wore them . For as expensive as these pantyhose are , they should last longer than 2 wearings.They are not too sheer , if that is something you are looking for in support hose . They look more like tights when they are on your legs . I did find the beige shade to be a little more like a pale nude shade .
 I have worn Jobst compression hose for a few years now . I havenever had a problem . I was thrilled when I had the option fora sheer pair ... great for summer . The third time I wore one pair , I got a hole in them . I am not even sure how that happened . I figuredI must have done something . I put on my backup pair and the first timeI wore them I developed a hole in them ... the same leg -LRB- right one -RRB- . Nowthat I see these posts I know I will never purchase them again .
 I put them on at the doctor 's office and the first time I had to take them off , sure enough , ran them . Otherwise , liked them very much .
 Having read the previous reviewers ' reports warning about how easily this product could develop runs , I was super careful and tried very much to make my expensive pair last . The first time I had this pantyhose on , I got a bad run that ruined this very expensive pair of hosiery ! Unbelievable !
 I ordered two in Cowboy Slim Cut 33x34 . I already had some Wranglers . The waist was way too small , the fly was off to my left in a really weird and very ugly and uncomfortable way . These were made in Mexico , just like the ones I bought at Target , but the badging was different , a rubber badge on the back right pocket , not the thin leather Wrangler badge at the rear right waist . Were these knock-offs ? Not sure . Returned them and went to Target where I got two pair for $ 15.99 each -LRB- they were Original and Legendary Gold , not Cowboy , but still , half the price , pard -RRB- !
 I got the black stockings in size A/B . They are way off too short . Almost 1 '' above my knees . I am 5 ' 3 '' and 125 lbs . Make sure you order at least one size up.I am also disappointed with the customer service . Shipping took exactly 2 weeks . I do not think I would like to order another thing from Essential Apparel .
 Went by the sizing chart and still did not fit right . Plus the way they explained the sizes really confused me . So maybe it was my fault , but I will be purchasing from someone who has the actual size I can understand .
 I loved the feel of the hose unfortunately the cotton lace top has no give and therefore is very uncomfortable and cuts into your thigh .
 I just got these stockings but the seller sent me a way smaller size -LRB- A-B -RRB- than I ordered , I e-mailed them telling them about the problem and will keep you dear buyer posted . I can not tell you about anything about the quality or color because I have not opened the ones I received .

 I DID NOT GET THE SLACK THAT HAD THE WAISTBAND . I GOT SLACK WITH NO WAISTBAND , SO I SEND THEM BACK AN WAS TRYING TO GE A 42 29 BUT I RECEIVED A E MAIL STATETING THAT THE PRODUCT WAS NO LONGER AVABILITY . SO FAR I ` AM NOT SURE WERE MY REFUND WENT . PLEASE LET ME KNOW.TOM ATKINSON
 I agree , these are cut small ... Buy an inch or two larger than you normally do . The waist band does NOT stretch .
 I got the shippment quickly . But wrong items was sent . I have to return it to the seller . I got the refund pretty quick , but only for the value of product . I spent about & 10 for two way shipping without geting anything .
 Did not like the pants at all , and threw them in the trash rather than pay return postage . Flimsy , smelled of dye , cheap fabric , etc. . Too bad .
 Merchant was out of stock on the second pair of pants , so when it was shipped I was charged $ 9 again when the second pair was in stock weeks later.Will not buy from Amazon vendors again .

 Dockers are Dockers , so that 's not the problem . Just be sure you do n't trust the images if you choose to buy these via Amazon . `` Cafe , '' for example , should be `` Coffee .

 I have worn these pants for years ; my size is the same as always . I could n't get them on ; they were so tight I could n't get the button buttoned around the waist . What is going on ? These pants seemed to be cut for a skinny 25 year old , not someone who is a little on the hefty side . Further , the shipping and handling charges are just out of sight ... $ 16.95 above and beyond the already rather pricy product . I would not recommend doing business with this seller at all .

 I read a previous review that said hers got a run the first time she used them and I figured I 'd just be more careful ... mine got a run the second time I used them ! Unless you 're desperate , do n't bother . I expected better quality for the price I paid !
 I tried these Jobst 15-20 mmHg pantyhose in my search for high quality therapeutic support pantyhose for a severe circulation problem in one of my legs . I did find them a little difficult to put on , but once they were on they stayed in place nicely and provided great support.The only problem I had was , like the other review stated ... they ran the second time I wore them . For as expensive as these pantyhose are , they should last longer than 2 wearings.They are not too sheer , if that is something you are looking for in support hose . They look more like tights when they are on your legs . I did find the beige shade to be a little more like a pale nude shade .
 I have worn Jobst compression hose for a few years now . I havenever had a problem . I was thrilled when I had the option fora sheer pair ... great for summer . The third time I wore one pair , I got a hole in them . I am not even sure how that happened . I figuredI must have done something . I put on my backup pair and the first timeI wore them I developed a hole in them ... the same leg -LRB- right one -RRB- . Nowthat I see these posts I know I will never purchase them again .
 I put them on at the doctor 's office and the first time I had to take them off , sure enough , ran them . Otherwise , liked them very much .
 Having read the previous reviewers ' reports warning about how easily this product could develop runs , I was super careful and tried very much to make my expensive pair last . The first time I had this pantyhose on , I got a bad run that ruined this very expensive pair of hosiery ! Unbelievable !

 This was purchased for my daughters halloween costume . BEWARE ! Very cheap material ! The sizes are different from what it reads online , and the pieces of the costume are different sizes . For example
 Item sizing was not consistent . Had to make modifications just to wear it and make it fit . Cheap and torn before could even use it .
 This costume is very flimsy , but the bright pink color is great . The only problem we had was the elastic on the mask was too short to fit my daughter 's head . So I cut it off and used glue dots to glue the mask onto a pair of sunglasses that I pushed the lenses out of . Perfect fit and much easier to wear !
 This was great as a Halloween Costume . however , after my daughter tried it on , one of the straps on the leg covers broke and the mask was too tight . Good for a one time use . My daughter enjoyed it .
 I received the package with missing main dress , belt and cloak -LRB- I received only the mask , gauntlets and shoes cover -RRB- I 'm an oversea customer and it will be very costly for me to return this item as already I paid the shipment fees to get this item.I sent them an e-mail on 1/11/2013 requesting to send me the missing items , BUT , they did n't respond till now !!!
 The material is thin thin thin which I expected from this kind of costume . The mask did n't really hold up for one halloween party and one night of trick or treating . The worst part was that the cape in the picture is big enough for the girl to hold with both hands but in reality it is n't that big at all . Also the velcro that holds the cape on did n't even hold up on Halloween night . Disappointing
 The price was cheap and so was a majority of the craftsmanship . Also , the belt was not in the package and we bought it new .
 I bought two of these bat girl costumes for my two daughters . The masks started falling apart after the first time wearing them . The material was so cheap it literally fell apart !!! I was SO disappointed ! By the time Halloween came I had completely redone the masks and stapled the silver belt back together.I have never rated anything before but I could n't help myself , I want people to know what they are buying .
 The sizing of this costume was fairly accurate but it very cheaply made . After only a few wears , the mask and belt both broke . I would n't recommend this costume .
 I ordered this for my average sized 8 year old . I purchased the medium -LRB- size 8-10 -RRB- and it is way too small . It 's too short , tight around the shoulders , the boot covers do n't cover her foot and the mask wo n't go around her head -LRB- not even close and again she 's 50 % ile in both height & weight for her age -RRB- . This size would be better for a 5 year old ! And if that is n't bad enough , the cape has a dark -LRB- non-removable -RRB- stain on it ! I 'm hoping I can return it w/o paying for shipping considering this item is damaged .
 The fabric is very common , the finishes are really bad , the mask was broken the first time , the layer has no seams , the fabric also is leadership , not what I expected .
 Was missing the belt for one thing was to small had to order another one just so she could use it they need to put the correct size on the item we ordered a 5-6 got ot and the item said fits size 4-5
 My costume was a small and did n't fit my 5 year old wayyyy to tight and it dd t come with the belt !!!

 I ordered this and realized I did n't specify the size so went back 20 min . later to cancel the order and then order another one.the shipping is 3/4 the priced of the item ! Then after what I thought was a canceled order did n't even work at all . I have been sending emails all day and tried to call them to no avail . Horrible communication . they took my money and have n't even responded to my email or phone call.Caveat Emptor

 Having read the previous reviewers ' reports warning about how easily this product could develop runs , I was super careful and tried very much to make my expensive pair last . The first time I had this pantyhose on , I got a bad run that ruined this very expensive pair of hosiery ! Unbelievable !
 I read a previous review that said hers got a run the first time she used them and I figured I 'd just be more careful ... mine got a run the second time I used them ! Unless you 're desperate , do n't bother . I expected better quality for the price I paid !
 I tried these Jobst 15-20 mmHg pantyhose in my search for high quality therapeutic support pantyhose for a severe circulation problem in one of my legs . I did find them a little difficult to put on , but once they were on they stayed in place nicely and provided great support.The only problem I had was , like the other review stated ... they ran the second time I wore them . For as expensive as these pantyhose are , they should last longer than 2 wearings.They are not too sheer , if that is something you are looking for in support hose . They look more like tights when they are on your legs . I did find the beige shade to be a little more like a pale nude shade .
 I have worn Jobst compression hose for a few years now . I havenever had a problem . I was thrilled when I had the option fora sheer pair ... great for summer . The third time I wore one pair , I got a hole in them . I am not even sure how that happened . I figuredI must have done something .

 It 's definitely not having the cutting as shown on the model . I ordered size M as that 's suggested on the the manufacturer 's site for size 6 . It 's way too big . I exchanged it for size S. I have 36 '' breast and 26 '' waist and it 's still way too big.The cutting is very bad as well . It 's just a giant piece of flat cloth and they did n't have the shape for cups . Thus once you tie up at the back , you will have a weird surplus of fabric underneath your boobs . Very ill fitting .
 This is a nice costume , but the material is quite cheap . Also , it makes my bust look strange -LRB- because the black part is right in the middle of it -RRB- . But the bottom part is really cute , I LOVE the polka dots on the inner layer of the skirt.I just do n't really like it , myself . I think it could be better .
 I decided to return this outfit because I did not have time to try and pin up the polka dot underskirt to make it look like the model 's costume . The underskirt hangs 2-3 inches below the top layer making the outfit look frumpy . The underskirt is sewn onto some black fabric that can be tucked up around the waist , but it does n't stay there -LRB- and it makes your waist look bunchy -RRB- . The laces are cute but are a pain to tighten to get the outfit to mold to my body -LRB- reference , I bought an x-small since I 'm 5 ' 4 '' , weigh 104 lbs -RRB- . Also , this outfit is extremely hard to take off , which makes a romantic night in rather difficult . Plus , I did n't want to have to put in bra cups to give me some curves up top . The cut of the top made me look flat -LRB- 34B -RRB- . I think this would work well for busty girls.The material of the costume is of the quality I expected for this type of thing . Overall it was cute -- but it just looks so much better on the model .
 This costume is poorly cut . Areas through the bust/underarms bunch up and wo n't lay flat . I have an average build -- not flat , and not busty -LRB- 35 B/C -RRB- . I ordered an XS . But while the waist fit , the bust area was tight and dug into the underarms .
 I bought this costume in hopes of wearing for Halloween -LRB- last year -RRB- . I had even separately purchased the duster -LRB- which I am now using to really dust things -RRB- . Uhh ... I tried it on -LRB- I got a X-Small -RRB- and its just big ... the net piece -LRB- part of the dress with the dots -RRB- go all the way down to almost my knees . Which makes it awkward and not sexy at all - its just weird I tried tucking the net part in to my undies to hold it , but it just becomes supper puffy - again looks weird . I never wore it and its still brand new sitting in my closet somewhere.Maybe its just for my body - I am not sure , but the material is n't as great either compared to the picture . Def . does not look anything close to how the model looks in it.Sorry - this was not a good buy at all . The model sure looks good in it .
 This was a gift , but the fabric was cheap and did n't look great on or last well . However It was fun , and I got compliments on it all night .
 Not as described , the material is cheap looking and does not feel soft on the skin . Was dissapointed of the quality and packaging .
 The suspenders I ordered were just what I was looking for and they were delivered in a timely fashion in time for my boyfriend 's birthday !

 I ordered two in Cowboy Slim Cut 33x34 . I already had some Wranglers . The waist was way too small , the fly was off to my left in a really weird and very ugly and uncomfortable way . These were made in Mexico , just like the ones I bought at Target , but the badging was different , a rubber badge on the back right pocket , not the thin leather Wrangler badge at the rear right waist . Were these knock-offs ? Not sure . Returned them and went to Target where I got two pair for $ 15.99 each -LRB- they were Original and Legendary Gold , not Cowboy , but still , half the price , pard -RRB- !

 This bra is completley worthless ! It offers absolutely no support , is cheaply made and does not run according to size . Do n't waste a penny on this . You will be disappointed .
 i ordered this item for support being that i have a rather large chest . the item had MUCH more coverage than the picture lets on and came in the size i ordered according to the tag but once i had it on i realised it was 3 sizes too SMALL . when i returned it to the sender the refunded only HALF my money . this item was ordered with one more bra like it and out of my $ 40 order i got just over $ 20 back . i plan on disputing this with amazon and the seller .
 I love the style of the bra , however I ordered a 46D in Black and the cup size of what I received was almost double in size . The label read 46D -LRB- which I know I wear -RRB- , but had to send it back because the cup was just too LARGE .

 This shirt was labeled Large , but it was more along the lines of XL to XXL . Unfortunately after paying extra shipping charges , I had to pay more shipping charges to return . I wo n't buy from this supplier again unless they offer free return shipping .
 I 'm sure these are great socks , but I was slightly disappointed when I thought I was getting 3 pairs for the price listed ... my package arrived and there was only one pair for the stated price . I feel like the image with 3 socks was deceptive and `` false advertising '' , as it states nowhere else how many pairs are sold for the stated price . Hope I enjoy the socks , but thought I 'd warn everyone else before they buy these and expect more than what you 'll receive .
 Package says one size fits most queen ... well what the heck is most queen because a 1x and a 3x are too different sizes , I am a 1x and this did n't fit over my curves .

 I really liked this briefcase until one of the buckles broke . I contacted the company that shipped the bag , something like ` Sports Accessories ' , not Rawlings . After 3 months of poor communication -LRB- and after I sent them the broken buckle upon their request even though I had offered to just buy a new buckle -RRB- they informed me that their service department was closing . I asked them to return the broken buckle , but no response . The story is longer than this , but as a result of horrible customer service , I now have a briefcase that i can not use .
 The bra is too &#34; molded &#34; for my taste . The cups are very thick and feel to the breast the way a helmet feels to a head . It does have a good basic design but I will be returning it because of the uncomfortable density of the cups .
 It felt like it was two cups smaller then what I ordered ! So they run a lot smaller . It was also very scratchy/stiff feeling .
 I have the Le Mystere Safari T-Shirt Bra and love it , but this bra is just not as good . The quality is not great ; the fabric is harsh and the cups of the bra are very stiff . When I tried it on , the bra separated my boobs very far apart . It made me look like a 1950 's housewife with cone boobs . No cleavage , total separation , very pointy . Just not attractive.As for the sizing , I did n't feel that the cups were too small . I am a 32 G in other Le Mystere bras and the fit was proportional . The cups just made my chest look unattractive .
 The elastic used for the band very easily loses it 's elasticity and thus loses shape quickly -LRB- after one wear I noticed the difference -RRB- . For a molded style , this bra loses it 's use after a week . It 's pretty but poorly engineered .
 I was n't thrilled with the fit of this bra . It was stiff and the edges were so pronounced that even my thickest sweater could n't hide them .

 Great looking bag . The compartments are the best I have had in a back pack . The support structure is poorly designed which leads to pressure spots on the shoulders and early failure of the seams . Baby it a little -LRB- avoid using just one strap with more than a lite load -RRB- and it should do ok for the price .
 I bought this backpack a while ago , despite my reservations about having the opening for the laptop compartment on the side . The obvious danger is to forget closing the zipper , and it wo n't take much for your laptop to go flying ... Naturally I tried to be careful about closing it , but one day I must have been distracted or in a hurry , and when I took off the backpack , my laptop fell on the floor . Many other computer backpacks also have a strap that secures the laptop , and prevents it from moving around ; this one does n't . Otherwise it is quite nice and comfortable , but I wo n't use it for laptop duty anymore .

 Useless , just a junk kit . Do not waste ur time or pennies on this item . If it was free and I had to checkin to sign up to get it , I would refuse it ! Junk !
 This review is for the Sunglass Eyeglass Repair Kit 77pc DELUXE Sold by
 The pic was so small - could n't see that it was exclusively screws - no nuts at all . I did n't lose my screws - I lost a nut on my glasses . How can you send out an eye class repair kit with no nuts ? Please send me some nuts for my eye glasses .
 the keychain is useful and works good , so if you are getting this to tighten up your glasses , its great . but i bought it to replace a cushion on my glasses . the screws are so small you can barely hold them in your fingers let alone secure it in place to try to screw it in , even with someone else helping me . you are better off getting your glasses repaired in a shop . but i do like the keychain .
 The case is pretty much useless . Nothing stays in the small compartments . I really dont know why they exist . The small screwdriver , both flathead & phillips are cheap material . You cant magnetize it in order to hold the screws which would make all the difference considering the size of the screws .
 I was quite surprised to find that about half the screws in this kit were defective in that they did not have any cut in the head for a screwdriver . They looked loke little threaded rivets ? No way to use them without a way to turn the screw . Quality rip off .

 When item was ordered it was in stock I waited 4 days that I could have ordered another item just to be emailed out of stock . The money was taken out of my account so I couldnt even buy anything else . very irritated I need this hat for a xmas gift wont be buying from this company again .

 I 'm dissappointed overall . I ordered 4 dresses back in march . they took two weeks to deliver though i was told 3-5 business days . we finally got the dresses first week of april . i went according to the size chart that they provided . the dresses ran small so we ended up needing to exchange out two of the dresses . that following monday -LRB- april 5 -RRB- we mailed the dresses back in with the papers to get them exchanged . another 2 weeks go by and i still do n't have the dresses . i 've contacted the manufacturer and no answer on the phone . i finally get through to them and they said they 're on back order . i did n't receive any notifications whatsoever that there was a hold up . on april 23 -LRB- almost 3 weeks later from the second shipment -RRB- we finally receive the other 2 dresses . now these run too big . ! we 're just going to have them personally hemmed to not go through any more trouble .
 I ordered this dress and was extremely disappointed . The fit was awful . It was tight around the waist but too large in the bust area . I even ordered the dress size based upon review comments . I did n't have time to exchange it and make needed alterations . Donated it .
 I wish there was a way I could give this ZERO stars . The quality is awful . The `` satin '' looks like pleather and the feel is disgustingly cheap.It also does not fit true to size . According to measurements , I fit into a size large . Apparently the tape measure they have at the factory is not the same as mine.Now , I 'm stuck with having to find a dress in less than a month .
 I ordered my dress for a wedding , and three weeks later it had n't come . I finally called the company , who then informed me that the size I ordered was out of stock . They did not bother to call or email me to let me know . They made no attempts to correct this huge mistake , and were completely unapologetic . After several other phone calls trying to get a dress from them , I finally just ordered the dress a size too big and figured I 'd take it in.If you do indeed manage to acquire a dress from this company , be prepared to have it altered . The sizing chart is in no way related to the actual size of the dresses . Every member of my wedding party had sizing issues with their dress.I have nothing good to say about this company .
 I ordered according to my size . The dress fit great except for the chest area was EXTREMELY to big and there was no way to alter the dress without ruining the style . Could n't exchange for smaller size as the rest of the dress fit great .
 This dress adds 100 lbs , i swear . It is a good price , but you would look better naked . It is unfortunate , but please save yourself and do not purchase this dress .
 I was trying to find a dress for the military formal for weeks . I had read the reviews for this particular dress and I was afraid it wouldnt fit . After searchinghigh and low for 1 nice dress to wear I just decided to order it and if it neededto be altered I 'd do it . It only took 4 days for the dress to be sent to me with regular standard shipping . I tried the dress on and it fit amazingly well . I dontneed to alter a thing . I paid 57.00 total and in a store for something like this I was looking at rediculous prices . I 'm going to have to say that I 'm very verypleased with this dress and for any other upcoming event I may just buy it again but in a new color . : - -RRB-
 This dress got here about when it was promised but it did not fit at all . I had been measured at a dress shop so I know it was n't my own error and there 's NO WAY I got measured wrong by 8 inches ! Just make sure you order bigger than you need .
 I ordered this product , because it was supposed to be `` plus size '' however it is it . i am a plus size girl , and this dress does not fit at all . It is a beautiful dress , but if you are looking for something plus size , this is not for you . I am very very disappointed .
 Living on the Gulf Coast of Texas , our winters are seldom cold - it rarely gets to 30 degrees . The description did not mention that these were heavy and designed for really cold weather . I now have useless sleepwear .
 we ordered these as part of a Halloween costume.It is very very flimsy and is literally falling apart after only a few minutes out of the box ... While it is `` light and safe '' as per another reviewer 's comment , kids will want to mimic sword fighting . With these , they seem to break just by lightly swinging them around .
 This thing does n't work at all - right out of the box ! Says to set to low temp for several minutes to begin ; 10 min later , not even warm.Description should indicate only way to get steam - for a second or two - is to mash the flimsy button on top , but then wait minute or two to get more . NO constant steam.Water reservoir would not detach to fill.Piece of cheap , worthless junk !
 Very cheaply/poorly made . Within two uses , water reservoir cap was broken . Could no longer use the steam as water leaked out . Would not recommend .
 Seams already have started to come apart . Have only being worn three times , , ! Very poor workmanship . Expected better.Do not know where to return product .
 Bought these as a Christmas gift for my husband . They have been washed 2 times and they are already faded , shaggy and the seams are coming apart on the legs . He wants to throw them away after only having them for 2 weeks .
 These pants were washed one time , following the washing instructions , they were not put in the dryer , and they shrunk not only around , but lengthwise . I had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and did n't have any problems . I look forward to your reply .
 very badly sized and ca n't return it since I washed it before trying it on
 Reading so many positive reviews for the Intimo Silk Pant , I treated myself to one on May 15 , 2010 . I received my maroon silk pant quickly and they seemed all the reviewers had said they were . I followed the advice of one reviewer and ordered the `` silk pant '' a size larger . I loved them -- they felt wonderful . I carefully followed the washing instructions , and all went well for over a month . Long enough for the return period to expire , as I was soon to discover . Then on a morning in late July , I removed my silk pant from the washer -LRB- only a year old -RRB- from a solo cleaning on delicate to discover a seven inch rip where the silk joins the waistband . First , I sent an email to `` Intimo '' customer service . Their reply was quick , and thanked me for the information but put the blame on Amazon . I contacted Amazon and discovered my time had run out , so shame on me . For a month they were wonderful sleeping pants . If you think that is enough time to justify the expense , well order one . If you do n't then look elsewhere for luxury sleep wear .
 I bought a pair in maroon and they were a little short but fine . The problem was that they started coming apart at the seams after 2 months . Will definitely be looking to a different company for a replacement pair .
 I have ordered these pants on and off for the past several years . At first , they were great , and held up well , though usually starting falling apart after about 6 - 8 months . Note - before commenting on the quality of the product , I want to stipulate that I followed the manufacturers washing instructions to the letter!At first I thought that being silk they were just more fragile than regular material . They ARE extremely comfortable . However , I started to notice that they were always coming apart at the seams , and the fabric would unravel making a sewing repair very difficult , if not impossible.I decided to give them one more try , as they 're really very soft and comfortable . I ordered two more pair , and they began to fall apart even more rapidly than before -LRB- only lasted about six - eight weeks -RRB- . Note - they always seem to last just long enough to preclude being able to return them for a refund.My advice - they cost nearly $ 70 bucks a pair now , and they are n't worth $ 7 . If you reall must have black , remember you were warned.If you like other colors , you can find other brands which hold up VERY well.I have a steel grey pair I bought from Wintersilks two years ago , for less money , and they are still in good shape . I wear/wore the Wintersilks pairs just as frequently as this crap .
 I had got these for my husband for christmas . Nice material , however they were too tapered at the ankle and also short for him and he is average height , so we had to return it .
 Reading so many positive reviews for the Intimo Silk Pant , I treated myself to one on May 15 , 2010 . I received my maroon silk pant quickly and they seemed all the reviewers had said they were . I followed the advice of one reviewer and ordered the `` silk pant '' a size larger . I loved them -- they felt wonderful . I carefully followed the washing instructions , and all went well for over a month . Long enough for the return period to expire , as I was soon to discover . Then on a morning in late July , I removed my silk pant from the washer -LRB- only a year old -RRB- from a solo cleaning on delicate to discover a seven inch rip where the silk joins the waistband . First , I sent an email to `` Intimo '' customer service . Their reply was quick , and thanked me for the information but put the blame on Amazon . I contacted Amazon and discovered my time had run out , so shame on me . For a month they were wonderful sleeping pants . If you think that is enough time to justify the expense , well order one . If you do n't then look elsewhere for luxury sleep wear .
 Seams already have started to come apart . Have only being worn three times , , ! Very poor workmanship . Expected better.Do not know where to return product .
 Bought these as a Christmas gift for my husband . They have been washed 2 times and they are already faded , shaggy and the seams are coming apart on the legs . He wants to throw them away after only having them for 2 weeks .
 These pants were washed one time , following the washing instructions , they were not put in the dryer , and they shrunk not only around , but lengthwise . I had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and did n't have any problems . I look forward to your reply .
 very badly sized and ca n't return it since I washed it before trying it on

 I bought a pair in maroon and they were a little short but fine . The problem was that they started coming apart at the seams after 2 months . Will definitely be looking to a different company for a replacement pair .
 I have ordered these pants on and off for the past several years . At first , they were great , and held up well , though usually starting falling apart after about 6 - 8 months . Note - before commenting on the quality of the product , I want to stipulate that I followed the manufacturers washing instructions to the letter!At first I thought that being silk they were just more fragile than regular material . They ARE extremely comfortable . However , I started to notice that they were always coming apart at the seams , and the fabric would unravel making a sewing repair very difficult , if not impossible.I decided to give them one more try , as they 're really very soft and comfortable .

 This bra is completley worthless ! It offers absolutely no support , is cheaply made and does not run according to size . Do n't waste a penny on this . You will be disappointed .
 i ordered this item for support being that i have a rather large chest . the item had MUCH more coverage than the picture lets on and came in the size i ordered according to the tag but once i had it on i realised it was 3 sizes too SMALL . when i returned it to the sender the refunded only HALF my money . this item was ordered with one more bra like it and out of my $ 40 order i got just over $ 20 back . i plan on disputing this with amazon and the seller .
 I love the style of the bra , however I ordered a 46D in Black and the cup size of what I received was almost double in size . The label read 46D -LRB- which I know I wear -RRB- , but had to send it back because the cup was just too LARGE .
 The overall idea of the body suit was good however the fit not so much . I am about average hieght 5 6 '' and weigh 130 but it seemed like it was made for a person smaller in stature . My guy was pleased with my appearance but the odd fit did n't make me feel as sexy as I wud have liked .

 I bought this poncho for my little girl . She broke her arm so she needed something to keep her warm . It came on time . When I opened the package the price on the poncho had been ripped off . It had several `` sale '' stickers on were the price had also been ripped off . My daughter wore it once and two of the little flowers fell off . I would n't purchase anything from this vendor . They overprice their items online and the quality of the item is poor .
 Living on the Gulf Coast of Texas , our winters are seldom cold - it rarely gets to 30 degrees . The description did not mention that these were heavy and designed for really cold weather . I now have useless sleepwear .
 I purchased this shirt assuming it to be great deal . But these shirts are worth the sale price at the best .

 I have only had them a week and already they are falling apart , I would not recommend them to anyone
 Product was small to size . Return policy sucks so I kept it . Perhaps I can pass it on to someone else ...
 Please be honest to your clients . Please ship for the value we pay . Please do not send used pajama for a new one . I have to have a vey used pajama for the value of $ 109.00 . It is very unfair .
 I was unable to return the item because of restrictions imposed by their return policyI made a mistake by buying it
 I bought these in August for my Father and he loved them . Upon visiting him this Christmas -LRB- 4 months later -RRB- , I discovered that he had stopped wearing them . The bottom had ripped away from the waist band and a button came off . The pajamas are of course now useless . Went to order someone new ones , and of course these came up on the search . Do n't buy this inferior quality for this much money ! Not a good deal
 These were a gift at Christmas , and were a deep burgundy color . they do appear to be well stitched . however , after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading , and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost do n't look like a match anymore . the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much !!
 These pajamas last only two months before the silk started to tear at the waist and in the crotch area . For this price I would expect that they would have been much better quality and last longer than two months .
 High priced , supposedly nice items should be presented nicely ... with a little class . This item was wrinkled and disheveled . Looked like a 6 year old packed it . Actual garment quality was poor and in no way die it warrant a price so high !
 When you first get these , you will realize that they are WAY BIGGER than they should be & assume they have made a mistake . But then , when you wash them , they will shrink into TINY kids looking clothes . I washed these in cold water , did not put in dryer , yet they shrunk about 4 to 5 sizes . I also washed in a gentle cycle , yet the seams look they are starting to fall apart and lint sticks all over them & they come out of the machine FULL OF WRINKLES . . so basically after the first wash they are garbage ... so unless you plan on having your PJ 's dry cleaned , I would n't waste my money on these , they were cozy & comfortable at first -LRB- although when they arrive they will be WAY TO BIG -RRB- but once they make contact with water they are ruined -LRB- even though it says they can be machine washed & dried -RRB- I ca n't imagine if I had put them in the dryer , they would probably turn into doll clothes , save your money & buy the cheaper satin version , at leat they do n't get ruined in the wash .
 Got these for Christmas from my wife . They looked great but it 's February and the crotch is already completely torn out of them . Just turning over in bed is more than the material can handle . I do NOT recommend these .
 I recently bought these silk pajamas for my husband 's birthday . Within a week , all the button fell off the top and the fabric frayed 2 - 3 inches wide along the seams in the pants along the thighs . I paid $ 160 dollars for these pajamas , more than silk PJs listed from other suppliers on Amazon , expecting I was buying quality . After a week 's use , they are heading for the rag bag and I feel defrauded .
 I do n't like it , feels like paper . i buoght this item because it of the price it was on.Ima throw them in a couple of month . Make my money worth .
 No I wo n't purchase Hanes Boxers again . I do n't like the seams in them , and they ended up as clean up rags in the garage .

 I have lots of these , using them almost daily as underware . my first pair having purchased at least 6 years ago . my two most recent purchases of these has yielded a variety of quality and sizes . seems like they are being made in multiple overseas sweet shops with little quality control . wo n't be buying again
 Normally , you 'd expect a company to understand a man and his underwear . Sadly , UA does not.When I received this underwear , I was able to wear it once . Once . Why ? Because it simply fell the hell apart half way through my day as I was wearing it.Chances are , this is just a defective case . Yeah , probably . So what do I do ? I go and contact UA support . First of all , I had to continuously try to get them to actually talk to me . I 'd say I had a problem with their underwear breaking down on me . What do they say ? To use the return form and send it back , followed by an immediate disconnection ! I had to try continuously contacting them to get them to say anything else what so ever . When I finally do , I ask whether or not I could just provide proof of purchase -LRB- a receipt + picture -RRB- . They simply deny me.I mean , really . Sending back a gross , dirty pair of underwear that you sweated in all day to the point they break is n't something you want to do . After denying me , they refused to talk to me whatsoever . They simply disconnect as soon as I enter the chat , refusing to talk to me at all ! Furthermore , their employees constantly gave attitude and belittled me at the same time.UA , you 're a damn shame . A damn shame .
 I am a big fan of Under Armour Compression Shorts , and prefer them to other brands -LRB- like Shock Doctor -RRB- . However , this order interface is terrible , and I have never seen such an obvious error on the part of Amazon . There is no size information to indicate what size you are ordering . It says sizes S-XL available , but gives you no way to choose your size . I very foolishly ordered anyway and what I received was size small . So I had to return the items and get replacements . Road Runner Sports has great customer service and made the return and reorder very easy , but it would have been better if I could have chosen my size when I placed the order through Amazon .
 I was extremely disappointed with this product . I purchased this product as a Christmas gift for someone very special and when the person opened the package I was so embarrassed . The product stated and also showed online the color `` white '' . However , upon opening the package the product was a `` dirty '' white and not pure white like online . The person accepted the gift which is why I can not return it . I still would like to be compensated for this product .
 I have no idea how good or bad this item is . Amazon advertised size M for this item and I ordered it . When it came it was S. and I did n't know it until after my grandson brought it back saying it was the wrong size . When I looked it was a S. I had thrown all the papers away so I am stuck with a size small for the next yard sale I have or someone has .
 These shorts are extremely comfortable , and do their job . However , I have had several pair that rip in the inner thigh . My most recent pair ripped after only 3 months of use , being worn 1-2x per week . Simply not worth the $ .
 I ended up with two garments two sizes too large on a reorder . Same UA top quality , but not the right fit .
 I know this is a product review , but I need to bring up that I have bought over 20 pairs of these Under Armour Heatgear Compression shorts in the past , but if bought from this company , I suspect they may be fake . The material in the shorts as well as the band are rougher and seem of a lower grade material then what I 've bought directly from `` Under Armour '' . Two of my three pairs bought here have had the bands separate from the shorts with normal washing/wearing over a 2 month period . For reference , the oldest pair I have from `` Under Armour '' has lasted over 3 years with normal washing/wearing !!!

 I ordered these tights , mainly for the price and the well-known brand . I am 5 ' 5 '' and about 130 pounds ... average woman 's height and weight and ordered a medium . They are very long - probably about 2-3 extra inches , which bag up at the ankles . The fit is also quite old-fashioned ; high waist-ed . I would buy these if fit and looks are not all that important to you . I also run in colder weather , about 20 degrees in the winter and found they had very little insulation , if any.Overall , I was not pleased with the tight and would have sent them back , if there was not an additional $ 9 return fee from Roadrunner Sports !
 I ordered these for a Christmas gift . They were backordered so I got a new ship date . They cancelled the order after the end of the new shipping window . No explanation - just did n't send them . I 'd be cautious about ordering from Fogdog .
 I ordered these tights on Dec. 17 . I waited , and waited and waited . They were a Christmas gift for my sister . It took a full month -- until Jan. 12 -- for an email from the company . They mysteriously canceled my order . Thanks , guys ! Guess there 's always next Christmas .

 There are two photos here . One , with the authentic head band and the other , comparing the bootleg version with the authentic one . Here 's the problem ... I was hoping to receive the authentic one but turned out to get the bootlegged one . I 'm not very happy with it but I 'm not planning to use it for cosplay or something of that nature . Still would 've been better to get the better looking one .
 do not buy this product go somewhere else i got mine today and its horrible i wasted money on a stupid bootleg version go to another site or something the bootleg version in the picture it the one you get im writing this so nobody else wastes there money and time for nothing
 the description stated that this item was
 I purchased this because of the picture and that it said it was the official headband . I was shipped a bootleg headband that was falling apart upon opening the package . Very disappointed .
 This headband sucks !! its not the official one . Its too small for my head . Its supposed to be blue , not black . I 'm currently using it as a collar for my dog and thats the only cool thing about it . I 'm trying to find a real one in time for this costume party im going to . Plz help !
 Product information is confusing and have so bad luck i received the Bootleged version . Still i 'm keeping it because i 'm not very picky with cosplay , but for hardcore cosplayers stay away , looks really cheap and fake ! : -LRB-
 I thought this was suppose to be the authentic headband , instead they sent a bootleg one that looks like s ** t !! My 4 year old cousin could make a better looking bootleg headband than this.save your money and buy some sheet metal , get someone to cut it , then get them to imprint the symbol and scratch , then glue it on to some black faric
 I recommend this product to no one because it was essentially plastic . It felt like it was throw together in and hour . The &#34; metal part &#34; bends too easy as it will break . If you want to truly cosplay , this is not the right headband . I tried bending it to make it look like my cosplay and it was terrible .
 Well , the title says it all . I almost bought this because I received a bootleg one with the complete costume . Guess I 'll look somewhere else .
 This item does n't even look like the one the picture ... It 's not the real thing and it 's a bootleg one . .
 The quality of cotton used on this product is not good . It came out of the dryer covered with wrinkles , despite the fact that I dried it on a permanent press + wrinkle guard setting . I must iron it and who wants to iron a t-shirt ???? I am very disappointed in the Columbia Sportswear company for putting out such a low-quality product .
 Ok , so I 'm exaggerating a little bit , bit not by much . Where the Iron Maiden shirts used to be printed on Haines heavy-weight t-shirts , this shirt was printed on a Delta t-shirt . Shrank to the point where it looks like a belly shirt almost . Cheap , low thread count t-shirt . When ordering these rock shirts , be sure to ask the seller what kind of shirt it 's been printed on . If you 're like me , you like to keep your rock shirts around until they get nice and faded . The DELTA shirts wo n't last that long . The eact same thing happened with a new RIde the Lightning shirt , and I 'm a little frustrated . The HAINES and GIANT brand shirts tend to be high quality and do n't shrink . * Please note that this is not an issue with the seller , but with whomsoever is making Maiden 's licensed stuff now .
 I purchased this shirt assuming it to be great deal . But these shirts are worth the sale price at the best .
 I ended up with two garments two sizes too large on a reorder . Same UA top quality , but not the right fit .
 I know this is a product review , but I need to bring up that I have bought over 20 pairs of these Under Armour Heatgear Compression shorts in the past , but if bought from this company , I suspect they may be fake . The material in the shorts as well as the band are rougher and seem of a lower grade material then what I 've bought directly from `` Under Armour '' . Two of my three pairs bought here have had the bands separate from the shorts with normal washing/wearing over a 2 month period . For reference , the oldest pair I have from `` Under Armour '' has lasted over 3 years with normal washing/wearing !!!
 These shorts are extremely comfortable , and do their job . However , I have had several pair that rip in the inner thigh . My most recent pair ripped after only 3 months of use , being worn 1-2x per week . Simply not worth the $ .
 Normally , you 'd expect a company to understand a man and his underwear . Sadly , UA does not.When I received this underwear , I was able to wear it once . Once . Why ? Because it simply fell the hell apart half way through my day as I was wearing it.Chances are , this is just a defective case . Yeah , probably . So what do I do ? I go and contact UA support . First of all , I had to continuously try to get them to actually talk to me . I 'd say I had a problem with their underwear breaking down on me . What do they say ? To use the return form and send it back , followed by an immediate disconnection ! I had to try continuously contacting them to get them to say anything else what so ever . When I finally do , I ask whether or not I could just provide proof of purchase -LRB- a receipt + picture -RRB- . They simply deny me.I mean , really . Sending back a gross , dirty pair of underwear that you sweated in all day to the point they break is n't something you want to do . After denying me , they refused to talk to me whatsoever . They simply disconnect as soon as I enter the chat , refusing to talk to me at all ! Furthermore , their employees constantly gave attitude and belittled me at the same time.UA , you 're a damn shame . A damn shame .
 I am a big fan of Under Armour Compression Shorts , and prefer them to other brands -LRB- like Shock Doctor -RRB- . However , this order interface is terrible , and I have never seen such an obvious error on the part of Amazon . There is no size information to indicate what size you are ordering . It says sizes S-XL available , but gives you no way to choose your size . I very foolishly ordered anyway and what I received was size small . So I had to return the items and get replacements . Road Runner Sports has great customer service and made the return and reorder very easy , but it would have been better if I could have chosen my size when I placed the order through Amazon .
 I was extremely disappointed with this product . I purchased this product as a Christmas gift for someone very special and when the person opened the package I was so embarrassed . The product stated and also showed online the color `` white '' . However , upon opening the package the product was a `` dirty '' white and not pure white like online . The person accepted the gift which is why I can not return it . I still would like to be compensated for this product .
 I have no idea how good or bad this item is . Amazon advertised size M for this item and I ordered it . When it came it was S. and I did n't know it until after my grandson brought it back saying it was the wrong size . When I looked it was a S. I had thrown all the papers away so I am stuck with a size small for the next yard sale I have or someone has .
 I have lots of these , using them almost daily as underware . my first pair having purchased at least 6 years ago . my two most recent purchases of these has yielded a variety of quality and sizes . seems like they are being made in multiple overseas sweet shops with little quality control . wo n't be buying again
 product was as described except picture was entirely different . One large lady but in the middle not many . I would have preferred as pictured but not worth returning was will serve as bib just the same .
 I bought this bib for my daughter to wear at her ladybug themed 1st birthday . It only lasted a few times after that before it started falling apart .

 The shirt fits well , good style , good shirt . But Bealls of Florida sucks as a retailer . Their customer service is rude , crude , and unrefined . Even the supervisors of Customer Service suck , they do n't return or accept any items back . So BEWARE , you better be damn sure that size fits -LRB- ordered product before -RRB- . Because Bealls of Florida will not let you return the item for different size or style . I will not shop here again ! I repeat , I WILL NOT SHOP HERE AGAIN . THIS PLACE SUCKS AS FAR AS A RETAILER .
 I had 3 of these shirts in my cart and saw the reviews and just took these shirts out of my basket . Thanks all for the warning . Bill Blass , Hmmmmmmm , I thought they made quality merchandize . Live and learn .
 Shirts of average quality ... worth about what I paid for them , $ 10.00 ... built in collar stays ...
 I did not like the texture/material . The fitting was also loose for me . Having used Eddie Bauer cotton shirts , these shirts were disappointment .
 Pros : I bought this shirt before it changed to $ 10 a pop.Has magical powers.I wore this shirt on Superbowl Sunday and the Steelers won.Cons : I put the shirt on and chaos erupted , i.e. , it is flammable .
 I bought these shirts based on great reviews . After receiving them , I realize that it was a total mistake . I did n't even bother to put these on me , as the quality is horrible . By the way , Amazon will charge you money to ship them back as they do n't consider `` item is n't as described on the web site '' is their fault . Things I found out about these shirts :1 . The pictures are misleading . These are n't `` fitted '' shirts . They are quite big .2 . Amazon search engine is misleading too . If you search `` fitted shirts '' , these will show up , but in no mean they are fitted .3 . Poor quality . They are see-through shirts . Unless you like to show off your underwear , these are horrible shirts.Do yourself a favor and do n't order these shirts . You will be ~ $ 8 happier .
 First thing you have to know about clothes
 Not of Good quality.It 's not even worth for that price.Packaging is also not good.The pictures are misleading and they do not look like that .
 My shirts arrived today.Thin , ... an understatement!I 've seen support hose that was thicker!It would take three of these shirts to to make one good shirt.Good for summer wear someone said . These shirts are the kind that are so thin they would cling to you!I 'll need nipple patches on about the third wearing . You know , like the knee patches we used to use on blue jeans.Looks like Bill Blass has gone the way of other companies , selling off their name . I would n't even rip them up for cleaning cloth.NO THANKS ! Back they go ! I 'll suffer the shipping .
 do not buy these shirts , not worth the money , certainly not worth bill blass label , very poor style and stitching and fabric .
 I didnt knew that amazon had such a poor quality control and also they dont have any control over other vendors , Save $ 8 by not buying this product ... Very thin and very large sized shirts ... . they are see thru and look no where like they are shown on web site ...
 Though good workmanship , I was expecting a heavier material for this brand name .
 Fabric is one of the cheapest . Stiching is very bad and sizing is off . Not even worth $ 7.50 sale price .
 I bought two shirts and later I realize never ever buy cloths over net . What you see is not what you get . These are poor quality shirts .
 This shirt is absolutely the worst in the market . The fabric is cheap , so cheap , that I threw the darn thing away
 Why do I keep forgetting about these type of `` sales '' ??? Thanks to all of the wonderful people - reviewers - who truly care about others.I 'll pass on these .
 The material is almost see-through and the collar stays are sown into the material . Not really the highest quality although what can you expect for the price ?
 Paid around 10 bucks for the shirt , but its not wort 10 bucks at all , cant wear to office cos the cloth is see thru . very thin cloth .
 Very dissatisfied with the quality like several other reviewers . Relegated to cleaning after just one use .
 like the birdies sing ... cheep cheep ... yep they are cheapi got the izzue -LRB- sp -RRB- shirt and it was great ... these blass ones , not so great ... plus amazon plays the price game , they were 5 bucks , but then came a special promo , they raised the price to 7.50 ... to get you to buy more ; using the promo code bringing the price back to 5 each , gamesmanship ... got ta really watch amazon prices , always double check at other sites ... like the contek sunglasses , amazon had them at 130 retail ... heck the mfr only had them retail at 80 ... games
 All I can say is do n't waste your money.This has to be one of the worst shirts I have ever purchased.It looks nice in the pictures , but in this case looks can be deciving . Flimsy material , and the collar appears to be simply paper inside .
 These shirts chafe when sweated in . Do not sweat . If you are a heavy sweater , I strongly recommend going for at least a 20 dollar shirt . Twice as much fabric would be a good idea . There is no way that Bill Blass himself wears these shirts . I do n't know if you can handle the truth , but this shirt has puffy arms . The Fashion Pointed Collars are a MUST HAVE though !!! A slight downfall though , they sometimes slice my shoulders open . Just kidding , but they do kinda poke . :-RRB- If you 're still reading this , you should check out some of those other reviews . They 're ridiculous . I should know . I read them . What is a Lovett Ogre , and how does its back produce so much cotton ? Anyway , if you 're still reading this , I 'll be going to the movies tonight wearing my blue Bill Blass Dress Shirt with Fashion Pointed Collar , if you want to meet me . You ca n't miss me . It 's a stunning shirt . It basically has a glow to it . The light blue tint also matches my eyes . Enough about me . What about you ? Note
 I bought these shirts for $ 6 each thinking that I 've got a bargain , but once I received them was disappointed in my purchase . As previous reviewers mentioned , the material is flimsy , 60 % cotton - 40 % polyester -LRB- and feel like the latter -RRB- , the fit is improper and finish poor . Am wearing one of the shirts now , and it wears uncomfortably -LRB- feels like a poorly made medical scrub -RRB- and looks just as cheap -LRB- yes , even the French Blue color -RRB- . Will either send these back or they will end up collecting dust in my closet .
 If you want a cheap thin shirt that likely will not last a dozen washing then this is the shirt for you.Be aware that Amazon has a $ 3.99 plus $ 0.99 -LRB- per item -RRB- return shipping fee.Is all Bill Blass stuff this `` quality '' ?
 I bought this shirt for one reason , the price , and I soon as I open the box I found out why it was so cheap . Because of the cheap materials . Save your money , spend couple of dollars more and you will be happier with quality .
 it is only worth if you get it for under 5 bucks
 The shirt is NOT at all of a good quality . It does not worth $ 6 at all . Its transparent also . Please save your money and buy a better quality shirt .
 Collars will go bad as soon as you wash them or send them to the dry cleaners . I would prefer going to Marshalls or Ross and get a better deal . Please dont waste your money .
 If you are looking for Bill Blass quality -LRB- go and check it out in a store -RRB- , then keep away from this.On the other hand , if you are looking for a CHEAP shirt , then this is the real thing .
 I wore this shirt just once . It 's almost transparent . Not worth it even if you get it for free .
 I bought 6 of these shirts going by the photographs and some of the reviews . Dont mean to be rude , but people who gave these shirts probably have n't wore a decent dress shirt . You can frequently get ` good ' $ 45 shirt for $ 10 in malls when on sale . I thought this was a better deal . But boy oh boy , I can assure you this is not much better than what you might get at a dollar store . I had ordered these as a gift , but now will give them to Red Cross because these should not be worn at any kind of formal occassion , or even for daily use -LRB- except maybe when you are working at Septic tanks or something -RRB- . These are from Bangladesh , and I can assure you , they are not much better than what would be sold for $ 0.50 in BGD . If you have any self-respect and work in anything but a lowest income group atmosphere , DO NOT BUY THESE SHIRTS .
 The negatives were as reviewed
 I waited all week for this over priced shirt . I only bought it because I could n't find another button down shirt in eggplant and I needed the color for an event this week . The shirt arrived and they sent me the wrong style shirt . Its a polo shirt . Does n't even look like the picture . Now I 'm screwed for the event this week . Hella Lame .
 My husband does n't like to wear shirts under his dress shirts ; however , he will have to with these . I ordered 2 whites and 1 tan . They are nice looking but very , very thin . The retail tags say $ 45 . I 'd be quite upset if I had paid that much ! I guess for $ 9.99 , they 'll be okay . I did n't save a lot though cause now I have to buy some new t-shirts to wear underneath ! If you do n't have a white-collar job , these would be fine -LRB- at a reasonable price -RRB- for occassional wear . However , my husband has to wear them everyday , and I doubt they will hold up well since they are so thin .
 I ordered several designs of the Cacharel shirts and was very disappointed when they arrived because the fabric was extremely thin . I always wear a white undershirt , and that fact was very evident since one could literally see through the shirt .
 I purchased this shirt assuming it to be great deal . But these shirts are worth the sale price at the best .

 The quality of cotton used on this product is not good . It came out of the dryer covered with wrinkles , despite the fact that I dried it on a permanent press + wrinkle guard setting . I must iron it and who wants to iron a t-shirt ???? I am very disappointed in the Columbia Sportswear company for putting out such a low-quality product .
 We were very disappointed in this wallet for the amount of money we paid . It is very cheaply made , and the person we got it for did n't like it . We would have been better off going to a discount store and getting a $ 5.00 wallet .
 My husband does n't like to wear shirts under his dress shirts ; however , he will have to with these . I ordered 2 whites and 1 tan . They are nice looking but very , very thin . The retail tags say $ 45 . I 'd be quite upset if I had paid that much ! I guess for $ 9.99 , they 'll be okay .

 I did n't see the logic behind this garment . It 's suppose to hold in the belly but yet there 's a little opening at the bottom where my belly sticks out from . I sent this back and got the bottomless one . I love that one i have been wearing that one for years .
 This is a good ideal but you need to be measures for the right size.I have order the 2xx and it was to little and I order the 3xx and the legs or the bottom part was to big . But I have the Squeem Rubber High Back Waist Cincher Girdle Style 26J in 2xx and it fitted well .
 Received the product and it is NOTHING like described . Instead of the item as shown , the item is only a short stomach wrap and not a more full body item as pictured . Returned .
 I thought I was going to break by hands trying to get this on . There are like a MILLION little bra like hooks all the way down this thing and it takes FOREVER to get them hooked and it hurts my hands like crazy ! BUT my fianc&eacute; did say that once I had it on he could see the difference it was making but by the time I got it on I was too fed up with it I just wanted it off ! Go get some spanx !!!
 Let me first start off by saying that I am not A large woman so the XL size I ordered should have been more than sufficient for my size . I always wear my clothes large and on me , an XL fits loosely and comfortably . I had this product for less than a week when it tore ! For an Ninety dollar purchase needless to say I was less than pleased . When I returned this product I had the same result ! I am returning this product and I would NEVER recommend it .
 I bought this item , along with the Squeem Miracle vest . I tried putting this on and it was so odd , I ca n't imagine anyone actually wearing it . I am 5 ' 4 '' and weigh 128 . I usually wear a size 6 . I ordered the medium size . I put it on and the abdominal area was really tight . However , the crotch area gapped really badly and when I fastened the thighs , they hung loosely . Now , I have saddle bags and my thighs are one of my biggest problem areas . But this was actually way too big to do anything for my thighs , compounded by the gapping crotch . I had great luck with the miracle vest and will be writing a review on that item .
 I previously purchased Squeem Waist Cincher -LRB- Med -RRB- and was super satisfied . Decided to try this model -LRB- also Med -RRB- and I must say I was very disappointed . It feels like a wet suit and sizing does not match that of other Squeem products . I could not get it on -LRB- waist not even close , while it felt lose around my thighs -RRB- . Would not recommend buying this product online unless you try it out first at their retail store .
 Worst thing ever ... I do n't know how anyone could even wear this thing ... It is so uncomfortable , and it hurts to sit down ... and it makes you look lumpy . It 's in my drawer collecting dust . I 've owned it for almost a year , and gave it many chances , and I still ca n't get comfortable with it . I 'm better off getting the cheap one at the local mall or some plain ole spanks !! Kudos to anyone who can wear this thing all evening under a beautiful cocktail dress or gown ... not me !!! I would n't recommend it to family or friends ... it is overly priced .
 I have big legs and legs on this were too big while the waist area too tight even though I followed the instructions . Had to return it .
 I returned this product . The legs were too big and the waist too small . I looked like I was in a strait jacket . I have the high back waist cincher and am pleased with it , other than the rubber smell I ca n't elimate , but this product sucks !
 The product was very difficult to put on that I just gave up on it . Could n't return it because the orginal wrapping had been thrown away .
 well i just recieved my product and it is the wrong color ... i ordered nude which i paid 50 dollars more for and recieved beige and the packing even says available in beige and black only ... . not very happy at this point feeling a little ripped off !
 The quality of cotton used on this product is not good . It came out of the dryer covered with wrinkles , despite the fact that I dried it on a permanent press + wrinkle guard setting . I must iron it and who wants to iron a t-shirt ???? I am very disappointed in the Columbia Sportswear company for putting out such a low-quality product .
 I bought these shirts based on great reviews . After receiving them , I realize that it was a total mistake . I did n't even bother to put these on me , as the quality is horrible . By the way , Amazon will charge you money to ship them back as they do n't consider `` item is n't as described on the web site '' is their fault . Things I found out about these shirts :1 . The pictures are misleading . These are n't `` fitted '' shirts . They are quite big .2 . Amazon search engine is misleading too . If you search `` fitted shirts '' , these will show up , but in no mean they are fitted .3 . Poor quality . They are see-through shirts . Unless you like to show off your underwear , these are horrible shirts.Do yourself a favor and do n't order these shirts . You will be ~ $ 8 happier .
 First thing you have to know about clothes
 Not of Good quality.It 's not even worth for that price.Packaging is also not good.The pictures are misleading and they do not look like that .
 My shirts arrived today.Thin , ... an understatement!I 've seen support hose that was thicker!It would take three of these shirts to to make one good shirt.Good for summer wear someone said . These shirts are the kind that are so thin they would cling to you!I 'll need nipple patches on about the third wearing . You know , like the knee patches we used to use on blue jeans.Looks like Bill Blass has gone the way of other companies , selling off their name . I would n't even rip them up for cleaning cloth.NO THANKS ! Back they go ! I 'll suffer the shipping .
 do not buy these shirts , not worth the money , certainly not worth bill blass label , very poor style and stitching and fabric .
 I didnt knew that amazon had such a poor quality control and also they dont have any control over other vendors , Save $ 8 by not buying this product ... Very thin and very large sized shirts ... . they are see thru and look no where like they are shown on web site ...
 Though good workmanship , I was expecting a heavier material for this brand name .
 Fabric is one of the cheapest . Stiching is very bad and sizing is off . Not even worth $ 7.50 sale price .
 I bought two shirts and later I realize never ever buy cloths over net . What you see is not what you get . These are poor quality shirts .
 This shirt is absolutely the worst in the market . The fabric is cheap , so cheap , that I threw the darn thing away
 Why do I keep forgetting about these type of `` sales '' ??? Thanks to all of the wonderful people - reviewers - who truly care about others.I 'll pass on these .
 The material is almost see-through and the collar stays are sown into the material . Not really the highest quality although what can you expect for the price ?
 Paid around 10 bucks for the shirt , but its not wort 10 bucks at all , cant wear to office cos the cloth is see thru . very thin cloth .
 The shirt fits well , good style , good shirt . But Bealls of Florida sucks as a retailer . Their customer service is rude , crude , and unrefined . Even the supervisors of Customer Service suck , they do n't return or accept any items back . So BEWARE , you better be damn sure that size fits -LRB- ordered product before -RRB- . Because Bealls of Florida will not let you return the item for different size or style . I will not shop here again ! I repeat , I WILL NOT SHOP HERE AGAIN . THIS PLACE SUCKS AS FAR AS A RETAILER .
 I had 3 of these shirts in my cart and saw the reviews and just took these shirts out of my basket . Thanks all for the warning . Bill Blass , Hmmmmmmm , I thought they made quality merchandize . Live and learn .
 Shirts of average quality ... worth about what I paid for them , $ 10.00 ... built in collar stays ...
 I did not like the texture/material . The fitting was also loose for me . Having used Eddie Bauer cotton shirts , these shirts were disappointment .
 Pros : I bought this shirt before it changed to $ 10 a pop.Has magical powers.I wore this shirt on Superbowl Sunday and the Steelers won.Cons : I put the shirt on and chaos erupted , i.e. , it is flammable .
 I bought these shirts for $ 6 each thinking that I 've got a bargain , but once I received them was disappointed in my purchase . As previous reviewers mentioned , the material is flimsy , 60 % cotton - 40 % polyester -LRB- and feel like the latter -RRB- , the fit is improper and finish poor . Am wearing one of the shirts now , and it wears uncomfortably -LRB- feels like a poorly made medical scrub -RRB- and looks just as cheap -LRB- yes , even the French Blue color -RRB- . Will either send these back or they will end up collecting dust in my closet .
 If you want a cheap thin shirt that likely will not last a dozen washing then this is the shirt for you.Be aware that Amazon has a $ 3.99 plus $ 0.99 -LRB- per item -RRB- return shipping fee.Is all Bill Blass stuff this `` quality '' ?
 I bought this shirt for one reason , the price , and I soon as I open the box I found out why it was so cheap . Because of the cheap materials . Save your money , spend couple of dollars more and you will be happier with quality .
 it is only worth if you get it for under 5 bucks
 The shirt is NOT at all of a good quality . It does not worth $ 6 at all . Its transparent also . Please save your money and buy a better quality shirt .
 Collars will go bad as soon as you wash them or send them to the dry cleaners . I would prefer going to Marshalls or Ross and get a better deal . Please dont waste your money .
 If you are looking for Bill Blass quality -LRB- go and check it out in a store -RRB- , then keep away from this.On the other hand , if you are looking for a CHEAP shirt , then this is the real thing .
 I wore this shirt just once . It 's almost transparent . Not worth it even if you get it for free .
 I bought 6 of these shirts going by the photographs and some of the reviews . Dont mean to be rude , but people who gave these shirts probably have n't wore a decent dress shirt . You can frequently get ` good ' $ 45 shirt for $ 10 in malls when on sale . I thought this was a better deal . But boy oh boy , I can assure you this is not much better than what you might get at a dollar store . I had ordered these as a gift , but now will give them to Red Cross because these should not be worn at any kind of formal occassion , or even for daily use -LRB- except maybe when you are working at Septic tanks or something -RRB- . These are from Bangladesh , and I can assure you , they are not much better than what would be sold for $ 0.50 in BGD . If you have any self-respect and work in anything but a lowest income group atmosphere , DO NOT BUY THESE SHIRTS .
 The negatives were as reviewed
 Very dissatisfied with the quality like several other reviewers . Relegated to cleaning after just one use .
 like the birdies sing ... cheep cheep ... yep they are cheapi got the izzue -LRB- sp -RRB- shirt and it was great ... these blass ones , not so great ... plus amazon plays the price game , they were 5 bucks , but then came a special promo , they raised the price to 7.50 ... to get you to buy more ; using the promo code bringing the price back to 5 each , gamesmanship ... got ta really watch amazon prices , always double check at other sites ... like the contek sunglasses , amazon had them at 130 retail ... heck the mfr only had them retail at 80 ... games
 All I can say is do n't waste your money.This has to be one of the worst shirts I have ever purchased.It looks nice in the pictures , but in this case looks can be deciving . Flimsy material , and the collar appears to be simply paper inside .
 These shirts chafe when sweated in . Do not sweat . If you are a heavy sweater , I strongly recommend going for at least a 20 dollar shirt . Twice as much fabric would be a good idea . There is no way that Bill Blass himself wears these shirts . I do n't know if you can handle the truth , but this shirt has puffy arms . The Fashion Pointed Collars are a MUST HAVE though !!! A slight downfall though , they sometimes slice my shoulders open . Just kidding , but they do kinda poke . :-RRB- If you 're still reading this , you should check out some of those other reviews . They 're ridiculous . I should know . I read them . What is a Lovett Ogre , and how does its back produce so much cotton ? Anyway , if you 're still reading this , I 'll be going to the movies tonight wearing my blue Bill Blass Dress Shirt with Fashion Pointed Collar , if you want to meet me . You ca n't miss me . It 's a stunning shirt . It basically has a glow to it . The light blue tint also matches my eyes . Enough about me . What about you ? Note
 The quality of cotton used on this product is not good . It came out of the dryer covered with wrinkles , despite the fact that I dried it on a permanent press + wrinkle guard setting . I must iron it and who wants to iron a t-shirt ???? I am very disappointed in the Columbia Sportswear company for putting out such a low-quality product .
 My husband does n't like to wear shirts under his dress shirts ; however , he will have to with these . I ordered 2 whites and 1 tan . They are nice looking but very , very thin . The retail tags say $ 45 . I 'd be quite upset if I had paid that much ! I guess for $ 9.99 , they 'll be okay . I did n't save a lot though cause now I have to buy some new t-shirts to wear underneath ! If you do n't have a white-collar job , these would be fine -LRB- at a reasonable price -RRB- for occassional wear . However , my husband has to wear them everyday , and I doubt they will hold up well since they are so thin .
 I ordered several designs of the Cacharel shirts and was very disappointed when they arrived because the fabric was extremely thin . I always wear a white undershirt , and that fact was very evident since one could literally see through the shirt .
 I purchased one of these shirts from Sport Check and paid $ 30 for it . It was comfortable and I had no problems with it until 1 day I noticed some white flakes on the front of it . When I tried to wipe them off I saw that it was the material that was flaking off in a perfect circle . The more I brushed the bigger the hole grew . Now you can see through the center of my shirt like some nylon stockings , which looks pretty girly . For a $ 30 shirt I sure expected to get a lot more wear out of it .
 This is the first thing I 've ever gotten from under armour . Everyone on my football team has good luck with their products but mine seems to be defective . After one wash the logo starts cracking and the second time worn the logo starts peeling ... wishing for a refund , bad luck I guess .
 Great fabric and tight fit . Problem is that if you are over 6ft tall , then all Under Armour products will be too short in the torso . This company does not listen to the customer .
 This is the first time I 've had anything negative to say about Under Armour , and my complain is not really about the product , but the company , as the 2 shirts I ordered was to be short sleeved , and they arrived as sleeveless , It was a birthday gift to my grandson , and he assured me it was OK . I went along with him , but when I received this letter asking if I would rate the transaction , I had to tell you.I will think twice before I order again , this was a plain and simple order , and you messed it up.If I had had time I would have returned them for the right kind , but they were delivered on the birthday so I gave the package to him as it arrived , ibg1105
 thought the product worked great ... only problem had was first time was too small ... second was that not happy with cost to ship ... way overpriced
 Nice shirt but runs really small . I understand they are to be worn tight , but my 14 year old could n't get it over his head . Have to return it .
 The picture and description is of a shirt , what was sent was a sleeveless tank-top , open at the arm pits . Do n't order this if you expect a shirt or plan to use it for submission grappling .
 I did not expect this top to be skin tight . The other Armour exercise shirt I have is a comfortable fit . It is partly my own fault because I did not realize the significance of &#34; compression &#34; fit .
 Great shirt in most respects , but way too small . I bought the Adult Small for my 12-year-old son , who is 5 ft even , 115 lbs , and it is so skin-tight he could barely breathe in it . I 'm exchanging it for the non-compression version .
 I purchased an Under Armour compression tee at a local store in a size Large . The shirt fit fantastic . I wanted a back up so I purchased this one online size Large , different color . The shirt arrives on time , open the package and it is a Large but does not even fit over my shoulders ... . I contacted the vendor for an exchange . They do not do exchanges but will allow me to return the shirt . If the shirt was worn it has to be washed before returning it ... no problem for I could not get the shirt on anyway so tags etc were all in place . If you pass 30 days , there is a restocking fee of 20 % which I was unaware of.When I questioned the vendor why I have a Large and ordered the same size it did not fit . The vendor stated that Under Armour has different sizing charts for different shirts . That just did not make sense . How are you to buy a product with `` floating '' sizes.So , I went online to Nordstrum to find the same exact heat guard compression tee . There was a size chart that could be pulled up to check size before ordering ... . only 1 chart for Under Armour . I did all the measurements correctly to find that I was to order a Large.I know the shirt fits tight but since I already HAD a large that fits , and the chart from Under Armor at Nordstrum confirmed that I had ordered the correct shirt size , the statement that there are different size charts for different Under Armour shirts '' just does n't fit ! '' . I personally will visit a store and actually try it on to avoid the hassle and disappointment of waiting for a product that does not fit , seemingly was ordered correctly , and then had to be mailed back .
 I love Vanity Fair Full Slips but this one was just to small for me . I will be looking for a larger size .
 This could be a really great item . The length is perfect if you are a knee length skirt/dress wearer . The material is not bulky and stays static free . The fit is comfortable enough that I do n't notice I 'm wearing it under a dress . I gave it two stars though because of one detail that I find excessively annoying
 It is my girls first year in ballet so I just wanted an inexpensive bag . If you want a really nice bag do n't waste your money here . The entire bag is made of urethane and has a cheap feel . The biggest positives are the cute graphics and the straps work well .

 The size ordered were what she normally wears -- but were smaller than comparable clothes of the same type . Very disappointing .

 the costume does not open in the front . runs a little small . i have a 42inch chest and couldnt get it on . i would have still used it if i could have just worn it open , but it does not open so i sent it back
 Okay for a costume , but cheap materials , especially sunglasses . Easy to put on , but just so so . Probably would n't buy again .

 I did not expect this top to be skin tight . The other Armour exercise shirt I have is a comfortable fit . It is partly my own fault because I did not realize the significance of &#34; compression &#34; fit .
 Great shirt in most respects , but way too small . I bought the Adult Small for my 12-year-old son , who is 5 ft even , 115 lbs , and it is so skin-tight he could barely breathe in it . I 'm exchanging it for the non-compression version .
 I purchased an Under Armour compression tee at a local store in a size Large . The shirt fit fantastic . I wanted a back up so I purchased this one online size Large , different color . The shirt arrives on time , open the package and it is a Large but does not even fit over my shoulders ... . I contacted the vendor for an exchange . They do not do exchanges but will allow me to return the shirt . If the shirt was worn it has to be washed before returning it ... no problem for I could not get the shirt on anyway so tags etc were all in place . If you pass 30 days , there is a restocking fee of 20 % which I was unaware of.When I questioned the vendor why I have a Large and ordered the same size it did not fit . The vendor stated that Under Armour has different sizing charts for different shirts . That just did not make sense . How are you to buy a product with `` floating '' sizes.So , I went online to Nordstrum to find the same exact heat guard compression tee . There was a size chart that could be pulled up to check size before ordering ... . only 1 chart for Under Armour . I did all the measurements correctly to find that I was to order a Large.I know the shirt fits tight but since I already HAD a large that fits , and the chart from Under Armor at Nordstrum confirmed that I had ordered the correct shirt size , the statement that there are different size charts for different Under Armour shirts '' just does n't fit ! '' . I personally will visit a store and actually try it on to avoid the hassle and disappointment of waiting for a product that does not fit , seemingly was ordered correctly , and then had to be mailed back .
 I never recd my merchandise , true enough no fault of this seller , it was my post office , but I nevertheless I do n't have it !! I still like this seller and might purchase from them again in the future !
 Received this item , it would barely fit a regular L let alone someone that is a size 18-20 what a joke ... a waste of my money . If your weight is more than 155 pounds forget this altogether .
 This item is too short besides being too small . It does n't fit well at all . At least it did n't cost too much .
 THIS ITEM WAS POORLY MADE ... VERY THIN FABRIC FOR TIGHTS , THE BODY SEAMS WERE TWISTED SO THE SUIT STRAPS DID N'T LINE-U -LSB- WITH THE BODY , WHICH MADE IT VERY UNCONFORTABLE TO WEAR . GREAT IDEA , OK PRICE BUT NOT THE QUALITY I EXPECTED . WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM ...
 This body stocking is very cheap . Ripped right through when putting on even with gloves and being very careful . Save your hard earned money and do not buy this body stocking .
 I purchased one of these shirts from Sport Check and paid $ 30 for it . It was comfortable and I had no problems with it until 1 day I noticed some white flakes on the front of it . When I tried to wipe them off I saw that it was the material that was flaking off in a perfect circle . The more I brushed the bigger the hole grew . Now you can see through the center of my shirt like some nylon stockings , which looks pretty girly . For a $ 30 shirt I sure expected to get a lot more wear out of it .
 This is the first thing I 've ever gotten from under armour . Everyone on my football team has good luck with their products but mine seems to be defective . After one wash the logo starts cracking and the second time worn the logo starts peeling ... wishing for a refund , bad luck I guess .
 Great fabric and tight fit . Problem is that if you are over 6ft tall , then all Under Armour products will be too short in the torso . This company does not listen to the customer .
 This is the first time I 've had anything negative to say about Under Armour , and my complain is not really about the product , but the company , as the 2 shirts I ordered was to be short sleeved , and they arrived as sleeveless , It was a birthday gift to my grandson , and he assured me it was OK . I went along with him , but when I received this letter asking if I would rate the transaction , I had to tell you.I will think twice before I order again , this was a plain and simple order , and you messed it up.If I had had time I would have returned them for the right kind , but they were delivered on the birthday so I gave the package to him as it arrived , ibg1105
 thought the product worked great ... only problem had was first time was too small ... second was that not happy with cost to ship ... way overpriced

 Ordered two , and billed for two , as Christmas presents . Received one , which was a misassembled plastic piece of garbage . Oh well , my fault for buying jewelry over the net . Should , at least , receive what I ordered , however . So I wrote the dealer to either send the second one or issue a refund . Never could get a reply . Threw the one that had arrived in the trash . Would have given this a negative rating , if `` 1 '' were not the lowest number available .
 My husband does n't like to wear shirts under his dress shirts ; however , he will have to with these . I ordered 2 whites and 1 tan . They are nice looking but very , very thin . The retail tags say $ 45 . I 'd be quite upset if I had paid that much ! I guess for $ 9.99 , they 'll be okay . I did n't save a lot though cause now I have to buy some new t-shirts to wear underneath ! If you do n't have a white-collar job , these would be fine -LRB- at a reasonable price -RRB- for occassional wear . However , my husband has to wear them everyday , and I doubt they will hold up well since they are so thin .
 I ordered several designs of the Cacharel shirts and was very disappointed when they arrived because the fabric was extremely thin . I always wear a white undershirt , and that fact was very evident since one could literally see through the shirt .

 Ca n't say I was pleased with this order . Just be careful when ordering Tommy items via Amazon . I received 3 separate apparel items with insects -LRB- roaches/beetles -RRB- tucked within the garment bags , including these pants . Either it was a factory cleanliness issue or the factory they imported the clothing from did n't bother to check . I have written to Customer service but they reply with the standard apology and that they will forward the message to the appropriate department.If you want to bite , order a size up because it is a bit snug . The belt is ornamental and rather useless . The linen is not as breathable as I would like it . Material is a bit thick and rough.And the labels do warn that color will fade after washing . It becomes much lighter , almost tan after one wash.Just Ok as lounge pants .
 This is n't even close to authentic or realistic . My 3-year-old said he 'd rather use the cheap plastic hats the fire departments pass out than this . The hat 's PVC plastic means soft formed and when the description says `` Finished with soft red plush trim '' -- it 's on the outside . As soon as we opened this , we knew it was going back .

 All the credit card slots are to small for credit cards . I had to cut each side of the slots to get the cards to fit .
 If you want a cheap thin shirt that likely will not last a dozen washings then this is the shirt for you.Be aware that Amazon has a $ 3.99 plus $ 0.99 -LRB- per item -RRB- return shipping fee.Is all Bill Blass stuff this `` quality '' ?
 I have this in all 3 colors , and only the blue color looks fine . The other two colors , I do n't think I would like to wear to office where I am a mid-manager level . Reason being that the fabric is a blend hence thinner than the normal 100 % cotton shirts that I prefer . Looking at the retail price of the shirt , I was expecting something better .

 I bought the right size , and it fits well and looks great , but it tore and fell apart within 24 hours . It is also NOT crotchless .
 I ordered what I thought were 100 percent cotton handkerchiefs . These are NOT -- and I 'm returning them to the manufacturer !
 I wanted cotton handkerchiefs . These are a polyester blend and have more of a polyester than a cotton feel .

 This is the first thing I 've ever gotten from under armour . Everyone on my football team has good luck with their products but mine seems to be defective . After one wash the logo starts cracking and the second time worn the logo starts peeling ... wishing for a refund , bad luck I guess .
 Great fabric and tight fit . Problem is that if you are over 6ft tall , then all Under Armour products will be too short in the torso . This company does not listen to the customer .
 This is the first time I 've had anything negative to say about Under Armour , and my complain is not really about the product , but the company , as the 2 shirts I ordered was to be short sleeved , and they arrived as sleeveless , It was a birthday gift to my grandson , and he assured me it was OK . I went along with him , but when I received this letter asking if I would rate the transaction , I had to tell you.I will think twice before I order again , this was a plain and simple order , and you messed it up.If I had had time I would have returned them for the right kind , but they were delivered on the birthday so I gave the package to him as it arrived , ibg1105
 thought the product worked great ... only problem had was first time was too small ... second was that not happy with cost to ship ... way overpriced
 I did not expect this top to be skin tight . The other Armour exercise shirt I have is a comfortable fit . It is partly my own fault because I did not realize the significance of &#34; compression &#34; fit .
 Nice shirt but runs really small . I understand they are to be worn tight , but my 14 year old could n't get it over his head . Have to return it .
 The picture and description is of a shirt , what was sent was a sleeveless tank-top , open at the arm pits . Do n't order this if you expect a shirt or plan to use it for submission grappling .
 Great shirt in most respects , but way too small . I bought the Adult Small for my 12-year-old son , who is 5 ft even , 115 lbs , and it is so skin-tight he could barely breathe in it . I 'm exchanging it for the non-compression version .
 I purchased an Under Armour compression tee at a local store in a size Large . The shirt fit fantastic . I wanted a back up so I purchased this one online size Large , different color . The shirt arrives on time , open the package and it is a Large but does not even fit over my shoulders ... . I contacted the vendor for an exchange . They do not do exchanges but will allow me to return the shirt . If the shirt was worn it has to be washed before returning it ... no problem for I could not get the shirt on anyway so tags etc were all in place . If you pass 30 days , there is a restocking fee of 20 % which I was unaware of.When I questioned the vendor why I have a Large and ordered the same size it did not fit . The vendor stated that Under Armour has different sizing charts for different shirts . That just did not make sense . How are you to buy a product with `` floating '' sizes.So , I went online to Nordstrum to find the same exact heat guard compression tee . There was a size chart that could be pulled up to check size before ordering ... . only 1 chart for Under Armour . I did all the measurements correctly to find that I was to order a Large.I know the shirt fits tight but since I already HAD a large that fits , and the chart from Under Armor at Nordstrum confirmed that I had ordered the correct shirt size , the statement that there are different size charts for different Under Armour shirts '' just does n't fit ! '' . I personally will visit a store and actually try it on to avoid the hassle and disappointment of waiting for a product that does not fit , seemingly was ordered correctly , and then had to be mailed back .
 I wanted to like these pants so bad . I 'm 5 ' 8 '' 135 Lbs and they were too short for me . I guess I 'm a little anal when it comes to my pants being long enough , but regardless , they were way too thin . I have a pair of Adidas and prefer their dry-fit fabric over these . These are for sure a summer pant .
 1st , the cups were a bit small , & I know I gave the right size . Then , the strap broke ! It 's pretty , & they had my size , which is a small miracle in itself , but I would n't buy this again !
 This bra is not true to size it is smaller than the 34 G bra I was replacing . The faberic is very ichy and uncomfortable . A very disapointing purchase .
 I think the fit of the bra is great , but I can only wear it briefly because it is so uncomfortable . The fabric is stiff and itchy and the metal adjustments in the front poke me on both sides . I have washed it several times to try and soften the fabric ; did n't work . I would love to be able to wear it because it give such good support and shape , but I just ca n't .
 The size is wrong . I ordered my regular size and it 's much too small . Am returning for a larger . We 'll see .
 Please be honest to your clients . Please ship for the value we pay . Please do not send used pajama for a new one . I have to have a vey used pajama for the value of $ 109.00 . It is very unfair .
 I was unable to return the item because of restrictions imposed by their return policyI made a mistake by buying it
 I bought these in August for my Father and he loved them . Upon visiting him this Christmas -LRB- 4 months later -RRB- , I discovered that he had stopped wearing them . The bottom had ripped away from the waist band and a button came off . The pajamas are of course now useless . Went to order someone new ones , and of course these came up on the search . Do n't buy this inferior quality for this much money ! Not a good deal
 These were a gift at Christmas , and were a deep burgundy color . they do appear to be well stitched . however , after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading , and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost do n't look like a match anymore . the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much !!
 These pajamas last only two months before the silk started to tear at the waist and in the crotch area . For this price I would expect that they would have been much better quality and last longer than two months .
 I have only had them a week and already they are falling apart , I would not recommend them to anyone
 Product was small to size . Return policy sucks so I kept it . Perhaps I can pass it on to someone else ...
 When you first get these , you will realize that they are WAY BIGGER than they should be & assume they have made a mistake . But then , when you wash them , they will shrink into TINY kids looking clothes . I washed these in cold water , did not put in dryer , yet they shrunk about 4 to 5 sizes . I also washed in a gentle cycle , yet the seams look they are starting to fall apart and lint sticks all over them & they come out of the machine FULL OF WRINKLES . . so basically after the first wash they are garbage ... so unless you plan on having your PJ 's dry cleaned , I would n't waste my money on these , they were cozy & comfortable at first -LRB- although when they arrive they will be WAY TO BIG -RRB- but once they make contact with water they are ruined -LRB- even though it says they can be machine washed & dried -RRB- I ca n't imagine if I had put them in the dryer , they would probably turn into doll clothes , save your money & buy the cheaper satin version , at leat they do n't get ruined in the wash .
 Got these for Christmas from my wife . They looked great but it 's February and the crotch is already completely torn out of them . Just turning over in bed is more than the material can handle . I do NOT recommend these .
 I recently bought these silk pajamas for my husband 's birthday . Within a week , all the button fell off the top and the fabric frayed 2 - 3 inches wide along the seams in the pants along the thighs . I paid $ 160 dollars for these pajamas , more than silk PJs listed from other suppliers on Amazon , expecting I was buying quality . After a week 's use , they are heading for the rag bag and I feel defrauded .
 If you want a cheap thin shirt that likely will not last a dozen washings then this is the shirt for you.Be aware that Amazon has a $ 3.99 plus $ 0.99 -LRB- per item -RRB- return shipping fee.Is all Bill Blass stuff this `` quality '' ?
 I have this in all 3 colors , and only the blue color looks fine . The other two colors , I do n't think I would like to wear to office where I am a mid-manager level . Reason being that the fabric is a blend hence thinner than the normal 100 % cotton shirts that I prefer . Looking at the retail price of the shirt , I was expecting something better .
 High Sierra Axle Wheeled Backpack.The straps are thin and hurt my childThe two lower black bottons came off within a weekThe wheels are not smooth dispite that there are four wheelThe handle has only one position which is to long four anyone under 5feet 2 inches .
 The backpack broke after less than a month of use . The material was pretty flimsy for the price . Overall , very disappointing .
 I could n't believe how cheap this costume is for the price . The hair is a very dark color and did n't even stay up through the night . I even bought extra bobby pins and it still fell . The dress is a piece of fabric , very simple and very cheap .
 I bought this and ended up returning it . The `` belt '' included is a piece of fabric with the silver buckles painted on that you tie behind your back . The dress itself is a cheap see-through fabric . I did n't take the wig out to look at it because I knew as soon as I saw the rest of the product I was returning it and I could n't return it if the wig was opened . I returned the product and made my own with higher quality fabric at a fraction of the price . It may not be the licensed product but it looks nicer . If I were in charge of Star Wars licensing I would be embarrassed to offer such a chintzy product with the SW logo attached .

 High priced , supposedly nice items should be presented nicely ... with a little class . This item was wrinkled and disheveled . Looked like a 6 year old packed it . Actual garment quality was poor and in no way die it warrant a price so high !

 But One Size Fits All just is n't the case with this hat . While it does fit on my head , with the strap adjusting to the correct length , the hat does not pull down nearly as far as any of the other hats I own.I wanted a blank hat , that would go with anything , but this hat does not fit down to the top of your ears , where I think you 'd want it to -LRB- it comes up about 1 inch short or more -RRB- . So your head will definitely be cold in the winter , and you will definitely feel like you 're wearing a yamaka , and not a baseball cap.I do n't just think it 's that I have a big head , I think this hat is just made differently than you 'd expect .
 Not since man began to walk upright would a robe with arms as long as these fit anyone not under contract to the NBA.Jerry
 I thought the shirt would be a good deal . hey . . for 10 bucks , there is not much to lose . The fabric of the shirt is decent . Too bad the shirt comes in 3 sizes larger than what you ordered . Amazon did n't get my order wrong , its just that cacharel makes their shirts very ... very ... large . But if you 've got the body to fit it , you better jump on the deal .

 I got two of these panties after reading other reviews . Yes , they are indeed nice and comfortable . However , the trims on the panties came off in several places after the first wash . It is ridiculous to pay $ 16 for THIS kind of quality . I am very disappointed !

 I am very unimpressed by this product . Sizing is very small and the product it flimzy and poorly made . After 2 washings it had shrunk to the point where I just threw it away . I would n't recommend this product to anyone .
 They are not fitted . They are very puffy and baggy . Do not fit at all like they are suppose to .

 Cheep material used so that it produces `` stretch '' marks in the fabric when you tighten the back . also it was way to tiny for my chest , I wear a 32 D to give you an idea of what I mean by too small .
 they do not answer the phone , have called to say glasses cracked after 2 months , they have no phone service to talk to customer service-pissed
 this thing is way too heavy . the interior quality is bad , full of useless plastic boxes . the overall feel of cheapness .
 Very cheap make . Too big . Do not buy this product . I 'm disappointed with Samsonite for such a cheap product .
 This is a different design . It does not have a zippered pocket like the previous ones and has no place to store small itmes such as keys etc. . If you store small items behind the back flap they fall out or get stuck on the sides .

 This had no effect on pet hair . Personally , masking tape wrapped around your hand works better .
 I recently purchased 8 of these bras and although I loved the fit , I 'm afraid that 4 out of 8 have had an identical problem in stitching at the center top part of the bra . All of them have unraveled stitching during the first wash causing the underwire to poke out . All were hand washed and were hung to dry so I 'm afraid it ca n't be blamed on machines . I 'm greatly disappointed
 I purchased two of these shirts for my father and my brother as part of their Christmas gifts . We are all Chicago Bear Fans and we all enjoyed the famous SNL skits about `` Da Bears . `` However , the shirts proved a disappointment as the quality was not there in the silk screening of the image -LRB- poor image quality and the print was crooked on one shirt -RRB- . The lack of quality extended to the shirt material -LRB- burlap comes to mind -RRB- . The manufacturer/vendor was simply out to make some fast money .
 I wanted a Mississippi State Bulldog shirt , but the bulldog is ugly.Be sure to look carefully at the logos before you buy . The shirt is great and the seller was wonderful .
 I ordered something , and a week later , it did n't arrive . I called and they said , `` Oh , sorry , we do n't have it . '' They seemed stoned and clueless .
 I PAID WAY TO MUCH FOR THIS ITEM . I SHOULD HAVE WAITED AND HIT THE FLEA MARKETS IN FLORIDA . I COULD HAVE GOTTEN THIS CHEAPLY MADE IN ASIA ITEM FOR $ 3 - $ 5 AT MOST . SO DISAPPOINTED THAT I PAID $ 20 PLUS SHIPPING .
 Beware of all of the positive reviews ! They are marketing plants ! Notice that all of the 5 star reviewers only review shirts for this and another company .
 I 've never really had shirts ` break apart ' like these did . They looked ok for a couple of washes but afterwards they completely fell apart . Simply a bad product . Not worth the cheap price .
 UGLY UGLY shirts . The texture/pattern was hiddeous . I immediately donated them to the Salvation Army truck around the block from my home - months after I dug them out of my closet . -LRB- It was too late to return them -RRB- .
 Cheaply-made , strange cut , bad fit . Makes a great gift for a father-in-law from whom you do not expect any inheritance .
 The strap loops and strap adjusters triggered a severe nickel allergy on my back where they touch the skin . There should be a warning on the tag but there is n't . If you have a Nickel allergy do not buy this . In most bras these connectors and adjusters are covered with or use plastic . This is bare metal and contains enough Nickel for an almost instant breakout .
 ALL OLGA BRAS RUN SMALL ... FOR SOME REASON , OLGA BRAS ARE MADE SMALL ON THE SIDES OF THE CUP . . I AM A 36 DD , NEVER HAVE A PROBLEM WITH BALI , ETC. . . I HAVE TRIED MANY OLGA BRAS ON AND HAVE ALSO TRIED ON A NEXT LARGER CUP SIZE , I HAVE TRIED GOING DOWN A BAND SIZE AND UP THE CUP SIZE , OR WHATEVER , STILL USELESS FOR ME ANYWAY . . IT 'S JUST NOT A GOOD BRAND FOR ME . . I WAS TOLD BY 2 FITTERS , IF YOU ARE A 36 DD , YOU ARE A 36 DD , THAT IS THAT . SOME BRANDS ARE JUST NOT RIGHT FOR YOU , SO DO N'T TRY CHANGING THE SIZES ... I AGREE ... THANK YOU , GOOD LUCK
 The outer lace on this bra began ripping on the first wear and now there are little rips 1-2 inches all over the cups of the bra . Disappointing to say the least
 Ordered a 38D for someone who has always been a 38D and it was too small . The tags were already off so it can not be returned . Wo n't be doing business with these folks again soon .
 This bra works okay but the material is really uncomortable . The lace cups is n't feel like flour sack material .
 I wish I had read the previous review before I ordered this bra . It does n't just run on the small side , the sizes are completely off . Believe us , the cup size is about 2 sizes smaller than should be . If you order a `` D '' cup in this bra , you will get the equivalent of a `` B '' cup , I went so far as to measure it against a `` B '' cup and they were approximately the same size . Save you money , time , and return postage .
 The sizing is seriously off on this item . I am on the small side of a 36D and prefer minimizer bras . Although I always wearing bras on the tightest hook , on even on the loosest hook , this bra was too tight . The D cup fit like a B cup .
 I bought a pair last year , which was early style -LRB- made in Italy -RRB- , it was awsome ! some how I broke the frame . So I ordered this one from UVEX sport , they described it as made in Italy , but actually made in China . The quality was awful ! It slips and the lense had some optical problem . I was forced to returned it after one day . so I glued my old one back and use it as it , and It still works GREAT ! All I can say is `` OVER PRICE KNOCK OFF , ''
 Ordered this t-shirt for my son and Old Glory , the supplier , did not send the order and just relinguished the order with no explanation . WARNING . . do not buy from Old Glory . . it 's a waiste of time , they will get your money and then a few months later refund with no explanation . Old Glory is keeping the money in the bank and getting interest for the few months till the refund .

 I used to have a neck gaiter from an army surplus store but at some point lost it . I bought this item as a replacement , and unfortunately it 's quite different than the old one
 My pants of this brand i hv bought a year ago shredded unfeasible sewing , the solution would be mailto analysis the fabric have told me , but the post costs is almost the price of the pants , unfortunatly i did n't buy in Amazon , perhaps i could have more support as i have had with my previous purchases .
 I thought the shirt would be a good deal . hey . . for 10 bucks , there is not much to lose . The fabric of the shirt is decent . Too bad the shirt comes in 3 sizes larger than what you ordered . Amazon did n't get my order wrong , its just that cacharel makes their shirts very ... very ... large . But if you 've got the body to fit it , you better jump on the deal .

 This item was ordered the afternoon of Dec. 19th 2012 as a Christmas gift . They shipped the item Dec. 24th ! Did n't receive it until January 2nd . Cap is perfect fit and excellent embroidery.Different color was purchased separately , knowing it was late but still as another gift for the holidays . -LRB- Red with yellow flame cap -RRB- Ordered on Dec. 21st . Shipped on Dec 27th . Received it January 5th . Cap was frayed at not less than 5 spots in the embroidery . Pay for shipping yet again ? Not worth it ... Very irritated with this vendor
 The wallet looked very nice , however , when I put all my things in it , the snap would not stay shut . It seems to be `` outlet '' quality not fit for a Coach retail store or department store
 The description on this product clearly states ` hair bows ' , and then lists 5 separate colors . However , what I received was 1 bow , for $ 10 plus $ 6.95 shipping . I will say that after 2 phone calls went unreturned , the company did respond to an email and did agreeably refund my money .
 I do not normally write reviews , however , the product I ordered , the organic burp cloths , was not the item I received . Although I should contact the seller , the item I received , which was a pack of 2 organic round bibs -LRB- smaller than normal bibs , primarily for drool and spit-up -RRB- , was okay AND I 'm 9 1/2 months pregnant and do n't have the time or energy to deal with returning something that I can use . However , buyers beware , the item I ordered was not the item I received , and although I have n't used or washed the cotton mini-bibs yet , the are not the best of quality . My thought was , organic would be nice , but they seem very cheaply made . We will see . Either way , not impressed and just wanted to give everyone else a heads up on this !
 I never even got to use these . I washed them once time while I was getting things ready for the baby . One of the washcloths completely fell apart . I plan to contact the manufacturer and Amazon .
 I ordered these burp cloths , but instead got 2 very small bibs -LRB- the ones that just go around the baby 's neck -RRB- .
 I was not pleased with this product . First of all , they 're made in China . Can something made where 90 % of the ground water is contaminated with pollution really be considered organic ? Secondly , after only one washing -- before even being used -- the quality was seriously degraded . They are cheaper than other organic burp cloths , but I guess you get what you pay for .
 These are not nearly as soft and absorbent as I had hoped . Also , there are many loose threads and the quality is not at all what I expected . I say save your money for another product . My favorite burp clothes are the Babies R Us brand .
 When I received this cap I thought I was getting a letter . The cap was crammed into a flat envelope . Terrible quality , very flimsy brim . Awful item . I do n't know where the positive reviews came from . This is a cap I will NEVER wear . In fact it went from the envelope it came from straight into the trash where it belongs . Very bad buying experience would not ever buy from this seller again . This is NOT a military cap . It 's a crap cap made in China .

 My husband does n't like to wear shirts under his dress shirts ; however , he will have to with these . I ordered 2 whites and 1 tan . They are nice looking but very , very thin . The retail tags say $ 45 . I 'd be quite upset if I had paid that much ! I guess for $ 9.99 , they 'll be okay . I did n't save a lot though cause now I have to buy some new t-shirts to wear underneath ! If you do n't have a white-collar job , these would be fine -LRB- at a reasonable price -RRB- for occassional wear . However , my husband has to wear them everyday , and I doubt they will hold up well since they are so thin .
 I ordered several designs of the Cacharel shirts and was very disappointed when they arrived because the fabric was extremely thin . I always wear a white undershirt , and that fact was very evident since one could literally see through the shirt .
 This was the funniest thing at Halloween , but it was also broken.It lasted one day before it dropped out of his mouth and a whole 20 inches to the ground and snapped a piece off.I would not buy again .
 There is no way the regular price for this shirt should have EVER retailed for 25.00 . It is a plain T-shirt made with cotton and polyester , Nothing special about this shirt . For 10.99 I could/should have gone to Ross , Sears , anywhere and bought 3 of the same type of shirts for 10.99 . I have purchased Maxit products before and was pleased until now . I was enticed when I saw the regular retail and then the closeout price , assuming I was getting a deal . The regular retail for the shirt is 10.99 and should be sold for $ 3 or $ 4 max ! Also , no where close to an Under Armour Shirt ...
 Shirt arrive in good condition BUT the company filled my mailbox with junk mail so much so that I had to out a block on anythig that came from them

 I 've never really had shirts ` break apart ' like these did . They looked ok for a couple of washes but afterwards they completely fell apart . Simply a bad product . Not worth the cheap price .
 UGLY UGLY shirts . The texture/pattern was hiddeous . I immediately donated them to the Salvation Army truck around the block from my home - months after I dug them out of my closet . -LRB- It was too late to return them -RRB- .
 Cheaply-made , strange cut , bad fit . Makes a great gift for a father-in-law from whom you do not expect any inheritance .

 Save yourself the time and money and go to a thrift store , and an artshop and buy the shirt and paints . . Paint it and then throw it in the bin - this should at least save you the postage costs for this shirt
 1st , the cups were a bit small , & I know I gave the right size . Then , the strap broke ! It 's pretty , & they had my size , which is a small miracle in itself , but I would n't buy this again !
 This bra is not true to size it is smaller than the 34 G bra I was replacing . The faberic is very ichy and uncomfortable . A very disapointing purchase .
 I think the fit of the bra is great , but I can only wear it briefly because it is so uncomfortable . The fabric is stiff and itchy and the metal adjustments in the front poke me on both sides . I have washed it several times to try and soften the fabric ; did n't work . I would love to be able to wear it because it give such good support and shape , but I just ca n't .
 The size is wrong . I ordered my regular size and it 's much too small . Am returning for a larger . We 'll see .

 When trying on this body shaper it was comfortable but being a BBW there was NO support . Was like putting on a comfy pair of undies . Being larger through the middle , the high top would roll when sitting . Had to return the item .

 No wonder that this bottom is placed in the under $ 24 category . It is cheap and fragil . The fabric is very poor . I was at a waterpark and was going to be daring and go down a waterslide headfirst for the rush . Because this was against the rules , my friend videotaped the act and also got many spectators to watch . I got by the staff person and went down . As I went down the friction -LRB- which is n't a lot -RRB- caused the strap to break off . This means I come down bottomless and give some a good show . After about 30 seconds , I notice in horror that I only have half my bathing suit . I could n't find it . Then I had to go back naked to get a towel . The worst experience of my life and I will never ever forger it . I tell this story so a similar fate does n't happen to you . I care unlike the makers of the bikini bottom .

 It 's actually a very poorly made and easily damaged costume . The purple color comes off in a strong breeze . Therefore it is very overpriced . Mine arrived with the fabric pre-ruined , but I do n't have time or funds to make/buy another costume . You are much better off just buying a wig and putting the rest of the costume together yourself .
 I ordered the Jane Jetson Halloween costume and was excited to wear it to a party . I had tried it on at a store and it fit really well , but I decided to order it online to save a few bucks . What a mistake ! When I received it I very briefly looked at it and put it aside until Halloween . Well to my surprise , when I was putting the leggings on , it turned out that my package had two right legs instead of one right leg and one left leg . There is a white stripe that runs down the outside of the legs . I had one stripe on the outside of my right leg and one stripe on the inside of my left leg when I wore it . It ruined the costume . On top of that the leggings kept sliding down my legs ALL NIGHT LONG . It turned what would have been a fun night into a really long night and I just wanted to go home and take it off . I had to wear it since I did n't have a back-up costume , otherwise I would have returned it .
 Bag is very pretty and functional - the only thing is the leather on the handle has seperated and does not look nice - especially when this is a designer bag it almost makes it seem not real - A Prada bag should not do this .

 Wrong size arrived , 38 &#34; waist was ordered , 42 &#34; waist arrived . Returned the item , ordered a second pair hoping for a 38 &#34; waist . No luck , the second pair arrived with a 35 &#34; waist.They fitted someone we know so we kept them . We will not order this item again . Someone at the factory needs to measure the waist before the item is sent out , it 's such a waste of time and money to keep returning items.The item is lightish blue as represented in picture , the jeans are comfortable because of the stretch . Wish I knew a a reliable company that sells men 's stretch jeans .
 First of all this product is described as a `` ladies '' size , but it is actually a missy , or junior size . The company describes this item as shipping within 24 hours for instock items . It took a full week for them to ship it out even though it was listed as `` in stock '' the whole time I was waiting for it to finally ship . This caused my Christmas gift to arrive well after Christmas , had it shipped within the 24 hours as the company promised I would have recieved it with time to spare . I sent several emails to this comapny all of which were met with a `` sorry , we are experiencing problems with our email servers and they are down right now please try again later '' This company 's level of service was a joke .
 my boyfriend currently wears 32x32s that were getting a bit tight and a bit long on him . for some reason these in 34x34 were ridiculously huge ! Returned
 These pants are fake no tags fake packaging.the zipper was broke.I work in 874s for over 25 years an I know how they look an feel an these look an feel &#34; FAKE &#34;
 I generally wear a 38x30 , and that 's what I bought in these , they are sized quite a bit smaller in the waste . I 'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in , but you may want to get a waste size up . I 'll be wearing them in a dress office setting , and I 'm surprised how good these look , hopefully they last a long time too .
 My husband always wears 36 30 . He has several Dickie pants ... I got 874 which were the wrong ones . They were stiff and small . I had to return and now pay postage beause they were part of another order making over $ 25 . Also had to go to UPS and post and will have return postage taken out of refund ... My mistake and I paid for it
 for no apparent reason these are humongous . my bf currently wears 32x32 which are a bit short and a bit tight on him so we tried to go a size up - but for some reason these were ginormous !
 i ordered gray and they sent green . GREEN , come on guys really ? at least they were the right size . well done
 I remember when I was a teenager Dickies would last forever ; nowadays they fall apart pretty quickly . I think they must be cutting costs on quality control ...
 I had a pair of Dickies fall apart after a month . Then they would n't honor the warranty . Shady company and now making crap products .
 The pants have so much wrong with them , plus they look awful . It is my guess that dickies enjoys making money at the expense of the customer , both by making them pay too much for them and making them look stupid wearing them .1 . -RRB- CARDBOARD PANTS . They are STIFF . Wash them 100 times and I guarantee you they will still feel like cardboard .2 . -RRB- They are so tapered they barely fit over any boots you wear . Your feet look enormous next to these skinny pants . NO ROOM !! 3 . -RRB- They ride so high on your waist it is uncomfortable4 . -RRB- They are n't sized properly , a 36 is a 34 , 34 is 32 etc. ... STAY AWAY .
 Waist is not true to size just like many dickies products , its better if you just go to a store and try them on first
 These pants , for me , where a bit tighter than I thought it would be , also stiffer and smaller than I had hoped .
 I 've been buying Dickies , particularly the 874 's for over 20 years and I was n't impressed with these ones at all . . While the item was clearly marked as a Dickies product , it did n't look or feel like any pair of Dickies I 've ever bought before.The material seemed very thin , and the pants had no factory crease . . Live and learn . .
 Just going to list the issues
 Be aware that these run small - At least by a size or more . And they 're straight leg , not boot cut , so there 's a bit of a taper at the ankle .

 I love Vanity Fair Full Slips but this one was just to small for me . I will be looking for a larger size .
 This could be a really great item . The length is perfect if you are a knee length skirt/dress wearer . The material is not bulky and stays static free . The fit is comfortable enough that I do n't notice I 'm wearing it under a dress . I gave it two stars though because of one detail that I find excessively annoying

 I bought this shirt and had to return it immediately . The color is not bright and I can best describe it as off white . The medium size of this shirt appear to be larger than what I normally wear . The design is beautiful but in all , I did not like the shirt .

 Do not play poker with these sunglasses , even though they are `` casino sunglasses '' . They look good in the picture , what you actually get is quite different . First of all , there is a sentence written in white letters on one of the lenses saying that these are UV protected sunglasses . Do not even think about scratching that off the lenses , you simply can not . Perhaps this was written to let people watching you know what type of sunglasses you are wearing . Second of all , the screws on the center of the glasses are loose ... -LRB- Why ? -RRB- . I have bought this model twice . The first time I thought it was because the manufacturer wanted the customer to adjust and tight the glasses ; they were too loose that feel off my face and broke ... my fault ... perhaps . I decided to buy a second pair and the same thing happened again . This time one of the screws got lost and the lenses came off . I have been unable to find replacements , I even took them to a professional sunglasses boutique at a mall and they said it was impossible . Bottom line , try them first , see how they look on you , then buy them if you like them .

 My daughter chose this messenger bag because of the print , but we had n't realized it was n't a regular size messenger bag . That was our mistake for not looking at the product dimensions , but it never occurred to me that a bag labelled as a `` messenger bag '' would be so small . She can not fit her folders or homework book in it . We have found another use for it , but she was disappointed nonetheless .
 It 's tiny -LRB- can not fit an 8.5 x11 single subject notebook -RRB- and kind of cheap-looking . I 've had other items from Jansport which had a much higher-quality fabric .
 I did the same thing as another reviewer . Saw a cute pattern and the words `` messenger bag '' and thought I had a new bag for school . This bag is the worst . Very flimsy . It holds nothing for my classes - does n't even fit a notebook - and certainly is n't nice enough to use around town for an every-day bag . Unless you 're , like , 12 . Useless .
 I blame Shirley for false advertising . When I saw this handsome set of shorts on the most gorgeous men ever , I thought they would come with the package . Instead all I received was a balding middle aged UPS guy with a stain on his shirt . Regardless , I still made him strip dance and put the shorts on . Not as satisfying , but when your an 82 year old grandmother you need something to alleviate the boredom . Great product if you can find the kind of guy who would look good in it .

 The leather on this coin purse is nice and it 's a perfect size - my problem with it is that the hinges that you squeeze on the edges are exposed and rather sharp . I ended up punching a hole in it and attaching a keyring , which worked fine . I tried squeezing the hinges with a pair of pliers to round the edges and ended up breaking the hinge -LRB- my problem , not the product 's -RRB- This product would easily get 4 stars if there was a small strip of leather covering the hinges and 5 stars if it had covered hinges and a keyring attachment .
 This pouch arrived already torn of damaged at the corner . This kind of item takes a lot of opening and closing wear and this one would not last long at all .
 This is not well made . The whole function is to squeeze it open , but when you do , the exposed hinges pinch your fingers . It is also very stiff . I threw it out . Save your money .
 Functionally it works as described , but the material seemed very cheap , but I guess you get what you pay for . That would be fine , but the material really smelled . I tried to wash it , but the smell stuck around on the material so I have a distrust of using it with my hands .
 Nice leather . The squeeze portion broke immediately and I was never able to use it . Overall not a well designed product .
 I previously bought some coin purses similar to what is pictured . What I got looks similar but , not the same product . For one , there is a ring inside which if you pull out keeps the coin purse somewhat open and coins could fall off . The ring inside the purse is a hazard which could result in your fingers getting hooked by that said ring . I will cut off the stupid ring which does not serve a useful purpose for a small coin purse . Will avoid dealing with this company . If you do not have the exact same product then , do not switch products without asking the customer . Considering the cost of the items , returning it would be pointless and not cost effective .
 The service was good , but I was not happy that it was necessary . Barely three weeks after the arrival of the coin pouch , one of the hinges BROKE . The company responded well to my e-mail , and sent a replacement - which just arrived . IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN IF THIS IS A SATISFACTORY OUTCOME . .
 the metal cladps stick out on the end of the purse and dig into your fingers when you try to open it up . Its quite obvious that nothing will be done about this , so doi n't waste time asking to write a review
 It looked like a good idea , but it broke soon after using it . There is a real need for a place for men to put their change !
 Bought 2 shirts $ 29.99 did not really think this through for the shipping charges $ 20 per shirt , 2 shirts came in one box -LRB- size of a medium pizza box -RRB- . The company did offer to take the shipment back but , it was too late , I opened the shirts . After 2 washes , they are not holding up too well , so overall . I would not endorse this company or product.Amazon though , did acknowledge my issue with this shipping transaction as best they could . I hope they will improve for the next buyer .

 I have bought almost 8 shirts from this manufacturer . This particular model has problems . Firstly , the sizes are not true -LRB- actually somewhat larger than indicated -RRB- . Secondly , the sleeve construction is about two sizes smaller than the size indicated . I agree with the previous reviewer on this issue .
 I ordered a black and a navy XXL shirt.The black was slightly larger than a normal XXL , but is wearable.The navy XXL chest size measures approximately 62 - 64 !!! This is larger than many 4XL shirts I have seen . And is no where close to the generic sizing chart that Amazon provides.For both shirts to be from the same manufactuer and line and to be completely different in size makes me leary to purchase clothes from this manufactuer again .
 The suction cup did not stay on the wall and the radio did not work . The light never goes off .
 hung for less then 5 min . fell . it was broken in the package . listen to the reviews . worst item ever its my 2end one . dont buy pos
 This mirror sucks . First use , fell two times and fogged over . Do not purchase ! Did not try radio , what 's the point .
 This is the worst product I 've ever seen.The `` mirror '' is n't really glass - just shiny plastic . The radio 's volume is almost non-existent and the knobs break off as you take it out of the package.Awful product . Do not purchase !
 My wife bought this for me as a stocking stuffer for Christmas to use on travel when staying in hotels . Unfortunately it will never be used due to the terrible design and manufacturing . I removed the product from the box and emptied out all of the parts on the bed only to find out that the parts were n't all supposed to be detached from the product . The detached parts consisted of a couple small plastic chipped or broken pieces , the tuner dial -LRB- knob -RRB- , and the razor holder . The tuner knob is what the chipped plastic pieces go to , thus the radio is not even worth attempting to operate . The razor holder has plastic nubs that lock it in place to prevent it from falling off , however on mine they are shaved or broken off on one side , rendering it useless to attempt to hang a razor . Additionally , there is a large crack in the plastic on the back side of the product near the lower-mid section that goes all the way through . Although this was clearly enough to warrant returning the pos , I inspected the device further for mere amusement . The am/fm selector switch was extremely difficult to move and took all of my strength and multiple attempts to finally slide it . Then I tried to mount the suction cup to the shower without success , yet I did finally get it to stick to my bed post after putting all of my weight on top of it.My overall opinion is that this is the cheapest made junk I have ever owned or seen for that matter . I will never purchase anything made by Totes again as long as I live , but I doubt they will be in business much longer judging from the reviews of a few of their products .
 A so called `` fog-free mirror '' that fogs within minutes of the shower running.The clock is terrible and keeps horrible time , within days it will lose hours or add hours , have to constantly reset it.The light doesnt even work , press the button and nothing happens.The only thing that was working properly is the radio but that didnt long as the whole unit fell off the wall thanks to the junky suction cup , now nothing works and the unit receives no power .
 This product is a waste of time . Out of the box and nothing worked . No lights , no radio . Now that I read the other reviews I see this is not uncommon . I will not perchase Totes products in the future .
 I really like the radio part of this , but the fog free mirror was definitely not fog free . As soon as I turn the shower on it would fog almost instantly . I ended up having to take the batteries out because the light that was suppose to auto shut off would stay on constantly .
 The `` lighted '' feature is completely useless . The light is aimed wrong and does n't illuminate anything . Though the mirror is good with fogging , it is n't a very good one.The LCD Clock and radio is a good touch , unfortunately I do n't use them.Maybe the makers should 've just concentrated on the mirror ... maybe made it magnifying or just a little bigger .
 I bought the mirror at about $ 30.00 for a Christmas present for my husband . The suction cups kept the mirror up for about a few hours after that it kept falling off the wall . The clock broke because it fell . Then we hung it a different way and not even a month later it is like a regular mirror . It fogs , what happen to fog less mirror !?! This is a rip off . Do n't buy it . It looks like it is cheaper that in the picture . Total disappointment !
 Radio does not work . Suction cup holder broke . Do not buy this one .
 The mirror works . It is fog free.The clock does not work . It resets every time the radio is turned on and off.The radio is barely functional . It only picks up the radio station that has a super-strong , super-close signal . 95 % of the local radio stations can not be picked up .
 I bought this same product a few months back because it was kinda cheap . So far ... it has fallen off the wall a number of times and broken the piece that holds your razor , the mirror fogs up every shower , the little lights do n't do crap -- I regret buying it .
 Seems like a great product , but after recieving the first one . The FM radio did n't work and the light did n't work . The second one I recieved as a replacement , the radio worked , but still the light did not work . I was tired after this time and settled . My husband took it apart and fixed the light , but it would n't seal completely after closing , so he had to put tape around it . Was n't worth all the hassle .
 My husband has been wanting a fog free mirror to shave in the shower for so long ... I decided to purchase this on because it has a light , radio and clock included ... good deal right ? WRONG ! The mirror is ok ... but everything does not work . It 's not worth anyone 's money . Please dont make the same mistake I did .
 This is the first time i have ever written a review , but this piece of garbage is so bad , i had too.I Received this as a xmas present . The suction cup fails occasionally , and when it falls , things break on it . The batteries wont stay properly seated in the compartment , so i got ta smack the hell out of it to get the light on . The radio , used to work til it fell.But those are just novelties , i really cared about the mirror itself . Fog Free ? are you serious ? that lasted about a week , now it gets so fogged i cant see anything in it . . DONT buy this POS .
 This is my first review . I do not write reviews as I just do n't have the time . But , my experience with this `` Fog-Free '' mirror -LRB- that I got as a Christmas present -RRB- was so bad I felt obligated to write about it . I have been using various shower mirrors to shave for over 20 years and know what to expect . This has been the worst experience.The mirror is not very flat and there is distortion when you look into it . It is enough that some may feel a little sick when using it . The mirror was fog-free for about 2 weeks then I had to get it wet to use it . Then 2 weeks after that I had to get it wet and put the slightest bit of liquid soap on the mirror . I always rinsed the soap off after use with as little water as I could . I have been VERY careful to allow only the smallest amount of water to get on this product.The clock worked for the first week then it would fade out after just a few minutes of the shower being on . It is clear that it is losing all power as it resets every time . There are also small water drops inside the plastic cover over the clock.The light is bright but placed at the bottom of the mirror so you have get low to use it . It would have been better if the 2 LEDs had been placed one on each side of the mirror pointing a little in . This would have made them much more useful . The light starts to fade out in about 1 minute until it is off . After almost 2 months of use the light is stuck on and I have to pull the batteries out to turn it off.The radio works , barely . The dial is way too sensitive and trying to select any but the strongest signals is impossible . The dial is 1.5 '' across and the tuning area is only half the dial.The battery compartment is sealed well . No issues there.Today I opened it up to find out why things are not working any more . Now I know why , it is soaked inside . The rubber gasket between the front and back panels is not thick enough . The small ridge of plastic that is designed to push into that gasket and keep it water tight is too small leaving a large gap that allows water to get in VERY easily . The circuit board has parts hanging off by long wires or hot-glued in place and there are bare wires everywhere . If I could post a picture of the inside you would be appalled , I am . It is very clear that this product is very poorly designed and should be avoided . Buy a different product .
 Can be knocked off the suction cup and if it falls will break.DON `` T Buy - at some point the suction cup or it will get knocked down and then break into 100 pieces
 The worst product . Put the batteries in and I thought the on/off button was going to fall ... off ! No radio , no light , but hey , the digital quarter inch clock was flashing ! Went to turn the AM-FM knob and thought holy crap ! I need to go to the gym to turn this switch , but felt better moving the radio knob , it only requires you to bench about 400 pounds !
 These are NOT a true thearmal . This product mught have a purpose for a under the jacket wear , but it 's actualy COLD to wear on its own with a T-shirt over it . I tried to sleep in them & it was amazingly COLD when my arms would touch the cold part of my bed , or comforter . I think I was warmer without it . Out in my shop I tried to wear these with a T-shirt on top & it was just FREEZING ! My arms felt colder than if I just had a T-shirt alone . It 's almost like it does the opposite of what a thearmal should do . Maybe under a jacket or sweater it helps in some way , but I do n't like them at all . I feel I wasted my money .
 The sizing runs a bit small , potentially because of the spandex , but one thing that is way to short are the sleeves . I am a 36 chest and 5 ' 9 '' , and ordered the 38-40 size because the 34-36 sleeves were too short . However , even the 38-40 sleeves are still short by at least a full inch . Get this if you are stout and/or short . Not advisable for slender people as the chest/arm length ratio are not for the slender or even average person .
 Aside from the fact that it took two weeks for my order to arrive , once it finally arrived the shirt appeared to be a knockoff . In comparison to another Duofold item I purchased from another seller , this shirt is clearly inferior - not only is the material different but the tag appears to be an iron-on copy with several of the words blacked out . I would never buy from this seller again .
 No thermal value at all . I think I would be better off wearing 2 t-shirts . I work in a cooler all day and the only way I was warm at all was by working harder then normal to stay that way . They do breath really well so if you 're sweating you 'll stay dry . Great idea in a cooler . So as you move around the breeze from moving passes right through it and evaporates the sweat on you making you even colder . They do n't even fit as they should . The bottom is loose and the sleeves are loose and they are tight in the top . I have other thermals that fit very well but these do not . I even went two sizes smaller then the suggested sizing because I new I did not wear an XL as their sizing said I would based on my measurements.Maybe I received something wrong because what I have is a very thin all nylon looking shirt that is about as thick as spandex and has the same slick feel . Nothing soft about it .
 The Veritherm underwear shirts we purchased for our son were supposed to be midweight . However , they were much thinner than the midweight shirts we bought at the local outdoor gear store , even though they were supposed to be the same brand , style , etc. . Could there have been some mispackaging , or is someone misrepresenting the product ? Anyway , if you are looking for midweight polyprop underwear , steer clear of this stuff .
 Was supposed to be a mid-weight thermal . It is a very thin , light weight material with no thermal/insulation capability that I could detect . Also , I 'm 6 ' 0 &#34; with average arm length , ordered a Large , but the sleeves are at least 2 &#34; too short . This product , as advertised , is garbage . Not like my old Thermastat Duofolds that I love , and hoped would be similar to this product .
 As mentioned in other reviews these are made of very thin material . Consequently I found that they did not provide me with any real thermal warmth when I was stationary . I felt no difference in warmth between having these on as a base layer under clothing versus wearing the same clothing without these while I was stationary . They are stretchy and very comfortable however . My guess is that they would prevent one from getting cold during periods of activity by wicking away any perspiration from the skin . Since I needed something that would be provide warmth during periods of inactivity as well as during time of activity , I am returning these .
 I am sure that is what Duofold had in mind is a baselayer.I bought two of these based on other reviews , but these are not what I expected.First they run small.Normally I wear a medium , so I bought a large and it is still very tight.So buy accordingly.Second , I bought these to wear under my work shirts as I am in and out all day long ... make note , if the fabric gets cold , so do you.It is early fall here and the lowest temp I have encountered is 40 degrees.I went outside wearing this under my work shirt , the fabric got cold , so naturally so did I.Obviously I did not use the product correctly , as I believe under other layers and a winter jacket , it would probably help a great deal.For my needs , I 'll just head back to the old fashioned waffle type long undershirt .
 it looks cool , but It is too thin and kind of small . If you want some thing really warm , it is not good enough for you .
 the materials are very good , but the workmanship is disappointing , at the second wash begins to unpick , I just use it 2 times , materials are thin
 Very small product . If you have a small Child , then this will work for them . Normal Adult , pass on it .
 It works . But is super tight . I wear a large helmet but this is really snug fit . I lost my old one which i believe was cotton and fit better . It fit more like a sock . This one fits like a wetsuit . tight . It smashed my nose down when i ride . Before you buy make sure you want a snug fit balaclava .
 I purchased this after losing my Under Armour Tactical Hood , which fit with plenty of room to spare and was perfect for eating or drinking without needing to remove the whole thing off . When I first pulled the package out I noticed right away that it said `` fits most sizes '' and knew I would have a problem . I tried putting it on and my head had trouble fitting thru the neck area . I finally got it on I noticed the stitching goes right down the middle of your face and the stitching rubbed against my lips and figured it would irritate my lips if worn for a long period of time.If you wear a 7 1/2 or larger fitted hat or have a 22 1/2 inch or larger head I strongly suggest you find another Balaclava as this will most likely not fit .
 This balaclava was purchased to use on my 30-40 degree bike rides . It was too tight on my jaw and made breathing distracting . I have a smaller head too . It was not very warm . There is stiching down the center of the chin and is chaffs a bit . Disappointed .
 Like other reviewers , I find this balaclava to be way too small . It is definitely not one-size-fits-most . I have a normal sized head and nose , and it fits way too tight on both . One would think they can make a nylon material that conforms to the shape of one 's head without being too tight -LRB- like Under Armour 's products -RRB- . Oh well .
 Made in china , it is very thin and poor quality . I do not recomend it.i boght it form my motorcycle helmet .
 It is way too tight ... I thought it was just me , but I let a couple friends try it and it was way to tight on them as well . It will smash your nose to your face and smear your lips across your face.Purchase this product if you want a flat face with a headache !
 Pros
 I have 2 balaclavas from zan headgear . I bought one years ago at my military surlpus store , it fits great . The one I ordered from amazon.com is significantly smaller . It says one size fits all but that 's a lie . False advertisement .
 For the price , what do you expect -LRB- I suppose -RRB- , but there is NO WARMTH in this thing . It is just a CAMO cover for you head while playing in the woods , but that is all it is . It is wafer thin -LRB- but decently made -RRB- , and will provide no environmental protection of ANY kind ... so do n't be fooled . It is not for Skiing or cold weather protection , just for decoration .
 This balaclava is to small for an average man . It would fit better on a small kid or a girl .
 I purchased this item because I read some great reviews on it and because I needed a really good supportive jog bra . I was not happy about paying over $ 50.00 -LRB- with shipping -RRB- but I figured it had to be top of the line for that price . I received my bra and it was basically an overpriced sports bra that you could buy at your local walmart . It was very uncomfortable and it was huge . I had to check the size to see if I received the correct one . I do n't know if I received the wrong product but I was shocked to read the reviews and then to get such a low quality item for such a high price . Between shipping and returning it cost me $ 15.00 and I still have no jog bra . . ridiculous . .
 The shirt looks great in the package , but I found its fabric to be very thin . It was difficult to iron , and by the time I got to work it looked like I had slept in it . I bought 3 , and I 'm looking for a way to get rid of the 2 that I have n't opened yet .
 Bought 2 shirts $ 29.99 did not really think this through for the shipping charges $ 20 per shirt , 2 shirts came in one box -LRB- size of a medium pizza box -RRB- . The company did offer to take the shipment back but , it was too late , I opened the shirts . After 2 washes , they are not holding up too well , so overall . I would not endorse this company or product.Amazon though , did acknowledge my issue with this shipping transaction as best they could . I hope they will improve for the next buyer .

 I have bought almost 8 shirts from this manufacturer . This particular model has problems . Firstly , the sizes are not true -LRB- actually somewhat larger than indicated -RRB- . Secondly , the sleeve construction is about two sizes smaller than the size indicated . I agree with the previous reviewer on this issue .
 I ordered a black and a navy XXL shirt.The black was slightly larger than a normal XXL , but is wearable.The navy XXL chest size measures approximately 62 - 64 !!! This is larger than many 4XL shirts I have seen . And is no where close to the generic sizing chart that Amazon provides.For both shirts to be from the same manufactuer and line and to be completely different in size makes me leary to purchase clothes from this manufactuer again .
 I love Vanity Fair Full Slips but this one was just to small for me . I will be looking for a larger size .
 This could be a really great item . The length is perfect if you are a knee length skirt/dress wearer . The material is not bulky and stays static free . The fit is comfortable enough that I do n't notice I 'm wearing it under a dress . I gave it two stars though because of one detail that I find excessively annoying

 The scarves were good quality but I should have paid more attention to previous reviewers on this gift.the pack had about 5 or 6 black scarves and a couple other colors , nothing like the picture . save your dough on these scarves .
 I never received this order and they have not responded to emails regarding order status . This left me without gifts for co workers over the holidays ... I am out the money .
 Extremely dissapointed in the colors I received . Out of 10 , 6 were black , 3 red -LRB- 2 shades -RRB- , 1 pink . I could deal with 6 blacks and 4 different -LRB- and I mean different - not all red-toned -RRB- colors , but not with what I got . Useless.I 'm upset beyond words . Will never buy from this seller again , and will not recommend to anyone I know , unless the seller comes through and fixes this .
 wish there was a 0 stardo you people know what assorted means - you are morrons - what the hell am I supposed to do with 3 red shawls and 6 black shawls - this is not what I bargained for I could give them to friends but I dont have 6 girl friends I want somebody to fix this or I will never use or shop Amazon ever againI have never been so unhappy with a purchase in my lifehope you have a merry Xmas - I am not

 I ordered this dress a size bigger then my normal size and it was still too small in the chest . I was very disappointed because the dress was for a cruise to the Bahamas . I ended up getting a different dress from someone else .

 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .

They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .

 I love Vanity Fair Full Slips but this one was just to small for me . I will be looking for a larger size .
 This could be a really great item . The length is perfect if you are a knee length skirt/dress wearer . The material is not bulky and stays static free . The fit is comfortable enough that I do n't notice I 'm wearing it under a dress . I gave it two stars though because of one detail that I find excessively annoying
 I have bought almost 8 shirts from this manufacturer . This particular model has problems . Firstly , the sizes are not true -LRB- actually somewhat larger than indicated -RRB- . Secondly , the sleeve construction is about two sizes smaller than the size indicated . I agree with the previous reviewer on this issue .
 I ordered a black and a navy XXL shirt.The black was slightly larger than a normal XXL , but is wearable.The navy XXL chest size measures approximately 62 - 64 !!! This is larger than many 4XL shirts I have seen . And is no where close to the generic sizing chart that Amazon provides.For both shirts to be from the same manufactuer and line and to be completely different in size makes me leary to purchase clothes from this manufactuer again .
 If you 're a civilized grown adult and wish to dress up like a Star Wars creature please choose a character like Greedo , Admiral Ackbar or Bib Fortuna . Yoda is meant for kids -LRB- or little people -RRB- only . The person modeling this costume looks flat-out ridiculous and absurd . They should have used a child model in this case . Another character that 's just as bad a choice -LRB- for grown adults -RRB- is the Jawa . Please do not dress up like a Jawa if you 're over 5 feet . The BEST choice would be to dress up like Ponda Baba -LRB- Walrus Man -RRB- this Halloween season -- he 's somebody you do n't see that often , and he 's quite scary looking .
 First the postive - good material and good sizing mechanism.Now the negative - this hat did not even provide shade for my neck - seriously . My wife checked it out -LRB- and yes it really , really looks stupid -RRB- and she said it did not provide a single bit of shade to the back of my neck or my shoulders.I noticed that it did n't come low over my forehead either or shade my eyes much.It is really beyond me why a company that has such a good idea screws it up at the finish line . This hat is just too small to effectively shade against the sun . It really irritates me.So ... back it goes to Amazon.BTW it provided fine coverage for a 7 year old kid - that is how small it is.Argh ... . the other reviews must be seeded .
 As the other reviews suggest , this hat is too small . The diameter should be increased by at least 6 '' . Other materials should be considered as well .

 Shoe covers were a great idea I thought , however after my daughter put them on one of the bows fell off within 15 minutes . They also did not stay on her shoes very well , they kept slipping off . They were cute when they were put on unfortunately they just would n't stay on .
 I just received these a few minutes ago and was very excited to try them . I tried to put them on 2 different pairs of my daughters shoes and they do not fit . My daughter is 5 and wears a size 12-13 shoe . The package says 4 + but I think it should say 4 and under . Also one of them is flawed from being stretched over the insert that was in it . I guess I will see about returning .
 I read the reviews and ordered these anyway . My daughter wears a toddler size 8 and these were tight . They fell apart 30 minutes into our first party . The bows fell off , sequins dropped off and a hole ripped through each toe . This did not make my Dorothy very happy . Please do not purchase these . Go ahead and find a pair of actual shoes for under $ 10 at many retailers .
 The order said child , that means toddler . Then the sequins fell off & am still finding them everywhere . On a positive note
 These were described as fitting &#34; most children 's shoes &#34; but they were too small for anything but the smallest child 's shoes . They were also cheaply made and very thin .
 My daughter has size 12 feet and these covers were nowhere near big enough to work . More like size 7
 These really are too small for any child and should not be recommended for anyone over 3-4 years old . I bought for a 7 year old girl and only fit 3/4 of way over her shoes . We could not use them at all . Great price and a great idea , but not for anyone over 4 years old .
 I understood theseRuby Slippers Shoe Covers -LRB- Child -RRB- were a shoe cover , and not a slip on slipper-type shoe , but the item is a big disappointment . First , when I first opened the package , a ton of the red shiney sequins had already fallen off and were floating all over the bag . Not a great way to start off . And although I did read the shoes were a `` shoe cover '' , I thought perhaps -LRB- partly based on the picture -RRB- that there was a `` bottom '' to the shoe ... not just an elastic cord , which for my daughter , could be come an obstacle while walking - she 's 3 and pretty stable on her feet , but walking ON an elastic cord is somewhat awkward . Also , the back of the shoe has a velcro portion , which I 'm not sure why , considering the shoe is not adjustable , but it was poorly made , does n't lay flat , and `` pokes '' her when she walks . I know , you get what you pay for , but do n't pay for this !
 The slippers were cute . My daughters were happy to have them . They would have been a great product if they were both the same size . One shoe was huge an the other was about 4 sizes smaller . We were very disappointed . Other than the sizing issue , my girls have had fun with them .
 We ordered these to go along with our 5 year old 's dorothy costume . As she got them out of the box one of the bows fell off . And , as she tried to put them over her shoes the sequins started dropping off everywhere . These are a joke ! She wears a size 11 shoe and they had to be stretched to the max to fit over her flats . Just ordered some real shoes that are supposed to arrive on Halloween . Keeping my fingers crossed !
 I was very unhappy with my purchase ! I wanted to give the reviews the benefit of the doubt ; I should have went with the majority ! My two granddaughters and I had a Oz paarty and the shoe covers were off within the first 15 minutes ! I agree with the shopper who said to save your money and invest in your little girl a nice pair of red shoes that she will get to wear for more than just a few minutes ! Not worth the money ! : -LRB-
 This is really for an adult ! I thought it was for a child . Unfortunately I could n't use these , I would not recommend these . waste of money .
 The shoe covers were different sizes and did not stay in place . The bows came off some shoes prior to the tots going on stage . As they began to dance the shoe cover came off . They are cute but good for dress up only .
 These are so awful . I guess that is what I get for four dollars . They are not even a full booty , they are bottomless . Yeah , try wrapping a bottomless , thin , crappy piece of material around a bouncy toddler 's shoe and see how long it stays on there . Clue
 The size is listed as `` 38x30 '' although the tag and futher down in the description it shows the actual size as `` 48x30 '' . I did not order this but I was browsing and noticed the mistake .
 After the initial wash , one diaper lost a snap , after a second wash three more lost their snaps . Seems to be defective snaps or manufacturing.The material is very nice , and everything other than the snaps is well made .
 I returned the original belt because the size shipped was too small . I have still not received the replacement in size 40 that I orginally ordered . No vendor response would suggest no one use this vendor until they clean up their act .

 this belt does not stretch ... the seller responded by sending a belt that did stretch . Also this belt is not attractive at all . Just a dark brown bla ...
 This jacket is basically just a windbreaker , and an uncomfortable one at that . My biggest issue is sleeve length . Does the manufacturer think people 's arms end at their waist ?? If I bend my arm the sleeve chokes up all the way to my elbow ! What a joke ...
 These guys had Amazon cancel the order , stating that they were out of stock on grey -LRB- charcoal -RRB- large size jackets . However , right now and everytime since the cancelation , they state they have 2 left in stock ! What the heck is this crap ? Completely unprofessional . I ordered patches for this jacket once the order went through , so now I have patches and no coat . Completely unacceptable . Order yours somewhere reliable , not from these creeps . !
 I ca n't comment on this as the supplier could not meet what I required . I believe they should not be in this free market and should be expelled under creative destruction , which is to drive them out if they are not performing at market equilibrium .

 order got messed up-problem in fulfillment , but they handled it well . Got in white also - arms are the length for a chimpanzee . They need to QC this better . The tomato color is high quality , one of my favorites .
 These leggings were great out of the package . They fit perfectly and were very soft . However , after the first washing they shrunk quite a bit and the softness was lost . I would n't buy them again .
 I bought these because of the reviews . I usually buy the $ 5 leggings at forever21 and wanted to invest in a nicer pair but cant afford lululemons . . So I thought maybe it would be a similar but knockoff type brand . OMG these leggings are the EXACT same quality as forever21 's except the only difference is that these are $ 30 vs $ 5 ... I am returning them , reason being , is that they are see through and not worth the money . I also bought `` capezio '' leggings which I added the link below , and they are a little bit cheaper but more importantly NOT see through.http : / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002XZMCQK/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00
 My wife wore them once and the seam in the seat began to unravel . I also got her pair from Newport News that were of much sturdier construction . I would recommend going with those instead of these .
 5 ' 5 '' 140 lbs . I ordered these in large . They are great ; made in USA , nice fabric ; great price . So I ordered three more pair but sized up to XL so I could freely launder without them becoming too small . The XL are same as L. . . so I guess anyone larger than 140 should look elsewhere . They actually told me they add 1/8th inch to the XL . Now that is just ridiculous !!! I do notice that washing them makes the legs longer . Too bad because they are terrific tights .
 I returned these - too loose ... Have a hard time finding tall , slim sizes . Fabric seemed to be an ok weight , though I do n't know how they would have worn since I did n't keep them . Had to wait a few weeks for the return credit .
 These leggings sit low on the waist , nothing like the pictures . Pitbull and American Apparel are both using this brand now called In Touch . The materical is thin but comfortable but the lowrise fit ruins them . I am a real woman and I need a little more material for my waist and back side .
 I bought a pair of these leggins based on the reviews I read here . I literally wore them twice before the ripped at the seam . They also pilled extremely fast . Was n't worth the money
 I 'm 5 ' 3 '' 112 lbs . The small size is sluggish and 1 1/2 inches longer than I would like them to be . It 's well made and material is ok for the price-not too thick nor thin . I 'm afraid that they do n't have x-small size .
 I did n't care for these leggings . They are very thin and not at all substantial . I should have returned them , but kept them for warmer weather wear .
 I have been loyal to Danskin for a few decades , even though I 've occasionally tried other brands . The truth is that Danskin outshines them all
 These leggings shrink even when following garment care instructions.For this money the fabric should be of much better quality , they are see through.I doubt these will last.There are better choices .
 So I found a great deal on these and purchased two pairs ... however , I will only be wearing these with a long shirt or dress . I do n't know how many ladies who bought these have turned around , bent over , and taken a good look in the mirror . I have and got a great look at my ass ! I suggest not buying these if you plan on wearing them to yoga and doing some forward folds !
 I did n't try these on after purchasing for a couple months , and during the first wearing , the center seam busted and that was it . Needle holes had expanded and split along one side . Not a good quality fabric .
 I did n't find that these legging gave support . They were thin and I really could n't feel the spandex . They just were not what I wanted .
 The label on the back says `` City Lights '' -LSB- ... -RSB- Not really sure if it 's Athletica unless they do n't put that label on them . The pants are nice . But not what I was expecting . I 've used them for yoga and biking . They are comfortable and durable .
 These sunglasses were crooked from the beggining . I took them to a store to see if it could be fixed , but did n't change much . Big mistake to buy glasses over the internet .
 The title says relaxed fit carpenter jeans ... well they are not a relax fit . The waist is the right size , but there is almost no room in the leg and crotch area !!! I purchased 2 pair because they were a good price but even at under $ 20 a pair what good is it if they are so uncomfortable . Also make sure you wash them twice before you wear . Even using fabric softener they are very harsh .
 poor fit , non functional pockets , look like 5 dollar thrift store jeans . Wranglers are much much better for the same price .
 I have been wearing dickies carpenter jeans for years and found them to be of good quality at a reasonable price , looks like they are trying to make more money because the fabric is NOT 100 % cotton denim as they claim . They seem to be some sort of plastic fabric or such , the color is a lot darker then the jeans named this color before . The material is very course and rough to the feel . I am sorry to say I wo n't be buying this brand again !
 These have got to be the most uncomfortable pair of jeans I 've ever owned . The material feels like canvas - I 'm used to Levis , I figured I 'd try these because they were a lot cheaper ... . They fail .
 Jeans not color shown on website picture -LRB- indigo blue -RRB- and way baggy for normal size I wear . Live and learn .
 The pants I received look nothing like the picture . I was looking for a nice pair of jeans for my husband and picture was just what I wanted . When they arrived I was very disappointed . The stitching is white which maks the pants look really cheap . Most of the reviews indicate they are nice work pants and they might be but they 're not what I expected . I am definitely returning : o -LRB-
 After reading the reviews of this product , I was expecting to get at least an okay pair of jeans at a cheaper-than-my-usual cost . Needless to say , I was very disappointed when these arrived . The material was thinner than I expected it to be , the belt loops were wide enough to fit the width of two belts through and the color of the jeans were a lot bluer than the advertised picture -LRB- a very dark blue instead of a more faded , stone-washed blue -RRB- . I have no problems with the sale . It arrived on time , etc. , etc. . But I do n't think I will ever buy a cheaer-than-average pair of jeans ever again . Have since gone to the lee 's jeans website and ordered directly through them .
 These looked SUPER cool in the picture ... but in real life these were way too BLUE for us ... him ... and they were HUGE !!!!!!!!!!!! ... ran bigger than the size we normally order for my husband . ALSO ... as far as returning them ... WHAT A PAIN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Boooooooo on all levels ...
 Every time I wash the pants . . They are so wrinkled ... I highly doubt I will be buying these again . . Not a good buy . .
 I am not an actual belly dancer , but I have been doing it since i was very young . I saw the price and i thought it was a good deal , when i got the thing home and tied it on , to show the rest of my family , my mom asked me were those beads rolling across the floor part of my scarf . The scarf says it is 60 ' long . but if you have forty inch or more hips like me , it wont work for you .

 It comes with a matching washbag and the cotton is soft , which is nice . What I do n't like about this product is that the dots are actually printed on the fabric ! It makes this product feel cheap and I most importatly I worry about my daughter getting any of the plastic print in her mouth as she puts EVERYTHING in her mouth . It also feels as if the print will come off after a few washes . I only used it once , and will not use it again .
 This belt is printed on . The printing is so so . The buckle is a friction fit bar that does not work well . I returned it . They have a high shipping cost , a 20 % restocking fee and then if you have to return something you have to ship it again . It is still worth returning even with these deterants because you really can not sell this in good conscience on ebay or you will get a horrible rating . Just realize that galaxy army navy is not like a regular store . They do not have regular return policies . It is a 20 day return policy and the 2 things I got I had to return . I really wanted them to work and not believe the other reviewers . Now I am just waiting to see if they give me credit for my purchase . They do have stores in NY so if you live there buy them at the store . I do not live there.The belt is low quality . There is better stuff at target , walmart and k-mart even exculding their high end stuff . This stuff is really low end . I wish it was not because I really wanted these products to work.Update I finally realized the quality this is . It is something you would get at one of those stores where everything is a dollar .

 Product description did not say that pants were 18Long . Since I am 5 ' 1 '' , they are unwearable and will have to be sent back .

 What came in the mail looked nothing like the picture . I hate the product that they sent , it is matronly and ugly . I do n't know where they got the picture that they show , but it is not what you get . Careful of this company !

 I have previously bought a lot of these shirts . Over time , a peculiar problem surfaced . Shrinkage -LRB- natural in a cotton shirt -RRB- affected one side of the front of the shirt , in the up and down direction , more than the other . As a result , the button holes in the placket increasingly became farther apart than the buttons , causing the shirt to have extensive wrinkling on the button side . I am not a tailor , but what I suspect happened is that the Banks buyers failed to specify how the warp and woof of the fabric were to be matched -- an expensive mistake.A second problems arises from product sizing . When I moved from a 16.5-34 to a 17-34 , the shirt suddenly became a tent.I have not had these problems with other manufacturers , notably Eagle , Land 's End and Enro .
 Bad fit for an ordinary guy . I ca n't imagine who they design such shirts for!I had luck with one of their Traveler shirts - really nice , and attempted to get another twice - no more !
 Unfortunely , my new Military T-Shirt was not prefect - the logo -LRB- US Navy -RRB- was off-center - the `` Y '' below logo was off .

 Please do not waste your time and money on this paper-thin , poorly-designed dress . Apparently , not all Italian-made clothes are made well . I sent it back immediately . VERY disappointed .

 I selected this one over the others here because it was n't labeled as small like some others . But it also is too small for an adult head . Wasted my money .
 I spent about 4 months ordering , trying on and returning nursing bras trying to find one roomy and supportive enough -LRB- every size chart is different , but I 'm in the 40J neighborhood -RRB- . I was optimistic about this one when I tried it on because the fabric is comfortable enough to sleep in and there was enough give in the cotton to allow for size fluctuations . But now that the baby 's here and I 'm actually nursing , I 'm frustrated enough with this bra to toss it after less than 2 weeks.Cons : - The band is not supportive and does n't stay put . I 'm constantly tugging at the back from where it rode up . It simply does n't have what it takes to keep heavy breasts in place . - The side stays dig into my side , which gets worse as the band rides up . They end up constantly poking my armpits . This is why I 'm not even keeping it to sleep in . - The cups are not supportive enough for heavy breasts . The fabric just stretches and bunches in odd places . - The hook and eye loops are the skimpiest nursing bra flap closure I 've ever seen . I keep expecting it to simply pull out of the fabric . The multi hook option for size changes is a nice idea in theory , but it does n't seem to make a lot of sense to do such a small hook in bras supposedly designed for large busted women.Pros : - The fabric is soft , which is a bonus for those early days of soreness . Right now the only bra I 've got that 's supportive enough is a sturdy - but rough - fabric.I think this bra would be fine for smaller busted women , but if you 've got some girls that need real support then you probably wo n't be happy with it .
 I did n't care for this one . The size runs small . It was a bit uncomfortable , so I ended up not using it and giving it away to a much smaller person .
 The cup size runs too small , i had cheaper nursing bras doing a way better job than this one
 This bra did not measure correctly . The band was very loose . It was not supportive . The hook and eye closures for the nursing cups are difficult to use .
 I have previously bought a lot of these shirts . Over time , a peculiar problem surfaced . Shrinkage -LRB- natural in a cotton shirt -RRB- affected one side of the front of the shirt , in the up and down direction , more than the other . As a result , the button holes in the placket increasingly became farther apart than the buttons , causing the shirt to have extensive wrinkling on the button side . I am not a tailor , but what I suspect happened is that the Banks buyers failed to specify how the warp and woof of the fabric were to be matched -- an expensive mistake.A second problems arises from product sizing . When I moved from a 16.5-34 to a 17-34 , the shirt suddenly became a tent.I have not had these problems with other manufacturers , notably Eagle , Land 's End and Enro .
 Bad fit for an ordinary guy . I ca n't imagine who they design such shirts for!I had luck with one of their Traveler shirts - really nice , and attempted to get another twice - no more !
 1st , the cups were a bit small , & I know I gave the right size . Then , the strap broke ! It 's pretty , & they had my size , which is a small miracle in itself , but I would n't buy this again !
 This bra is not true to size it is smaller than the 34 G bra I was replacing . The faberic is very ichy and uncomfortable . A very disapointing purchase .
 I think the fit of the bra is great , but I can only wear it briefly because it is so uncomfortable . The fabric is stiff and itchy and the metal adjustments in the front poke me on both sides . I have washed it several times to try and soften the fabric ; did n't work . I would love to be able to wear it because it give such good support and shape , but I just ca n't .
 The size is wrong . I ordered my regular size and it 's much too small . Am returning for a larger . We 'll see .
 Well the shorts looked good and fit well , but I had to re sew every button on the shorts as the buttons were all about to fall off and one did i guess in shipping

 I have bought almost 8 shirts from this manufacturer . This particular model has problems . Firstly , the sizes are not true -LRB- actually somewhat larger than indicated -RRB- . Secondly , the sleeve construction is about two sizes smaller than the size indicated . I agree with the previous reviewer on this issue .
 I ordered a black and a navy XXL shirt.The black was slightly larger than a normal XXL , but is wearable.The navy XXL chest size measures approximately 62 - 64 !!! This is larger than many 4XL shirts I have seen . And is no where close to the generic sizing chart that Amazon provides.For both shirts to be from the same manufactuer and line and to be completely different in size makes me leary to purchase clothes from this manufactuer again .
 I selected this one over the others here because it was n't labeled as small like some others . But it also is too small for an adult head . Wasted my money .

 I totally agree with the other reviewers . It is impossible to purchase a handbag without knowing the size of the bag !!
 I could n't agree more of the bad descriptions on Amazon products . I used to shop a lot at Amazon and it used to have very good descriptions . But just recently the descriptions are turning really bad . There are no dimensions , some products do n't even mention the material that are made of . I would have bought a lot more items if the descriptions have been better .
 I was considering to buy this handbag , but I did n't buy it because of the very vague description of it . The most important lacking information is the dimensions of the bag . Why would they state the weight and NOT the dimensions of this handbag ? It does n't make sense to me .
 I received this shirt in an order of 4 . As another reviewer said , it looks just like the picture . HOWEVER , when I washed the thing , poor quality issues showed . First off , there are many folded areas in the shirt that are not sewn or tacked , so they wrinkle , a lot . This includes the ` lapels ' . Secondly , the corners of the button placket are also folded and not tacked , and turn inside out , and are a pain to dig out . Thirdly , I have many tropical type shirts , and these are by far the `` messiest '' looking coming out of a hot dryer , and many of my shirts cost less than $ 15 . If you do the ironing , you will hate these shirts , and since I am single and do not iron ... ; - -RRB- Do they look good ? Yes . If you take your shirts to the cleaners , or have a significant other that does the ironing , you may love it . -LRB- though the cleaner would have to pay close attention when pressing this one -RRB- If you ARE the significant other , you will not love it.To be fair , since I have washed these a number of times since this review , they have relaxed and are more in line with what I expect . I still would like to see a bit more attention to detail in the tailoring though . So raise it to 3 stars .
 Like the description I thought this looks different like something Hunter s. Thompson would wear . I ordered to wear on vacation and it is paper thin and itchy even after washing . Awful experience lol . Looks better on here . save the time , and trouble .

 I know that 20 bucks isnt bad for a hoodie , but it feels so darn cheap.I 've gotten cheaper hoodies that feel thicker and warmer than this one .
 Not comfortable or a good fit . Worse fit after clothes dryer . Wish I had returned before washing .
 I bought this hooded sweatshirt thinking it was going to be of really good quality , it 's very thin and not a heavy-duty sweatshirt at all . I 'm very disappointed with the quality . If you 're looking for a light weight , thin sweatshirt then this is the sweatshirt for you . Blah .
 I am an average size guy , about 5 ' 10 '' 165 lbs . I ordered a size large of this sweatshirt . The length of it is too short -LRB- after washing it , it barely reaches the bottom of my belt in the back -RRB- . And the sleeves and width are too large . I think the sleeves are large enough to fit my thighs . And it is big enough around to fit two of my torso -LRB- but not two necks , since the neck hole is pretty small -RRB- . I have another hooded sweatshirt from a brand sold on Amazon . It is a size large , and the proportions are more reasonable.Also , the first time I washed this sweatshirt , the stitching around the pocket started unraveling . Pretty lame .
 I bought an extra large Russell Athletic Men 's Dri-Power Hooded Pullover Fleece Sweatshirt , Graphite and let me start off by saying I do n't have a fat neck . I put the jacket on and I felt as if I was being choked ... so if some one wants to buy this item I suggest getting a size bigger or just not buying it at all . I had to rip the neck part to where it . If I put the hood on it just looks funny now , sigh . how depressing .
 We needed 3 of this type of Sweatshirt and found one Big 5 but were unable to find the other 2 so we ordered them online from Amazon.com . The ones that we ordered were not as good of quality and thinner in weight , so was dissapointed in them . I do n't think that I will be ordering anything more through Amazon.com .
 Size is true , heavyweight material but pills after a couple washes badly . I have always bought Russell brand but never again . I purchased Hanes and am extremely satisfied with all their products .
 Not very durable . Looked good when it arrived but rapidly became sloppy looking . The texture and shape seemed to age after a few wearings .
 I ca n't recommend ordering ties on line -- or at least , from this vendor . Tie was not Navy -- it was ROYAL blue . Plus , the stitching started falling apart after 2 uses .

 From the description '' ... giving it enough space to store two to three textbooks , a large binder , two to three spiral notebooks ... `` Not sure what textbooks and notebooks these guys used to measure it , but my daughter had to pack 2 middle-school textbooks , 1 binder and 1 spiral notebook and they would not fit . We had to go and buy her a different backpack .
 I bought this backpack for my son for his freshman year of high school . He came to me two days later and told me he had too many things from his classes and they would n't all fit in this pack . Together we tried to make room for everything and were able to squeeze it all in . However , the backpack started coming apart at the seams a week later .
 This bag was going to be for me to use at college , and quite frankly it was WAY too small for that . It is more made for elementry to middle school kids . So luckily I have a little sister to give it to , but otherwise , I 'm pretty disappointed .
 So i bought this backpack because I needed to keep my books somewhere so I could carry things in my hands . I am 17 and a senior in High School . I ordered on the 21st or 22nd of December -LSB- I know I got the rest of my items before Christmas -RSB- and got the bag on the 6th of January . which was a drag.I got the bag at the material is pretty lousy , the straps are stiff and worst of all ... its really small . I am 5 ' 7 '' and this bag looks like a little kid 's backpack . I just got ta say that if you are older than 10 or 11 , find a new backpack or you will just look like a grown person who stole some little helpless kid 's backpack .
 I bought 3 of these to replace worn out back packs . I thought they would be great quality , but from the appearance they look no better than the ones they already had that fell apart after 3 months . I was really disappointed by how thin they are .
 I really like the color and it is aesthetically pleasing in my opinion . I 'm not sure if they sent me the wrong size or something but it is really small . It looks like a first graders back pack , not one for a college student .
 It is really low quality and the straps are uncomfortable.I bought it for my daughter If I had seen it before I would not buy it . I think it is not good for a child . Because comfort is more important for them than adults.I will not return it but will not use for school.I am very disappointed.It is like a joke !!!
 For the quality and size of this backpack , it is way overpriced . I can buy a large size gym bag for the price of this backpack .
 The material for the body of the bag is very thin and I 'm worried it wo n't last me through the school year . It 's not a comfortable fit with the weight of my texts no matter where the straps are adjusted . I admit it looks really cute and you ca n't beat the price , but if i were to see that bag in a store where i could touch it and feel the material , i would not have purchased it - even despite how inexpensive it was .
 Jansport has really gone downhill in the past 10 years . It used to be that the top 3 brands were Jansport , Eastpak , and High Sierra . Now Eastpak only deals with the european market . High Sierra has gone into uber industrial -LRB- non casual -RRB- backpacks that are a cross between urban and hiking . And Jansport still produces casual school/day treker backpacks but unfortunately the quality has gone down a lot . They do n't produce the leather/suede bottoms anymore . Now , the bottoms rip and wear out more easily and the entire fabric is a lot thinner and cheaper . I compared one I purchased last week at Staples to one that I had 10 years ago and the one purchased recently will probably wear out faster than the one 10 years back . That 's a little ridiculous . You can really feel how thing the fabric has become , it 's sad . I do n't think they 're even produced in the US anymore , probably China . They 've made no changes to it besides putting some padding in the back . But it 's really lost the appeal that it once had . I ca n't believe you could walk into a Walmart , Kmart or Target and find wall to wall of quality Jansports with leather bottoms and now the closest thing you can get is this piece of crap . Thanks Jansport , maybe in 10 more years you 'll reduce down to a burlap sack or a coffee bean bag . BTW , the jansport I just purchased has been returned .
 I purchased this product for my 1st grader . He liked the design ; I liked the Jansport brand -LRB- I have had several Jansport backpacks and always was very happy -RRB- . Well , the backpack was so thin I could read this review online through the material . The backpack was so lightweight that my son 's water bottle could put a hole through its side . The bottom had such little support that a wet paper grocery bag would provide superior results . In summary -- I returned the product the day after it arrived at my home . I actually contacted the seller and asked him/her if this was a knock-off , and he reassured me that it was a genuine product . Although I could n't believe him completely , the vendor was very nice and professional about returning the backpack .
 The color of the real thing is dark gray which is very ugly . And I have tried to return this item , but I failed because UPS did come to pick the package in three days . And I am leaving in two weeks so I am afraid I can not get the refund at that time so I gave up to return this item . This is an awful experience !
 This product is cheap and the stitching was all over the place . It was made overseas and it shows . I will never buy from this company again . It 's doubtful this thing will last 3 weeks as it 's so thin and flimsy . I would like to warn anyone who is considering buying one of the Jansport bags online . Go to a store and look at it first and buy it there . I would have never EVER bought this bag if I was able to check it out first . Either way , it made my 7 year old happy , and i 'm sure she will be upset that it has torn up within a month . Buyers BEWARE .
 I got excited when i came across this bag because of the colour and when i received it i was very disappionted the colour is nothing like the one in the picture and i am so not happy with this bag .
 the shoulder strap is already broken and it has only been 6 weeks . its a weak backpack , considering that i put it to gentle use
 I saw this bag well displayed with multi-divisions -LRB- sections -RRB- and got attracked to it because that was what I wanted but to my surprise , is far from what it was displayed . I am very much disappointed , it will not serve my purpose and I hate it that I do not even know what to do with it . it was totally wrong product display .
 The shipping time is ok , but the color is totally wronge . It is impossible to carry the kind of color to outside .
 It is REALLY FRUSTRATING ... I ASKED FOR WHITE/SILVER STARS , it seems to be a problem with the product , they sent me the WHITE/SILVER TWINKLE STARS one ... I purchased it in amazon ONLY because I needed SPECIFICALLY the WHITE/SILVER STARS in the RIGHT DAY ... This order was time sensitive , anyhow everybody can make mistakes , so I called to let them know that It was wrong and they told me that they will fix it , they will not make the same mistake they will resend the backpack ... . they ask me to send it back and they sent me `` THE RIGHT ONE '' but today -LRB- 24 days after -RRB- I got in the mail AGAIN THE WRONG BACKPACK ! ... Not to mention the other hydration pack that I bought in the same order that got lost in the mail ... I just want to place the complaint , I feel really frustrated and do n't want to hear again a customer service representative telling me that `` he assure me this will not happen again `` My recommendation
 the straps would loosen by itself when carring the bag on your back ... . i dont like it . Also the material is flimsy . but we all know that jansport lasts long ...
 I could n't believe it was a jansport . It is the sorriest excuse for a backpack I have seen in awhile . More like something from the K-mart bargain basement . Would definitely not suggest buying it .
 Very disappointed in this backpack . My daughter was happy with it , but myself as a mother knows that it will last no longer than a couple of months . There is absolutely no lining within the back . Fits all her books though she says ...
 This was supposed to be large enough for an adult . It 's really meant for a Jr. . High school student . A waste !
 I got my first JanSport backpack when I was in elementary school , and it lasted until my senior year of high school . A while later in college , I decided to buy a backpack , and naturally went for another JanSport.My first disappointment was that the backpack was n't a true navy color -- it 's dark blue , not navy . That I could live with , however . The drastic decrease in quality was the biggest disappointment . Within months , the backpack had small holes in it . I bought this size because I 'm an English major who rarely has textbooks to carry around , so I was n't even carrying anything heavy or sharp . After roughly a year of use , the backpack had several good-sized holes in it.The straps also began to come unattached from the top of the backpack ; the fabric started to fray terribly , and by the week , the straps came off more and more . I was perplexed , since I 'd carried much heavier things in my older backpack for much longer . Before I 'd even had the backpack two years , one of the straps had almost completely come off . I sewed it back on using heavy duty thread , but within a couple of weeks the stitches no longer held because the fabric had frayed even further . I did n't have much choice but to replace it.The last thing is , JanSport backpacks are no longer machine washable . I threw my first backpack in the washer dozens of times . With this one , I had to try to hand wash it if it got a stain on it . Backpacks get enough use that they should really be machine washable . And they should be much more durable than this one was .
 The backpack shown in the picture is not the same as the one delivered . My daughter was quite disappointed . The one delivered is a cute backpack , but not what I thought I was ordering . The one pictured has bright purple ; the one delivered has very dark purple that is n't noticible . The one pictured has purple straps at the top and on the bottom of the shoulder straps . The one delivered has all black ... So , the only things purple on the one we got are the zipper pulls . By the time we got it we were afraid if we sent it back , my daughter would not have a new one by the first day of school . So , we added our own purple to it . I 'll think twice about ordering from here again .
 My kids have used JanSport backpacks in the past and we have n't had a problem with them . However , I ordered this one in the beginning of September . My daughter has used it for about 2 weeks and it has already ripped . I am very disappointed in JanSport .
 I bought this backpack for my 12-year old Goddaughter who was visiting from Brazil . She wanted this particular brand because it happens to be in fashion down there . However , I fail to understand why it costs so much considering the poor quality of the material and the overall product . I can buy a much much better backpack , padded , strongly made and with lots of compartments making it much more useful , for a lot less money . I think the product is way overrated and unless your kid wants it for the `` fashion '' aspect of it , I 'd look for something else of better quality .
 I bought this backpack for college and after 9 months it tore in three places . Terrible quality . I paid 5 Bucks to mail it in for repair under warranty and after two months with no responce I called and found out that they wo n't fix anything because the damage happened , `` as a result of normal use , '' ... well is n't that exactly why companies have a warranty ? So that if the product you buy from them shows manufacturing defects that become evident through normal use the product is replaced ? This company is a joke and only profits on the fact that they have huge name recognition , but this product was of very low quality and the warranty is a fraud .
 I purchased this , thinking that it was hot pink , but to my surprise the backpack was a unexpected salmon color &#34; pink . &#34; Do n't be fooled by the description -LRB- Pink Prep -RRB- .
 This is n't really worth the price . Based on strength and utility alone , I 've seen cheaper backpacks at Wal-Mart , etc. that far outshine this little thing . This is really quite small , do n't let the big numbers fool you.I guess I could suggest this for elementary schoolers , but as a college student this really does n't work for me . I remember carrying even more books in high school , so yeah , that 's out too . When you get this , you 're really just paying for the name brand . They pocket the difference by sacrificing quality .1 . Smaller than it looks .2 . Very thin fabric .3 . The joke they call ` padding ' does n't keep the sharp edges of any book from sticking into your back .4 . The straps feel very weak , and I do n't feel comfortable carrying all my books in it .5 . The backpack has a tendency to ` slide ' down ; the buckle does n't hold the straps well , so the nylon slides past it and causes the straps to loosen against your will .
 I received my bag and it looks exactly like i wanted it . Problem is it 's cut like someone has used a knife or razor to cut it a whole 5cm cut on the top of the bag . This is not what i really imagined to get .
 Purchased it for junier high school student . it 's not big enough and also you can not image how large it actually will be . Overall , it 's low cost and low quality bag and you can buy it at local sports authority cheaper and easy to return or change it if you do n't like it after receiving . Will not buy those bag anyway .
 I spent about 4 months ordering , trying on and returning nursing bras trying to find one roomy and supportive enough -LRB- every size chart is different , but I 'm in the 40J neighborhood -RRB- . I was optimistic about this one when I tried it on because the fabric is comfortable enough to sleep in and there was enough give in the cotton to allow for size fluctuations . But now that the baby 's here and I 'm actually nursing , I 'm frustrated enough with this bra to toss it after less than 2 weeks.Cons : - The band is not supportive and does n't stay put . I 'm constantly tugging at the back from where it rode up . It simply does n't have what it takes to keep heavy breasts in place . - The side stays dig into my side , which gets worse as the band rides up . They end up constantly poking my armpits . This is why I 'm not even keeping it to sleep in . - The cups are not supportive enough for heavy breasts . The fabric just stretches and bunches in odd places . - The hook and eye loops are the skimpiest nursing bra flap closure I 've ever seen . I keep expecting it to simply pull out of the fabric . The multi hook option for size changes is a nice idea in theory , but it does n't seem to make a lot of sense to do such a small hook in bras supposedly designed for large busted women.Pros : - The fabric is soft , which is a bonus for those early days of soreness . Right now the only bra I 've got that 's supportive enough is a sturdy - but rough - fabric.I think this bra would be fine for smaller busted women , but if you 've got some girls that need real support then you probably wo n't be happy with it .
 I did n't care for this one . The size runs small . It was a bit uncomfortable , so I ended up not using it and giving it away to a much smaller person .
 The cup size runs too small , i had cheaper nursing bras doing a way better job than this one
 This bra did not measure correctly . The band was very loose . It was not supportive . The hook and eye closures for the nursing cups are difficult to use .
 I ordered these hoping that I 'd have some great new silk pajamas to replace mine that had worn out . Let me tell you , if you 're a small person like I am these are not at all for you . You will be completely drowning in them . I looked like I was 5 years old and playing dress up in my mother 's clothing ; the small is not at all small ... I was highly disappointed .
 What a ripoff.They look very nice but maybe you should n't wear them?I bought them for my girlfriend.She wore them a few times over a few months . When I asked her why shestopped wearing them , she said `` I 'm afraid to wear them because the seams are comingapart '' . She never washed them . They do n't fit her tight.When I spoke to Amazon several months after I bought them , they said `` speak to Intimo '' . We called Intimo several times and left messages . When I sent them an email , theyquickly responded `` we spoke to you already -LRB- ? -RRB- , speak to Amazon '' . Amazon seems to willing to dovery little . If I bought this at a department store , I would n't have a problem -LRB- even after 4 months -RRB- . Caveat emporer.Unfortunately the 90 day return policy on american express purchase protection already expired . -LSB- update -- Amazon is accepting a return after much haggling.I looked at them last night and its not the seems butthe actual material is coming apart -- like a worn elbow of a flannel shirt -RSB- . marty
 These pajamas fit poorly and the quality is poor for the price . I have owned several pairs of silk pajamas and they all washed well and were not wrinkly . These look horrible after one washing . I would not recommend these pajamas .
 I have previously bought a lot of these shirts . Over time , a peculiar problem surfaced . Shrinkage -LRB- natural in a cotton shirt -RRB- affected one side of the front of the shirt , in the up and down direction , more than the other . As a result , the button holes in the placket increasingly became farther apart than the buttons , causing the shirt to have extensive wrinkling on the button side . I am not a tailor , but what I suspect happened is that the Banks buyers failed to specify how the warp and woof of the fabric were to be matched -- an expensive mistake.A second problems arises from product sizing . When I moved from a 16.5-34 to a 17-34 , the shirt suddenly became a tent.I have not had these problems with other manufacturers , notably Eagle , Land 's End and Enro .
 Bad fit for an ordinary guy . I ca n't imagine who they design such shirts for!I had luck with one of their Traveler shirts - really nice , and attempted to get another twice - no more !
 apron was NOT full length , poorly packed , and one mass of wrinkles . I will keep it but do not recommend . And very poorly made . I have not yet washed this product yet but would not be at all surprised if it fell apart .
 Looks and feels inferior to my other Kipling products . The zipper is problematic in that it does not open and close with ease .
 After two attempts to purchase the back pack picture on the Amazon website , I was unable to get the back pack pictured . Originally , a Belgian company , I had started purchasing Kipling products while livingKipling Ridge Backpackin Belgium . They were great looking and sturdy items . The packs now being sent or available are the Kipling back packs with the Kipling patch the same colour as the pack material . In the past the Kipling products have had a contasting patch in black with the grey lettering . They were very stylish packs/products . No longer does it seem possible to get these packs/products with this styling.As a result , I will no longer purchase Kipling products unless we can find the products with the traditional patch that has been the classic Kipling look . The new look is not a good one . Very disappointing .
 I have previously bought a lot of these shirts . Over time , a peculiar problem surfaced . Shrinkage -LRB- natural in a cotton shirt -RRB- affected one side of the front of the shirt , in the up and down direction , more than the other .

I am not a tailor , but what I suspect happened is that the Banks buyers failed to specify how the warp and woof of the fabric were to be matched -- an expensive mistake.A second problems arises from product sizing .

 This is a vintage image . . Not a vintage T-shirt . It is of poor quality . The only reason why I did n't give it 1 star is because I love Superman and anything with Superman on it is worth something . . But this is n't worth much.The shirt has a horrible fit and finish . It is NOT a slim fit like advertised . The neck stretches out and does n't retain its shape . The sleeves are loose and baggy , more so than it should be . I have found higher quality T-shirts at Walmart and Target , for less money and no shipping charges . The graphic was n't even printed on straight . It was off-center and crooked . The only reason why I didnt return it was because of the hassle . That and the fact that I have a hard time parting with anything with a Superman logo . Yes , I know it is a bit obsessive . Do n't judge me.Honestly this was the worst clothing purchase I have ever made thru Amazon.com . I ca n't remember the name of the vendor , or if Amazon sold it themselves , but I ended up using the shirt as a rag to clean up oil in the garage .

 The description says 100 % cotton , but the tag on each of the two pairs of shorts I received -LRB- different colors -RRB- says 50 % polyester/50 % cotton , and this is what they appear to be . Since Amazon.com can not get the description right for a pair of shorts , I guess I can not trust any of their descriptions . For an online retailer , this is serious , given the hassle involved in returning an item .
 shorts were ruined on the second day i wore them . the waist string broke . instead of being made by one continuous string , it was composed of 2 strings which were stiched into the waist band at the back of shorts and tightened in the front . as a result , when tightened , it came loose and was rendered useless . i believe i had the same problem with a pair of their sweatpants in the past . i will stay clear of their products in the future.let 's face it - you get what you pay for . russell athletic has lost a customer . low quality
 shorts looked and fit good but began unravelling along the waistband immediately.have had Russell apparel previously and had no problem
 When ordering I would suggest you consider a size smaller than what you generally wear . Not having a product specific size chart available here does not help . My poor rating is more influenced by the fact that the cloth used is quite thin and does not look like it will hold up to regular wear beyond a few months . Will post an update on the shorts longevity in around six months .
 I liked them at first , but I use bleach often around the house , and the color does n't hold up . Now they are a mess .
 Bought these shorts for a basic pair to wear and workout at a sports club . The price was good , but the quality of the shorts is lacking . Very light cotton material - not much to them , and the elastic waist string does n't have any strength or elasticity ... would n't buy them again ... . sorry : -LRB-
 For around $ 10 , I was not expecting a great pair of shorts , but I would not wear these in public.They are cheap looking , uncomfortable , and not very durable.If you are looking for inexpensive shorts , I STRONGLY recommend the Champion brand which is of much higher quality and comfort for the same price .
 The shorts were HUGE and baggy , dropping below the knees . Not suitable for working out at the gym . They were returned for credit .
 I ordered these shorts to replace my husband 's old pair of Russell shorts . Although I ordered the same size , the new ones were far larger , and the fabric was much thinner and lower quality than the older shorts . I sent them back .
 ... but , that 's just me.I think that these gym shorts are less than I have come to expect from Russell Athletic . Maybe Russell has a cheaper line of clothing to fill a low price niche.These shorts do n't look very stylish . They are a boxy looking cut with no real shape to them.Material is just OK and not very soft feeling . Hems are OK , I guess , but do n't look like anything special ; I wo n't be surprised if the hems begin to unravel . The Russell logo is an iron-on as opposed to the stich-on that they have used on other lines.Be aware that they are an 8 '' inseam so , depending on your height , they might not reach the knee.They look a size larger then tagged.I got these on an Amazon special price of $ 4.03 . I would n't pay more for them after seeing them.For me they 're OK for hanging around the house or for warm weather sleepwear . I wo n't wear them in public because of the boxy , short , oversized look of them .
 These were advertised as 100 % cotton . Some of them i received were and others were partly cotton and partly synthetic material . I love the all-cotton ones , but the hybrids I do n't . Too bad you ca n't get what you order . Buy at your own risk .
 I 've bought these shorts for years and used them as pajamas and for lounging around the house.I will be giving the three pair I just bought to charity.The fabric feels much lighter/scratchier/cheaper than my current pair . They are also about three inches longer . Embroidered logo is now an iron-on .
 I bought this shorts in an x-large for my husband . They were huge all over , including length . They looked like a tent.Do not recommend . It was shocking because some rating that I read prior to purchase said they ran small . That is absolutley not true . They had to be returned .
 The sizing of these shorts is a joke . Read all the reviews very carefully before buying - something has changed within the last couple years .
 Sometimes the XXL were a little confining while exercising , so I tried these in XXL . They were HUGE !!! I washed them in hot water a few times and they are still way too big . I then ordered XXL which were the original size I wore and they too are way too big . I have n't lost enough weight to account for the size change . It seems Russell has once again started to screw with their sizing . It may get to the point that I quit buying their products , online anyway .
 Let me start by saying that in my past experience I loved the shorts that I purchased in the past . I previously ordered a pair in light grey , and the dark blue ... they were well made , comfortable , and a real value . I was shocked to discover that by changing the color the quality would drop so drastically.They are very thin and poorly sewn . I discovered a large hole in the seam the first time I put my hand in my pocket . The Russell logo on the leg is a cheap iron on an d not the embroidered logo that is on the 2 previous pairs I ordered . Had I known they would differ from color to color I would have stuck to the colors I had before . These shorts are good for sleep shorts maybe but they are too thin and poorly sewn to wear out of the house . I am really disappointed .
 Nice fit and good price but they unravel fast!Thread comes right out of them.It is a dirty shame !
 Purchased two pair of these so-called athletic shorts . One pair after one day wear split at pocket seam . Amazon refunded total purchase price . # 2 short has been loose strings from waist and pockets . it has not split , but if this continues the short shall be a pile of string . I do not think I will buy anymore clothing @ Amazon .
 I liked these shorts when I originally got them but after one washing the stitching on one of the bottom hems began unraveling and came entirely out . Now I 'm just waiting for the material to fray . This is not the quality that I have known Russell for in the past and these are not cheap shorts . I guess that 's what happens when you move manufacturing overseas -LRB- these were made in El Salvador -RRB- . Russell used to have manufacturing in Alabama with fantastic quality . I certainly wo n't go out of my way to purchase Russell in the future .
 I have been looking for some cotton shorts that look good on me and these are not them . The crotch area is way too long . Most important , these are not 100 % cotton . I was under the impression that they were all cotton , being that they are supposed to be premium .
 I was very unhappy with this product . These are not the same quality cotton performance shorts that I bought a couple of years ago . The material was way too thin and the size was probably two sizes larger than indicated on the tag . I used to really like Russell products , what has happened to them ?
 Russell is using yet another off shore manufacture and the quality is not the same . The shorts are sized different then the past that I have worn for years . The waist to crouch is 3 inches longer and the crouch to leg is yet another 3 inches . The Russell R on the side is not stitched any longer but an iron on .
 I read the reviews about sizing and the shorts being too big but I did n't think that would bother me since I like larger shorts for working out . It is n't that these shorts are too big , the design is horrible.These shorts have an 18 '' rise and an 8 '' inseam that still takes the hem to just above the knee . Take a minute to imagine an 18 '' rise ... you can pull these shorts up to your arm pits !
 I recently ordered graphite color which supposed to be 100 % cotton -LRB- only oxford color that mentioned as 42 % cotton -RRB- . But this one came as 50 % cotton and 50 % polyester . Had I have not tear up the packaging , I would return it instantly .
 these are just way too flimsy ... the thread comes loose after a wash ... the seams are not strong at all . not happy .
 These pantyhose are terrible . They are ruff to the touch . They have no stretch to them . The band rolls and not because they were the wrong size . Because there 's no stretch to them after awhile they were like old school stockings , bunching around the ankles . Yuk ! I did n't purchase them through amazon . I found them at JCP . I bought 2 pairs and will be returning the second .

 Tie was late and we missed the opportunity to dress in our 60 's attire like the other dancers . The tie will probably never be worn .

 I 've had this robe for about a month now . The color is nice and it was reasonably soft out of the box . However , it 's been washed twice now , and is covered in pulled threads , and feels like a cheap , thin towel . No softness at all , even when rinsed with a good fabric softener . Also , it 's not very big - almost too small for me , and would never fit my husband . Compared to the robe it replaced , which lasted 15 years and was still soft , albeit coming apart , this one is way overpriced . I doubt it will last a year before being replaced . Skip this one , folks .
 Only a couple of washings and the threads just keep unraveling ; snags easily . Only lasted less than a year . Now I am looking for a qualitly robe that will last , LL Bean !
 Nice looking , cozy robe , but started to fall apart within a week . Left a voice message for the company , no response . Was out of town , but now back and will re-attempt contact.Doug Miller480-262-0746
 I have never had any problem with Amazon . I swear buy them . I have been cautious with their third party sellers . However , still no complaints . This seller waits until 5 days from Christmas to tell me my robe is in customs and wont be available . In stock should mean in stock ! E-mail response '' I wanted to give you an update on this so that you will have the time to complete your Christmas purchases '' . Thank you , IT DID . I HAD TO PAY $ 40 -LRB- in shipping -RRB- TO HAVE ANOTHER ROBE SENT OVERNIGHT ! THANKS FOR NOTHING BUT A HEADACE!AND - $ 40 BE WARRY !

 This was the worst pair of jeans I have ever bought in my life . The specs implied that it would fit on one 's waist , however with the crotch being so short it barely reached my hips . I normally wear waist size 31 , which I ordered , but with this pair of jeans , the zipper almost could not go up . In addition , I am not a person with large legs , but this pair of jeans hugged me like it was made for a woman who wants to show off her assets . I would have returned my purchase , but where I am living it would cost double what the jeans are worth , so I will just have to accept my losses .
 this pair of jeans did not fit as expected . THEY LOOK REALLY BAD ON ME . I would like to send them back .
 I ordered stone washed jeans because I like the look and feel , I was sent regular blue jeans . Because I needed pants now not later I kept them but I 'm not happy ! As usual the jeans are good they are Levi 's after all but NOT what I paid for . ARE YOU EITHER COLOR BLIND OR ILLITTERATE AT AMAZON NOW . M.S.
 I had ordered Levis jeans before , and the sizes fits always perfect , in this case this jeans were suppose to be a 34 waist 30 long ... but it looks like a 32 or 34 long .
 I bought these jeans for my husband at Christmas . I knew that they would be stiff when I got them , and they were new so that is OK . But the first few times these have been washed , inside out or right-side out , they have faded and have horrible crease marks in the jeans , like the starch that was in them when they were new was just too much . I am disappointed in these jeans . After 6 washings they have weird lines on them and I can not get them to go away . My advice , do n't get the RIGID rinse . .
 ordered 32 inch length . first pair was 4 &#34; too long . recieved a replacement pair and they were 2 &#34; too long . poor quality control on this product
 This is terrible ! I am upset and disappointed!I ordered a pair of 517 jeans using a size . The jeans mailed to me showed the size on the Levi 's patch , however they were several inches too long and the waist was much wider than normal . This was definitely not the size stated on the label.Very frustrating , especially after we were eagerly anticipating their arrival I hesitate to mail-order jeans again after this experience .
 I am not fat by any means . I am in fact built . Both pairs ripped in the seat after 3 months . Beware when buying them . Levis boot cut jeans .
 The pants are not true to size.Nor was it medium it was light color . They are too long . Not 36x29 . More like 36x30May I return for exchange ? The darker colorIndigo are true to size not stonewash.We are not satisfied with merchandise.Please send Return Label for exchange.Thank you.alfredawhtd@gmail.com
 In the same order I purchased these and another pair of Levi 's jeans , in a dfferent cut . Both pairs were ordered in the same size . The other pair fit fine , just like every other pair of jeans that I 've ordered in this size . These jeans , however , were about three sizes too small . I double checked every tag just to make sure they were n't improperly labeled , but according to every tag and sticker on the jeans , they were the size I had ordered . Ever since my favorite cut of Levi 's -LRB- 569 -RRB- have been changed , it 's been hard to find a good pair of jeans . Thankfully Amazon offers free returns , back to the warehouse these go !
 Will not shop with this vendor again . I ordered 2 pair of jeans . After washing them to shrink , they were still 3 inches too long . CLOTHING TAGS DID NOT MATCH the actual size . I 'm a guy , I build houses but ca n't sew , so now I have to pay a seamstress . Vendor sucks , but Amazon was good about the whole thing.Dano .
 they were too long and did n't fit the waist as advertized . the price was okay and the delivery was fine . overall , i was disappointed and would not repeat my order .
 I 'm 5 ' 11 &#34; 185 lbs , muscular build . It took effort to stuff my thighs and bits into these , leaving me uncomfortable throughout the day . Luckily I was able to find a friend these worked for .
 When the Chinese bought-out Levi Strauss & Co. they surrendered the quality of the Levi brand to history . Levi is not now or will they ever return to being the best pants money can buy . Shame , Shame , Shame on Levi Strauss & Co. . Levis are not even of high enough quality to be considered `` suckfull '' . Levis are now just another company making highly generic clothes from China , Honduras , Bangladesh , or wherever ...
 The length is way off . I have 30L with shorter legs . Other than that they would be OK I guess . But I would n't have bought them if I knew the length was a lie .
 Great product . Communication was lacking . Amazon website indicated 2 pair were available at time of purchase . When they were not received in a timely fashion -LRB- ordered for a birthday present -RRB- , I initiated communication with G&L Clothing . They stated the merchandise was out of stock & had to be ordered . I will buy this product again , but not from this company . They should have been proactive in notifying me of the backorder issue instead of remaining silent .
 I feel disappointed with this product levi 's , in many occasions I have bought this brand of jeans in my country and for amazon and I never had problems with the heights , they all have come perfect , but this product not come correctly , my height is 34x 32 though these trousers have this marked height , is not correctly . this one is too small and I have others identical of the same height and model and I still have them excellent , I feel disappointed by this purchase . I have ten jeans of the same brand of diverse models 34x32 and I still have them correct , this one not . The height marked in this jeans is not real .
 Tags on clothing say 29 &#34; length . They are 30 1/2 &#34; so I have to hem them . According to Levi 's website they do not have a 29 &#34; length so ?
 I am a long time fan of Levi 's but this company is all over the place . I can not understand how there numerical style system works because it is almost meaningless . I got these and the waist was too big , thighs too small and boot cut seems to be almost more of a bell bottom look rather than having room for boots . I then got a size smaller locally of the 514 straight fit and they were almost the exact same overall , including the boot area . So if your waist measures 34 with a measuring tape , this 34 is too large and 33 in the 514 is also too large . However , the thighs are tight in both so I figure a 32 -LRB- which possibly might actually measure 34 -RRB- is probably going to looking like skinny jeans . because the thighs will be too small . So good luck with all that .
 I have worn the 517 for over twenty five years and Levi 's exclusively over 50 years . Two years ago , the cut changed and all 517 's were relaxed fit . Send back and change size because they were too big . SO I ordered the same thing but now 517 's are `` slim cut '' . Does n't work on me , I need some extra room . Now the number is 557 for the relaxed fit and I get to pay the postage to return the wrong cut jeans . Shame on Levi 's
 Quality is no longer the same and the fit varies from wich country it is made and the mood of that worker that day !!! One day hopefully we 'll start making are own merchandise like the old days , with quality and pride !!!
 DO NOT buy new 517s if you are looking for the slim , fitted , look of the classic Levi 's 517 . That 's been left in the dust . Apparently Levi 's thinks only fat people wear jeans now.These jeans have so much extra fabric it 's almost comical . I bought a pair online , set the jeans out on the floor , and even with a 29 waist , there is so much extra fabric they look like women 's jeans ! It 's like they have room for hips or something.Gimme a break , someone who buys 517 's is not going for the baggy gangster look , they 're 517s !!! Thoroughly disappointed with the direction Levi 's have taken the fit of their jeans , I will never buy a pair again.Don ' t be fooled by the other reviews that say these have a classic fit . They have a baggy , frumpy , ` modern ' couch potato fit .
 I ordered a pair of 517 jeans using a size I had used for years . The jeans mailed to me showed the size on the Levi 's patch , however they were several inches too long and the waist was much wider than normal . This was definitely not the size stated on the label.Very frustrating , especially after we were eagerly anticipating their arrival 2 weeks after the order was placed . I hesitate to mail-order jeans again after this experience .
 ever since levi changed from being american made to being overseas made . . mostly in china THEY HAVE NO WORTH , the fabric is not half as tough as it used to be , the cut has changed and by doing so made it ten times worse then it was a few years ago , levi used to be my number one favorite brand to buy jean wise . . now it makes me just sad to look at them . they are poor excuses for jeans , the belt loops break off in a matter of weeks the zippers are weaker , and the sizing is complete bogus . everything is pretty much unprofessional and all they seem to care about now is mass production to make more money , instead of making a decent product to sell to customers , im sorry to say this levi but it has to be said , your products have been horrible over the last few years . your relaxed bootcut jeans of the early 2000 's were the BEST now you cant find them anywhere . so unless you go back to that exact fashion OR you make something just as good if not better then your old products you have lost a very loyal customer of 20 years . STOP just caring about making money and not caring about how well you make yoru products . carhartt has become my go to because atleast they care about if something holds together for more then a month .
 Ive been wearing Levi 's over 40 years . These are not the same old Levi 's ! The fit is baggy , the sizing is not consistant , I bought 2 pair and they fit and wear are totally different . Probably wo n't buy any levi products again
 The length is soo long that it bunches at the bottom and drags on the ground .
 Received jeans . Color was correct but it was clearly marked `` slim '' and my son needed a regular.It was clearly marked on all packaging that it was slim but never said so on the website and he wore them anyway to an event so I could n't return . Waste of $ 40
 I am a size 30x32 and buy alot of jeans . I also carry a concealed weapin in my waistband and for the most part , never have a problem with any other jeans . These jeans , however were so tight that i could barely button them even without my weaponi on me .
 Purchased Two Pair Of Jeans Only Got One . Was Told They Only Had One Pair And Never Heard Another Word But Got Charged For Two Pair .
 too baggy . The wwrong side was received . I need 40 X 34 and received 42 X 34 . I washed them -LRB- I wash all new clothes before wearing -RRB- and then found them to be too large . I Looked at the size tag and saw it saying 42 X 34 . I re-ordered the correct size which fits right . I guess I am stuck with the fat pants .
 I ordered 4 jeans , 34 size each , the Boot Cut is 1 size smaller than the 505 Straight Fit I also purchased in same order .
 I ordered 2 pair in the rinsed color , they have a very strong chemical odor that only got stronger after washing them . I am returning them .
 This T-shirt looks so cool with digital camo . However , attention when you decide to pay for it , especially , the carriage . It costs pretty much than T-shirt itself .
 I hate the Harbor Bay line of clothes so much , I should never buy them , but I still do ... oh woe is me.To make this long story short : These are standard khaki pants , but when you put them on it feels like they put more material up front near the belly and less in the back so it feels like you need to pull up your pants all the time since they didnt give enough room in the seat or enough fabric up top to feel comfortable . All of the fabric they could have used to cover the small of the back was instead put into clown sized calves that look like balloons and make the pant legs unwearable without further alteration . So purchase these pants , enjoy your trip to the tailor and forever hate them for the rest of their life as your work pants . I swear these are the kind of pants that make you hate your job .
 I was really disappointed when I got the gloves . The gloves are meant for kids but the length for the fingers seems to be for adults . Poor fit .
 The gloves are made from cheap thin foam material . My 4 year old played with them a few times . He has the Captain America shield too , which he loves .
 These are sold as Captain America Gloves , but really they are just shinny red child gloves that are probably meant for any costume - as the package was a clear plastic bag with no mention of any superheros . It could just as easily be for a girl - and probably more so since they are a big shinny/shimmery . Also , if you are planning on buying for the Captain America costume - it is a totally different red ... they are actually plain red child gloves that could be for ANY outfit .
 These pantyhose are terrible . They are ruff to the touch . They have no stretch to them . The band rolls and not because they were the wrong size . Because there 's no stretch to them after awhile they were like old school stockings , bunching around the ankles . Yuk ! I did n't purchase them through amazon . I found them at JCP . I bought 2 pairs and will be returning the second .

 Fashion Express purses are cheaply made and overpriced . The company will not stand behind the quality - or lack thereof - of its product .

 I have returned these for a new pair too many times . Belt loops pulling off , wear holes in the legs , everything happened within a couple weeks of receipt . My last pair is being returned , and I will NOT be getting a replacement
 I have been wearing Silvertab jeans almost exclusively for I believe 15 + years because they fit my legs the best . I was disappointed when I discovered that Levi was no longer making them . I 've tried several lower/mid priced jeans and all of them were too tight for my liking around my hamstrings and quads , including the Levi 569 Loose line . I was surprised to find that the Lee Dungarees Loose Fit Carpenter Jeans have come the closest to fitting how I like them . They are n't a perfect replacement but they are certainly the most comfortable jeans I have come across that are within the price range I feel comfortable paying for some jeans . The only question I have is how durable they will be but time will tell.Update : Roughly 3 months later and I can already say that the durability of these are pretty horrible . Multiple holes have worn into the jeans and bumping into a wooden table at work has left me with a pretty embarrassing hole to try to conceal through the end of the day .
 I love the way that these jeans fit , one of the more comfortable pairs of jeans . So why might you ask am I giving these jeans such a low rating . . The last 5 pairs of these jeans that I have bought have ripped within 5 times of wearing them and two of the pairs ripped down the back within 2 months of purchasing them . I take good care of my clothes and have not had any issues with other brands but recently they have started using cheaper thinner fabric on these jeans . . I unfortunately am going to have to switch to a different brand due to the lack of quality . If the price was less then I might expect it but these are marketed as the more premium line yet the use the cheaper fabric.Save yourself the money on these , If the fabric is thin and feels cheap that probably means that it is !

 I had high hopes for this product after all the hype from Oprah and reviews . Well , could just be my body , but it did not work for me at all ! I am 5 ' 6 '' and 140 and wear a 6-8 and all I wanted was something to help hold in the tummy and smooth the bulges . It does do that , but with-in one minute , the top is rolling down giving me the ugliest `` muffin-top '' I have ever had ! I ordered this with the Spanx Camisole and tried tucking the camisole in ... NOPE ! The camisole rolled up and the bottoms rolled down . My husband had a really good laugh and said something about it looking like sausage casing . Not exactly the look I was going for . Both the bottoms and top will be returned . Try Sassybax ... much better !
 Despite having `` no waistband '' these hose are not comfortable at the waste . Instead , the fabric just rolls down so that you have , in effect , a lumpy waist band . Also they do NOT stay up .
 I ordered a half-dozen different pairs of Hue tights and love them all except these pantyhose . The top of the panty -- where the waistband would have been -- rolls down creating a thick , tight band of fabric . I phoned Hue and they graciously offered to refund the cost of the pantyhose . Great company , but this particular style did n't work for me .
 found shirt to be lacking in quality more like a 20 dollar throw awayreturned shirt and discovered negative return policy to be in placefound same pattern & better quality shirt for less elseewhere
 straps broke on the third day of school , but have n't been able to get it back from my 7 year old . I feel I was ` ripped off ' , much as the straps behaved .
 I am 5 '11 and 154 pound . Even I select M size , but it 's still too big for me . Seems it built for a guy has 6 ' 3 and 200 pound .
 collar is too big , the length is too long and fit is very loose , not what I was expecting . from the photo it looks different .
 I always bought the Columbia items and will continue , but this item is the worst I ever have seen . I saw the picture and never hesitated to get the item . Well , today I got it and when I opened my jaws dropped . This is thinner than a handkerchief I believe . Never rely on the picture you see . It was my fault that I never consaulted with some customers and when I sent mails to Columbia , they never replied . This is a no-good vest !!!!!
 I bought this item from Amazon at a good price , but when it arrived it was short and blousy ... too wide , yet too short . It 's a shame because the materials are typical Columbia excellence .
 I 've worn Columbia fleece for years , and their vests are a particular favorite because they are so versatile . I 've loved the quality and the details in the design . However , this Cathedral vest falls woefully short in both those categories . First of all , there is NO DRAWSTRING at the bottom , and that is an essential for the fit and warmth of a vest ... the bottom just hangs open and the drape of the garment just does n't work without that simple elastic drawstring . Further , the workmanship is n't any better than the no-name brands available for half the price , and the material is thin and insufficient . Not up to Columbia 's very high -LRB- and usual -RRB- standard . Wish I could get my money back . Try again , Amazon .
 We 've purchased a number of these vest over the past few years and we actually had to return this one because the quality of the material was so poor . It was very thin and flimsy . The collar would n't stand up as it should because the material was so thin . Very dissapointed .
 I have a columbia vest from a few years ago , and this one is a FRAUD ... paper thin , DO NOT get suckered into buying these cheap imitations !!!!!
 I got this vest from my wife as a gift , so I should n't be looking a gift horse in the mouth . Maybe that 's OK , as my comments are not directed at her , but to possible future buyers.I 've had other vests , so I 've had time to develop a very strong opinion about features that I like and do n't . This vest does n't meet up with some of the basics that I am used to enjoying with my years old Gap vest.First of all , the fleece is quite thin and porous and thus not warm in a breeze , so I do n't wear it outside much . The large arm holes do n't help there either.The zipper is only one way , i.e. , it does n't open up from the bottom . To me that is a major inconvenience as I ca n't adjust the bottom when I am sitting or driving . With the slightly longer cut , the vest ends up bunching up around my waist . I also have to undo the zipper completely or yank the bottom of the vest halfway up my waist if I have to pull down the zipper in my pants to go to the bathroom.My major problem , however , is with the cut . The middle has a lot of fabric and wo n't lay flat over my chest and stomach . It finally occurred to me that it is actually perfect for someone with a medium pot belly , but that 's not me.My final complaint is with the pocket zipper , they go down to close . If you do n't zip it fully , small things like change or keys , will fall out.Overall , the design feels like there was a lack of thought throughout . Maybe they turned a junior designer loose on this item.Since I won ; t be returning the vest , it 'll get demoted to workshop duty .
 This is the sleeveless version of the Steen 's Mountain jacket . Runs a size big -LRB- 5 ' 7 '' 160 lbs , small was loose -RRB- . No drawcord in hem is less than stellar . Useless against wind . I 'm having to edit my review because the stitching is coming loose around the bottom of the zipper . It 's not only fraying , it 's also interfering with the zipper operation . I hope Amazon will take it back .
 got a medium and it 's more like an xl and the material is a little flimsy
 bought this vest to supplement a Patagonia fleece vest i have . To my surprise the vest is not very warm , does not feel like i have a fleece vest on ! Otherwise the fleece has a nice material and nice look to it but it is not doing what it is supposed to -LRB- keep me warm -RRB- & also as others have mentioned in the posts here it runs a size larger -LRB- i bought an L but should have gotten an M - for all my other stuff i have Ls -RRB- Hope this helps .
 The vest did not meet my expectations . The quality of the fleece was not what I expected . I expected a thicker fleece . It is very hard buying some things online without details of the construction of the item . Thanks Scott
 These items are selling for different prices -- It seems like whatever popular colors are they jack up the price -- what a cheat !
 There was no drawstring to cinch the waistline as was stated in the description . Very unhappy with this purchase ! Boo !

 These are the cheesiest sunglasses I 've ever seen . I 've bought pairs for $ 2.00 at flea markets that were much better . The lenses look like someone used recycled plastic . They are not clear , but cloudy instead.Shame on this company . These glasses can not be worn . The picture looks nothing like the actual glasses.Garbage !!!!!
 This is the worst product I have ever seen in my life . The size of the glasses do n't even fit my dog 's head , consider my own head . This is a waste of plastic to even be used , it could n't even be donated to poor kids in Africa . Do not waste your money on this and spend your 3 bucks somewhere else .
 Made out of REALLY cheap plastic , one pair was broken when I received them . Not only that , but they were too small for my face ! Do n't buy these sunglasses ! They 're TERRIBLE .
 I got these because they were fashionable . That was two years ago . I only had these for about 3 months . I never wore them daily . I would wear them while biking , and I took them to camp with me . Then after I picked them up , the screw holding the arms to the lenses was coming out . I ignored it , and soon enough , there went the arm , and the glasses fell off my face and cracked the other arm . So I taped the arm back on , and taped the other arm on the crack to prevent it from falling apart . But , It did . *** Bottom line
 very very cheap looking they look like they were used by someone and tht someone tried to fix it but did not do a good job do not buy trust me i read all the review and decided to tk a chance with it but i wish i did not they are just good to throw away or give it to a 4 year old
 For $ 2.90 , I expected these to be cheap sunglasses . But when I received them , I noticed that they were nothing more than novelty sunglasses from Oriental Trading . Do n't waist your time or money on these sunglasses from here . If you really want them , go directly to Orientaltrading.com and you can get a dozen pairs for $ 10 .
 These are inexpensive sunglasses . I get it . They are cheap . I understand that they 're not Ray Bans for $ 200 . I get that . But dont ship them to me if they are scratched w / white paint on black frames . Or have the filler holding the lens in place to be coming apart . Shoddy craftmanship . Poorly made . I expect them last -LRB- even with care -RRB- for something like 2 months , and the over-under on that isnt looking good for me.Whatever . I guess I get to look forward to buying newer , cheaper shades soon .
 I guess you get what you pay for . I have several off brand sunglasses but none of them feel so cheap .
 The company is find - shipping was fast and everything went smoothly , no complaints with them . The glasses , however , broke apart after a couple days of normal usage . Just save up and buy the real things for 20x the price : -RRB-
 These may look like Wayfarers at a distance but anyone will be able to spot them as fakes . They feel very cheap . The plastic is soft , like a toy , not hard and slick like you expect sunglasses to feel . They 're great if you 're looking for a cheap ` Risky Business ' Halloween costume , but they 're not sturdy enough for everyday wear .
 doesnt look anything like picture . i just threw it away after i got it because i didnt want to waste my time returning it and letting them resell it .
 One lens was darker than the other and it costed to much for how cheap the sunglasses looked . So I suggest to look somewhere else .
 I ordered this product from a third-party partner . While the tank was of excellent quality , there is a distinct sizing issue with the product . I received a medium , but the cut of the tank is either a large or extra large . When I put it on , I am literally swimming in it -LRB- yes , I am a medium with a 31 waist and 44 chest -RRB- . Since there is no sizing information on Amazon or at Athletica 's site , it is impossible to guess how these items will actually fit once received . I elected to keep it and just wear it around the house rather than at the gym , but I am very disappointed and wo n't be ordering from anything from Athletica again .
 I can not believe two things : first , the item is too large ! I buy a medium one , but it came like LX!second , when I return it back with $ 5 shipping , it came back again with a label said that I am late for returning ! It came to my house in march 17 , and it return at the company at Apr 12 . It out of return time ?? I had better read the all the review first , I can not believe this kind of company exit so long!never buy anything from them !
 This shirt I ordered did not look or fit the description I saw in the ad . I did return this item to get a refund . Sorry
 Sizing is very small . Worn once ... washed ... too small to wear again . Flimzy and not well made . Would n't recommend to anyone .
 The shirt is made very well , high quality , HOWEVER the sizing is all wrong . I ordered an Xtra large and a Large ... both seemed to be a child sized ... needless to say , my husband couldnt fit them Dont waste your money on these shirts . The merchant was a fast shipper , I had no problems with the transaction at all , however instead of dealing with the hassle of returning them , I just gave them to goodwill .

 I was very disappointed with this shirt . It 's plain goofy and weird ; if you want to look like a mad scientist Vikings fan this is the perfect attire .
 These nylons do not stay up . I found myself pulling them up on the hour . I expected better from a Hanes product .
 I ordered these hoping that they would be higher quality knee socks than I had used before . Within a couple of hours , these socks were slouching around my ankles . Not worth the higher price .
 The shirt I bought was XXL for a reason ... I am fat . While it fit just fine in my chest , The stomach area was narrow .
 I have never got such a bad purchase from Amazon . Offcourse I was attracted by the brand and the price . The shirt was having a real bad sizing . It was not large or medium while ordered for a large one . It still is haning in my closet and is useless.The design looks as if at the first look itself it can be identified as a discontinued model or design or something.Do not waste your money on this .
 I received two of these shirts of the same size . Both were too small for the indicated size and were incorrectly cut.Avoid .
 This shirt is too long to wear inside or out . Not Ralph Polo quality , just style .
 In the same order I purchased these and another pair of Levi 's jeans , in a dfferent cut . Both pairs were ordered in the same size . The other pair fit fine , just like every other pair of jeans that I 've ordered in this size . These jeans , however , were about three sizes too small . I double checked every tag just to make sure they were n't improperly labeled , but according to every tag and sticker on the jeans , they were the size I had ordered . Ever since my favorite cut of Levi 's -LRB- 569 -RRB- have been changed , it 's been hard to find a good pair of jeans . Thankfully Amazon offers free returns , back to the warehouse these go !
 I had ordered Levis jeans before , and the sizes fits always perfect , in this case this jeans were suppose to be a 34 waist 30 long ... but it looks like a 32 or 34 long .
 this pair of jeans did not fit as expected . THEY LOOK REALLY BAD ON ME . I would like to send them back .
 I ordered stone washed jeans because I like the look and feel , I was sent regular blue jeans . Because I needed pants now not later I kept them but I 'm not happy ! As usual the jeans are good they are Levi 's after all but NOT what I paid for . ARE YOU EITHER COLOR BLIND OR ILLITTERATE AT AMAZON NOW . M.S.
 The length is soo long that it bunches at the bottom and drags on the ground .
 I have worn the 517 for over twenty five years and Levi 's exclusively over 50 years . Two years ago , the cut changed and all 517 's were relaxed fit . Send back and change size because they were too big . SO I ordered the same thing but now 517 's are `` slim cut '' . Does n't work on me , I need some extra room . Now the number is 557 for the relaxed fit and I get to pay the postage to return the wrong cut jeans . Shame on Levi 's
 DO NOT buy new 517s if you are looking for the slim , fitted , look of the classic Levi 's 517 . That 's been left in the dust . Apparently Levi 's thinks only fat people wear jeans now.These jeans have so much extra fabric it 's almost comical . I bought a pair online , set the jeans out on the floor , and even with a 29 waist , there is so much extra fabric they look like women 's jeans ! It 's like they have room for hips or something.Gimme a break , someone who buys 517 's is not going for the baggy gangster look , they 're 517s !!! Thoroughly disappointed with the direction Levi 's have taken the fit of their jeans , I will never buy a pair again.Don ' t be fooled by the other reviews that say these have a classic fit . They have a baggy , frumpy , ` modern ' couch potato fit .
 Quality is no longer the same and the fit varies from wich country it is made and the mood of that worker that day !!! One day hopefully we 'll start making are own merchandise like the old days , with quality and pride !!!
 I ordered a pair of 517 jeans using a size I had used for years . The jeans mailed to me showed the size on the Levi 's patch , however they were several inches too long and the waist was much wider than normal . This was definitely not the size stated on the label.Very frustrating , especially after we were eagerly anticipating their arrival 2 weeks after the order was placed . I hesitate to mail-order jeans again after this experience .
 Great product . Communication was lacking . Amazon website indicated 2 pair were available at time of purchase . When they were not received in a timely fashion -LRB- ordered for a birthday present -RRB- , I initiated communication with G&L Clothing . They stated the merchandise was out of stock & had to be ordered . I will buy this product again , but not from this company . They should have been proactive in notifying me of the backorder issue instead of remaining silent .
 I feel disappointed with this product levi 's , in many occasions I have bought this brand of jeans in my country and for amazon and I never had problems with the heights , they all have come perfect , but this product not come correctly , my height is 34x 32 though these trousers have this marked height , is not correctly . this one is too small and I have others identical of the same height and model and I still have them excellent , I feel disappointed by this purchase . I have ten jeans of the same brand of diverse models 34x32 and I still have them correct , this one not . The height marked in this jeans is not real .
 I am a long time fan of Levi 's but this company is all over the place . I can not understand how there numerical style system works because it is almost meaningless . I got these and the waist was too big , thighs too small and boot cut seems to be almost more of a bell bottom look rather than having room for boots . I then got a size smaller locally of the 514 straight fit and they were almost the exact same overall , including the boot area . So if your waist measures 34 with a measuring tape , this 34 is too large and 33 in the 514 is also too large . However , the thighs are tight in both so I figure a 32 -LRB- which possibly might actually measure 34 -RRB- is probably going to looking like skinny jeans . because the thighs will be too small . So good luck with all that .
 ever since levi changed from being american made to being overseas made . . mostly in china THEY HAVE NO WORTH , the fabric is not half as tough as it used to be , the cut has changed and by doing so made it ten times worse then it was a few years ago , levi used to be my number one favorite brand to buy jean wise . . now it makes me just sad to look at them . they are poor excuses for jeans , the belt loops break off in a matter of weeks the zippers are weaker , and the sizing is complete bogus . everything is pretty much unprofessional and all they seem to care about now is mass production to make more money , instead of making a decent product to sell to customers , im sorry to say this levi but it has to be said , your products have been horrible over the last few years . your relaxed bootcut jeans of the early 2000 's were the BEST now you cant find them anywhere . so unless you go back to that exact fashion OR you make something just as good if not better then your old products you have lost a very loyal customer of 20 years . STOP just caring about making money and not caring about how well you make yoru products . carhartt has become my go to because atleast they care about if something holds together for more then a month .
 When the Chinese bought-out Levi Strauss & Co. they surrendered the quality of the Levi brand to history . Levi is not now or will they ever return to being the best pants money can buy . Shame , Shame , Shame on Levi Strauss & Co. . Levis are not even of high enough quality to be considered `` suckfull '' . Levis are now just another company making highly generic clothes from China , Honduras , Bangladesh , or wherever ...
 The length is way off . I have 30L with shorter legs . Other than that they would be OK I guess . But I would n't have bought them if I knew the length was a lie .
 This was the worst pair of jeans I have ever bought in my life . The specs implied that it would fit on one 's waist , however with the crotch being so short it barely reached my hips . I normally wear waist size 31 , which I ordered , but with this pair of jeans , the zipper almost could not go up . In addition , I am not a person with large legs , but this pair of jeans hugged me like it was made for a woman who wants to show off her assets . I would have returned my purchase , but where I am living it would cost double what the jeans are worth , so I will just have to accept my losses .
 I 'm 5 ' 11 &#34; 185 lbs , muscular build . It took effort to stuff my thighs and bits into these , leaving me uncomfortable throughout the day . Luckily I was able to find a friend these worked for .
 they were too long and did n't fit the waist as advertized . the price was okay and the delivery was fine . overall , i was disappointed and would not repeat my order .
 The pants are not true to size.Nor was it medium it was light color . They are too long . Not 36x29 . More like 36x30May I return for exchange ? The darker colorIndigo are true to size not stonewash.We are not satisfied with merchandise.Please send Return Label for exchange.Thank you.alfredawhtd@gmail.com
 Will not shop with this vendor again . I ordered 2 pair of jeans . After washing them to shrink , they were still 3 inches too long . CLOTHING TAGS DID NOT MATCH the actual size . I 'm a guy , I build houses but ca n't sew , so now I have to pay a seamstress . Vendor sucks , but Amazon was good about the whole thing.Dano .
 too baggy . The wwrong side was received . I need 40 X 34 and received 42 X 34 . I washed them -LRB- I wash all new clothes before wearing -RRB- and then found them to be too large . I Looked at the size tag and saw it saying 42 X 34 . I re-ordered the correct size which fits right . I guess I am stuck with the fat pants .
 Received jeans . Color was correct but it was clearly marked `` slim '' and my son needed a regular.It was clearly marked on all packaging that it was slim but never said so on the website and he wore them anyway to an event so I could n't return . Waste of $ 40
 I am a size 30x32 and buy alot of jeans . I also carry a concealed weapin in my waistband and for the most part , never have a problem with any other jeans . These jeans , however were so tight that i could barely button them even without my weaponi on me .
 Purchased Two Pair Of Jeans Only Got One . Was Told They Only Had One Pair And Never Heard Another Word But Got Charged For Two Pair .
 Ive been wearing Levi 's over 40 years . These are not the same old Levi 's ! The fit is baggy , the sizing is not consistant , I bought 2 pair and they fit and wear are totally different . Probably wo n't buy any levi products again
 I ordered 4 jeans , 34 size each , the Boot Cut is 1 size smaller than the 505 Straight Fit I also purchased in same order .
 I ordered 2 pair in the rinsed color , they have a very strong chemical odor that only got stronger after washing them . I am returning them .
 I am not fat by any means . I am in fact built . Both pairs ripped in the seat after 3 months . Beware when buying them . Levis boot cut jeans .
 I bought these jeans for my husband at Christmas . I knew that they would be stiff when I got them , and they were new so that is OK . But the first few times these have been washed , inside out or right-side out , they have faded and have horrible crease marks in the jeans , like the starch that was in them when they were new was just too much . I am disappointed in these jeans . After 6 washings they have weird lines on them and I can not get them to go away . My advice , do n't get the RIGID rinse . .
 ordered 32 inch length . first pair was 4 &#34; too long . recieved a replacement pair and they were 2 &#34; too long . poor quality control on this product
 This is terrible ! I am upset and disappointed!I ordered a pair of 517 jeans using a size . The jeans mailed to me showed the size on the Levi 's patch , however they were several inches too long and the waist was much wider than normal . This was definitely not the size stated on the label.Very frustrating , especially after we were eagerly anticipating their arrival I hesitate to mail-order jeans again after this experience .
 I got this vest from my wife as a gift , so I should n't be looking a gift horse in the mouth . Maybe that 's OK , as my comments are not directed at her , but to possible future buyers.I 've had other vests , so I 've had time to develop a very strong opinion about features that I like and do n't . This vest does n't meet up with some of the basics that I am used to enjoying with my years old Gap vest.First of all , the fleece is quite thin and porous and thus not warm in a breeze , so I do n't wear it outside much . The large arm holes do n't help there either.The zipper is only one way , i.e. , it does n't open up from the bottom . To me that is a major inconvenience as I ca n't adjust the bottom when I am sitting or driving . With the slightly longer cut , the vest ends up bunching up around my waist . I also have to undo the zipper completely or yank the bottom of the vest halfway up my waist if I have to pull down the zipper in my pants to go to the bathroom.My major problem , however , is with the cut . The middle has a lot of fabric and wo n't lay flat over my chest and stomach . It finally occurred to me that it is actually perfect for someone with a medium pot belly , but that 's not me.My final complaint is with the pocket zipper , they go down to close . If you do n't zip it fully , small things like change or keys , will fall out.Overall , the design feels like there was a lack of thought throughout . Maybe they turned a junior designer loose on this item.Since I won ; t be returning the vest , it 'll get demoted to workshop duty .
 This is the sleeveless version of the Steen 's Mountain jacket . Runs a size big -LRB- 5 ' 7 '' 160 lbs , small was loose -RRB- . No drawcord in hem is less than stellar . Useless against wind . I 'm having to edit my review because the stitching is coming loose around the bottom of the zipper . It 's not only fraying , it 's also interfering with the zipper operation . I hope Amazon will take it back .
 got a medium and it 's more like an xl and the material is a little flimsy
 bought this vest to supplement a Patagonia fleece vest i have . To my surprise the vest is not very warm , does not feel like i have a fleece vest on ! Otherwise the fleece has a nice material and nice look to it but it is not doing what it is supposed to -LRB- keep me warm -RRB- & also as others have mentioned in the posts here it runs a size larger -LRB- i bought an L but should have gotten an M - for all my other stuff i have Ls -RRB- Hope this helps .
 The vest did not meet my expectations . The quality of the fleece was not what I expected . I expected a thicker fleece . It is very hard buying some things online without details of the construction of the item . Thanks Scott
 I am 5 '11 and 154 pound . Even I select M size , but it 's still too big for me . Seems it built for a guy has 6 ' 3 and 200 pound .
 collar is too big , the length is too long and fit is very loose , not what I was expecting . from the photo it looks different .
 There was no drawstring to cinch the waistline as was stated in the description . Very unhappy with this purchase ! Boo !
 I always bought the Columbia items and will continue , but this item is the worst I ever have seen . I saw the picture and never hesitated to get the item . Well , today I got it and when I opened my jaws dropped . This is thinner than a handkerchief I believe . Never rely on the picture you see . It was my fault that I never consaulted with some customers and when I sent mails to Columbia , they never replied . This is a no-good vest !!!!!
 I bought this item from Amazon at a good price , but when it arrived it was short and blousy ... too wide , yet too short . It 's a shame because the materials are typical Columbia excellence .
 I 've worn Columbia fleece for years , and their vests are a particular favorite because they are so versatile . I 've loved the quality and the details in the design . However , this Cathedral vest falls woefully short in both those categories . First of all , there is NO DRAWSTRING at the bottom , and that is an essential for the fit and warmth of a vest ... the bottom just hangs open and the drape of the garment just does n't work without that simple elastic drawstring . Further , the workmanship is n't any better than the no-name brands available for half the price , and the material is thin and insufficient . Not up to Columbia 's very high -LRB- and usual -RRB- standard . Wish I could get my money back . Try again , Amazon .
 We 've purchased a number of these vest over the past few years and we actually had to return this one because the quality of the material was so poor . It was very thin and flimsy . The collar would n't stand up as it should because the material was so thin . Very dissapointed .
 I have a columbia vest from a few years ago , and this one is a FRAUD ... paper thin , DO NOT get suckered into buying these cheap imitations !!!!!
 These items are selling for different prices -- It seems like whatever popular colors are they jack up the price -- what a cheat !
 but when i went to use it i found that the handle has a problem ... since this was at an airport it was not a good thing ... it seems that the hole to make the handle go `` click '' when it is extended does not allow the handle to then retract ... since i 've got it home i have fixed the problem , but really , this shows some shoddy workmanship and quality contro ; ... wo n't be buying from american tourister again
 Size smaller than expected . Purchased as Christmas gift for nephew ; plan on returning .
 The fabric itself is acceptable but not great as you could see for the price tag of ~ 100usd , so the price after discount is even still a bit high compared to its quality.The sizing is a big big problem , size S is way far bigger than same size of any other 's brand . Recommended to buy two size smaller than what you normally wear .
 I liked these shoes initially but I am so disappointed now . The shoes are falling apart ! I am even wondering if they are conterfeit or something because it is hard to believe a company would sell a shoe this poorly constructed.I started to feel a weird thing in one foot , then a day later the other foot too . . then the next day I found out what it was - the inside of the shoe coming apart . I have not been hard on these shoes , just walked in them.I 've had them 10 days and they are now useless , not repairable .
 The length is soo long that it bunches at the bottom and drags on the ground .
 Received jeans . Color was correct but it was clearly marked `` slim '' and my son needed a regular.It was clearly marked on all packaging that it was slim but never said so on the website and he wore them anyway to an event so I could n't return . Waste of $ 40

 In the same order I purchased these and another pair of Levi 's jeans , in a dfferent cut . Both pairs were ordered in the same size . The other pair fit fine , just like every other pair of jeans that I 've ordered in this size . These jeans , however , were about three sizes too small . I double checked every tag just to make sure they were n't improperly labeled , but according to every tag and sticker on the jeans , they were the size I had ordered . Ever since my favorite cut of Levi 's -LRB- 569 -RRB- have been changed , it 's been hard to find a good pair of jeans . Thankfully Amazon offers free returns , back to the warehouse these go !
 I 'm 5 ' 11 &#34; 185 lbs , muscular build . It took effort to stuff my thighs and bits into these , leaving me uncomfortable throughout the day . Luckily I was able to find a friend these worked for .

 I have worn the 517 for over twenty five years and Levi 's exclusively over 50 years . Two years ago , the cut changed and all 517 's were relaxed fit . Send back and change size because they were too big . SO I ordered the same thing but now 517 's are `` slim cut '' . Does n't work on me , I need some extra room . Now the number is 557 for the relaxed fit and I get to pay the postage to return the wrong cut jeans . Shame on Levi 's
 Quality is no longer the same and the fit varies from wich country it is made and the mood of that worker that day !!! One day hopefully we 'll start making are own merchandise like the old days , with quality and pride !!!
 DO NOT buy new 517s if you are looking for the slim , fitted , look of the classic Levi 's 517 . That 's been left in the dust . Apparently Levi 's thinks only fat people wear jeans now.These jeans have so much extra fabric it 's almost comical . I bought a pair online , set the jeans out on the floor , and even with a 29 waist , there is so much extra fabric they look like women 's jeans ! It 's like they have room for hips or something.Gimme a break , someone who buys 517 's is not going for the baggy gangster look , they 're 517s !!! Thoroughly disappointed with the direction Levi 's have taken the fit of their jeans , I will never buy a pair again.Don ' t be fooled by the other reviews that say these have a classic fit . They have a baggy , frumpy , ` modern ' couch potato fit .

 Great product . Communication was lacking . Amazon website indicated 2 pair were available at time of purchase . When they were not received in a timely fashion -LRB- ordered for a birthday present -RRB- , I initiated communication with G&L Clothing . They stated the merchandise was out of stock & had to be ordered . I will buy this product again , but not from this company . They should have been proactive in notifying me of the backorder issue instead of remaining silent .
 I feel disappointed with this product levi 's , in many occasions I have bought this brand of jeans in my country and for amazon and I never had problems with the heights , they all have come perfect , but this product not come correctly , my height is 34x 32 though these trousers have this marked height , is not correctly . this one is too small and I have others identical of the same height and model and I still have them excellent , I feel disappointed by this purchase . I have ten jeans of the same brand of diverse models 34x32 and I still have them correct , this one not . The height marked in this jeans is not real .
 I should definitely have heeded the warnings of others . I ordered a pair of the 517s and upon receiving them , was rather dismayed that indeed the length was way off . Upon measurement , the inseam is 31.5 &#34; instead of the 30 &#34; that I ordered , and what the jean claims to be . Back to Amazon it goes . Such is the QA of a global brand . People have been fired for way less.The search for the perfect fit continues .
 Tags on clothing say 29 &#34; length . They are 30 1/2 &#34; so I have to hem them . According to Levi 's website they do not have a 29 &#34; length so ?
 This was the worst pair of jeans I have ever bought in my life . The specs implied that it would fit on one 's waist , however with the crotch being so short it barely reached my hips .

 this pair of jeans did not fit as expected . THEY LOOK REALLY BAD ON ME . I would like to send them back .
 I ordered stone washed jeans because I like the look and feel , I was sent regular blue jeans . Because I needed pants now not later I kept them but I 'm not happy ! As usual the jeans are good they are Levi 's after all but NOT what I paid for . ARE YOU EITHER COLOR BLIND OR ILLITTERATE AT AMAZON NOW . M.S.
 I had ordered Levis jeans before , and the sizes fits always perfect , in this case this jeans were suppose to be a 34 waist 30 long ... but it looks like a 32 or 34 long .
 When the Chinese bought-out Levi Strauss & Co. they surrendered the quality of the Levi brand to history . Levi is not now or will they ever return to being the best pants money can buy .

 I have previously bought a lot of these shirts . Over time , a peculiar problem surfaced . Shrinkage -LRB- natural in a cotton shirt -RRB- affected one side of the front of the shirt , in the up and down direction , more than the other . As a result , the button holes in the placket increasingly became farther apart than the buttons , causing the shirt to have extensive wrinkling on the button side . I am not a tailor , but what I suspect happened is that the Banks buyers failed to specify how the warp and woof of the fabric were to be matched -- an expensive mistake.A second problems arises from product sizing . When I moved from a 16.5-34 to a 17-34 , the shirt suddenly became a tent.I have not had these problems with other manufacturers , notably Eagle , Land 's End and Enro .
 Bad fit for an ordinary guy . I ca n't imagine who they design such shirts for!I had luck with one of their Traveler shirts - really nice , and attempted to get another twice - no more !
 Although I did follow instructions for sizing the product , it was still way too tight . In addition , there were no return or exchange direction including in the package . I have attempted to email the company and have not received a response . It has been about 2 weeks . I am not sure what to do .
 I bought this shirt for my brother for Christmas . It 's hard to find good primus t-shirts and I was so excited about giving him this shirt . He absolutely loved it . * However * after pulling it out of the washer for the very first time , before having ever worn it once , the fabric on the collar and cuffs had disinegrated ! Seriously it looked like moths ATE it . I think Les Claypool would be very disappointed to know that his merchandise is no good . I would not recommend this shirt if you 're planning on wearing it for a long time .

When they were not received in a timely fashion -LRB- ordered for a birthday present -RRB- , I initiated communication with G&L Clothing . They stated the merchandise was out of stock & had to be ordered . I will buy this product again , but not from this company . They should have been proactive in notifying me of the backorder issue instead of remaining silent .
 I feel disappointed with this product levi 's , in many occasions I have bought this brand of jeans in my country and for amazon and I never had problems with the heights , they all have come perfect , but this product not come correctly , my height is 34x 32 though these trousers have this marked height , is not correctly . this one is too small and I have others identical of the same height and model and I still have them excellent , I feel disappointed by this purchase . I have ten jeans of the same brand of diverse models 34x32 and I still have them correct , this one not . The height marked in this jeans is not real .
 I am a long time fan of Levi 's but this company is all over the place . I can not understand how there numerical style system works because it is almost meaningless . I got these and the waist was too big , thighs too small and boot cut seems to be almost more of a bell bottom look rather than having room for boots . I then got a size smaller locally of the 514 straight fit and they were almost the exact same overall , including the boot area . So if your waist measures 34 with a measuring tape , this 34 is too large and 33 in the 514 is also too large . However , the thighs are tight in both so I figure a 32 -LRB- which possibly might actually measure 34 -RRB- is probably going to looking like skinny jeans . because the thighs will be too small . So good luck with all that .
 Ive been wearing Levi 's over 40 years . These are not the same old Levi 's ! The fit is baggy , the sizing is not consistant , I bought 2 pair and they fit and wear are totally different . Probably wo n't buy any levi products again
 I ordered 4 jeans , 34 size each , the Boot Cut is 1 size smaller than the 505 Straight Fit I also purchased in same order .
 Received jeans . Color was correct but it was clearly marked `` slim '' and my son needed a regular.It was clearly marked on all packaging that it was slim but never said so on the website and he wore them anyway to an event so I could n't return . Waste of $ 40
 I am a size 30x32 and buy alot of jeans . I also carry a concealed weapin in my waistband and for the most part , never have a problem with any other jeans . These jeans , however were so tight that i could barely button them even without my weaponi on me .
 Purchased Two Pair Of Jeans Only Got One . Was Told They Only Had One Pair And Never Heard Another Word But Got Charged For Two Pair .
 I ordered 2 pair in the rinsed color , they have a very strong chemical odor that only got stronger after washing them . I am returning them .
 this pair of jeans did not fit as expected . THEY LOOK REALLY BAD ON ME . I would like to send them back .
 I ordered stone washed jeans because I like the look and feel , I was sent regular blue jeans . Because I needed pants now not later I kept them but I 'm not happy ! As usual the jeans are good they are Levi 's after all but NOT what I paid for . ARE YOU EITHER COLOR BLIND OR ILLITTERATE AT AMAZON NOW . M.S.
 The length is soo long that it bunches at the bottom and drags on the ground .
 I had ordered Levis jeans before , and the sizes fits always perfect , in this case this jeans were suppose to be a 34 waist 30 long ... but it looks like a 32 or 34 long .
 I am not fat by any means . I am in fact built . Both pairs ripped in the seat after 3 months . Beware when buying them . Levis boot cut jeans .
 I bought these jeans for my husband at Christmas . I knew that they would be stiff when I got them , and they were new so that is OK . But the first few times these have been washed , inside out or right-side out , they have faded and have horrible crease marks in the jeans , like the starch that was in them when they were new was just too much . I am disappointed in these jeans . After 6 washings they have weird lines on them and I can not get them to go away . My advice , do n't get the RIGID rinse . .
 ordered 32 inch length . first pair was 4 &#34; too long . recieved a replacement pair and they were 2 &#34; too long . poor quality control on this product
 This is terrible ! I am upset and disappointed!I ordered a pair of 517 jeans using a size . The jeans mailed to me showed the size on the Levi 's patch , however they were several inches too long and the waist was much wider than normal . This was definitely not the size stated on the label.Very frustrating , especially after we were eagerly anticipating their arrival I hesitate to mail-order jeans again after this experience .
 In the same order I purchased these and another pair of Levi 's jeans , in a dfferent cut . Both pairs were ordered in the same size . The other pair fit fine , just like every other pair of jeans that I 've ordered in this size . These jeans , however , were about three sizes too small . I double checked every tag just to make sure they were n't improperly labeled , but according to every tag and sticker on the jeans , they were the size I had ordered . Ever since my favorite cut of Levi 's -LRB- 569 -RRB- have been changed , it 's been hard to find a good pair of jeans . Thankfully Amazon offers free returns , back to the warehouse these go !
 Will not shop with this vendor again . I ordered 2 pair of jeans . After washing them to shrink , they were still 3 inches too long . CLOTHING TAGS DID NOT MATCH the actual size . I 'm a guy , I build houses but ca n't sew , so now I have to pay a seamstress . Vendor sucks , but Amazon was good about the whole thing.Dano .
 too baggy . The wwrong side was received . I need 40 X 34 and received 42 X 34 . I washed them -LRB- I wash all new clothes before wearing -RRB- and then found them to be too large . I Looked at the size tag and saw it saying 42 X 34 . I re-ordered the correct size which fits right . I guess I am stuck with the fat pants .
 they were too long and did n't fit the waist as advertized . the price was okay and the delivery was fine . overall , i was disappointed and would not repeat my order .
 The pants are not true to size.Nor was it medium it was light color . They are too long . Not 36x29 . More like 36x30May I return for exchange ? The darker colorIndigo are true to size not stonewash.We are not satisfied with merchandise.Please send Return Label for exchange.Thank you.alfredawhtd@gmail.com
 I 'm 5 ' 11 &#34; 185 lbs , muscular build . It took effort to stuff my thighs and bits into these , leaving me uncomfortable throughout the day . Luckily I was able to find a friend these worked for .
 When the Chinese bought-out Levi Strauss & Co. they surrendered the quality of the Levi brand to history . Levi is not now or will they ever return to being the best pants money can buy . Shame , Shame , Shame on Levi Strauss & Co. . Levis are not even of high enough quality to be considered `` suckfull '' . Levis are now just another company making highly generic clothes from China , Honduras , Bangladesh , or wherever ...
 The length is way off . I have 30L with shorter legs . Other than that they would be OK I guess . But I would n't have bought them if I knew the length was a lie .
 This was the worst pair of jeans I have ever bought in my life . The specs implied that it would fit on one 's waist , however with the crotch being so short it barely reached my hips . I normally wear waist size 31 , which I ordered , but with this pair of jeans , the zipper almost could not go up . In addition , I am not a person with large legs , but this pair of jeans hugged me like it was made for a woman who wants to show off her assets . I would have returned my purchase , but where I am living it would cost double what the jeans are worth , so I will just have to accept my losses .
 very poor quality , balla at ankle , too expensive for this pathetic product . I am having doubts about amazons ability to offer high quality , durable , satisfactory products . JUST CHEAP is poor reason to offer a product .
 I loved the first paid and came back for more only to find two colors . :-LRB- What happened to the Champagne and Smoke Colors ?
 I got these because I have circulation problems in my feet . However , they 're not that warm . I have wool socks that are much warmer . Plus , they do n't have enough elastic and so they fall off in bed . I would not recommend these to anyone .
 $ 23.07 for a pair of socks ?! Ca n't be real . Had to return them . Know that you will only get one color .
 I ordered 2 pairs of these for Christmas gifts-a pink & a grey.The pink was soft & warm & washed well-no dryer . However , there are pink fuzzies all over the place-in bed -LRB- worn as sleeping socks -RRB- & all over the floor . Hope the shedding stops!The grey was given as a gift also . Worn once , it started to fall apart at the top & could no longer be worn . It 's currently on the sewing machine table to be fixed as the top started unraveling-how embarrassing . I am ashamed of giving a gift like that!Tried to contact seller-no response . Hope they send a replacement to my giftee!NOTE 1.21.10
 These socks are wonderful to touch , soft and silky , but the individual threads that make up the socks are actually quite coarse and hard . When I wear them I think I can feel every single thread under my feet . This is likely not going to be the experience of everyone who buys this product , but my feet are sensitive and I purchased these socks thinking I was buying something that would make my feet feel good . Could not have been more disappointed .
 The product is cute , warm and fuzzy , but one sock popped a big hole in the side after 4 days of bed use . Could be a fluke , but tough to say .
 Taking it out of the package I see there 's a two inch long tear in the lace in the collar , on the front , of course . The lace is totally not the elegant lace in the photo but a really cheesy cotton lace that looks way cheaper , the silver trim is different , too.Putting it on , I see the collar bunches and does n't lay as it should , and armholes are way too tight.Need this for a costume party , no time to return . Will be taking it apart and fixing it to make it work . Completely unimpressed . The first real dud I 've experienced through Amazon.Update : Could n't waste any more time on fixing it before party , and needed to buy a whole new different costume fast . Bought Princess Leia from the local Target , which cost me * another * much more reasonable $ 40 for a better made product . In the meantime , the seller has contacted me begging for me to reconsider my rating . They say Amazon commingles their products with inferior products and I received this cheap product because I chose Amazon 's fulfillment instead of them for fast shipping ... it was Amazon that made the mistake . They told me to ask Amazon for the refund.Amazon will -LRB- somewhat understandably -RRB- only credit me $ 20 as the costume was altered to try to make it wearable fast and that makes it unreturnable.Bottom line
 The Timbuk 2 Classic Messenger Bag is a very roomy bag . The large can fit a ton of Stuff . Unfortunately the strap is very uncomfortable.The 2 '' wide strap cuts my shoulder when the bag is loaded . The strap is also sewn on to one end which prevented me from replacing it with something more comfortable . So it sits in the corner ; looks nice but not very functionable .
 I got a Large timbuk2 and from the rides i 've taken it on , it is n't very comfortable . I got a strap pad , hoping this would fix the problem but it still persists . When i bought the bag it did n't come with the strap pad or a cross strap but from carrying a chrome citizen messenger bag and this , the chrome definitely beats it in at area of comfortability . The one plus is that it definitely is very roomy .
 I have previously bought a lot of these shirts . Over time , a peculiar problem surfaced . Shrinkage -LRB- natural in a cotton shirt -RRB- affected one side of the front of the shirt , in the up and down direction , more than the other . As a result , the button holes in the placket increasingly became farther apart than the buttons , causing the shirt to have extensive wrinkling on the button side . I am not a tailor , but what I suspect happened is that the Banks buyers failed to specify how the warp and woof of the fabric were to be matched -- an expensive mistake.A second problems arises from product sizing . When I moved from a 16.5-34 to a 17-34 , the shirt suddenly became a tent.I have not had these problems with other manufacturers , notably Eagle , Land 's End and Enro .
 Bad fit for an ordinary guy . I ca n't imagine who they design such shirts for!I had luck with one of their Traveler shirts - really nice , and attempted to get another twice - no more !
 I have worn the 517 for over twenty five years and Levi 's exclusively over 50 years . Two years ago , the cut changed and all 517 's were relaxed fit . Send back and change size because they were too big . SO I ordered the same thing but now 517 's are `` slim cut '' . Does n't work on me , I need some extra room . Now the number is 557 for the relaxed fit and I get to pay the postage to return the wrong cut jeans . Shame on Levi 's
 Quality is no longer the same and the fit varies from wich country it is made and the mood of that worker that day !!! One day hopefully we 'll start making are own merchandise like the old days , with quality and pride !!!
 DO NOT buy new 517s if you are looking for the slim , fitted , look of the classic Levi 's 517 . That 's been left in the dust . Apparently Levi 's thinks only fat people wear jeans now.These jeans have so much extra fabric it 's almost comical . I bought a pair online , set the jeans out on the floor , and even with a 29 waist , there is so much extra fabric they look like women 's jeans ! It 's like they have room for hips or something.Gimme a break , someone who buys 517 's is not going for the baggy gangster look , they 're 517s !!! Thoroughly disappointed with the direction Levi 's have taken the fit of their jeans , I will never buy a pair again.Don ' t be fooled by the other reviews that say these have a classic fit . They have a baggy , frumpy , ` modern ' couch potato fit .
 I ordered a pair of 517 jeans using a size I had used for years . The jeans mailed to me showed the size on the Levi 's patch , however they were several inches too long and the waist was much wider than normal . This was definitely not the size stated on the label.Very frustrating , especially after we were eagerly anticipating their arrival 2 weeks after the order was placed . I hesitate to mail-order jeans again after this experience .

 I should definitely have heeded the warnings of others . I ordered a pair of the 517s and upon receiving them , was rather dismayed that indeed the length was way off . Upon measurement , the inseam is 31.5 &#34; instead of the 30 &#34; that I ordered , and what the jean claims to be . Back to Amazon it goes . Such is the QA of a global brand . People have been fired for way less.The search for the perfect fit continues .
 Tags on clothing say 29 &#34; length . They are 30 1/2 &#34; so I have to hem them . According to Levi 's website they do not have a 29 &#34; length so ?
 I ordered 4 jeans , 34 size each , the Boot Cut is 1 size smaller than the 505 Straight Fit I also purchased in same order .
 I ordered 2 pair in the rinsed color , they have a very strong chemical odor that only got stronger after washing them . I am returning them .

 ever since levi changed from being american made to being overseas made . . mostly in china THEY HAVE NO WORTH , the fabric is not half as tough as it used to be , the cut has changed and by doing so made it ten times worse then it was a few years ago , levi used to be my number one favorite brand to buy jean wise . . now it makes me just sad to look at them . they are poor excuses for jeans , the belt loops break off in a matter of weeks the zippers are weaker , and the sizing is complete bogus . everything is pretty much unprofessional and all they seem to care about now is mass production to make more money , instead of making a decent product to sell to customers , im sorry to say this levi but it has to be said , your products have been horrible over the last few years . your relaxed bootcut jeans of the early 2000 's were the BEST now you cant find them anywhere . so unless you go back to that exact fashion OR you make something just as good if not better then your old products you have lost a very loyal customer of 20 years . STOP just caring about making money and not caring about how well you make yoru products . carhartt has become my go to because atleast they care about if something holds together for more then a month .

 In the same order I purchased these and another pair of Levi 's jeans , in a dfferent cut . Both pairs were ordered in the same size . The other pair fit fine , just like every other pair of jeans that I 've ordered in this size . These jeans , however , were about three sizes too small . I double checked every tag just to make sure they were n't improperly labeled , but according to every tag and sticker on the jeans , they were the size I had ordered .

 I have worn silk camisoles and tank tops for years , under sweatshirts at home and under shirts at work in the winter , for that extra and lightweight layer of warmth . Mine have usually lasted many years and through dozens of hand washings . I only purchased these because my favorite ones were suddenly not to be found anywhere online . They looked promising , but were ultimately disappointing . The blue tank was significantly smaller than the black in the same size , but still a good fit . The stitching on both tanks began to unravel after only one or two wearings and before I 'd even hand washed them , around the arms on the blue tank and along the hemline on the black one . Then , the black one began to shred -LRB- as silk is likely to do , eventually -RRB- almost immediately , as the hemline was no longer supported . I could n't believe it ! Worse , amazon.com does n't seem interested in standing behind its products , because I 'd passed some arbitrary 30-day mark and it was n't simply an exchange of an unworn item . I will definitely not be purchasing this brand of shirts again , and I will think twice before ordering any items again from amazon.com . It 's hard to believe that the largest online store in the world does n't have a better method for dealing with faulty products . I 'm speechless .

 Why was it not advertised as a Cuscus bag , it seems a deceiving misrepresenting practice ? Shipping charges are outragous at $ 8.99 ? Go to cuscus website and you can buy it for $ 29.95 incl . shipping .
 When this bag arrived , I excitedly attempted to throw it over my shoulder , only to have the clasp open and fall right off . Confused , I spent 20 minutes fiddling with the plastic clasp that keeps the upper and lower portions of the strap together , only to finally decide that it must have been molded wrong or something , because it refuses to stay closed . Even the slightest bit of pulling-pressure on the clasp causes it to release , even if you have n't pushed the `` safety tabs '' in.I e-mailed the company asking them how to return the bag for a new one , but was asked to `` make a video or something '' showing what the problem was . I did n't bother to respond -- if they 're going to force me to `` prove '' the problem just to exchange the bag , it 's not worth my time.This bag is a piece of crap , and their customer service 's roadblock to solving the problem earns them 1-star . Thanks for wasting my $ 20 !
 Length :
 The backpack has been carefully used for two weeks , but already one of the outside straps across the pocket for a water bottle has ripped out . Looks like not enough of the strap was sewn into the seam .
 My mother-in-law cracks on me every time I wear this hat ! The style is not that appealing I must say . It is warm , but ugly .
 Ordered items Dec 3 for xmas presents & DID NOT get items until Dec 26 . Package came and WAS SENT THE WRONG ITEMS ORDERED . Did not match what was on the picture . Called them but took forever to get any answer . DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER ! CAN NOT RESOLVE PROBLEMS QUICKLY .

 ever since levi changed from being american made to being overseas made . . mostly in china THEY HAVE NO WORTH , the fabric is not half as tough as it used to be , the cut has changed and by doing so made it ten times worse then it was a few years ago , levi used to be my number one favorite brand to buy jean wise . . now it makes me just sad to look at them . they are poor excuses for jeans , the belt loops break off in a matter of weeks the zippers are weaker , and the sizing is complete bogus . everything is pretty much unprofessional and all they seem to care about now is mass production to make more money , instead of making a decent product to sell to customers , im sorry to say this levi but it has to be said , your products have been horrible over the last few years . your relaxed bootcut jeans of the early 2000 's were the BEST now you cant find them anywhere . so unless you go back to that exact fashion OR you make something just as good if not better then your old products you have lost a very loyal customer of 20 years . STOP just caring about making money and not caring about how well you make yoru products . carhartt has become my go to because atleast they care about if something holds together for more then a month .
 Great product . Communication was lacking . Amazon website indicated 2 pair were available at time of purchase . When they were not received in a timely fashion -LRB- ordered for a birthday present -RRB- , I initiated communication with G&L Clothing . They stated the merchandise was out of stock & had to be ordered . I will buy this product again , but not from this company . They should have been proactive in notifying me of the backorder issue instead of remaining silent .
 I feel disappointed with this product levi 's , in many occasions I have bought this brand of jeans in my country and for amazon and I never had problems with the heights , they all have come perfect , but this product not come correctly , my height is 34x 32 though these trousers have this marked height , is not correctly . this one is too small and I have others identical of the same height and model and I still have them excellent , I feel disappointed by this purchase . I have ten jeans of the same brand of diverse models 34x32 and I still have them correct , this one not . The height marked in this jeans is not real .
 I bought these jeans for my husband at Christmas . I knew that they would be stiff when I got them , and they were new so that is OK . But the first few times these have been washed , inside out or right-side out , they have faded and have horrible crease marks in the jeans , like the starch that was in them when they were new was just too much . I am disappointed in these jeans . After 6 washings they have weird lines on them and I can not get them to go away . My advice , do n't get the RIGID rinse . .
 ordered 32 inch length . first pair was 4 &#34; too long . recieved a replacement pair and they were 2 &#34; too long . poor quality control on this product
 I have worn the 517 for over twenty five years and Levi 's exclusively over 50 years . Two years ago , the cut changed and all 517 's were relaxed fit . Send back and change size because they were too big . SO I ordered the same thing but now 517 's are `` slim cut '' . Does n't work on me , I need some extra room . Now the number is 557 for the relaxed fit and I get to pay the postage to return the wrong cut jeans . Shame on Levi 's
 DO NOT buy new 517s if you are looking for the slim , fitted , look of the classic Levi 's 517 . That 's been left in the dust . Apparently Levi 's thinks only fat people wear jeans now.These jeans have so much extra fabric it 's almost comical . I bought a pair online , set the jeans out on the floor , and even with a 29 waist , there is so much extra fabric they look like women 's jeans ! It 's like they have room for hips or something.Gimme a break , someone who buys 517 's is not going for the baggy gangster look , they 're 517s !!! Thoroughly disappointed with the direction Levi 's have taken the fit of their jeans , I will never buy a pair again.Don ' t be fooled by the other reviews that say these have a classic fit . They have a baggy , frumpy , ` modern ' couch potato fit .
 Quality is no longer the same and the fit varies from wich country it is made and the mood of that worker that day !!! One day hopefully we 'll start making are own merchandise like the old days , with quality and pride !!!
 I ordered a pair of 517 jeans using a size I had used for years . The jeans mailed to me showed the size on the Levi 's patch , however they were several inches too long and the waist was much wider than normal . This was definitely not the size stated on the label.Very frustrating , especially after we were eagerly anticipating their arrival 2 weeks after the order was placed . I hesitate to mail-order jeans again after this experience .
 I 'm 5 ' 11 &#34; 185 lbs , muscular build . It took effort to stuff my thighs and bits into these , leaving me uncomfortable throughout the day . Luckily I was able to find a friend these worked for .
 they were too long and did n't fit the waist as advertized . the price was okay and the delivery was fine . overall , i was disappointed and would not repeat my order .
 The pants are not true to size.Nor was it medium it was light color . They are too long . Not 36x29 . More like 36x30May I return for exchange ? The darker colorIndigo are true to size not stonewash.We are not satisfied with merchandise.Please send Return Label for exchange.Thank you.alfredawhtd@gmail.com
 In the same order I purchased these and another pair of Levi 's jeans , in a dfferent cut . Both pairs were ordered in the same size . The other pair fit fine , just like every other pair of jeans that I 've ordered in this size . These jeans , however , were about three sizes too small . I double checked every tag just to make sure they were n't improperly labeled , but according to every tag and sticker on the jeans , they were the size I had ordered . Ever since my favorite cut of Levi 's -LRB- 569 -RRB- have been changed , it 's been hard to find a good pair of jeans . Thankfully Amazon offers free returns , back to the warehouse these go !
 The length is way off . I have 30L with shorter legs . Other than that they would be OK I guess . But I would n't have bought them if I knew the length was a lie .
 This was the worst pair of jeans I have ever bought in my life . The specs implied that it would fit on one 's waist , however with the crotch being so short it barely reached my hips . I normally wear waist size 31 , which I ordered , but with this pair of jeans , the zipper almost could not go up . In addition , I am not a person with large legs , but this pair of jeans hugged me like it was made for a woman who wants to show off her assets . I would have returned my purchase , but where I am living it would cost double what the jeans are worth , so I will just have to accept my losses .
 When the Chinese bought-out Levi Strauss & Co. they surrendered the quality of the Levi brand to history . Levi is not now or will they ever return to being the best pants money can buy . Shame , Shame , Shame on Levi Strauss & Co. . Levis are not even of high enough quality to be considered `` suckfull '' . Levis are now just another company making highly generic clothes from China , Honduras , Bangladesh , or wherever ...
 I have worn silk camisoles and tank tops for years , under sweatshirts at home and under shirts at work in the winter , for that extra and lightweight layer of warmth . Mine have usually lasted many years and through dozens of hand washings . I only purchased these because my favorite ones were suddenly not to be found anywhere online . They looked promising , but were ultimately disappointing . The blue tank was significantly smaller than the black in the same size , but still a good fit . The stitching on both tanks began to unravel after only one or two wearings and before I 'd even hand washed them , around the arms on the blue tank and along the hemline on the black one . Then , the black one began to shred -LRB- as silk is likely to do , eventually -RRB- almost immediately , as the hemline was no longer supported . I could n't believe it ! Worse , amazon.com does n't seem interested in standing behind its products , because I 'd passed some arbitrary 30-day mark and it was n't simply an exchange of an unworn item . I will definitely not be purchasing this brand of shirts again , and I will think twice before ordering any items again from amazon.com . It 's hard to believe that the largest online store in the world does n't have a better method for dealing with faulty products . I 'm speechless .
 The Timbuk 2 Classic Messenger Bag is a very roomy bag . The large can fit a ton of Stuff . Unfortunately the strap is very uncomfortable.The 2 '' wide strap cuts my shoulder when the bag is loaded . The strap is also sewn on to one end which prevented me from replacing it with something more comfortable . So it sits in the corner ; looks nice but not very functionable .
 I got a Large timbuk2 and from the rides i 've taken it on , it is n't very comfortable . I got a strap pad , hoping this would fix the problem but it still persists . When i bought the bag it did n't come with the strap pad or a cross strap but from carrying a chrome citizen messenger bag and this , the chrome definitely beats it in at area of comfortability . The one plus is that it definitely is very roomy .
 I have previously bought a lot of these shirts . Over time , a peculiar problem surfaced . Shrinkage -LRB- natural in a cotton shirt -RRB- affected one side of the front of the shirt , in the up and down direction , more than the other . As a result , the button holes in the placket increasingly became farther apart than the buttons , causing the shirt to have extensive wrinkling on the button side . I am not a tailor , but what I suspect happened is that the Banks buyers failed to specify how the warp and woof of the fabric were to be matched -- an expensive mistake.A second problems arises from product sizing . When I moved from a 16.5-34 to a 17-34 , the shirt suddenly became a tent.I have not had these problems with other manufacturers , notably Eagle , Land 's End and Enro .
 Bad fit for an ordinary guy . I ca n't imagine who they design such shirts for!I had luck with one of their Traveler shirts - really nice , and attempted to get another twice - no more !
 i didnt get item so i wouldnt know how it looks still wanted on the person i bought it from to found me anoter ornament

 I should definitely have heeded the warnings of others . I ordered a pair of the 517s and upon receiving them , was rather dismayed that indeed the length was way off . Upon measurement , the inseam is 31.5 &#34; instead of the 30 &#34; that I ordered , and what the jean claims to be . Back to Amazon it goes . Such is the QA of a global brand . People have been fired for way less.The search for the perfect fit continues .
 Tags on clothing say 29 &#34; length . They are 30 1/2 &#34; so I have to hem them . According to Levi 's website they do not have a 29 &#34; length so ?
 I have worn the 517 for over twenty five years and Levi 's exclusively over 50 years . Two years ago , the cut changed and all 517 's were relaxed fit .

 this pair of jeans did not fit as expected . THEY LOOK REALLY BAD ON ME . I would like to send them back .
 I ordered stone washed jeans because I like the look and feel , I was sent regular blue jeans . Because I needed pants now not later I kept them but I 'm not happy ! As usual the jeans are good they are Levi 's after all but NOT what I paid for . ARE YOU EITHER COLOR BLIND OR ILLITTERATE AT AMAZON NOW . M.S.
 I had ordered Levis jeans before , and the sizes fits always perfect , in this case this jeans were suppose to be a 34 waist 30 long ... but it looks like a 32 or 34 long .
 too baggy . The wwrong side was received . I need 40 X 34 and received 42 X 34 . I washed them -LRB- I wash all new clothes before wearing -RRB- and then found them to be too large . I Looked at the size tag and saw it saying 42 X 34 . I re-ordered the correct size which fits right . I guess I am stuck with the fat pants .
 they were too long and did n't fit the waist as advertized . the price was okay and the delivery was fine . overall , i was disappointed and would not repeat my order .

 I 'm 5 ' 11 &#34; 185 lbs , muscular build . It took effort to stuff my thighs and bits into these , leaving me uncomfortable throughout the day . Luckily I was able to find a friend these worked for .
 I ordered 4 jeans , 34 size each , the Boot Cut is 1 size smaller than the 505 Straight Fit I also purchased in same order .
 I ordered 2 pair in the rinsed color , they have a very strong chemical odor that only got stronger after washing them . I am returning them .
 I am a long time fan of Levi 's but this company is all over the place . I can not understand how there numerical style system works because it is almost meaningless . I got these and the waist was too big , thighs too small and boot cut seems to be almost more of a bell bottom look rather than having room for boots . I then got a size smaller locally of the 514 straight fit and they were almost the exact same overall , including the boot area . So if your waist measures 34 with a measuring tape , this 34 is too large and 33 in the 514 is also too large . However , the thighs are tight in both so I figure a 32 -LRB- which possibly might actually measure 34 -RRB- is probably going to looking like skinny jeans . because the thighs will be too small . So good luck with all that .
 I bought these jeans for my husband at Christmas . I knew that they would be stiff when I got them , and they were new so that is OK .

 I am not fat by any means . I am in fact built . Both pairs ripped in the seat after 3 months . Beware when buying them . Levis boot cut jeans .
 Ive been wearing Levi 's over 40 years . These are not the same old Levi 's ! The fit is baggy , the sizing is not consistant , I bought 2 pair and they fit and wear are totally different . Probably wo n't buy any levi products again

 Will not shop with this vendor again . I ordered 2 pair of jeans . After washing them to shrink , they were still 3 inches too long . CLOTHING TAGS DID NOT MATCH the actual size . I 'm a guy , I build houses but ca n't sew , so now I have to pay a seamstress . Vendor sucks , but Amazon was good about the whole thing.Dano .
 The length is soo long that it bunches at the bottom and drags on the ground .
 Received jeans . Color was correct but it was clearly marked `` slim '' and my son needed a regular.It was clearly marked on all packaging that it was slim but never said so on the website and he wore them anyway to an event so I could n't return . Waste of $ 40
 I am a size 30x32 and buy alot of jeans . I also carry a concealed weapin in my waistband and for the most part , never have a problem with any other jeans . These jeans , however were so tight that i could barely button them even without my weaponi on me .

 Great product . Communication was lacking . Amazon website indicated 2 pair were available at time of purchase . When they were not received in a timely fashion -LRB- ordered for a birthday present -RRB- , I initiated communication with G&L Clothing . They stated the merchandise was out of stock & had to be ordered . I will buy this product again , but not from this company . They should have been proactive in notifying me of the backorder issue instead of remaining silent .
 I feel disappointed with this product levi 's , in many occasions I have bought this brand of jeans in my country and for amazon and I never had problems with the heights , they all have come perfect , but this product not come correctly , my height is 34x 32 though these trousers have this marked height , is not correctly . this one is too small and I have others identical of the same height and model and I still have them excellent , I feel disappointed by this purchase . I have ten jeans of the same brand of diverse models 34x32 and I still have them correct , this one not . The height marked in this jeans is not real .
 Tags on clothing say 29 &#34; length . They are 30 1/2 &#34; so I have to hem them . According to Levi 's website they do not have a 29 &#34; length so ?

However , the thighs are tight in both so I figure a 32 -LRB- which possibly might actually measure 34 -RRB- is probably going to looking like skinny jeans . because the thighs will be too small . So good luck with all that .
 I have worn the 517 for over twenty five years and Levi 's exclusively over 50 years . Two years ago , the cut changed and all 517 's were relaxed fit . Send back and change size because they were too big . SO I ordered the same thing but now 517 's are `` slim cut '' . Does n't work on me , I need some extra room . Now the number is 557 for the relaxed fit and I get to pay the postage to return the wrong cut jeans . Shame on Levi 's
 Quality is no longer the same and the fit varies from wich country it is made and the mood of that worker that day !!! One day hopefully we 'll start making are own merchandise like the old days , with quality and pride !!!
 DO NOT buy new 517s if you are looking for the slim , fitted , look of the classic Levi 's 517 . That 's been left in the dust . Apparently Levi 's thinks only fat people wear jeans now.These jeans have so much extra fabric it 's almost comical . I bought a pair online , set the jeans out on the floor , and even with a 29 waist , there is so much extra fabric they look like women 's jeans ! It 's like they have room for hips or something.Gimme a break , someone who buys 517 's is not going for the baggy gangster look , they 're 517s !!! Thoroughly disappointed with the direction Levi 's have taken the fit of their jeans , I will never buy a pair again.Don ' t be fooled by the other reviews that say these have a classic fit . They have a baggy , frumpy , ` modern ' couch potato fit .
 I ordered a pair of 517 jeans using a size I had used for years . The jeans mailed to me showed the size on the Levi 's patch , however they were several inches too long and the waist was much wider than normal . This was definitely not the size stated on the label.Very frustrating , especially after we were eagerly anticipating their arrival 2 weeks after the order was placed . I hesitate to mail-order jeans again after this experience .
 I ordered 4 jeans , 34 size each , the Boot Cut is 1 size smaller than the 505 Straight Fit I also purchased in same order .
 I ordered 2 pair in the rinsed color , they have a very strong chemical odor that only got stronger after washing them . I am returning them .
 too baggy . The wwrong side was received . I need 40 X 34 and received 42 X 34 . I washed them -LRB- I wash all new clothes before wearing -RRB- and then found them to be too large . I Looked at the size tag and saw it saying 42 X 34 . I re-ordered the correct size which fits right . I guess I am stuck with the fat pants .
 I have worn silk camisoles and tank tops for years , under sweatshirts at home and under shirts at work in the winter , for that extra and lightweight layer of warmth . Mine have usually lasted many years and through dozens of hand washings . I only purchased these because my favorite ones were suddenly not to be found anywhere online . They looked promising , but were ultimately disappointing . The blue tank was significantly smaller than the black in the same size , but still a good fit . The stitching on both tanks began to unravel after only one or two wearings and before I 'd even hand washed them , around the arms on the blue tank and along the hemline on the black one . Then , the black one began to shred -LRB- as silk is likely to do , eventually -RRB- almost immediately , as the hemline was no longer supported . I could n't believe it ! Worse , amazon.com does n't seem interested in standing behind its products , because I 'd passed some arbitrary 30-day mark and it was n't simply an exchange of an unworn item . I will definitely not be purchasing this brand of shirts again , and I will think twice before ordering any items again from amazon.com . It 's hard to believe that the largest online store in the world does n't have a better method for dealing with faulty products . I 'm speechless .
 I have previously bought a lot of these shirts . Over time , a peculiar problem surfaced . Shrinkage -LRB- natural in a cotton shirt -RRB- affected one side of the front of the shirt , in the up and down direction , more than the other . As a result , the button holes in the placket increasingly became farther apart than the buttons , causing the shirt to have extensive wrinkling on the button side . I am not a tailor , but what I suspect happened is that the Banks buyers failed to specify how the warp and woof of the fabric were to be matched -- an expensive mistake.A second problems arises from product sizing . When I moved from a 16.5-34 to a 17-34 , the shirt suddenly became a tent.I have not had these problems with other manufacturers , notably Eagle , Land 's End and Enro .
 Bad fit for an ordinary guy . I ca n't imagine who they design such shirts for!I had luck with one of their Traveler shirts - really nice , and attempted to get another twice - no more !

 I ordered this item based on the image on Amazon website . But thats not what I got . I received a very very light coat , which can be used as a rain coat only . So be aware of it . I returned it on the same day.I am very disappointed on this purchase with Amazon .
 The jacket is nice but the size was off . I wear a xxl in shirts but usually an xl or so in outerware . Just to be on the safe side I ordered this as a XXL but it was still snug . A nice jacket and good value for what I paid but just order a size or even two larger .
 I did n't like the jacket . The size was off , and the cut was awkward -- the size did n't match the arm length . It was stiff , not cloth-like and confortable . It was likely weatherproof , but felt more like the rainslicker I had as a little kid than somethingI 'd wear now .
 I got this vest from my wife as a gift , so I should n't be looking a gift horse in the mouth . Maybe that 's OK , as my comments are not directed at her , but to possible future buyers.I 've had other vests , so I 've had time to develop a very strong opinion about features that I like and do n't . This vest does n't meet up with some of the basics that I am used to enjoying with my years old Gap vest.First of all , the fleece is quite thin and porous and thus not warm in a breeze , so I do n't wear it outside much . The large arm holes do n't help there either.The zipper is only one way , i.e. , it does n't open up from the bottom . To me that is a major inconvenience as I ca n't adjust the bottom when I am sitting or driving . With the slightly longer cut , the vest ends up bunching up around my waist . I also have to undo the zipper completely or yank the bottom of the vest halfway up my waist if I have to pull down the zipper in my pants to go to the bathroom.My major problem , however , is with the cut . The middle has a lot of fabric and wo n't lay flat over my chest and stomach . It finally occurred to me that it is actually perfect for someone with a medium pot belly , but that 's not me.My final complaint is with the pocket zipper , they go down to close . If you do n't zip it fully , small things like change or keys , will fall out.Overall , the design feels like there was a lack of thought throughout . Maybe they turned a junior designer loose on this item.Since I won ; t be returning the vest , it 'll get demoted to workshop duty .
 This is the sleeveless version of the Steen 's Mountain jacket . Runs a size big -LRB- 5 ' 7 '' 160 lbs , small was loose -RRB- . No drawcord in hem is less than stellar . Useless against wind . I 'm having to edit my review because the stitching is coming loose around the bottom of the zipper . It 's not only fraying , it 's also interfering with the zipper operation . I hope Amazon will take it back .
 got a medium and it 's more like an xl and the material is a little flimsy
 bought this vest to supplement a Patagonia fleece vest i have . To my surprise the vest is not very warm , does not feel like i have a fleece vest on ! Otherwise the fleece has a nice material and nice look to it but it is not doing what it is supposed to -LRB- keep me warm -RRB- & also as others have mentioned in the posts here it runs a size larger -LRB- i bought an L but should have gotten an M - for all my other stuff i have Ls -RRB- Hope this helps .
 The vest did not meet my expectations . The quality of the fleece was not what I expected . I expected a thicker fleece . It is very hard buying some things online without details of the construction of the item . Thanks Scott
 I am 5 '11 and 154 pound . Even I select M size , but it 's still too big for me . Seems it built for a guy has 6 ' 3 and 200 pound .
 collar is too big , the length is too long and fit is very loose , not what I was expecting . from the photo it looks different .
 There was no drawstring to cinch the waistline as was stated in the description . Very unhappy with this purchase ! Boo !
 These items are selling for different prices -- It seems like whatever popular colors are they jack up the price -- what a cheat !
 I always bought the Columbia items and will continue , but this item is the worst I ever have seen . I saw the picture and never hesitated to get the item . Well , today I got it and when I opened my jaws dropped . This is thinner than a handkerchief I believe . Never rely on the picture you see . It was my fault that I never consaulted with some customers and when I sent mails to Columbia , they never replied . This is a no-good vest !!!!!
 I bought this item from Amazon at a good price , but when it arrived it was short and blousy ... too wide , yet too short . It 's a shame because the materials are typical Columbia excellence .
 I 've worn Columbia fleece for years , and their vests are a particular favorite because they are so versatile . I 've loved the quality and the details in the design . However , this Cathedral vest falls woefully short in both those categories . First of all , there is NO DRAWSTRING at the bottom , and that is an essential for the fit and warmth of a vest ... the bottom just hangs open and the drape of the garment just does n't work without that simple elastic drawstring . Further , the workmanship is n't any better than the no-name brands available for half the price , and the material is thin and insufficient . Not up to Columbia 's very high -LRB- and usual -RRB- standard . Wish I could get my money back . Try again , Amazon .
 I have a columbia vest from a few years ago , and this one is a FRAUD ... paper thin , DO NOT get suckered into buying these cheap imitations !!!!!

 This costume is of very poor quality . It 's so flimsy I do n't think it would survive a wash . It 's made in China and comes with several flammable warnings . I do n't know about you , but the last think I want my kid in on Halloween is something flammable . The bunny feet did n't fit at all -LRB- too small -RRB- and the ears do n't stand up straight . We took a few photos in in and threw it out . Not worth the money .
 Had to return it since the cap was too small for my baby even though she was barely 6 months old . If you live in a cold area , this may not be good for a late October outing .
 This item was a little disapionting for me . I ordered it thinking it was a truer , more peacock blue that would go well with other items I had . But as it turns out it is much more of a sky blue . Also the sizeing was a bit off and so I was n't able to wear it when I had hoped . I accually have n't worn it at all because untill I get it altered it will just fall off !

 We 've purchased a number of these vest over the past few years and we actually had to return this one because the quality of the material was so poor . It was very thin and flimsy . The collar would n't stand up as it should because the material was so thin . Very dissapointed .

 Miss-marked -LRB- small -RRB- Way off on waist . I bought this pair and a pair of linen shorts and the linen was true to size and this on was n't even close .
 I have worn silk camisoles and tank tops for years , under sweatshirts at home and under shirts at work in the winter , for that extra and lightweight layer of warmth . Mine have usually lasted many years and through dozens of hand washings . I only purchased these because my favorite ones were suddenly not to be found anywhere online . They looked promising , but were ultimately disappointing . The blue tank was significantly smaller than the black in the same size , but still a good fit . The stitching on both tanks began to unravel after only one or two wearings and before I 'd even hand washed them , around the arms on the blue tank and along the hemline on the black one . Then , the black one began to shred -LRB- as silk is likely to do , eventually -RRB- almost immediately , as the hemline was no longer supported . I could n't believe it ! Worse , amazon.com does n't seem interested in standing behind its products , because I 'd passed some arbitrary 30-day mark and it was n't simply an exchange of an unworn item . I will definitely not be purchasing this brand of shirts again , and I will think twice before ordering any items again from amazon.com . It 's hard to believe that the largest online store in the world does n't have a better method for dealing with faulty products . I 'm speechless .

 I am 5 '11 and 154 pound . Even I select M size , but it 's still too big for me . Seems it built for a guy has 6 ' 3 and 200 pound .
 collar is too big , the length is too long and fit is very loose , not what I was expecting . from the photo it looks different .
 I got this vest from my wife as a gift , so I should n't be looking a gift horse in the mouth . Maybe that 's OK , as my comments are not directed at her , but to possible future buyers.I 've had other vests , so I 've had time to develop a very strong opinion about features that I like and do n't . This vest does n't meet up with some of the basics that I am used to enjoying with my years old Gap vest.First of all , the fleece is quite thin and porous and thus not warm in a breeze , so I do n't wear it outside much . The large arm holes do n't help there either.The zipper is only one way , i.e. , it does n't open up from the bottom . To me that is a major inconvenience as I ca n't adjust the bottom when I am sitting or driving . With the slightly longer cut , the vest ends up bunching up around my waist . I also have to undo the zipper completely or yank the bottom of the vest halfway up my waist if I have to pull down the zipper in my pants to go to the bathroom.My major problem , however , is with the cut . The middle has a lot of fabric and wo n't lay flat over my chest and stomach . It finally occurred to me that it is actually perfect for someone with a medium pot belly , but that 's not me.My final complaint is with the pocket zipper , they go down to close . If you do n't zip it fully , small things like change or keys , will fall out.Overall , the design feels like there was a lack of thought throughout . Maybe they turned a junior designer loose on this item.Since I won ; t be returning the vest , it 'll get demoted to workshop duty .
 This is the sleeveless version of the Steen 's Mountain jacket . Runs a size big -LRB- 5 ' 7 '' 160 lbs , small was loose -RRB- . No drawcord in hem is less than stellar . Useless against wind . I 'm having to edit my review because the stitching is coming loose around the bottom of the zipper . It 's not only fraying , it 's also interfering with the zipper operation . I hope Amazon will take it back .
 got a medium and it 's more like an xl and the material is a little flimsy
 bought this vest to supplement a Patagonia fleece vest i have . To my surprise the vest is not very warm , does not feel like i have a fleece vest on ! Otherwise the fleece has a nice material and nice look to it but it is not doing what it is supposed to -LRB- keep me warm -RRB- & also as others have mentioned in the posts here it runs a size larger -LRB- i bought an L but should have gotten an M - for all my other stuff i have Ls -RRB- Hope this helps .
 The vest did not meet my expectations . The quality of the fleece was not what I expected . I expected a thicker fleece . It is very hard buying some things online without details of the construction of the item . Thanks Scott
 We 've purchased a number of these vest over the past few years and we actually had to return this one because the quality of the material was so poor . It was very thin and flimsy . The collar would n't stand up as it should because the material was so thin . Very dissapointed .
 I have a columbia vest from a few years ago , and this one is a FRAUD ... paper thin , DO NOT get suckered into buying these cheap imitations !!!!!
 I always bought the Columbia items and will continue , but this item is the worst I ever have seen . I saw the picture and never hesitated to get the item . Well , today I got it and when I opened my jaws dropped . This is thinner than a handkerchief I believe . Never rely on the picture you see . It was my fault that I never consaulted with some customers and when I sent mails to Columbia , they never replied . This is a no-good vest !!!!!
 I bought this item from Amazon at a good price , but when it arrived it was short and blousy ... too wide , yet too short . It 's a shame because the materials are typical Columbia excellence .
 I 've worn Columbia fleece for years , and their vests are a particular favorite because they are so versatile . I 've loved the quality and the details in the design . However , this Cathedral vest falls woefully short in both those categories . First of all , there is NO DRAWSTRING at the bottom , and that is an essential for the fit and warmth of a vest ... the bottom just hangs open and the drape of the garment just does n't work without that simple elastic drawstring . Further , the workmanship is n't any better than the no-name brands available for half the price , and the material is thin and insufficient . Not up to Columbia 's very high -LRB- and usual -RRB- standard . Wish I could get my money back . Try again , Amazon .
 These items are selling for different prices -- It seems like whatever popular colors are they jack up the price -- what a cheat !
 I have previously bought a lot of these shirts . Over time , a peculiar problem surfaced . Shrinkage -LRB- natural in a cotton shirt -RRB- affected one side of the front of the shirt , in the up and down direction , more than the other . As a result , the button holes in the placket increasingly became farther apart than the buttons , causing the shirt to have extensive wrinkling on the button side . I am not a tailor , but what I suspect happened is that the Banks buyers failed to specify how the warp and woof of the fabric were to be matched -- an expensive mistake.A second problems arises from product sizing . When I moved from a 16.5-34 to a 17-34 , the shirt suddenly became a tent.I have not had these problems with other manufacturers , notably Eagle , Land 's End and Enro .
 Bad fit for an ordinary guy . I ca n't imagine who they design such shirts for!I had luck with one of their Traveler shirts - really nice , and attempted to get another twice - no more !

 Synthetic Leather Looking Belt - fell apart after first use.Don ' t buy this !!!!
 The belt lasted after 2 weeks after one of the punched holes broken due to my large belt buckle . It is not leather . The merchant sent me a replacement belt for free but useless due to unevenly punched holes . Try it . You may have better luck with it . I think my belt buckle was too tough for it .
 beware of sizing ... i ordered a brown medium because i am a size 9 pants ... it would n't even fit around my waist . i ordered a white one also and i got a large and even thoguht it fits it could stand to be bigger to look less awkward . if you are more than average size , i would steer clear ... otherwise , for the money , it 's a good belt ... i wear it often .
 Do n't bother.Feels like it 's made of some plastic material -LRB- though I 'm sure it 's not -RRB- . Just looks cheap.I ended up buying a vintage leather belt which was much nicer .
 This belt is 2 layers of top-grain stitched on the edges . It may be laminated too ; however , the leather was very dry and the layers were not stuck together.For a very small , thin person , this belt would look nice and allow the use of your own buckle.For any larger person , this belt would stretch , tear , and fail because it is not full-grain leather.Full-Grain means it 's one , thick piece of leather.Top-Grain means they use a slicer to split the sheets of leather into thinner sheats.Top-Grain is common because it 's often the `` waste '' leather used when making large sheets of uniform thickness . Laminating two layers of top-grain together does not give you any level of shear strength between the two layers .
 All I can say is that you are n't getting a deal here . It 's a Cheap belt . Feels like plastic or a rubber coating , it 's not real leather . I also ordered a size above my pant size and it was barely long enough to buckle . Waste of money .
 The belt is cheaply made with a very thin leather vineer over a fiber composit core . It will not hold up . The buckle slot was not cut as shown in photo .
 I bought this for a Halloween costume , which was good because after 3 uses this belt started to fall apart . I just want to warn people out there that if you are looking to use a belt everyday , do not get this belt .
 Cheap , not real solid leather , size is wrong , shipping a rip-off , supplier does not respond
 The description says 100 % leather . I was so shocked at how cheap it felt that I cut it in two to see what it was made of . It 's a layer less than a millimeter thick of what is probably faux leather . The rest of the thickness of the belt is something that looks like compressed dryer lint . It includes tiny pieces of colored thread and I even found a shred of silver mylar . THIS BELT IS LITERALLY MADE OF TRASH.Also , it did NOT come with a buckle , as the selection said it would .
 Cheap belt and it is not genuine leather . When I called for a replacement after the buckle hole ripped , they refused to consider one . Do n't waste your money .
 The belts have a thin layer of `` fabric '' glued to the internal side . Upon first wear the fabric pulls away from the `` pleather '' core leaving a gooey mess.These are not `` leather belts '' they are a poorly manufactured leather-veneer `` pleather '' belts .
 This made in China product appears to be a composite covered by a skin which looks like leather . If the skin is breached , the belt will fray . Not 100 % top grain or split grain cowhide .
 THOUGHT I HAD A GOOD BUY AND A GOOD SELLER . WRONG . BELT LASTED A WEEK AND TORE IN TWO . IMITATION LEATHER OR IT WAS TOO THIN WITH A SLICK COATING ON ONE SIDE AND FABRIC ON THE OTHER .
 While technically a leather belt , the leather comprises , perhaps , only 5-10 % of the material in this belt.Because it was not the full grain leather belt I expected , I returned it.The response was immediate and covered the cost for the return shipment . I 'm very happy with their customer service .
 Great price but poor quality . Does not seem to be made entirely of leather . I added a hole to the belt and the inside seems to have cardboard or some other composite material inside . I have had similar belts and the eventually de-laminate . But it was really inexpensive .
 I should have bought a better one . You get what you pay for . Said it came with free buckle but it did n't . Avoid unless you want a really cheap belt .
 This Beltmasters Brown Leather Belt is fairly low quality and has a very strong chemical smell that persists even after letting it air out.The sizing was accurate and the snaps are strong enough to hold my rather large metal buckle , but will look for another alternative the next time I need a belt.CFH
 Not sure what I expected from such an inexpensive belt but after one day or so the material started to crack and the seams came undone . I suppose this product would be ideal for someone who needed to wear a belt only once for a going away party and then planned to move to some sort of nudist colony or elastic waist band enthusiast community . Bottom line , spend a few more bucks and get something of a better quality .
 My mother always told me you get what you pay for I bought this belt and buckle because I thought it was a great deal but upon receiving it my husband tried on the belt and the buckle imidiately bent due to the quality and the texture of the belt was just way to flimsy it will be a nice belt for special event but as far as hard work I would n't recommend this belt
 after an excessive wait , I never did receive this product . My account got credited . I had ordered this for Christmas and by the time I found I was n't getting the belt , it was too late to order another in time for the holiday .
 i ordered for a brown belt and when i got it turned out to be orange making me a little frustrated .
 this belt seems to be cheep and the clasp seems to undo easier than I think it should . at time my buckle falls off . had to get a better one

 This clock is a cute little package wrapped around the deafening ticking of a quartz movement from hell . The alarm function is moot since you will never get any sleep with this baby in the room .
 The hat looks nice , but the seam in the middle front of the hat is felt under the band , and makes the hat very uncomfortable to wear . Even after a short time , I end up with a red welt on my for-head from these caps , I would not recommend them .
 I do n't know why the other reviewers liked this . It 's hard and made of polyester , not comfortable at all .
 I know it sounds like a joke but my head was too big for this item . It was very economical but the size was simply too small to fit comfortably . I ended up giving it away . So , if you 're a male with a fairly average body this hat will most likely not fit you . It just comes down to the old saying , you get what you pay for . If you pay for this , expect this to be too small for you . It may be a great hat for children or women though . So , buy with caution .

 The vest did not meet my expectations . The quality of the fleece was not what I expected . I expected a thicker fleece . It is very hard buying some things online without details of the construction of the item . Thanks Scott
 These items are selling for different prices -- It seems like whatever popular colors are they jack up the price -- what a cheat !
 There was no drawstring to cinch the waistline as was stated in the description . Very unhappy with this purchase ! Boo !
 I have previously bought a lot of these shirts . Over time , a peculiar problem surfaced . Shrinkage -LRB- natural in a cotton shirt -RRB- affected one side of the front of the shirt , in the up and down direction , more than the other . As a result , the button holes in the placket increasingly became farther apart than the buttons , causing the shirt to have extensive wrinkling on the button side . I am not a tailor , but what I suspect happened is that the Banks buyers failed to specify how the warp and woof of the fabric were to be matched -- an expensive mistake.A second problems arises from product sizing . When I moved from a 16.5-34 to a 17-34 , the shirt suddenly became a tent.I have not had these problems with other manufacturers , notably Eagle , Land 's End and Enro .
 Bad fit for an ordinary guy . I ca n't imagine who they design such shirts for!I had luck with one of their Traveler shirts - really nice , and attempted to get another twice - no more !

 We purchased this Pill Organizer after using the same type for a few years . The last one lasted a few years , but this one has started falling apart in one trip . On a few of the pouches , the zipper tab has come out in the fist day of use . I tried to put them back but no luck.Very poorly built - low quality .
 I was initially VERY happy with this clock . It 's easy to set , compact , large display , loud alarm and a sensible 8-minute snooze function . However , the light function stopped working after less than a week . I will continue to use the clock but have to turn light on to see the time at night . It 's a shame that nobody makes a decent , compact , SILENT running travel alarm anymore . : -LRB-
 Costume is a lighter tan not brown like Barnery Rubble . When I put it on it matched the color of my light skin and made me look naked . The image on amazon makes the costume look darker than it really is . I give it 2 stars because it actually did fit me . The Extra Large size was perfect for my 6 ' 2 '' body but the color was way off . I ended up spray painting it brown to look like like the actual Barney Rubble .
 I got a Large timbuk2 and from the rides i 've taken it on , it is n't very comfortable . I got a strap pad , hoping this would fix the problem but it still persists . When i bought the bag it did n't come with the strap pad or a cross strap but from carrying a chrome citizen messenger bag and this , the chrome definitely beats it in at area of comfortability . The one plus is that it definitely is very roomy .
 The Timbuk 2 Classic Messenger Bag is a very roomy bag . The large can fit a ton of Stuff . Unfortunately the strap is very uncomfortable.The 2 '' wide strap cuts my shoulder when the bag is loaded . The strap is also sewn on to one end which prevented me from replacing it with something more comfortable . So it sits in the corner ; looks nice but not very functionable .

 I got this vest from my wife as a gift , so I should n't be looking a gift horse in the mouth . Maybe that 's OK , as my comments are not directed at her , but to possible future buyers.I 've had other vests , so I 've had time to develop a very strong opinion about features that I like and do n't . This vest does n't meet up with some of the basics that I am used to enjoying with my years old Gap vest.First of all , the fleece is quite thin and porous and thus not warm in a breeze , so I do n't wear it outside much . The large arm holes do n't help there either.The zipper is only one way , i.e. , it does n't open up from the bottom . To me that is a major inconvenience as I ca n't adjust the bottom when I am sitting or driving . With the slightly longer cut , the vest ends up bunching up around my waist . I also have to undo the zipper completely or yank the bottom of the vest halfway up my waist if I have to pull down the zipper in my pants to go to the bathroom.My major problem , however , is with the cut . The middle has a lot of fabric and wo n't lay flat over my chest and stomach . It finally occurred to me that it is actually perfect for someone with a medium pot belly , but that 's not me.My final complaint is with the pocket zipper , they go down to close . If you do n't zip it fully , small things like change or keys , will fall out.Overall , the design feels like there was a lack of thought throughout . Maybe they turned a junior designer loose on this item.Since I won ; t be returning the vest , it 'll get demoted to workshop duty .
 This is the sleeveless version of the Steen 's Mountain jacket . Runs a size big -LRB- 5 ' 7 '' 160 lbs , small was loose -RRB- . No drawcord in hem is less than stellar . Useless against wind . I 'm having to edit my review because the stitching is coming loose around the bottom of the zipper . It 's not only fraying , it 's also interfering with the zipper operation . I hope Amazon will take it back .
 got a medium and it 's more like an xl and the material is a little flimsy

 I have a columbia vest from a few years ago , and this one is a FRAUD ... paper thin , DO NOT get suckered into buying these cheap imitations !!!!!
 We 've purchased a number of these vest over the past few years and we actually had to return this one because the quality of the material was so poor . It was very thin and flimsy . The collar would n't stand up as it should because the material was so thin . Very dissapointed .
 I am 5 '11 and 154 pound . Even I select M size , but it 's still too big for me . Seems it built for a guy has 6 ' 3 and 200 pound .
 collar is too big , the length is too long and fit is very loose , not what I was expecting . from the photo it looks different .
 I always bought the Columbia items and will continue , but this item is the worst I ever have seen . I saw the picture and never hesitated to get the item . Well , today I got it and when I opened my jaws dropped . This is thinner than a handkerchief I believe . Never rely on the picture you see . It was my fault that I never consaulted with some customers and when I sent mails to Columbia , they never replied . This is a no-good vest !!!!!
 I bought this item from Amazon at a good price , but when it arrived it was short and blousy ... too wide , yet too short . It 's a shame because the materials are typical Columbia excellence .
 I 've worn Columbia fleece for years , and their vests are a particular favorite because they are so versatile . I 've loved the quality and the details in the design . However , this Cathedral vest falls woefully short in both those categories . First of all , there is NO DRAWSTRING at the bottom , and that is an essential for the fit and warmth of a vest ... the bottom just hangs open and the drape of the garment just does n't work without that simple elastic drawstring . Further , the workmanship is n't any better than the no-name brands available for half the price , and the material is thin and insufficient . Not up to Columbia 's very high -LRB- and usual -RRB- standard . Wish I could get my money back . Try again , Amazon .
 Does not seal good . so pollens and dust gets in from the edge of it.And it is too ridiculs to wear outside .

 This review is for the Fruit of the Loom V-neck Tee shirt.Horrible , horrible product . Fabric is so thin you can see right through it . Yellowed and dingy colored . Ugh.My worst online purchase this year .
 I have worn FTL shirts for many years.This batch was disappointing because they shrunk a lot after a couple of washes . We do n't use hot water to wash cloths so that is n't the reason and I have been losing weight , not gaining of late . So it has to be the shirts themselves.I am hoping I just got a bad batch of shirts and FTL is n't using poorer weaving techniques.But I would advise you to maybe order your shirts one size larger than normal . If they do n't shrink like these did you can always wash them in hotter water so they shrink down to your regular size but if they do shrink without being washed in hot water , they should still feel like they are the right size .
 It didnt take long to ship . . but when i receieved the package all my expectations fell to the floor it was way to thin . . i used to buy vnecks from fruit of the loom , long time ago and it was way thicker , they need to start selling those again . .
 The shirts were bigger than i anticipated for a medium to be . If I had known they were so huge i would have ordered small instead . I workout , am 5 ' 11 '' and 185 lbs and these were so roomy even the nects folded .
 Frankly I was disappointed with the quality of a `` Fruit of the Loom '' product . I expected a better texture . Guess that 's what one should expect of imported goods . My bad I guess ...
 Received message on the 9th of February in regards to my return . It is now the 23rd of March and I have not received an email in regards to when the funds will be transfered to my account . ThanksDianna Harvey

 I have several cashmere wraps they are all thicker and warm . I knew this was going to be thinner the cost told me that but I can see through the single thread weave . It is usable as a scarf where it is bunched up , but do n't think you can use it as a wrap .
 I do n't what is pashmina but I am sure it is not cashmere . The product 's quality is no good . It looks cheap !

 I agree with the reviews that say sizing is way off . It is tiny ! Also , very different from the advertised picture . Probably about one tenth of the toole . Looks more like a purple skirt with a few small pieces of toole aroung the waist that isnt even as long as the lining ! Looks straggly and cheap . I 'm going to have to purchase tool and do some sewing before Halloween !
 I was so excited about getting a coin purse . Especially one that was handmade . I 'm upset because I received a plain old black and white one which was n't even in the picture . It also felt a little weird because I 'm black . Also I ca n't ever seem to get this thing open . I try extremely hard and it takes me about 12 tried to open it . It would really help if they let you atleast describe what you want like say you want it colorful or not plain or something like that .

 They described the shirt as a Large ADULT and it was actually for a child . It was very disappointing . However they were quick with the refunds and returns
 From the photos , it appeared the balaclava was relatively thick , form fitted , and well made , but what I received did n't come close . The material was thin , pilled , and baggy . The closure over the face was stretched out , flaring out about 2 '' around the nose . And the mouth piece did not come close to aligning properly - it rested around my chin . Returned it the next day for a full refund , then bought a different one at a local Kohls . The ZANheadgear sounds good , and the velcro closure is an attractive selling point , but its quality is not up to par .
 It is certainly warm enough although the mesh opening around the mouth allows a fair amount of wind chill to the lips . The down vent over the nose is not formed so it allows the escaping breath to rise and fog glasses/goggles . The velcro closure is bunched and is somewhat difficult to align and seal . It is fairly tight , if you have a large head like me , and that also makes it a little difficult to adjust . It took weeks for me to gt this item as it did not ship on the date promised from the manufacturer . If you are looking for high functionality and to get a balaclava in a hurry you should look at one of the more expensive options .
 Inside edging of seems opened already , materal rubs head and is uncomfortable .

 The only reason it sucked cause I didnt even recieve it all , not even on holloween .
 Bought this for my husband 's birthday . I was appalled to find out , by reading the warning label , that it contains lead and can cause cancer , birth defects and reproductive problems . It also says to wash your hands after handling . I returned it but had to pay the return fee myself . Not feeling too warm and fuzzy about this purchase !
 I got a Large timbuk2 and from the rides i 've taken it on , it is n't very comfortable . I got a strap pad , hoping this would fix the problem but it still persists . When i bought the bag it did n't come with the strap pad or a cross strap but from carrying a chrome citizen messenger bag and this , the chrome definitely beats it in at area of comfortability . The one plus is that it definitely is very roomy .
 The Timbuk 2 Classic Messenger Bag is a very roomy bag . The large can fit a ton of Stuff . Unfortunately the strap is very uncomfortable.The 2 '' wide strap cuts my shoulder when the bag is loaded . The strap is also sewn on to one end which prevented me from replacing it with something more comfortable . So it sits in the corner ; looks nice but not very functionable .
 I ordered two Kid 's Long Sleeve Royal blue Rash Guard shirts in large for a slender son . They were absolutely sized incorrectly and he could barely get into them . These were a birthday gift so it was really a shame . Then when I returned them they charged a restocking fee . So , they made the shirts too small and then charge a fee.I will not order from this company again .

 The GOOD
 Cute costume for little girls but the quality is very low . An `` ear '' fell off the headband after 1minute of wear - and would n't go back on with fabric glue . Try figuring that out racing out the door to a party ! Not good !
 I have worn the 517 for over twenty five years and Levi 's exclusively over 50 years . Two years ago , the cut changed and all 517 's were relaxed fit . Send back and change size because they were too big . SO I ordered the same thing but now 517 's are `` slim cut '' . Does n't work on me , I need some extra room . Now the number is 557 for the relaxed fit and I get to pay the postage to return the wrong cut jeans . Shame on Levi 's
 Quality is no longer the same and the fit varies from wich country it is made and the mood of that worker that day !!! One day hopefully we 'll start making are own merchandise like the old days , with quality and pride !!!
 DO NOT buy new 517s if you are looking for the slim , fitted , look of the classic Levi 's 517 . That 's been left in the dust . Apparently Levi 's thinks only fat people wear jeans now.These jeans have so much extra fabric it 's almost comical . I bought a pair online , set the jeans out on the floor , and even with a 29 waist , there is so much extra fabric they look like women 's jeans ! It 's like they have room for hips or something.Gimme a break , someone who buys 517 's is not going for the baggy gangster look , they 're 517s !!! Thoroughly disappointed with the direction Levi 's have taken the fit of their jeans , I will never buy a pair again.Don ' t be fooled by the other reviews that say these have a classic fit . They have a baggy , frumpy , ` modern ' couch potato fit .
 I ordered a pair of 517 jeans using a size I had used for years . The jeans mailed to me showed the size on the Levi 's patch , however they were several inches too long and the waist was much wider than normal . This was definitely not the size stated on the label.Very frustrating , especially after we were eagerly anticipating their arrival 2 weeks after the order was placed . I hesitate to mail-order jeans again after this experience .
 Great product . Communication was lacking . Amazon website indicated 2 pair were available at time of purchase . When they were not received in a timely fashion -LRB- ordered for a birthday present -RRB- , I initiated communication with G&L Clothing . They stated the merchandise was out of stock & had to be ordered . I will buy this product again , but not from this company . They should have been proactive in notifying me of the backorder issue instead of remaining silent .
 I feel disappointed with this product levi 's , in many occasions I have bought this brand of jeans in my country and for amazon and I never had problems with the heights , they all have come perfect , but this product not come correctly , my height is 34x 32 though these trousers have this marked height , is not correctly . this one is too small and I have others identical of the same height and model and I still have them excellent , I feel disappointed by this purchase . I have ten jeans of the same brand of diverse models 34x32 and I still have them correct , this one not . The height marked in this jeans is not real .
 I should definitely have heeded the warnings of others . I ordered a pair of the 517s and upon receiving them , was rather dismayed that indeed the length was way off . Upon measurement , the inseam is 31.5 &#34; instead of the 30 &#34; that I ordered , and what the jean claims to be . Back to Amazon it goes . Such is the QA of a global brand . People have been fired for way less.The search for the perfect fit continues .
 Tags on clothing say 29 &#34; length . They are 30 1/2 &#34; so I have to hem them . According to Levi 's website they do not have a 29 &#34; length so ?
 When the Chinese bought-out Levi Strauss & Co. they surrendered the quality of the Levi brand to history . Levi is not now or will they ever return to being the best pants money can buy . Shame , Shame , Shame on Levi Strauss & Co. . Levis are not even of high enough quality to be considered `` suckfull '' . Levis are now just another company making highly generic clothes from China , Honduras , Bangladesh , or wherever ...
 The length is way off . I have 30L with shorter legs . Other than that they would be OK I guess . But I would n't have bought them if I knew the length was a lie .
 they were too long and did n't fit the waist as advertized . the price was okay and the delivery was fine . overall , i was disappointed and would not repeat my order .
 The pants are not true to size.Nor was it medium it was light color . They are too long . Not 36x29 . More like 36x30May I return for exchange ? The darker colorIndigo are true to size not stonewash.We are not satisfied with merchandise.Please send Return Label for exchange.Thank you.alfredawhtd@gmail.com
 In the same order I purchased these and another pair of Levi 's jeans , in a dfferent cut . Both pairs were ordered in the same size . The other pair fit fine , just like every other pair of jeans that I 've ordered in this size . These jeans , however , were about three sizes too small . I double checked every tag just to make sure they were n't improperly labeled , but according to every tag and sticker on the jeans , they were the size I had ordered . Ever since my favorite cut of Levi 's -LRB- 569 -RRB- have been changed , it 's been hard to find a good pair of jeans . Thankfully Amazon offers free returns , back to the warehouse these go !
 too baggy . The wwrong side was received . I need 40 X 34 and received 42 X 34 . I washed them -LRB- I wash all new clothes before wearing -RRB- and then found them to be too large . I Looked at the size tag and saw it saying 42 X 34 . I re-ordered the correct size which fits right . I guess I am stuck with the fat pants .
 This was the worst pair of jeans I have ever bought in my life . The specs implied that it would fit on one 's waist , however with the crotch being so short it barely reached my hips . I normally wear waist size 31 , which I ordered , but with this pair of jeans , the zipper almost could not go up . In addition , I am not a person with large legs , but this pair of jeans hugged me like it was made for a woman who wants to show off her assets . I would have returned my purchase , but where I am living it would cost double what the jeans are worth , so I will just have to accept my losses .
 this pair of jeans did not fit as expected . THEY LOOK REALLY BAD ON ME . I would like to send them back .
 I ordered stone washed jeans because I like the look and feel , I was sent regular blue jeans . Because I needed pants now not later I kept them but I 'm not happy ! As usual the jeans are good they are Levi 's after all but NOT what I paid for . ARE YOU EITHER COLOR BLIND OR ILLITTERATE AT AMAZON NOW . M.S.
 I had ordered Levis jeans before , and the sizes fits always perfect , in this case this jeans were suppose to be a 34 waist 30 long ... but it looks like a 32 or 34 long .
 I ordered 4 jeans , 34 size each , the Boot Cut is 1 size smaller than the 505 Straight Fit I also purchased in same order .
 I ordered 2 pair in the rinsed color , they have a very strong chemical odor that only got stronger after washing them . I am returning them .
 I am not fat by any means . I am in fact built . Both pairs ripped in the seat after 3 months . Beware when buying them . Levis boot cut jeans .
 I am a long time fan of Levi 's but this company is all over the place . I can not understand how there numerical style system works because it is almost meaningless . I got these and the waist was too big , thighs too small and boot cut seems to be almost more of a bell bottom look rather than having room for boots . I then got a size smaller locally of the 514 straight fit and they were almost the exact same overall , including the boot area . So if your waist measures 34 with a measuring tape , this 34 is too large and 33 in the 514 is also too large . However , the thighs are tight in both so I figure a 32 -LRB- which possibly might actually measure 34 -RRB- is probably going to looking like skinny jeans . because the thighs will be too small . So good luck with all that .
 I bought these jeans for my husband at Christmas . I knew that they would be stiff when I got them , and they were new so that is OK . But the first few times these have been washed , inside out or right-side out , they have faded and have horrible crease marks in the jeans , like the starch that was in them when they were new was just too much . I am disappointed in these jeans . After 6 washings they have weird lines on them and I can not get them to go away . My advice , do n't get the RIGID rinse . .
 ordered 32 inch length . first pair was 4 &#34; too long . recieved a replacement pair and they were 2 &#34; too long . poor quality control on this product
 This is terrible ! I am upset and disappointed!I ordered a pair of 517 jeans using a size . The jeans mailed to me showed the size on the Levi 's patch , however they were several inches too long and the waist was much wider than normal . This was definitely not the size stated on the label.Very frustrating , especially after we were eagerly anticipating their arrival I hesitate to mail-order jeans again after this experience .
 Will not shop with this vendor again . I ordered 2 pair of jeans . After washing them to shrink , they were still 3 inches too long . CLOTHING TAGS DID NOT MATCH the actual size . I 'm a guy , I build houses but ca n't sew , so now I have to pay a seamstress . Vendor sucks , but Amazon was good about the whole thing.Dano .
 The length is soo long that it bunches at the bottom and drags on the ground .
 Received jeans . Color was correct but it was clearly marked `` slim '' and my son needed a regular.It was clearly marked on all packaging that it was slim but never said so on the website and he wore them anyway to an event so I could n't return . Waste of $ 40
 I am a size 30x32 and buy alot of jeans . I also carry a concealed weapin in my waistband and for the most part , never have a problem with any other jeans . These jeans , however were so tight that i could barely button them even without my weaponi on me .
 Purchased Two Pair Of Jeans Only Got One . Was Told They Only Had One Pair And Never Heard Another Word But Got Charged For Two Pair .
 Ive been wearing Levi 's over 40 years . These are not the same old Levi 's ! The fit is baggy , the sizing is not consistant , I bought 2 pair and they fit and wear are totally different . Probably wo n't buy any levi products again
 ever since levi changed from being american made to being overseas made . . mostly in china THEY HAVE NO WORTH , the fabric is not half as tough as it used to be , the cut has changed and by doing so made it ten times worse then it was a few years ago , levi used to be my number one favorite brand to buy jean wise . . now it makes me just sad to look at them . they are poor excuses for jeans , the belt loops break off in a matter of weeks the zippers are weaker , and the sizing is complete bogus . everything is pretty much unprofessional and all they seem to care about now is mass production to make more money , instead of making a decent product to sell to customers , im sorry to say this levi but it has to be said , your products have been horrible over the last few years . your relaxed bootcut jeans of the early 2000 's were the BEST now you cant find them anywhere . so unless you go back to that exact fashion OR you make something just as good if not better then your old products you have lost a very loyal customer of 20 years . STOP just caring about making money and not caring about how well you make yoru products . carhartt has become my go to because atleast they care about if something holds together for more then a month .
 These glasses are sold in a manner that suggests they are marked down , but they are clearly only worth the lower price . Once you figure in the shipping cost -LRB- almost equal to the item price -RRB- they are n't worth it . Also , bear in mind that they may not fit you since you do n't have the ability to try on an online purchase -LRB- mine do n't fit -RRB- . And , in person , they are less round than they appear in the photo . My advice ? Go buy some cheapo sunglasses at a store where you can at least see them on you first .

 I feel disappointed with this product levi 's , in many occasions I have bought this brand of jeans in my country and for amazon and I never had problems with the heights , they all have come perfect , but this product not come correctly , my height is 34x 32 though these trousers have this marked height , is not correctly . this one is too small and I have others identical of the same height and model and I still have them excellent , I feel disappointed by this purchase . I have ten jeans of the same brand of diverse models 34x32 and I still have them correct , this one not . The height marked in this jeans is not real .
 I am a long time fan of Levi 's but this company is all over the place . I can not understand how there numerical style system works because it is almost meaningless . I got these and the waist was too big , thighs too small and boot cut seems to be almost more of a bell bottom look rather than having room for boots . I then got a size smaller locally of the 514 straight fit and they were almost the exact same overall , including the boot area . So if your waist measures 34 with a measuring tape , this 34 is too large and 33 in the 514 is also too large . However , the thighs are tight in both so I figure a 32 -LRB- which possibly might actually measure 34 -RRB- is probably going to looking like skinny jeans . because the thighs will be too small . So good luck with all that .
 I have worn the 517 for over twenty five years and Levi 's exclusively over 50 years . Two years ago , the cut changed and all 517 's were relaxed fit . Send back and change size because they were too big . SO I ordered the same thing but now 517 's are `` slim cut '' . Does n't work on me , I need some extra room . Now the number is 557 for the relaxed fit and I get to pay the postage to return the wrong cut jeans . Shame on Levi 's
 DO NOT buy new 517s if you are looking for the slim , fitted , look of the classic Levi 's 517 . That 's been left in the dust . Apparently Levi 's thinks only fat people wear jeans now.These jeans have so much extra fabric it 's almost comical . I bought a pair online , set the jeans out on the floor , and even with a 29 waist , there is so much extra fabric they look like women 's jeans ! It 's like they have room for hips or something.Gimme a break , someone who buys 517 's is not going for the baggy gangster look , they 're 517s !!! Thoroughly disappointed with the direction Levi 's have taken the fit of their jeans , I will never buy a pair again.Don ' t be fooled by the other reviews that say these have a classic fit . They have a baggy , frumpy , ` modern ' couch potato fit .
 Quality is no longer the same and the fit varies from wich country it is made and the mood of that worker that day !!! One day hopefully we 'll start making are own merchandise like the old days , with quality and pride !!!
 I ordered a pair of 517 jeans using a size I had used for years . The jeans mailed to me showed the size on the Levi 's patch , however they were several inches too long and the waist was much wider than normal . This was definitely not the size stated on the label.Very frustrating , especially after we were eagerly anticipating their arrival 2 weeks after the order was placed . I hesitate to mail-order jeans again after this experience .
 ever since levi changed from being american made to being overseas made . . mostly in china THEY HAVE NO WORTH , the fabric is not half as tough as it used to be , the cut has changed and by doing so made it ten times worse then it was a few years ago , levi used to be my number one favorite brand to buy jean wise . . now it makes me just sad to look at them . they are poor excuses for jeans , the belt loops break off in a matter of weeks the zippers are weaker , and the sizing is complete bogus . everything is pretty much unprofessional and all they seem to care about now is mass production to make more money , instead of making a decent product to sell to customers , im sorry to say this levi but it has to be said , your products have been horrible over the last few years . your relaxed bootcut jeans of the early 2000 's were the BEST now you cant find them anywhere . so unless you go back to that exact fashion OR you make something just as good if not better then your old products you have lost a very loyal customer of 20 years . STOP just caring about making money and not caring about how well you make yoru products . carhartt has become my go to because atleast they care about if something holds together for more then a month .
 I had ordered Levis jeans before , and the sizes fits always perfect , in this case this jeans were suppose to be a 34 waist 30 long ... but it looks like a 32 or 34 long .
 this pair of jeans did not fit as expected . THEY LOOK REALLY BAD ON ME . I would like to send them back .
 I ordered stone washed jeans because I like the look and feel , I was sent regular blue jeans . Because I needed pants now not later I kept them but I 'm not happy ! As usual the jeans are good they are Levi 's after all but NOT what I paid for . ARE YOU EITHER COLOR BLIND OR ILLITTERATE AT AMAZON NOW . M.S.
 The length is soo long that it bunches at the bottom and drags on the ground .
 too baggy . The wwrong side was received . I need 40 X 34 and received 42 X 34 . I washed them -LRB- I wash all new clothes before wearing -RRB- and then found them to be too large . I Looked at the size tag and saw it saying 42 X 34 . I re-ordered the correct size which fits right . I guess I am stuck with the fat pants .
 Will not shop with this vendor again . I ordered 2 pair of jeans . After washing them to shrink , they were still 3 inches too long . CLOTHING TAGS DID NOT MATCH the actual size . I 'm a guy , I build houses but ca n't sew , so now I have to pay a seamstress . Vendor sucks , but Amazon was good about the whole thing.Dano .
 In the same order I purchased these and another pair of Levi 's jeans , in a dfferent cut . Both pairs were ordered in the same size . The other pair fit fine , just like every other pair of jeans that I 've ordered in this size . These jeans , however , were about three sizes too small . I double checked every tag just to make sure they were n't improperly labeled , but according to every tag and sticker on the jeans , they were the size I had ordered . Ever since my favorite cut of Levi 's -LRB- 569 -RRB- have been changed , it 's been hard to find a good pair of jeans . Thankfully Amazon offers free returns , back to the warehouse these go !
 I bought these jeans for my husband at Christmas . I knew that they would be stiff when I got them , and they were new so that is OK . But the first few times these have been washed , inside out or right-side out , they have faded and have horrible crease marks in the jeans , like the starch that was in them when they were new was just too much . I am disappointed in these jeans . After 6 washings they have weird lines on them and I can not get them to go away . My advice , do n't get the RIGID rinse . .
 ordered 32 inch length . first pair was 4 &#34; too long . recieved a replacement pair and they were 2 &#34; too long . poor quality control on this product
 This is terrible ! I am upset and disappointed!I ordered a pair of 517 jeans using a size . The jeans mailed to me showed the size on the Levi 's patch , however they were several inches too long and the waist was much wider than normal . This was definitely not the size stated on the label.Very frustrating , especially after we were eagerly anticipating their arrival I hesitate to mail-order jeans again after this experience .
 I am not fat by any means . I am in fact built . Both pairs ripped in the seat after 3 months . Beware when buying them . Levis boot cut jeans .
 I 'm 5 ' 11 &#34; 185 lbs , muscular build . It took effort to stuff my thighs and bits into these , leaving me uncomfortable throughout the day . Luckily I was able to find a friend these worked for .
 they were too long and did n't fit the waist as advertized . the price was okay and the delivery was fine . overall , i was disappointed and would not repeat my order .
 The pants are not true to size.Nor was it medium it was light color . They are too long . Not 36x29 . More like 36x30May I return for exchange ? The darker colorIndigo are true to size not stonewash.We are not satisfied with merchandise.Please send Return Label for exchange.Thank you.alfredawhtd@gmail.com
 When the Chinese bought-out Levi Strauss & Co. they surrendered the quality of the Levi brand to history . Levi is not now or will they ever return to being the best pants money can buy . Shame , Shame , Shame on Levi Strauss & Co. . Levis are not even of high enough quality to be considered `` suckfull '' . Levis are now just another company making highly generic clothes from China , Honduras , Bangladesh , or wherever ...
 The length is way off . I have 30L with shorter legs . Other than that they would be OK I guess . But I would n't have bought them if I knew the length was a lie .
 This was the worst pair of jeans I have ever bought in my life . The specs implied that it would fit on one 's waist , however with the crotch being so short it barely reached my hips . I normally wear waist size 31 , which I ordered , but with this pair of jeans , the zipper almost could not go up . In addition , I am not a person with large legs , but this pair of jeans hugged me like it was made for a woman who wants to show off her assets . I would have returned my purchase , but where I am living it would cost double what the jeans are worth , so I will just have to accept my losses .
 The length is soo long that it bunches at the bottom and drags on the ground .
 Received jeans . Color was correct but it was clearly marked `` slim '' and my son needed a regular.It was clearly marked on all packaging that it was slim but never said so on the website and he wore them anyway to an event so I could n't return . Waste of $ 40
 I am a size 30x32 and buy alot of jeans . I also carry a concealed weapin in my waistband and for the most part , never have a problem with any other jeans . These jeans , however were so tight that i could barely button them even without my weaponi on me .
 Purchased Two Pair Of Jeans Only Got One . Was Told They Only Had One Pair And Never Heard Another Word But Got Charged For Two Pair .

 Ive been wearing Levi 's over 40 years . These are not the same old Levi 's ! The fit is baggy , the sizing is not consistant , I bought 2 pair and they fit and wear are totally different . Probably wo n't buy any levi products again
 I ordered 4 jeans , 34 size each , the Boot Cut is 1 size smaller than the 505 Straight Fit I also purchased in same order .
 I ordered 2 pair in the rinsed color , they have a very strong chemical odor that only got stronger after washing them . I am returning them .

 Great product . Communication was lacking . Amazon website indicated 2 pair were available at time of purchase . When they were not received in a timely fashion -LRB- ordered for a birthday present -RRB- , I initiated communication with G&L Clothing . They stated the merchandise was out of stock & had to be ordered . I will buy this product again , but not from this company . They should have been proactive in notifying me of the backorder issue instead of remaining silent .

 Tags on clothing say 29 &#34; length . They are 30 1/2 &#34; so I have to hem them . According to Levi 's website they do not have a 29 &#34; length so ?

 I 've worn this bra for years and years . The last two bras I ordered have such a scratchy lining in the cup that I ca n't wear them without major irritation . I 've written Playtex but have n't heard . In the meantime , I 'm looking for a similar bra without the scratchy lining .
 I will be returning this product because it did not fit . From the picture it looked like it would but then when I took it out of the package , it did not .
 I think this bra is ok . There is nothing great or amazing about this bra . Its light . Thats it . But on to the interesting part . When I put this particular brazire on I 'm instantly transported to the 1950 's or at least my bosom is ! Why must I look like madonna in a cone bra?I do n't like it and after the 18 hours are up this bra becomes the most uncomfortable thing ever.Just do n't bother !
 I use to buy the Playtex Cross Your Heart bra all the time , then could n't find it anywhere , so I was glad to see it on Amazon . The size around and the cups fit ok . The problem is the straps , so much shorter than my other bras , which makes it very uncomfortable ! I did not have this problem before so maybe the current CYH bra is not made exactly like the ones I use to buy .
 I believe it is mis sized . I have used this brand for many years , but this was too tight to be comfortble .
 This has to be the most uncomfortable bra available . I would never recommend this bra . It is very very constricting .
 This bra was not what I ordered and it was totally unacceptable to me . It was cheap and scratchy . I sent it back .
 This bra has a good fit , supports nicely , and I like the lace detail . My biggest complaint is the matterial it is made of . The fabric is rough and itchy feeling and can be uncomfortable . For this reason I will be spending my money on a different Playtex bra in the future .
 I have used Playtex Cross your heart bras for years , and always took a size 36B . Compared to the ones i have , and the ones I ordered - the size is very different and no longer fits . I have returned them for an A cup and have not received my replacements from Rockin Sox at this time.Thank you for your attention .
 I have worn Cross Your Heart for years so was deeply disappointed in this style . It is a look that would be more at home in the 1960 's .
 I was surprised to open my UPS box and find a stiff , pre-shaped bust . From the description `` lightly lined '' and lack of underwire I assumed wrongly that this item would be a simple bralette-like bra , not a stiff-cupped bra . This may be good for someone with a larger bust , but I do n't recommend for anyone who likes bralette styles.Another problem I had with this bra was the uncomfortable fringe around the edges - apparently an effort to make it more frilly , but also a source of itching for those of us who do not like poking edges . If you look really closely at the most zoomed-in image available , you might be able to make out the fringe , if you 're looking for it .
 I never expected a Playtex bra to be so uncomfortable ! The cups are lightly lined with some thin mesh-like fabric that is very itchy ! I bought it for my 13-year-old daughter . She brought it back to me after trying it on and said , she just does n't like it . I tried to wear it myself , but I could n't handle the fabric . I ended up donating it to Goodwill.I prefer soft fabrics for a bra . The breast area is very sensitive and I ca n't stand to have a coarse , itchy bra on . I could n't imagine wearing it in the hot Atlanta summer , sweating and having that mesh clinging to me.If you do n't care about fabric , the bra was very well engineered otherwise . The cups had nice lift , even without an underwire . And the shoulder straps adjust in the front , so they are easier to reach . I would not buy it again , and I am glad I only paid $ 9.00 for it .
 Nice to find an inexpensive bra in size 32c that has straps centered on the cup
 I ordered 2 40D Cross your Heart bras . The band measurement was 31 &#34; . Guess I should have ordered a size 50D ??????? I could not believe the band measurement . Naturally , they did n't fit ----- you ca n't stuff 40 pounds of stuff into a 31 pound bag !!! I returned both and had no problem doing this and received my refund very promptly .
 This bra is very flimsy , you could probably punch a hole right through the side panels with your finger . It does n't provide enough support for me . The Playtex bra that I had been wearing for years was abruptly discontinued so I gave this one a try ... do n't like it at all .
 The way it fits in real life is not at all like the photo they use for the product . There are 3 levels of hooks when there should be 2 at maximum , and the cups are oversized . Their B-cup is like a C. Also , the straps are very wide , and the whole bra is cumbersome , uncomfortable , and unflattering .
 The picture was different when I ordered , so I thought I was getting more of a sports bra than this . It was uncomfortable and itchy and frumpy . I 'm not particularly well-endowed , so I do n't need a lot of support in my bras , which I 'm sure this one would offer . I just was n't right for me .
 Nice leather product by Royce , but the visible snaps cheapen the appearance . They make others without the gold snaps showing and that would be the way to go .
 I ordered these glasses as a Christmas gift and chose expedited shipping to be sure they would arrive in time . It is now January 4 , and still no glasses . I sent seven emails to Knife Depot , left two phone messages , and in return got one email message from customer service stating that they had no information available . I began requesting for the order to be cancelled and even that took several days for Knife Depot to accomplish . I still have not been given an explanation for why the item was never shipped or why the company failed on every level to answer my inquiries . Because Knife Depot cancelled the order themselves , I was unable to leave Seller Feedback . I 'd encourage shoppers to find this item , or a similar one , from another company .

 It was too small . I sent it back , still waiting the return of our money . Displeased .
 This bra is very lightweight and thin . It is comfortable but I would not call it a sports bra . It offers no support , and is so thin that you might as well not being wearing a bra , if you know what I mean .
 The photo of what I ordered and what I got were different items . I had ordered a pink ladies jacket and recieved a pink dolls jacket .
 I needed a pink ladies jacket for work . The jacket arrived with pink dolls on the back . Not only did I not have the item I needed for work but I was out all the shipping charges for the return . I was very disappointed .
 This was a From Me , To Me Christmas present . I wanted the very warm outdoor coverall and it is just that . Like all Carhartt it 's very well built , but the 44R I purchased did n't fit . I could n't raise my arms without the crotch cinching up . I went to a local store and tried on a 46Tall and I had the same problem . I was disappointed that I could n't find another size that would fit me so I ended up returning it to amazon .
 In the same order I purchased these and another pair of Levi 's jeans , in a dfferent cut . Both pairs were ordered in the same size . The other pair fit fine , just like every other pair of jeans that I 've ordered in this size . These jeans , however , were about three sizes too small . I double checked every tag just to make sure they were n't improperly labeled , but according to every tag and sticker on the jeans , they were the size I had ordered . Ever since my favorite cut of Levi 's -LRB- 569 -RRB- have been changed , it 's been hard to find a good pair of jeans . Thankfully Amazon offers free returns , back to the warehouse these go !
 I had ordered Levis jeans before , and the sizes fits always perfect , in this case this jeans were suppose to be a 34 waist 30 long ... but it looks like a 32 or 34 long .
 this pair of jeans did not fit as expected . THEY LOOK REALLY BAD ON ME . I would like to send them back .
 I ordered stone washed jeans because I like the look and feel , I was sent regular blue jeans . Because I needed pants now not later I kept them but I 'm not happy ! As usual the jeans are good they are Levi 's after all but NOT what I paid for . ARE YOU EITHER COLOR BLIND OR ILLITTERATE AT AMAZON NOW . M.S.
 The length is soo long that it bunches at the bottom and drags on the ground .
 ever since levi changed from being american made to being overseas made . . mostly in china THEY HAVE NO WORTH , the fabric is not half as tough as it used to be , the cut has changed and by doing so made it ten times worse then it was a few years ago , levi used to be my number one favorite brand to buy jean wise . . now it makes me just sad to look at them . they are poor excuses for jeans , the belt loops break off in a matter of weeks the zippers are weaker , and the sizing is complete bogus . everything is pretty much unprofessional and all they seem to care about now is mass production to make more money , instead of making a decent product to sell to customers , im sorry to say this levi but it has to be said , your products have been horrible over the last few years . your relaxed bootcut jeans of the early 2000 's were the BEST now you cant find them anywhere . so unless you go back to that exact fashion OR you make something just as good if not better then your old products you have lost a very loyal customer of 20 years . STOP just caring about making money and not caring about how well you make yoru products . carhartt has become my go to because atleast they care about if something holds together for more then a month .
 I have worn the 517 for over twenty five years and Levi 's exclusively over 50 years . Two years ago , the cut changed and all 517 's were relaxed fit . Send back and change size because they were too big . SO I ordered the same thing but now 517 's are `` slim cut '' . Does n't work on me , I need some extra room . Now the number is 557 for the relaxed fit and I get to pay the postage to return the wrong cut jeans . Shame on Levi 's
 DO NOT buy new 517s if you are looking for the slim , fitted , look of the classic Levi 's 517 . That 's been left in the dust . Apparently Levi 's thinks only fat people wear jeans now.These jeans have so much extra fabric it 's almost comical . I bought a pair online , set the jeans out on the floor , and even with a 29 waist , there is so much extra fabric they look like women 's jeans ! It 's like they have room for hips or something.Gimme a break , someone who buys 517 's is not going for the baggy gangster look , they 're 517s !!! Thoroughly disappointed with the direction Levi 's have taken the fit of their jeans , I will never buy a pair again.Don ' t be fooled by the other reviews that say these have a classic fit . They have a baggy , frumpy , ` modern ' couch potato fit .
 Quality is no longer the same and the fit varies from wich country it is made and the mood of that worker that day !!! One day hopefully we 'll start making are own merchandise like the old days , with quality and pride !!!
 I ordered a pair of 517 jeans using a size I had used for years . The jeans mailed to me showed the size on the Levi 's patch , however they were several inches too long and the waist was much wider than normal . This was definitely not the size stated on the label.Very frustrating , especially after we were eagerly anticipating their arrival 2 weeks after the order was placed . I hesitate to mail-order jeans again after this experience .
 Great product . Communication was lacking . Amazon website indicated 2 pair were available at time of purchase . When they were not received in a timely fashion -LRB- ordered for a birthday present -RRB- , I initiated communication with G&L Clothing . They stated the merchandise was out of stock & had to be ordered . I will buy this product again , but not from this company . They should have been proactive in notifying me of the backorder issue instead of remaining silent .
 I feel disappointed with this product levi 's , in many occasions I have bought this brand of jeans in my country and for amazon and I never had problems with the heights , they all have come perfect , but this product not come correctly , my height is 34x 32 though these trousers have this marked height , is not correctly . this one is too small and I have others identical of the same height and model and I still have them excellent , I feel disappointed by this purchase . I have ten jeans of the same brand of diverse models 34x32 and I still have them correct , this one not . The height marked in this jeans is not real .
 I am a long time fan of Levi 's but this company is all over the place . I can not understand how there numerical style system works because it is almost meaningless . I got these and the waist was too big , thighs too small and boot cut seems to be almost more of a bell bottom look rather than having room for boots . I then got a size smaller locally of the 514 straight fit and they were almost the exact same overall , including the boot area . So if your waist measures 34 with a measuring tape , this 34 is too large and 33 in the 514 is also too large . However , the thighs are tight in both so I figure a 32 -LRB- which possibly might actually measure 34 -RRB- is probably going to looking like skinny jeans . because the thighs will be too small . So good luck with all that .
 When the Chinese bought-out Levi Strauss & Co. they surrendered the quality of the Levi brand to history . Levi is not now or will they ever return to being the best pants money can buy . Shame , Shame , Shame on Levi Strauss & Co. . Levis are not even of high enough quality to be considered `` suckfull '' . Levis are now just another company making highly generic clothes from China , Honduras , Bangladesh , or wherever ...
 The length is way off . I have 30L with shorter legs . Other than that they would be OK I guess . But I would n't have bought them if I knew the length was a lie .
 This was the worst pair of jeans I have ever bought in my life . The specs implied that it would fit on one 's waist , however with the crotch being so short it barely reached my hips . I normally wear waist size 31 , which I ordered , but with this pair of jeans , the zipper almost could not go up . In addition , I am not a person with large legs , but this pair of jeans hugged me like it was made for a woman who wants to show off her assets . I would have returned my purchase , but where I am living it would cost double what the jeans are worth , so I will just have to accept my losses .
 I 'm 5 ' 11 &#34; 185 lbs , muscular build . It took effort to stuff my thighs and bits into these , leaving me uncomfortable throughout the day . Luckily I was able to find a friend these worked for .
 they were too long and did n't fit the waist as advertized . the price was okay and the delivery was fine . overall , i was disappointed and would not repeat my order .
 The pants are not true to size.Nor was it medium it was light color . They are too long . Not 36x29 . More like 36x30May I return for exchange ? The darker colorIndigo are true to size not stonewash.We are not satisfied with merchandise.Please send Return Label for exchange.Thank you.alfredawhtd@gmail.com
 I am not fat by any means . I am in fact built . Both pairs ripped in the seat after 3 months . Beware when buying them . Levis boot cut jeans .
 I bought these jeans for my husband at Christmas . I knew that they would be stiff when I got them , and they were new so that is OK . But the first few times these have been washed , inside out or right-side out , they have faded and have horrible crease marks in the jeans , like the starch that was in them when they were new was just too much . I am disappointed in these jeans . After 6 washings they have weird lines on them and I can not get them to go away . My advice , do n't get the RIGID rinse . .
 ordered 32 inch length . first pair was 4 &#34; too long . recieved a replacement pair and they were 2 &#34; too long . poor quality control on this product
 This is terrible ! I am upset and disappointed!I ordered a pair of 517 jeans using a size . The jeans mailed to me showed the size on the Levi 's patch , however they were several inches too long and the waist was much wider than normal . This was definitely not the size stated on the label.Very frustrating , especially after we were eagerly anticipating their arrival I hesitate to mail-order jeans again after this experience .
 Received jeans . Color was correct but it was clearly marked `` slim '' and my son needed a regular.It was clearly marked on all packaging that it was slim but never said so on the website and he wore them anyway to an event so I could n't return . Waste of $ 40
 I am a size 30x32 and buy alot of jeans . I also carry a concealed weapin in my waistband and for the most part , never have a problem with any other jeans . These jeans , however were so tight that i could barely button them even without my weaponi on me .
 Purchased Two Pair Of Jeans Only Got One . Was Told They Only Had One Pair And Never Heard Another Word But Got Charged For Two Pair .
 Ive been wearing Levi 's over 40 years . These are not the same old Levi 's ! The fit is baggy , the sizing is not consistant , I bought 2 pair and they fit and wear are totally different . Probably wo n't buy any levi products again
 I ordered 4 jeans , 34 size each , the Boot Cut is 1 size smaller than the 505 Straight Fit I also purchased in same order .
 I ordered 2 pair in the rinsed color , they have a very strong chemical odor that only got stronger after washing them . I am returning them .
 Will not shop with this vendor again . I ordered 2 pair of jeans . After washing them to shrink , they were still 3 inches too long . CLOTHING TAGS DID NOT MATCH the actual size . I 'm a guy , I build houses but ca n't sew , so now I have to pay a seamstress . Vendor sucks , but Amazon was good about the whole thing.Dano .
 too baggy . The wwrong side was received . I need 40 X 34 and received 42 X 34 . I washed them -LRB- I wash all new clothes before wearing -RRB- and then found them to be too large . I Looked at the size tag and saw it saying 42 X 34 . I re-ordered the correct size which fits right . I guess I am stuck with the fat pants .
 Do n't get caught short - lol - When you order these 505 shorts check your cart before you hit checkout - it will say 550 relaxed fit etc. . but I ordered 505 ?????? Thanks to the reveiew before me I did n't fall for this - my legs look real skinny in 550 's = lol
 it cost twice as much as I later saw it sold elsewhere at regular price
 Disappointed with this product , it is big and shapeless . Not something to wear if you want a little pick-me-up . Will not be taking this to the hospital with me . Material is very soft though . ''
 I wish there had been better photos of this gown posted . The one we see is of a beautiful blonde sitting down in a rocker with a baby . What we need to see is a photo of a pregnant mother standing up wearing the gown . The only good thing I can say about this gown is that the fabric is soft . However , it is just a long , shapeless hospital gown that happens to tie in the front instead of in the back . I feel like a frumpy old lady when I put it on . I ca n't see myself wearing this nightgown during labor or after giving birth . It should be sold as a front tie muu muu . -LRB- I take that back , at least muu muus have more shape than this gown . -RRB- I regret not reading all the reviews before buying this item . According to one review if I want to return it , I can expect to return the item at a lo $ $ . Do n't make the same mistake I made . Save your money .
 When I bought the product it did not have size options ... so I thought it must be one size fits all . This gown is way too big for me and I weight 170 pounds and am 5.4 '' in my 7th month of Pregnancy . It would fit two of me . Otherwise there is nothing wrong with the gown . The quality is good . But I will have to return the product .
 I will be returning this product because it did not fit . From the picture it looked like it would but then when I took it out of the package , it did not .
 I think this bra is ok . There is nothing great or amazing about this bra . Its light . Thats it . But on to the interesting part . When I put this particular brazire on I 'm instantly transported to the 1950 's or at least my bosom is ! Why must I look like madonna in a cone bra?I do n't like it and after the 18 hours are up this bra becomes the most uncomfortable thing ever.Just do n't bother !
 I use to buy the Playtex Cross Your Heart bra all the time , then could n't find it anywhere , so I was glad to see it on Amazon . The size around and the cups fit ok . The problem is the straps , so much shorter than my other bras , which makes it very uncomfortable ! I did not have this problem before so maybe the current CYH bra is not made exactly like the ones I use to buy .
 I believe it is mis sized . I have used this brand for many years , but this was too tight to be comfortble .
 This has to be the most uncomfortable bra available . I would never recommend this bra . It is very very constricting .
 I 've worn this bra for years and years . The last two bras I ordered have such a scratchy lining in the cup that I ca n't wear them without major irritation . I 've written Playtex but have n't heard . In the meantime , I 'm looking for a similar bra without the scratchy lining .
 I never expected a Playtex bra to be so uncomfortable ! The cups are lightly lined with some thin mesh-like fabric that is very itchy ! I bought it for my 13-year-old daughter . She brought it back to me after trying it on and said , she just does n't like it . I tried to wear it myself , but I could n't handle the fabric . I ended up donating it to Goodwill.I prefer soft fabrics for a bra . The breast area is very sensitive and I ca n't stand to have a coarse , itchy bra on . I could n't imagine wearing it in the hot Atlanta summer , sweating and having that mesh clinging to me.If you do n't care about fabric , the bra was very well engineered otherwise . The cups had nice lift , even without an underwire . And the shoulder straps adjust in the front , so they are easier to reach . I would not buy it again , and I am glad I only paid $ 9.00 for it .
 I ordered 2 40D Cross your Heart bras . The band measurement was 31 &#34; . Guess I should have ordered a size 50D ??????? I could not believe the band measurement . Naturally , they did n't fit ----- you ca n't stuff 40 pounds of stuff into a 31 pound bag !!! I returned both and had no problem doing this and received my refund very promptly .
 This bra is very flimsy , you could probably punch a hole right through the side panels with your finger . It does n't provide enough support for me . The Playtex bra that I had been wearing for years was abruptly discontinued so I gave this one a try ... do n't like it at all .
 The picture was different when I ordered , so I thought I was getting more of a sports bra than this . It was uncomfortable and itchy and frumpy . I 'm not particularly well-endowed , so I do n't need a lot of support in my bras , which I 'm sure this one would offer . I just was n't right for me .
 This bra was not what I ordered and it was totally unacceptable to me . It was cheap and scratchy . I sent it back .
 This bra has a good fit , supports nicely , and I like the lace detail . My biggest complaint is the matterial it is made of . The fabric is rough and itchy feeling and can be uncomfortable . For this reason I will be spending my money on a different Playtex bra in the future .
 I have used Playtex Cross your heart bras for years , and always took a size 36B . Compared to the ones i have , and the ones I ordered - the size is very different and no longer fits . I have returned them for an A cup and have not received my replacements from Rockin Sox at this time.Thank you for your attention .
 I have worn Cross Your Heart for years so was deeply disappointed in this style . It is a look that would be more at home in the 1960 's .
 I was surprised to open my UPS box and find a stiff , pre-shaped bust . From the description `` lightly lined '' and lack of underwire I assumed wrongly that this item would be a simple bralette-like bra , not a stiff-cupped bra . This may be good for someone with a larger bust , but I do n't recommend for anyone who likes bralette styles.Another problem I had with this bra was the uncomfortable fringe around the edges - apparently an effort to make it more frilly , but also a source of itching for those of us who do not like poking edges . If you look really closely at the most zoomed-in image available , you might be able to make out the fringe , if you 're looking for it .
 The way it fits in real life is not at all like the photo they use for the product . There are 3 levels of hooks when there should be 2 at maximum , and the cups are oversized . Their B-cup is like a C. Also , the straps are very wide , and the whole bra is cumbersome , uncomfortable , and unflattering .
 Do n't get caught short - lol - When you order these 505 shorts check your cart before you hit checkout - it will say 550 relaxed fit etc. . but I ordered 505 ?????? Thanks to the reveiew before me I did n't fall for this - my legs look real skinny in 550 's = lol

I was disappointed that I could n't find another size that would fit me so I ended up returning it to amazon .
 This costume looked most attractive in the catalogue pix . The fabric is cheap looking . It is constantly creased , and it looks like it will fall apart after a few washings . I did not return it because I needed it for a special event . I do not think I will deal with that company in the future .

I have ten jeans of the same brand of diverse models 34x32 and I still have them correct , this one not . The height marked in this jeans is not real .
 I should definitely have heeded the warnings of others . I ordered a pair of the 517s and upon receiving them , was rather dismayed that indeed the length was way off . Upon measurement , the inseam is 31.5 &#34; instead of the 30 &#34; that I ordered , and what the jean claims to be . Back to Amazon it goes . Such is the QA of a global brand . People have been fired for way less.The search for the perfect fit continues .
 Tags on clothing say 29 &#34; length . They are 30 1/2 &#34; so I have to hem them . According to Levi 's website they do not have a 29 &#34; length so ?
 I ordered 4 jeans , 34 size each , the Boot Cut is 1 size smaller than the 505 Straight Fit I also purchased in same order .
 I ordered 2 pair in the rinsed color , they have a very strong chemical odor that only got stronger after washing them . I am returning them .
 ever since levi changed from being american made to being overseas made . . mostly in china THEY HAVE NO WORTH , the fabric is not half as tough as it used to be , the cut has changed and by doing so made it ten times worse then it was a few years ago , levi used to be my number one favorite brand to buy jean wise . . now it makes me just sad to look at them . they are poor excuses for jeans , the belt loops break off in a matter of weeks the zippers are weaker , and the sizing is complete bogus . everything is pretty much unprofessional and all they seem to care about now is mass production to make more money , instead of making a decent product to sell to customers , im sorry to say this levi but it has to be said , your products have been horrible over the last few years . your relaxed bootcut jeans of the early 2000 's were the BEST now you cant find them anywhere . so unless you go back to that exact fashion OR you make something just as good if not better then your old products you have lost a very loyal customer of 20 years . STOP just caring about making money and not caring about how well you make yoru products . carhartt has become my go to because atleast they care about if something holds together for more then a month .
 Ive been wearing Levi 's over 40 years . These are not the same old Levi 's ! The fit is baggy , the sizing is not consistant , I bought 2 pair and they fit and wear are totally different . Probably wo n't buy any levi products again
 too baggy . The wwrong side was received . I need 40 X 34 and received 42 X 34 . I washed them -LRB- I wash all new clothes before wearing -RRB- and then found them to be too large . I Looked at the size tag and saw it saying 42 X 34 . I re-ordered the correct size which fits right . I guess I am stuck with the fat pants .
 The length is soo long that it bunches at the bottom and drags on the ground .
 Received jeans . Color was correct but it was clearly marked `` slim '' and my son needed a regular.It was clearly marked on all packaging that it was slim but never said so on the website and he wore them anyway to an event so I could n't return . Waste of $ 40
 I am a size 30x32 and buy alot of jeans . I also carry a concealed weapin in my waistband and for the most part , never have a problem with any other jeans . These jeans , however were so tight that i could barely button them even without my weaponi on me .
 Purchased Two Pair Of Jeans Only Got One . Was Told They Only Had One Pair And Never Heard Another Word But Got Charged For Two Pair .
 These ones have no pockets ! A small gripe in comparison to the following . . I purchased five different colors of these shorts at the same time and they were all delivered together . The problem is that they are all different sizes of the same size , if you get my meaning . When I order LG , I want them all to be LG , regarless of what the label says . I have some that go down the my knees , others that are 4-6 inches above the knee . . No consistancy at all . They were made in a couple different countries -LRB- El Salvador , Haiti and the Dominican Republic to be exact -RRB- , but measurements should be the same everywhere -LRB- I thought -RRB- .
 This costume looks nothing like the picture . The vest is red not purple , my son was devestated . The bat embleishment at the neck is not there , but as an upside , the pants are included . I would have to say , this is a poorly put together costume and Im pretty disappionted in it . I ordered another vampire costume for my older son that was cheaper and is wayyy nicer , and it was supposed to be red . Now I have a cheap red costume and a very nice one ... not going to go over well with the kids . Not Happy with this purchase at all .
 The vest is RED not purple as pictured . My son loves purple and that is the reason I picked this vampire costume over others that are better quality . The rest is ok , and not best quality but for the low cost , what would you expect . Still , the item should be what appears in the picture .
 When I got this case in January I was quite pleased with it . The leather is good quality , the case itself is perfect for my needs , expands to easily hold my notebook and a fairly decent stack of files . There are 3 large interior pockets , the middle of which has a zipper to keep contents in or prying eyes out . I keep my notebook in the rear pocket and use the front pocket for a few files and legal pad . The front pocket has several smaller pockets that can hold a check book , pens , wallet or cell phone easily . There are also two other pockets , one on the outside and one under the flap , that do n't close and are good for a letter or slim folder you may need more immediate access to . Again , overall , I was very happy with this case.Now , for the bad . The flap closes using a clasp , the clasp never really seemed very sturdy to me . Well , here it is , just after a little more than 2 months of use the clasp is breaking . The female part on the bag itself seems to mount with two metal clips of some type , and the bottom on is broken . Now only the top holds this half of the clasp on so I 'm sure it wo n't be long before the clasp is broken entirely and the case will then be useless.I now went from very satisfied with this case to completely dissatisfied .
 These ones have no pockets ! A small gripe in comparison to the following . . I purchased five different colors of these shorts at the same time and they were all delivered together . The problem is that they are all different sizes of the same size , if you get my meaning . When I order LG , I want them all to be LG , regarless of what the label says . I have some that go down the my knees , others that are 4-6 inches above the knee . . No consistancy at all . They were made in a couple different countries -LRB- El Salvador , Haiti and the Dominican Republic to be exact -RRB- , but measurements should be the same everywhere -LRB- I thought -RRB- .
 This order was never received . The seller did not respond to several emails and phone calls . Only through Amazon intervention was I able to learn the seller did not have the product in stock . My funds were returned to my account . Happily , I was able to locate the ring from another source . I trust Amazon and will continue to purchase items here . However , I can not recommend this seller and I definitely will never use it again .
 I am not fat by any means . I am in fact built . Both pairs ripped in the seat after 3 months . Beware when buying them . Levis boot cut jeans .
 When the Chinese bought-out Levi Strauss & Co. they surrendered the quality of the Levi brand to history . Levi is not now or will they ever return to being the best pants money can buy . Shame , Shame , Shame on Levi Strauss & Co. . Levis are not even of high enough quality to be considered `` suckfull '' . Levis are now just another company making highly generic clothes from China , Honduras , Bangladesh , or wherever ...
 The length is way off . I have 30L with shorter legs . Other than that they would be OK I guess . But I would n't have bought them if I knew the length was a lie .
 I am a long time fan of Levi 's but this company is all over the place . I can not understand how there numerical style system works because it is almost meaningless . I got these and the waist was too big , thighs too small and boot cut seems to be almost more of a bell bottom look rather than having room for boots . I then got a size smaller locally of the 514 straight fit and they were almost the exact same overall , including the boot area . So if your waist measures 34 with a measuring tape , this 34 is too large and 33 in the 514 is also too large . However , the thighs are tight in both so I figure a 32 -LRB- which possibly might actually measure 34 -RRB- is probably going to looking like skinny jeans . because the thighs will be too small . So good luck with all that .
 I bought these jeans for my husband at Christmas . I knew that they would be stiff when I got them , and they were new so that is OK . But the first few times these have been washed , inside out or right-side out , they have faded and have horrible crease marks in the jeans , like the starch that was in them when they were new was just too much . I am disappointed in these jeans . After 6 washings they have weird lines on them and I can not get them to go away . My advice , do n't get the RIGID rinse . .
 ordered 32 inch length . first pair was 4 &#34; too long . recieved a replacement pair and they were 2 &#34; too long . poor quality control on this product
 This is terrible ! I am upset and disappointed!I ordered a pair of 517 jeans using a size . The jeans mailed to me showed the size on the Levi 's patch , however they were several inches too long and the waist was much wider than normal . This was definitely not the size stated on the label.Very frustrating , especially after we were eagerly anticipating their arrival I hesitate to mail-order jeans again after this experience .
 Will not shop with this vendor again . I ordered 2 pair of jeans . After washing them to shrink , they were still 3 inches too long . CLOTHING TAGS DID NOT MATCH the actual size . I 'm a guy , I build houses but ca n't sew , so now I have to pay a seamstress . Vendor sucks , but Amazon was good about the whole thing.Dano .
 I had ordered Levis jeans before , and the sizes fits always perfect , in this case this jeans were suppose to be a 34 waist 30 long ... but it looks like a 32 or 34 long .
 The length is way off . I have 30L with shorter legs . Other than that they would be OK I guess . But I would n't have bought them if I knew the length was a lie .
 This was the worst pair of jeans I have ever bought in my life . The specs implied that it would fit on one 's waist , however with the crotch being so short it barely reached my hips . I normally wear waist size 31 , which I ordered , but with this pair of jeans , the zipper almost could not go up . In addition , I am not a person with large legs , but this pair of jeans hugged me like it was made for a woman who wants to show off her assets . I would have returned my purchase , but where I am living it would cost double what the jeans are worth , so I will just have to accept my losses .
 this pair of jeans did not fit as expected . THEY LOOK REALLY BAD ON ME . I would like to send them back .
 I ordered stone washed jeans because I like the look and feel , I was sent regular blue jeans . Because I needed pants now not later I kept them but I 'm not happy ! As usual the jeans are good they are Levi 's after all but NOT what I paid for . ARE YOU EITHER COLOR BLIND OR ILLITTERATE AT AMAZON NOW . M.S.
 I 'm 5 ' 11 &#34; 185 lbs , muscular build . It took effort to stuff my thighs and bits into these , leaving me uncomfortable throughout the day . Luckily I was able to find a friend these worked for .
 they were too long and did n't fit the waist as advertized . the price was okay and the delivery was fine . overall , i was disappointed and would not repeat my order .
 The pants are not true to size.Nor was it medium it was light color . They are too long . Not 36x29 . More like 36x30May I return for exchange ? The darker colorIndigo are true to size not stonewash.We are not satisfied with merchandise.Please send Return Label for exchange.Thank you.alfredawhtd@gmail.com
 In the same order I purchased these and another pair of Levi 's jeans , in a dfferent cut . Both pairs were ordered in the same size . The other pair fit fine , just like every other pair of jeans that I 've ordered in this size . These jeans , however , were about three sizes too small . I double checked every tag just to make sure they were n't improperly labeled , but according to every tag and sticker on the jeans , they were the size I had ordered . Ever since my favorite cut of Levi 's -LRB- 569 -RRB- have been changed , it 's been hard to find a good pair of jeans . Thankfully Amazon offers free returns , back to the warehouse these go !
 I have worn the 517 for over twenty five years and Levi 's exclusively over 50 years . Two years ago , the cut changed and all 517 's were relaxed fit . Send back and change size because they were too big . SO I ordered the same thing but now 517 's are `` slim cut '' . Does n't work on me , I need some extra room . Now the number is 557 for the relaxed fit and I get to pay the postage to return the wrong cut jeans . Shame on Levi 's
 Quality is no longer the same and the fit varies from wich country it is made and the mood of that worker that day !!! One day hopefully we 'll start making are own merchandise like the old days , with quality and pride !!!
 DO NOT buy new 517s if you are looking for the slim , fitted , look of the classic Levi 's 517 . That 's been left in the dust . Apparently Levi 's thinks only fat people wear jeans now.These jeans have so much extra fabric it 's almost comical . I bought a pair online , set the jeans out on the floor , and even with a 29 waist , there is so much extra fabric they look like women 's jeans ! It 's like they have room for hips or something.Gimme a break , someone who buys 517 's is not going for the baggy gangster look , they 're 517s !!! Thoroughly disappointed with the direction Levi 's have taken the fit of their jeans , I will never buy a pair again.Don ' t be fooled by the other reviews that say these have a classic fit . They have a baggy , frumpy , ` modern ' couch potato fit .

 Great product . Communication was lacking . Amazon website indicated 2 pair were available at time of purchase . When they were not received in a timely fashion -LRB- ordered for a birthday present -RRB- , I initiated communication with G&L Clothing . They stated the merchandise was out of stock & had to be ordered . I will buy this product again , but not from this company . They should have been proactive in notifying me of the backorder issue instead of remaining silent .
 I feel disappointed with this product levi 's , in many occasions I have bought this brand of jeans in my country and for amazon and I never had problems with the heights , they all have come perfect , but this product not come correctly , my height is 34x 32 though these trousers have this marked height , is not correctly . this one is too small and I have others identical of the same height and model and I still have them excellent , I feel disappointed by this purchase . I have ten jeans of the same brand of diverse models 34x32 and I still have them correct , this one not . The height marked in this jeans is not real .
 I should definitely have heeded the warnings of others . I ordered a pair of the 517s and upon receiving them , was rather dismayed that indeed the length was way off . Upon measurement , the inseam is 31.5 &#34; instead of the 30 &#34; that I ordered , and what the jean claims to be . Back to Amazon it goes . Such is the QA of a global brand . People have been fired for way less.The search for the perfect fit continues .
 Tags on clothing say 29 &#34; length . They are 30 1/2 &#34; so I have to hem them . According to Levi 's website they do not have a 29 &#34; length so ?
 I ordered 4 jeans , 34 size each , the Boot Cut is 1 size smaller than the 505 Straight Fit I also purchased in same order .
 I ordered 2 pair in the rinsed color , they have a very strong chemical odor that only got stronger after washing them . I am returning them .
 Ive been wearing Levi 's over 40 years . These are not the same old Levi 's ! The fit is baggy , the sizing is not consistant , I bought 2 pair and they fit and wear are totally different . Probably wo n't buy any levi products again
 The length is soo long that it bunches at the bottom and drags on the ground .
 Received jeans . Color was correct but it was clearly marked `` slim '' and my son needed a regular.It was clearly marked on all packaging that it was slim but never said so on the website and he wore them anyway to an event so I could n't return . Waste of $ 40
 I am a size 30x32 and buy alot of jeans . I also carry a concealed weapin in my waistband and for the most part , never have a problem with any other jeans . These jeans , however were so tight that i could barely button them even without my weaponi on me .
 Purchased Two Pair Of Jeans Only Got One . Was Told They Only Had One Pair And Never Heard Another Word But Got Charged For Two Pair .
 too baggy . The wwrong side was received . I need 40 X 34 and received 42 X 34 . I washed them -LRB- I wash all new clothes before wearing -RRB- and then found them to be too large . I Looked at the size tag and saw it saying 42 X 34 . I re-ordered the correct size which fits right . I guess I am stuck with the fat pants .
 It was too small . I sent it back , still waiting the return of our money . Displeased .

 ever since levi changed from being american made to being overseas made . . mostly in china THEY HAVE NO WORTH , the fabric is not half as tough as it used to be , the cut has changed and by doing so made it ten times worse then it was a few years ago , levi used to be my number one favorite brand to buy jean wise . . now it makes me just sad to look at them . they are poor excuses for jeans , the belt loops break off in a matter of weeks the zippers are weaker , and the sizing is complete bogus . everything is pretty much unprofessional and all they seem to care about now is mass production to make more money , instead of making a decent product to sell to customers , im sorry to say this levi but it has to be said , your products have been horrible over the last few years . your relaxed bootcut jeans of the early 2000 's were the BEST now you cant find them anywhere . so unless you go back to that exact fashion OR you make something just as good if not better then your old products you have lost a very loyal customer of 20 years .

I bought a pair online , set the jeans out on the floor , and even with a 29 waist , there is so much extra fabric they look like women 's jeans ! It 's like they have room for hips or something.Gimme a break , someone who buys 517 's is not going for the baggy gangster look , they 're 517s !!! Thoroughly disappointed with the direction Levi 's have taken the fit of their jeans , I will never buy a pair again.Don ' t be fooled by the other reviews that say these have a classic fit . They have a baggy , frumpy , ` modern ' couch potato fit .
 Quality is no longer the same and the fit varies from wich country it is made and the mood of that worker that day !!! One day hopefully we 'll start making are own merchandise like the old days , with quality and pride !!!
 I ordered a pair of 517 jeans using a size I had used for years . The jeans mailed to me showed the size on the Levi 's patch , however they were several inches too long and the waist was much wider than normal . This was definitely not the size stated on the label.Very frustrating , especially after we were eagerly anticipating their arrival 2 weeks after the order was placed . I hesitate to mail-order jeans again after this experience .
 I 'm 5 ' 11 &#34; 185 lbs , muscular build . It took effort to stuff my thighs and bits into these , leaving me uncomfortable throughout the day . Luckily I was able to find a friend these worked for .
 they were too long and did n't fit the waist as advertized . the price was okay and the delivery was fine . overall , i was disappointed and would not repeat my order .
 The pants are not true to size.Nor was it medium it was light color . They are too long . Not 36x29 . More like 36x30May I return for exchange ? The darker colorIndigo are true to size not stonewash.We are not satisfied with merchandise.Please send Return Label for exchange.Thank you.alfredawhtd@gmail.com
 In the same order I purchased these and another pair of Levi 's jeans , in a dfferent cut . Both pairs were ordered in the same size . The other pair fit fine , just like every other pair of jeans that I 've ordered in this size . These jeans , however , were about three sizes too small . I double checked every tag just to make sure they were n't improperly labeled , but according to every tag and sticker on the jeans , they were the size I had ordered . Ever since my favorite cut of Levi 's -LRB- 569 -RRB- have been changed , it 's been hard to find a good pair of jeans . Thankfully Amazon offers free returns , back to the warehouse these go !
 Great product . Communication was lacking . Amazon website indicated 2 pair were available at time of purchase . When they were not received in a timely fashion -LRB- ordered for a birthday present -RRB- , I initiated communication with G&L Clothing . They stated the merchandise was out of stock & had to be ordered . I will buy this product again , but not from this company . They should have been proactive in notifying me of the backorder issue instead of remaining silent .
 I feel disappointed with this product levi 's , in many occasions I have bought this brand of jeans in my country and for amazon and I never had problems with the heights , they all have come perfect , but this product not come correctly , my height is 34x 32 though these trousers have this marked height , is not correctly . this one is too small and I have others identical of the same height and model and I still have them excellent , I feel disappointed by this purchase . I have ten jeans of the same brand of diverse models 34x32 and I still have them correct , this one not . The height marked in this jeans is not real .
 this pair of jeans did not fit as expected . THEY LOOK REALLY BAD ON ME . I would like to send them back .
 This is terrible ! I am upset and disappointed!I ordered a pair of 517 jeans using a size . The jeans mailed to me showed the size on the Levi 's patch , however they were several inches too long and the waist was much wider than normal . This was definitely not the size stated on the label.Very frustrating , especially after we were eagerly anticipating their arrival I hesitate to mail-order jeans again after this experience .
 I ordered 4 jeans , 34 size each , the Boot Cut is 1 size smaller than the 505 Straight Fit I also purchased in same order .
 I ordered 2 pair in the rinsed color , they have a very strong chemical odor that only got stronger after washing them . I am returning them .
 Will not shop with this vendor again . I ordered 2 pair of jeans . After washing them to shrink , they were still 3 inches too long . CLOTHING TAGS DID NOT MATCH the actual size . I 'm a guy , I build houses but ca n't sew , so now I have to pay a seamstress . Vendor sucks , but Amazon was good about the whole thing.Dano .
 too baggy . The wwrong side was received . I need 40 X 34 and received 42 X 34 . I washed them -LRB- I wash all new clothes before wearing -RRB- and then found them to be too large . I Looked at the size tag and saw it saying 42 X 34 . I re-ordered the correct size which fits right . I guess I am stuck with the fat pants .
 I am not fat by any means . I am in fact built . Both pairs ripped in the seat after 3 months . Beware when buying them . Levis boot cut jeans .
 The length is way off . I have 30L with shorter legs . Other than that they would be OK I guess . But I would n't have bought them if I knew the length was a lie .
 Received jeans . Color was correct but it was clearly marked `` slim '' and my son needed a regular.It was clearly marked on all packaging that it was slim but never said so on the website and he wore them anyway to an event so I could n't return . Waste of $ 40
 I am a size 30x32 and buy alot of jeans . I also carry a concealed weapin in my waistband and for the most part , never have a problem with any other jeans . These jeans , however were so tight that i could barely button them even without my weaponi on me .
 Purchased Two Pair Of Jeans Only Got One . Was Told They Only Had One Pair And Never Heard Another Word But Got Charged For Two Pair .
 Ive been wearing Levi 's over 40 years . These are not the same old Levi 's ! The fit is baggy , the sizing is not consistant , I bought 2 pair and they fit and wear are totally different . Probably wo n't buy any levi products again

 I have worn the 517 for over twenty five years and Levi 's exclusively over 50 years . Two years ago , the cut changed and all 517 's were relaxed fit . Send back and change size because they were too big . SO I ordered the same thing but now 517 's are `` slim cut '' . Does n't work on me , I need some extra room . Now the number is 557 for the relaxed fit and I get to pay the postage to return the wrong cut jeans . Shame on Levi 's

 I am a long time fan of Levi 's but this company is all over the place . I can not understand how there numerical style system works because it is almost meaningless . I got these and the waist was too big , thighs too small and boot cut seems to be almost more of a bell bottom look rather than having room for boots . I then got a size smaller locally of the 514 straight fit and they were almost the exact same overall , including the boot area . So if your waist measures 34 with a measuring tape , this 34 is too large and 33 in the 514 is also too large . However , the thighs are tight in both so I figure a 32 -LRB- which possibly might actually measure 34 -RRB- is probably going to looking like skinny jeans . because the thighs will be too small . So good luck with all that .
 ever since levi changed from being american made to being overseas made . . mostly in china THEY HAVE NO WORTH , the fabric is not half as tough as it used to be , the cut has changed and by doing so made it ten times worse then it was a few years ago , levi used to be my number one favorite brand to buy jean wise . . now it makes me just sad to look at them . they are poor excuses for jeans , the belt loops break off in a matter of weeks the zippers are weaker , and the sizing is complete bogus . everything is pretty much unprofessional and all they seem to care about now is mass production to make more money , instead of making a decent product to sell to customers , im sorry to say this levi but it has to be said , your products have been horrible over the last few years . your relaxed bootcut jeans of the early 2000 's were the BEST now you cant find them anywhere . so unless you go back to that exact fashion OR you make something just as good if not better then your old products you have lost a very loyal customer of 20 years . STOP just caring about making money and not caring about how well you make yoru products . carhartt has become my go to because atleast they care about if something holds together for more then a month .
 I had ordered Levis jeans before , and the sizes fits always perfect , in this case this jeans were suppose to be a 34 waist 30 long ... but it looks like a 32 or 34 long .
 this pair of jeans did not fit as expected . THEY LOOK REALLY BAD ON ME . I would like to send them back .
 I ordered stone washed jeans because I like the look and feel , I was sent regular blue jeans . Because I needed pants now not later I kept them but I 'm not happy ! As usual the jeans are good they are Levi 's after all but NOT what I paid for . ARE YOU EITHER COLOR BLIND OR ILLITTERATE AT AMAZON NOW . M.S.
 The length is soo long that it bunches at the bottom and drags on the ground .
 When the Chinese bought-out Levi Strauss & Co. they surrendered the quality of the Levi brand to history . Levi is not now or will they ever return to being the best pants money can buy . Shame , Shame , Shame on Levi Strauss & Co. . Levis are not even of high enough quality to be considered `` suckfull '' . Levis are now just another company making highly generic clothes from China , Honduras , Bangladesh , or wherever ...
 The length is way off . I have 30L with shorter legs . Other than that they would be OK I guess . But I would n't have bought them if I knew the length was a lie .
 This was the worst pair of jeans I have ever bought in my life . The specs implied that it would fit on one 's waist , however with the crotch being so short it barely reached my hips . I normally wear waist size 31 , which I ordered , but with this pair of jeans , the zipper almost could not go up . In addition , I am not a person with large legs , but this pair of jeans hugged me like it was made for a woman who wants to show off her assets . I would have returned my purchase , but where I am living it would cost double what the jeans are worth , so I will just have to accept my losses .

 Overall quality is very poor . The fabric is very thin.Buttons are plastic and it came without one button , -LRB- at least did have one spare -RRB- . Size runs small , I ordered it XL and size is as a Large .
 These ones have no pockets ! A small gripe in comparison to the following . . I purchased five different colors of these shorts at the same time and they were all delivered together . The problem is that they are all different sizes of the same size , if you get my meaning . When I order LG , I want them all to be LG , regarless of what the label says . I have some that go down the my knees , others that are 4-6 inches above the knee . . No consistancy at all . They were made in a couple different countries -LRB- El Salvador , Haiti and the Dominican Republic to be exact -RRB- , but measurements should be the same everywhere -LRB- I thought -RRB- .
 The clasp to fasten this item was flimsy to begin with , difficult to operate and finally broke after a week of wear .
 This bow tie fell apart within 48 hrs after I received it . I was able to sew it back together but I do n't think that I should 've had to do that .
 I 'm usually a pretty positive reviewer but I have to give this 1 star as it broke will I was trying to adjust the length the first time I used it . The length adjust piece -LRB- there must be a better word -RRB- along with the clasp are a very cheap metalized plastic . If you have very delicate hands and know you will never wear it a second time AND must save an extra dollar or 2 then this might suit you . Otherwise I could n't justify not spending a few more dollars for a better quality bowtie . As far as material costs for the company are concerned , the amount of metal needed to make this thing is equivalent to the tab or a coke can !
 I got what I paid for with this bow tie
 I was hoping for a real bow tie not a clip on . Aside from that , it looked ok until I tried putting it on and the stitching ripped . What a waste of money . I 'm glad I did n't fork over much for it .
 looked nothing like the picture . . to small . . only kept it because , I had no time to replace it.The pictures shows a large bowtie . .
 The clasp broke after just one night . The fabric is good quality but the latch in the back is made of super cheap plastice that will snap with any force .
 This bowtie broke the first time my son wore it . Now I need to find another one before his next orchestra concert . : -LRB-
 Hate it ! doesnt work at all &#65281; I i returned it immediately !!! Do not buy it here ! that 's for your own good !
 Are you kidding ? I ordered 2 . They both fell apart as I put them on . Crap . Trash . Junk . Non functional . Inferior merchandise .
 This tie only lasted six outings ! It failed on the last outing , repair the tie standing in a line :-LRB- ! I will only give it a ; two Star rating : -LRB- unhappy John
 If you 're used to the bowties with metal clasps , then you wo n't like this tie . When I readjusted the neck band , the plastic clips moved with it -- metal clasp ties ALWAYS have the hook at the bow and the loop side always moves forward to meet the hook.This tie was hard to put on , and I remember the clasp moving based on how I adjusted the neck band . One time it was by the bow , the next it was at the right side or back of my neck.The plastic clasp was the worst part -- I ordered this in with 2 day shipping , just in time to put it on for a concert -- and the clasp broke the very night I received the tie . The clasp is very flimsy .

 I bought these jeans for my husband at Christmas . I knew that they would be stiff when I got them , and they were new so that is OK . But the first few times these have been washed , inside out or right-side out , they have faded and have horrible crease marks in the jeans , like the starch that was in them when they were new was just too much . I am disappointed in these jeans . After 6 washings they have weird lines on them and I can not get them to go away . My advice , do n't get the RIGID rinse . .

 Tags on clothing say 29 &#34; length . They are 30 1/2 &#34; so I have to hem them . According to Levi 's website they do not have a 29 &#34; length so ?

 too baggy . The wwrong side was received . I need 40 X 34 and received 42 X 34 . I washed them -LRB- I wash all new clothes before wearing -RRB- and then found them to be too large . I Looked at the size tag and saw it saying 42 X 34 . I re-ordered the correct size which fits right . I guess I am stuck with the fat pants .

 Too shinny to take seriously maybe wear it as a joke or a costume . This tie is not worth the money .
 I am not fat by any means . I am in fact built . Both pairs ripped in the seat after 3 months . Beware when buying them . Levis boot cut jeans .
 this pair of jeans did not fit as expected . THEY LOOK REALLY BAD ON ME . I would like to send them back .
 This is terrible ! I am upset and disappointed!I ordered a pair of 517 jeans using a size . The jeans mailed to me showed the size on the Levi 's patch , however they were several inches too long and the waist was much wider than normal . This was definitely not the size stated on the label.Very frustrating , especially after we were eagerly anticipating their arrival I hesitate to mail-order jeans again after this experience .
 The length is way off . I have 30L with shorter legs . Other than that they would be OK I guess . But I would n't have bought them if I knew the length was a lie .
 This was the worst pair of jeans I have ever bought in my life . The specs implied that it would fit on one 's waist , however with the crotch being so short it barely reached my hips . I normally wear waist size 31 , which I ordered , but with this pair of jeans , the zipper almost could not go up . In addition , I am not a person with large legs , but this pair of jeans hugged me like it was made for a woman who wants to show off her assets . I would have returned my purchase , but where I am living it would cost double what the jeans are worth , so I will just have to accept my losses .
 When the Chinese bought-out Levi Strauss & Co. they surrendered the quality of the Levi brand to history . Levi is not now or will they ever return to being the best pants money can buy . Shame , Shame , Shame on Levi Strauss & Co. . Levis are not even of high enough quality to be considered `` suckfull '' . Levis are now just another company making highly generic clothes from China , Honduras , Bangladesh , or wherever ...
 I 'm 5 ' 11 &#34; 185 lbs , muscular build . It took effort to stuff my thighs and bits into these , leaving me uncomfortable throughout the day . Luckily I was able to find a friend these worked for .
 they were too long and did n't fit the waist as advertized . the price was okay and the delivery was fine . overall , i was disappointed and would not repeat my order .
 The pants are not true to size.Nor was it medium it was light color . They are too long . Not 36x29 . More like 36x30May I return for exchange ? The darker colorIndigo are true to size not stonewash.We are not satisfied with merchandise.Please send Return Label for exchange.Thank you.alfredawhtd@gmail.com
 In the same order I purchased these and another pair of Levi 's jeans , in a dfferent cut . Both pairs were ordered in the same size . The other pair fit fine , just like every other pair of jeans that I 've ordered in this size . These jeans , however , were about three sizes too small . I double checked every tag just to make sure they were n't improperly labeled , but according to every tag and sticker on the jeans , they were the size I had ordered . Ever since my favorite cut of Levi 's -LRB- 569 -RRB- have been changed , it 's been hard to find a good pair of jeans . Thankfully Amazon offers free returns , back to the warehouse these go !
 Will not shop with this vendor again . I ordered 2 pair of jeans . After washing them to shrink , they were still 3 inches too long . CLOTHING TAGS DID NOT MATCH the actual size . I 'm a guy , I build houses but ca n't sew , so now I have to pay a seamstress . Vendor sucks , but Amazon was good about the whole thing.Dano .
 too baggy . The wwrong side was received . I need 40 X 34 and received 42 X 34 . I washed them -LRB- I wash all new clothes before wearing -RRB- and then found them to be too large . I Looked at the size tag and saw it saying 42 X 34 . I re-ordered the correct size which fits right . I guess I am stuck with the fat pants .
 I had ordered Levis jeans before , and the sizes fits always perfect , in this case this jeans were suppose to be a 34 waist 30 long ... but it looks like a 32 or 34 long .
 I ordered stone washed jeans because I like the look and feel , I was sent regular blue jeans . Because I needed pants now not later I kept them but I 'm not happy ! As usual the jeans are good they are Levi 's after all but NOT what I paid for . ARE YOU EITHER COLOR BLIND OR ILLITTERATE AT AMAZON NOW . M.S.
 The length is soo long that it bunches at the bottom and drags on the ground .
 I ordered 2 pair in the rinsed color , they have a very strong chemical odor that only got stronger after washing them . I am returning them .
 ever since levi changed from being american made to being overseas made . . mostly in china THEY HAVE NO WORTH , the fabric is not half as tough as it used to be , the cut has changed and by doing so made it ten times worse then it was a few years ago , levi used to be my number one favorite brand to buy jean wise . . now it makes me just sad to look at them . they are poor excuses for jeans , the belt loops break off in a matter of weeks the zippers are weaker , and the sizing is complete bogus . everything is pretty much unprofessional and all they seem to care about now is mass production to make more money , instead of making a decent product to sell to customers , im sorry to say this levi but it has to be said , your products have been horrible over the last few years . your relaxed bootcut jeans of the early 2000 's were the BEST now you cant find them anywhere . so unless you go back to that exact fashion OR you make something just as good if not better then your old products you have lost a very loyal customer of 20 years . STOP just caring about making money and not caring about how well you make yoru products . carhartt has become my go to because atleast they care about if something holds together for more then a month .
 I have worn the 517 for over twenty five years and Levi 's exclusively over 50 years . Two years ago , the cut changed and all 517 's were relaxed fit . Send back and change size because they were too big . SO I ordered the same thing but now 517 's are `` slim cut '' . Does n't work on me , I need some extra room . Now the number is 557 for the relaxed fit and I get to pay the postage to return the wrong cut jeans . Shame on Levi 's
 DO NOT buy new 517s if you are looking for the slim , fitted , look of the classic Levi 's 517 . That 's been left in the dust . Apparently Levi 's thinks only fat people wear jeans now.These jeans have so much extra fabric it 's almost comical . I bought a pair online , set the jeans out on the floor , and even with a 29 waist , there is so much extra fabric they look like women 's jeans ! It 's like they have room for hips or something.Gimme a break , someone who buys 517 's is not going for the baggy gangster look , they 're 517s !!! Thoroughly disappointed with the direction Levi 's have taken the fit of their jeans , I will never buy a pair again.Don ' t be fooled by the other reviews that say these have a classic fit . They have a baggy , frumpy , ` modern ' couch potato fit .
 Quality is no longer the same and the fit varies from wich country it is made and the mood of that worker that day !!! One day hopefully we 'll start making are own merchandise like the old days , with quality and pride !!!

 Great product . Communication was lacking . Amazon website indicated 2 pair were available at time of purchase . When they were not received in a timely fashion -LRB- ordered for a birthday present -RRB- , I initiated communication with G&L Clothing . They stated the merchandise was out of stock & had to be ordered . I will buy this product again , but not from this company . They should have been proactive in notifying me of the backorder issue instead of remaining silent .
 I feel disappointed with this product levi 's , in many occasions I have bought this brand of jeans in my country and for amazon and I never had problems with the heights , they all have come perfect , but this product not come correctly , my height is 34x 32 though these trousers have this marked height , is not correctly . this one is too small and I have others identical of the same height and model and I still have them excellent , I feel disappointed by this purchase . I have ten jeans of the same brand of diverse models 34x32 and I still have them correct , this one not . The height marked in this jeans is not real .
 I bought these jeans for my husband at Christmas . I knew that they would be stiff when I got them , and they were new so that is OK . But the first few times these have been washed , inside out or right-side out , they have faded and have horrible crease marks in the jeans , like the starch that was in them when they were new was just too much . I am disappointed in these jeans . After 6 washings they have weird lines on them and I can not get them to go away . My advice , do n't get the RIGID rinse . .
 ordered 32 inch length . first pair was 4 &#34; too long . recieved a replacement pair and they were 2 &#34; too long . poor quality control on this product
 Received jeans . Color was correct but it was clearly marked `` slim '' and my son needed a regular.It was clearly marked on all packaging that it was slim but never said so on the website and he wore them anyway to an event so I could n't return . Waste of $ 40
 I am a size 30x32 and buy alot of jeans . I also carry a concealed weapin in my waistband and for the most part , never have a problem with any other jeans . These jeans , however were so tight that i could barely button them even without my weaponi on me .
 Purchased Two Pair Of Jeans Only Got One . Was Told They Only Had One Pair And Never Heard Another Word But Got Charged For Two Pair .
 Ive been wearing Levi 's over 40 years . These are not the same old Levi 's ! The fit is baggy , the sizing is not consistant , I bought 2 pair and they fit and wear are totally different . Probably wo n't buy any levi products again
 I ordered 4 jeans , 34 size each , the Boot Cut is 1 size smaller than the 505 Straight Fit I also purchased in same order .
 The bow tie came apart -- the three pieces that make it up were no longer connected -- the first time it was tried on . I sewed it back together .
 It had little threads hanging off of it which made it look bad . Also mine had some kind of stain on the top which deteriorated the quality evn more .
 when i first got this bow tie it fell apart the second I picked it up and tried it on . The seller sent me another and it did the same thing . Do n't waste your money
 The pants are not true to size.Nor was it medium it was light color . They are too long . Not 36x29 . More like 36x30May I return for exchange ?

 Tags on clothing say 29 &#34; length . They are 30 1/2 &#34; so I have to hem them . According to Levi 's website they do not have a 29 &#34; length so ?
 I am a long time fan of Levi 's but this company is all over the place . I can not understand how there numerical style system works because it is almost meaningless . I got these and the waist was too big , thighs too small and boot cut seems to be almost more of a bell bottom look rather than having room for boots . I then got a size smaller locally of the 514 straight fit and they were almost the exact same overall , including the boot area . So if your waist measures 34 with a measuring tape , this 34 is too large and 33 in the 514 is also too large . However , the thighs are tight in both so I figure a 32 -LRB- which possibly might actually measure 34 -RRB- is probably going to looking like skinny jeans . because the thighs will be too small . So good luck with all that .
 I have worn the 517 for over twenty five years and Levi 's exclusively over 50 years . Two years ago , the cut changed and all 517 's were relaxed fit .

 The material is polyester but it is the stiffest polyester ever made . You ca n't really tie this scarf appropriately because it is so stiff and awkward that does n't sit well . It 's basically useless and does n't look good at all . I would certainly not recommend this product .
 This seller , `` In the Mood Intimates , '' is highly disreputable . I bought a matched bra and panty set , same color , as a gift . The bra was at a great sale price , the matching panty was at full price . The total , in excess of $ 100 , qualified me for a $ 10 discount and free shipping.Twelve -LRB- 12 -RRB- days after receiving my credit card remittance , they shipped me the panty only , with no explanation as to the missing bra . Over the next three days , I left eleven -LRB- 11 -RRB- detailed voice mail messages with In the Mood Intimates , receiving no response . Finally , another nine -LRB- 9 -RRB- days later , I received an e-Mail asserting that they no longer had the bra in stock , and indicating their refusal to accept a return of the panty -LRB- even though its packaging is unopened -RRB- owing to the nature of the item.Meanwhile , they have charged me for shipping and taken away the $ 10 discount.These people are dishonest . Stay away from them .
 The largest size I 've ever worn is 8M -LRB- stilettos , flip-flops , athletic shoes , flats , etc. -RRB- from varying brands . According to Injinji 's Web site , size small fits up to size 8 shoes in women , but it is short , causing a very snug , somewhat uncomfortable fit . As a result , I 've only worn them once to exercise . I was worried that they may slip underneath but they did not . However , the fit and whether or not they will stay in place is definitely not a good thing . They also came out fuzzy in the wash . I 'm keeping all six because the inconvenience of returning them to Amazon is too much .
 i have a size 12 foot , the holes didnt even come close to fitting my two big toes on both of my feet . good for small people or women .
 This make the Vibrams fit too tight , and not to mention they are way over priced . As regular socks they are kinda cool
 I am a big vibram 5 finger fan but these socks are not great . Got them to reduce foot moisture/sweating when wearing the vibrams but these made it worse . Do not recommend for that purpose . Ok for just wearing around the house , but I 'd rather go barefoot .
 I bought two pairs of these to wear with my Vibram KSO sports . One pair ripped between the big toe and second toe after one day of use . According to Amazon.com 's return policy , you can not return worn items ... I did n't read this beforehand and sent them back . . So I am out more than $ 20 and without socks . Do yourself a favor and buy these socks from your local retailer . I got a few pairs at my local REI and they are of higher quality and stretch and fit properly . My new socks are Injinji also , but are of a different design . Maybe the seller is selling older stock socks . . Your mileage may vary , buyer beware .
 I consider myself an intermediate-level half marathoner and had been using normal socks for all my training and runs for many years.My first feeling after putting this toesocks on was , `` Oh man , it feels so CRAMP in my shoe ! '' Tried running and felt extremely uncomfortable because of the rubbing of the fabrics in between my toes . Mind you , the fabric is not thin at all but quite thick . And my gut feeling tells me that I 'll definitely get blisters in between my toes at the end of a long run.If the fabric had been thinner , I might have considered it a great product , because of the snug-fit and flexibility it gives to my toes.Be warned !
 I really wanted to like these , but they were painful around my toes . I guess my toes are too thick for these or something and so it was painful . However , the toes were still longer than mine . I am not sure what the deal was there . If these were n't painful then I would have liked them .
 I bought this for my wife , she used it for her half marathon run . On mile 4 to 5 she had develop blister in between her toes from too much friction . It 's a great idea , but did n't really work for long distance running . I had on my Thorlo 's running socks and I had no issue with blistering . Would not recommend for a marathon .
 In the process of training for a marathon and keep getting a re-occuring blister on my second toe . Podiatrist recommended trying these socks ... worse thing i could have done went for an 8 mile run trying out these new socks and after that had a blister on the bad toe but also got more blisters in between my toes ... one toe actually has two blisters now . Really wanted to love these but they did not work ... instead of one blister i now have 5 do n't waste your money I will stick with my Nike dri fit and some good band-aids .
 I am not fat . I 'm in shape . My toes were too fat for these . I could get them in , but after about 5 minutes of wearing them , the circulation in my toes was gone .
 I was notified time and again that shipment would be made . Then when I decided to cancel the order to get something else in time for Christmas I was told that the shipment had already been made and that it was too late to cancel . I will certainly be returning this order if , per chance , it ever does arrive . Worst order I have ever had with Amazom .
 I am a women 's size 7 with normal to narrow feet and these socks are really too small . I have to really stretch them to get them up over my heal and that causes the individual toes to pull back and cramp my toes while the seams dig into the tender spaces in between my toes . I actually ca n't imagine these socks fitting someone with a size 8 foot . If I were to order again I 'd probably get the ones that come up higher on the ankle in the hope that I would n't have to stretch them so much .
 I 've been wearing toe socks now for over 20 years . I started wearing them as inner socks to prevent the fungus when I had to wear boots 13 to 20 hours a day . Before the barefoot running craze started I used to get them from a Korean friend who had his mother bring them from Korea . Then I had to order them from overseas or from Canada . My running days are behind me now but I still wear them and like them a lot.Too thick - I had no idea what they meant when the label mean `` Original Weight '' but I found out that it meant that these socks are around twice as thick as I 'm used to . That 's not really a problem when using them for the original purpose as inner socks but they are a problem for me when I use them with my Vibrams . I 'm still able to wear them -LRB- since I paid $ 12.00 a pair for them -RRB- but all that material means that wearing my Vibrams is not as nice as I would like.Too long - There is too much material on the pinkie toe for me . All that material just hangs off the end . This is the first time this has ever happened to me . Again , not a problem with boots and regular shoes but a problem with the toe shoes.Bad material - The material on these socks started to pill after the first wash BEFORE BEING WORN . Its only gotten worse and now I 've got a bunch of furry looking toe socks except that the fur are little bitty balls of material.I 've been wearing these for seven months now . This has really been a bad purchase for me . This is the most I 've ever paid for toe socks and this is the worst experience I 've ever had with them . I really do n't mind paying the price for premium products . The brand may be , but this is not a premium product . These are really not bad socks if they were half the price , but at this price these are bad socks .
 While these socks are very comfortable and work great with the barefoot running style of she , they are are flawed in I had holes developing at the seams in less than a month , not cool for socks that run at $ 12 each .
 I Ordered six pairs of this sock . Thinking that we get what we pay ; this should be a wonderful sock . It fits well , but one pair came with a role in it , and after one wash they look very , very old . I ordered white , and they never became bright white after just one use . The company never asked for a feedbak , what makes me wonder if they care at all for the quality of their products .
 I am an average size 11 , but the toes are so small that the socks pinch into the skin between the toes . They are unwearable .
 dont waste your money , you 'll wear them one time and then make an appointment to have your head checked for ordering something so trivial .
 I got these socks based on the stellar reviews here . I have been very disappointed with them . The socks tore within two washes . I am not sure whether the samples I received were bad , but needless to say I am not happy with this product . And for $ 10 a pop , these should have been more than rugged .
 I have very small feet . I generally wear a size 5.5 to size 6 . I bought these socks to wear with my vibram five fingers and to wear as running socks in my regular sneakers . The small is so small they slide down my heel and I have to keep pulling them up . They are basically useless to me . I own three other pairs of the toe socks from injinji and they are great but they are not the crew socks .
 The description says these socks are seamless - they absolutely are not . I had a big seam going down every toe which caused constant rubbing . These socks are so uncomfortable and rubbed my toes/toe webbing so much that I had to take them off after 20 minutes of use -LRB- my toes are now sore -RRB- . I * highly * recommend you pass on these socks - I will be returning mine .
 These socks worked great for me . I wore them to my exercise class and they protected a corn I had developed between my toes . Unfortunately , one of the socks was a little bit unraveled when it arrived and got worse with each washing . The final washing was crazy , as it was so `` stringy '' that it wound around other clothes in the wash and required extra effort to separate everything . Unfortunately , this was after the 30 day return period . And they are expensive socks .
 So I guess I have long toes or something because the toes on these socks are FAR shorter than they appear in the image . Front-to-back these feel great -LRB- I wear a size 9 shoe -RRB- , but I 'm going to have to cut off the ends of the toes in order to make these fit .
 Avoid this seller . I have sent multiple emails and only gotten 1/2 the order . There are much better vendors on Amazon . Avoid this one and go with with the other vendors .
 I found the men 's sock garters to be well constructed and designed . The problem I encountered is the uncomfortable restriction caused by the strong elastic and the painful pressure point caused by the adjustment buckle . I have worn them one time and am not soliciting a refund .
 The material is polyester but it is the stiffest polyester ever made . You ca n't really tie this scarf appropriately because it is so stiff and awkward that does n't sit well . It 's basically useless and does n't look good at all . I would certainly not recommend this product .
 Ive been wearing Levi 's over 40 years . These are not the same old Levi 's ! The fit is baggy , the sizing is not consistant , I bought 2 pair and they fit and wear are totally different . Probably wo n't buy any levi products again
 Great product . Communication was lacking . Amazon website indicated 2 pair were available at time of purchase . When they were not received in a timely fashion -LRB- ordered for a birthday present -RRB- , I initiated communication with G&L Clothing . They stated the merchandise was out of stock & had to be ordered . I will buy this product again , but not from this company . They should have been proactive in notifying me of the backorder issue instead of remaining silent .
 I feel disappointed with this product levi 's , in many occasions I have bought this brand of jeans in my country and for amazon and I never had problems with the heights , they all have come perfect , but this product not come correctly , my height is 34x 32 though these trousers have this marked height , is not correctly . this one is too small and I have others identical of the same height and model and I still have them excellent , I feel disappointed by this purchase . I have ten jeans of the same brand of diverse models 34x32 and I still have them correct , this one not . The height marked in this jeans is not real .
 I should definitely have heeded the warnings of others . I ordered a pair of the 517s and upon receiving them , was rather dismayed that indeed the length was way off . Upon measurement , the inseam is 31.5 &#34; instead of the 30 &#34; that I ordered , and what the jean claims to be . Back to Amazon it goes . Such is the QA of a global brand . People have been fired for way less.The search for the perfect fit continues .
 Tags on clothing say 29 &#34; length . They are 30 1/2 &#34; so I have to hem them . According to Levi 's website they do not have a 29 &#34; length so ?
 I have worn the 517 for over twenty five years and Levi 's exclusively over 50 years . Two years ago , the cut changed and all 517 's were relaxed fit . Send back and change size because they were too big . SO I ordered the same thing but now 517 's are `` slim cut '' . Does n't work on me , I need some extra room . Now the number is 557 for the relaxed fit and I get to pay the postage to return the wrong cut jeans . Shame on Levi 's
 Quality is no longer the same and the fit varies from wich country it is made and the mood of that worker that day !!! One day hopefully we 'll start making are own merchandise like the old days , with quality and pride !!!
 DO NOT buy new 517s if you are looking for the slim , fitted , look of the classic Levi 's 517 . That 's been left in the dust . Apparently Levi 's thinks only fat people wear jeans now.These jeans have so much extra fabric it 's almost comical . I bought a pair online , set the jeans out on the floor , and even with a 29 waist , there is so much extra fabric they look like women 's jeans ! It 's like they have room for hips or something.Gimme a break , someone who buys 517 's is not going for the baggy gangster look , they 're 517s !!! Thoroughly disappointed with the direction Levi 's have taken the fit of their jeans , I will never buy a pair again.Don ' t be fooled by the other reviews that say these have a classic fit . They have a baggy , frumpy , ` modern ' couch potato fit .
 I ordered a pair of 517 jeans using a size I had used for years . The jeans mailed to me showed the size on the Levi 's patch , however they were several inches too long and the waist was much wider than normal . This was definitely not the size stated on the label.Very frustrating , especially after we were eagerly anticipating their arrival 2 weeks after the order was placed . I hesitate to mail-order jeans again after this experience .
 ever since levi changed from being american made to being overseas made . . mostly in china THEY HAVE NO WORTH , the fabric is not half as tough as it used to be , the cut has changed and by doing so made it ten times worse then it was a few years ago , levi used to be my number one favorite brand to buy jean wise . . now it makes me just sad to look at them . they are poor excuses for jeans , the belt loops break off in a matter of weeks the zippers are weaker , and the sizing is complete bogus . everything is pretty much unprofessional and all they seem to care about now is mass production to make more money , instead of making a decent product to sell to customers , im sorry to say this levi but it has to be said , your products have been horrible over the last few years . your relaxed bootcut jeans of the early 2000 's were the BEST now you cant find them anywhere . so unless you go back to that exact fashion OR you make something just as good if not better then your old products you have lost a very loyal customer of 20 years . STOP just caring about making money and not caring about how well you make yoru products . carhartt has become my go to because atleast they care about if something holds together for more then a month .
 The length is soo long that it bunches at the bottom and drags on the ground .
 Received jeans . Color was correct but it was clearly marked `` slim '' and my son needed a regular.It was clearly marked on all packaging that it was slim but never said so on the website and he wore them anyway to an event so I could n't return . Waste of $ 40
 I am a size 30x32 and buy alot of jeans . I also carry a concealed weapin in my waistband and for the most part , never have a problem with any other jeans . These jeans , however were so tight that i could barely button them even without my weaponi on me .
 Purchased Two Pair Of Jeans Only Got One . Was Told They Only Had One Pair And Never Heard Another Word But Got Charged For Two Pair .
 I ordered 4 jeans , 34 size each , the Boot Cut is 1 size smaller than the 505 Straight Fit I also purchased in same order .
 I ordered 2 pair in the rinsed color , they have a very strong chemical odor that only got stronger after washing them . I am returning them .
 too baggy . The wwrong side was received . I need 40 X 34 and received 42 X 34 . I washed them -LRB- I wash all new clothes before wearing -RRB- and then found them to be too large . I Looked at the size tag and saw it saying 42 X 34 . I re-ordered the correct size which fits right . I guess I am stuck with the fat pants .
 This was the worst pair of jeans I have ever bought in my life . The specs implied that it would fit on one 's waist , however with the crotch being so short it barely reached my hips . I normally wear waist size 31 , which I ordered , but with this pair of jeans , the zipper almost could not go up . In addition , I am not a person with large legs , but this pair of jeans hugged me like it was made for a woman who wants to show off her assets . I would have returned my purchase , but where I am living it would cost double what the jeans are worth , so I will just have to accept my losses .
 this pair of jeans did not fit as expected . THEY LOOK REALLY BAD ON ME . I would like to send them back .
 I ordered stone washed jeans because I like the look and feel , I was sent regular blue jeans . Because I needed pants now not later I kept them but I 'm not happy ! As usual the jeans are good they are Levi 's after all but NOT what I paid for . ARE YOU EITHER COLOR BLIND OR ILLITTERATE AT AMAZON NOW . M.S.
 I had ordered Levis jeans before , and the sizes fits always perfect , in this case this jeans were suppose to be a 34 waist 30 long ... but it looks like a 32 or 34 long .
 I bought these jeans for my husband at Christmas . I knew that they would be stiff when I got them , and they were new so that is OK . But the first few times these have been washed , inside out or right-side out , they have faded and have horrible crease marks in the jeans , like the starch that was in them when they were new was just too much . I am disappointed in these jeans . After 6 washings they have weird lines on them and I can not get them to go away . My advice , do n't get the RIGID rinse . .
 ordered 32 inch length . first pair was 4 &#34; too long . recieved a replacement pair and they were 2 &#34; too long . poor quality control on this product
 This is terrible ! I am upset and disappointed!I ordered a pair of 517 jeans using a size . The jeans mailed to me showed the size on the Levi 's patch , however they were several inches too long and the waist was much wider than normal . This was definitely not the size stated on the label.Very frustrating , especially after we were eagerly anticipating their arrival I hesitate to mail-order jeans again after this experience .
 I am not fat by any means . I am in fact built . Both pairs ripped in the seat after 3 months . Beware when buying them . Levis boot cut jeans .
 they were too long and did n't fit the waist as advertized . the price was okay and the delivery was fine . overall , i was disappointed and would not repeat my order .
 The pants are not true to size.Nor was it medium it was light color . They are too long . Not 36x29 . More like 36x30May I return for exchange ? The darker colorIndigo are true to size not stonewash.We are not satisfied with merchandise.Please send Return Label for exchange.Thank you.alfredawhtd@gmail.com
 In the same order I purchased these and another pair of Levi 's jeans , in a dfferent cut . Both pairs were ordered in the same size . The other pair fit fine , just like every other pair of jeans that I 've ordered in this size . These jeans , however , were about three sizes too small . I double checked every tag just to make sure they were n't improperly labeled , but according to every tag and sticker on the jeans , they were the size I had ordered . Ever since my favorite cut of Levi 's -LRB- 569 -RRB- have been changed , it 's been hard to find a good pair of jeans . Thankfully Amazon offers free returns , back to the warehouse these go !
 I 'm 5 ' 11 &#34; 185 lbs , muscular build . It took effort to stuff my thighs and bits into these , leaving me uncomfortable throughout the day . Luckily I was able to find a friend these worked for .
 Will not shop with this vendor again . I ordered 2 pair of jeans . After washing them to shrink , they were still 3 inches too long . CLOTHING TAGS DID NOT MATCH the actual size . I 'm a guy , I build houses but ca n't sew , so now I have to pay a seamstress . Vendor sucks , but Amazon was good about the whole thing.Dano .

 When the Chinese bought-out Levi Strauss & Co. they surrendered the quality of the Levi brand to history . Levi is not now or will they ever return to being the best pants money can buy . Shame , Shame , Shame on Levi Strauss & Co. . Levis are not even of high enough quality to be considered `` suckfull '' . Levis are now just another company making highly generic clothes from China , Honduras , Bangladesh , or wherever ...
 The length is way off . I have 30L with shorter legs . Other than that they would be OK I guess . But I would n't have bought them if I knew the length was a lie .
 This was a From Me , To Me Christmas present . I wanted the very warm outdoor coverall and it is just that . Like all Carhartt it 's very well built , but the 44R I purchased did n't fit . I could n't raise my arms without the crotch cinching up . I went to a local store and tried on a 46Tall and I had the same problem . I was disappointed that I could n't find another size that would fit me so I ended up returning it to amazon .

 Ordered 2 pair , same size as I currently wear . I tried them on when they came in . Fit was more snug than other pairs of Dockers I have in the same size . When I went to wear one of the pairs to work , and removed the labels , I noticed the finish work on the button holes to be very poor . Extra thead hang off . Uneven stiching . My reaction was that these were `` seconds '' . Not first quality merchandise . Will be returning them No excuse for this poor quality . Buying manufacturer 's seconds is one thing , IF you know that is what you are getting .
 The length and waist are a little shorter/smaller than the same size pants from other manufacturers .
 Dockers ? Flat-front Classic Fit Original Khaki with Individual Fit -LRB- tm -RRB- WaistbandOrdered thru Macys for husband as work slacks . Pants rec 'd were not made of the same soft cotton fabric as ones we had bought in stores previously . Scratchy , stiff and seem to attract lint and hair . One pair had been re-hemmed -LRB- very poorly -RRB- . Very disappointed but had to keep and use because he needed for his job .
 I ordered three different styles of Docker 's pants , all in size 34x32 -LRB- the other being Dockers Men 's Pleated Original Khaki and Dockers Men 's Pleated Never Iron Cotton Khaki -RRB- . The other two fit fine -LRB- and I regularlywear 34x32 pants -RRB- , whereas this one is distinctly smaller both in waist size and inseam . Worse , since `` too small '' is viewed by Amazon as a customer error even though the problem clearly lies in the product itself , they want me to pay for the return shipping !
 The stitching on the left front pocket was defective . I repaired it myself rather than spend the time and effort to return it . I love the style and fit of this these pants but I wish the vendor would do some QC before shipping the item . This does n't promote repeat business .
 I have had it with all the overseas made slacks running small that I have ordered on Amazon . This is my third order of slacks . When I bought Dockers a couple years ago , they were Stain Defenders size 36x32 and they still fit me perfectly . This is the third order of of various types of slacks I ordered this year size 36x32 that have not fit properly . These are far smaller than 36x32 . If you order a size larger they might fit you , but I do n't think it proper that the sizes are off like this in the first place . The three pair I received from Flat-front Classic Fit Original Khaki with Individual Fit -LRB- tm -RRB- Waistband order were made in the Dominican Republic . One other thing . I just got in some slacks from JC Penney size 36x32 and they fit just fine .
 These Dockers pants look expensive , are heavier cotton , and they are color-fast . At $ 70.00 - $ 80.00 a pair , they are overpriced . I bought a pair of Dockers several years ago , and after only 4 months of wear -LRB- 2 or 3 times a week -RRB- , they frayed , and I could no longer wear them . I did not buy another pair until recently , as the material looked heavier and harder-wearing . I bought a pair , and this time around it frayed in even more places , and has completely fallen apart . This is one case where paying more for a product does not guarantee quality . Save your hard earned dollars for other brands .
 This is a solid well-made casual pair of pants . But from the first few daysof wear and from the first careful wash wrinkles were everywhere . Maybethe exact phrase `` wrinke-free '' as in some Van Heusen shirts is a moreaccurate phrase to look for when trying to find clothing that wrinkles less.Also it is advertised as `` stretch '' but does not and thelabel says `` 2 % spandex .

 I ordered the camo print wallet for my son for his birthday . This company Andrew Christian , sent me the wrong wallet . I e-mail their customer service and advised them that the wrong wallet had been sent . The packing slip showed I ordered the camo print however they sent me olive green , not what my son wanted . They had time to help me replace it before my sons birthday but instead tried to imply that I should pay to send back the wrong product . They do n't have any idea what customer service is !! . I would n't recommend shopping with them , you may never get what you really ordered .
 The material is polyester but it is the stiffest polyester ever made . You ca n't really tie this scarf appropriately because it is so stiff and awkward that does n't sit well . It 's basically useless and does n't look good at all . I would certainly not recommend this product .

 Dockers ? Flat-front Classic Fit Original Khaki with Individual Fit -LRB- tm -RRB- WaistbandOrdered thru Macys for husband as work slacks . Pants rec 'd were not made of the same soft cotton fabric as ones we had bought in stores previously . Scratchy , stiff and seem to attract lint and hair . One pair had been re-hemmed -LRB- very poorly -RRB- . Very disappointed but had to keep and use because he needed for his job .
 I ordered three different styles of Docker 's pants , all in size 34x32 -LRB- the other being Dockers Men 's Pleated Original Khaki and Dockers Men 's Pleated Never Iron Cotton Khaki -RRB- . The other two fit fine -LRB- and I regularlywear 34x32 pants -RRB- , whereas this one is distinctly smaller both in waist size and inseam . Worse , since `` too small '' is viewed by Amazon as a customer error even though the problem clearly lies in the product itself , they want me to pay for the return shipping !
 The stitching on the left front pocket was defective . I repaired it myself rather than spend the time and effort to return it . I love the style and fit of this these pants but I wish the vendor would do some QC before shipping the item . This does n't promote repeat business .
 I have had it with all the overseas made slacks running small that I have ordered on Amazon . This is my third order of slacks . When I bought Dockers a couple years ago , they were Stain Defenders size 36x32 and they still fit me perfectly . This is the third order of of various types of slacks I ordered this year size 36x32 that have not fit properly . These are far smaller than 36x32 . If you order a size larger they might fit you , but I do n't think it proper that the sizes are off like this in the first place . The three pair I received from Flat-front Classic Fit Original Khaki with Individual Fit -LRB- tm -RRB- Waistband order were made in the Dominican Republic . One other thing . I just got in some slacks from JC Penney size 36x32 and they fit just fine .
 These Dockers pants look expensive , are heavier cotton , and they are color-fast . At $ 70.00 - $ 80.00 a pair , they are overpriced . I bought a pair of Dockers several years ago , and after only 4 months of wear -LRB- 2 or 3 times a week -RRB- , they frayed , and I could no longer wear them . I did not buy another pair until recently , as the material looked heavier and harder-wearing . I bought a pair , and this time around it frayed in even more places , and has completely fallen apart . This is one case where paying more for a product does not guarantee quality . Save your hard earned dollars for other brands .
 This is a solid well-made casual pair of pants . But from the first few daysof wear and from the first careful wash wrinkles were everywhere . Maybethe exact phrase `` wrinke-free '' as in some Van Heusen shirts is a moreaccurate phrase to look for when trying to find clothing that wrinkles less.Also it is advertised as `` stretch '' but does not and thelabel says `` 2 % spandex . ''
 The material is polyester but it is the stiffest polyester ever made . You ca n't really tie this scarf appropriately because it is so stiff and awkward that does n't sit well . It 's basically useless and does n't look good at all . I would certainly not recommend this product .
 Ordered 2 pair , same size as I currently wear . I tried them on when they came in . Fit was more snug than other pairs of Dockers I have in the same size . When I went to wear one of the pairs to work , and removed the labels , I noticed the finish work on the button holes to be very poor . Extra thead hang off . Uneven stiching . My reaction was that these were `` seconds '' . Not first quality merchandise . Will be returning them No excuse for this poor quality .

 I ordered 2 navy shoe bags and you sent 2 beige ones . I would send them in for a return , I need them for a business trip on Monday and it 's not enough time for me to exchange colours . Product is passable quality for the price .
 this t-shirt when i put it on the first time it immediately torn appart so i am not satisfied with the product
 I ordered a 45 inch Mens scarf . It arrived in a plain envelope . It may or may not be one hundred percent silk , but is quite thin in any event . The seams are the usual mass produced Asian import seams
 I bought this scarf as a gift for a friend but had to return it . The photograph does not show how bad and uneven the stitching is . In addition to that the scarf had creases all over , most likely from already having been returned and repackaged . I contacted the seller but received no reply in over a week .
 Way too small for a scarf , can not be used neither as a scarf nor as an ascot . The material is okay .
 This is not what I expected - it is see through so you must wear something else under it which adds to your size which is not helpful when your dealing with plus size ! The arms are tight , the corset falls down exposing breasts since you can not wear a normal bra , the feather in the hat is small and lies flat because of the packaging , and packaging states that it comes with a choker but my package had no choker . It ships from another company so it is not as easy to return as most Amazon items . Choose something else !!!!!!
 Item was a little flimsy ... and sizing was not correct ... We ordered an extra large , just in case of shrinkage , but the t-shirt seemed already shrunk , possibly to a size Medium.Not really pleased with item .
 These ones have no pockets ! A small gripe in comparison to the following . . I purchased five different colors of these shorts at the same time and they were all delivered together . The problem is that they are all different sizes of the same size , if you get my meaning . When I order LG , I want them all to be LG , regarless of what the label says . I have some that go down the my knees , others that are 4-6 inches above the knee . . No consistancy at all . They were made in a couple different countries -LRB- El Salvador , Haiti and the Dominican Republic to be exact -RRB- , but measurements should be the same everywhere -LRB- I thought -RRB- .
 Whatever it says is the material , this is made of hard stuff that is not comfortable . These pants look odd and they are odd . Also , this is certainly not relaxed fit as advertised . The one I received was way too small , not the stated size . I returned them . Be forewarned .
 the cap looks good however it really is made for a child - i gave the hat away as a gift .

 Its a nice one , but it says the wrong size , I bought it as medium , but ist so big that is almost an extra large .

 I bought this belt from another website , but it is in the same packaging & same thing as listed above . It is very poorly made and if I had bought it in a store I would be returning it . It looks like something you would get at the dollar store but worse . It looks like it was made in a bad mold , and then quickly sewn on velcro & snaps which look like they might fall off . I would agree with the other reviewer , it smells funky . Save your $ and get something from the store instead .
 Do not waste your money on this . It 's very poorly made , imported from China and gives off a strong toxic chemical smell that will give you an instant headache . I would n't recommend this at ALL for children , despite what the product information says . Give this one a fast pass .
 I ordered three different styles of Docker 's pants , all in size 34x32 -LRB- the other being Dockers Men 's Pleated Original Khaki and Dockers Men 's Pleated Never Iron Cotton Khaki -RRB- . The other two fit fine -LRB- and I regularlywear 34x32 pants -RRB- , whereas this one is distinctly smaller both in waist size and inseam . Worse , since `` too small '' is viewed by Amazon as a customer error even though the problem clearly lies in the product itself , they want me to pay for the return shipping !
 The stitching on the left front pocket was defective . I repaired it myself rather than spend the time and effort to return it . I love the style and fit of this these pants but I wish the vendor would do some QC before shipping the item . This does n't promote repeat business .
 I have had it with all the overseas made slacks running small that I have ordered on Amazon . This is my third order of slacks . When I bought Dockers a couple years ago , they were Stain Defenders size 36x32 and they still fit me perfectly . This is the third order of of various types of slacks I ordered this year size 36x32 that have not fit properly . These are far smaller than 36x32 . If you order a size larger they might fit you , but I do n't think it proper that the sizes are off like this in the first place . The three pair I received from Flat-front Classic Fit Original Khaki with Individual Fit -LRB- tm -RRB- Waistband order were made in the Dominican Republic . One other thing . I just got in some slacks from JC Penney size 36x32 and they fit just fine .
 These Dockers pants look expensive , are heavier cotton , and they are color-fast . At $ 70.00 - $ 80.00 a pair , they are overpriced . I bought a pair of Dockers several years ago , and after only 4 months of wear -LRB- 2 or 3 times a week -RRB- , they frayed , and I could no longer wear them . I did not buy another pair until recently , as the material looked heavier and harder-wearing . I bought a pair , and this time around it frayed in even more places , and has completely fallen apart . This is one case where paying more for a product does not guarantee quality . Save your hard earned dollars for other brands .
 This is a solid well-made casual pair of pants . But from the first few daysof wear and from the first careful wash wrinkles were everywhere . Maybethe exact phrase `` wrinke-free '' as in some Van Heusen shirts is a moreaccurate phrase to look for when trying to find clothing that wrinkles less.Also it is advertised as `` stretch '' but does not and thelabel says `` 2 % spandex .

They were made in a couple different countries -LRB- El Salvador , Haiti and the Dominican Republic to be exact -RRB- , but measurements should be the same everywhere -LRB- I thought -RRB- .
 The size . The inseam was 26 inches . Stated 30 . The waist to shoulder was to long.the crotch hung down , had bund over to reach the pocket .
 Whatever it says is the material , this is made of hard stuff that is not comfortable . These pants look odd and they are odd . Also , this is certainly not relaxed fit as advertised . The one I received was way too small , not the stated size . I returned them . Be forewarned .
 honestly , this product was not that great for a few reasons . First
 The size . The inseam was 26 inches . Stated 30 . The waist to shoulder was to long.the crotch hung down , had bund over to reach the pocket .
 Ordered 2 pair , same size as I currently wear . I tried them on when they came in . Fit was more snug than other pairs of Dockers I have in the same size . When I went to wear one of the pairs to work , and removed the labels , I noticed the finish work on the button holes to be very poor . Extra thead hang off . Uneven stiching . My reaction was that these were `` seconds '' . Not first quality merchandise . Will be returning them No excuse for this poor quality . Buying manufacturer 's seconds is one thing , IF you know that is what you are getting .
 The length and waist are a little shorter/smaller than the same size pants from other manufacturers .
 I ordered three different styles of Docker 's pants , all in size 34x32 -LRB- the other being Dockers Men 's Pleated Original Khaki and Dockers Men 's Pleated Never Iron Cotton Khaki -RRB- . The other two fit fine -LRB- and I regularlywear 34x32 pants -RRB- , whereas this one is distinctly smaller both in waist size and inseam . Worse , since `` too small '' is viewed by Amazon as a customer error even though the problem clearly lies in the product itself , they want me to pay for the return shipping !
 The stitching on the left front pocket was defective . I repaired it myself rather than spend the time and effort to return it . I love the style and fit of this these pants but I wish the vendor would do some QC before shipping the item . This does n't promote repeat business .
 I have had it with all the overseas made slacks running small that I have ordered on Amazon . This is my third order of slacks . When I bought Dockers a couple years ago , they were Stain Defenders size 36x32 and they still fit me perfectly . This is the third order of of various types of slacks I ordered this year size 36x32 that have not fit properly . These are far smaller than 36x32 . If you order a size larger they might fit you , but I do n't think it proper that the sizes are off like this in the first place . The three pair I received from Flat-front Classic Fit Original Khaki with Individual Fit -LRB- tm -RRB- Waistband order were made in the Dominican Republic . One other thing . I just got in some slacks from JC Penney size 36x32 and they fit just fine .
 These Dockers pants look expensive , are heavier cotton , and they are color-fast . At $ 70.00 - $ 80.00 a pair , they are overpriced . I bought a pair of Dockers several years ago , and after only 4 months of wear -LRB- 2 or 3 times a week -RRB- , they frayed , and I could no longer wear them . I did not buy another pair until recently , as the material looked heavier and harder-wearing . I bought a pair , and this time around it frayed in even more places , and has completely fallen apart . This is one case where paying more for a product does not guarantee quality . Save your hard earned dollars for other brands .
 This is a solid well-made casual pair of pants . But from the first few daysof wear and from the first careful wash wrinkles were everywhere . Maybethe exact phrase `` wrinke-free '' as in some Van Heusen shirts is a moreaccurate phrase to look for when trying to find clothing that wrinkles less.Also it is advertised as `` stretch '' but does not and thelabel says `` 2 % spandex .

 Dockers ? Flat-front Classic Fit Original Khaki with Individual Fit -LRB- tm -RRB- WaistbandOrdered thru Macys for husband as work slacks . Pants rec 'd were not made of the same soft cotton fabric as ones we had bought in stores previously . Scratchy , stiff and seem to attract lint and hair . One pair had been re-hemmed -LRB- very poorly -RRB- . Very disappointed but had to keep and use because he needed for his job .

 These ones have no pockets ! A small gripe in comparison to the following . . I purchased five different colors of these shorts at the same time and they were all delivered together . The problem is that they are all different sizes of the same size , if you get my meaning . When I order LG , I want them all to be LG , regarless of what the label says . I have some that go down the my knees , others that are 4-6 inches above the knee . . No consistancy at all . They were made in a couple different countries -LRB- El Salvador , Haiti and the Dominican Republic to be exact -RRB- , but measurements should be the same everywhere -LRB- I thought -RRB- .

 In short , here 's why I returned it .1 . Embossing uneven .2 . Inner pocket blocked by `` made in China '' label and bent my business cards .4 . Front three card holders are too shallow and expose cards .5 . Bill holder is attached on the wrong side , magnet is weak , & it only holds two twenties .6 . It 's just too big . Like holding a deck of cards in your pocket.Look to Bey-Berk for a solid , simple , well made product .

 Dockers ? Flat-front Classic Fit Original Khaki with Individual Fit -LRB- tm -RRB- WaistbandOrdered thru Macys for husband as work slacks . Pants rec 'd were not made of the same soft cotton fabric as ones we had bought in stores previously . Scratchy , stiff and seem to attract lint and hair . One pair had been re-hemmed -LRB- very poorly -RRB- . Very disappointed but had to keep and use because he needed for his job .
 Ordered 2 pair , same size as I currently wear . I tried them on when they came in . Fit was more snug than other pairs of Dockers I have in the same size . When I went to wear one of the pairs to work , and removed the labels , I noticed the finish work on the button holes to be very poor . Extra thead hang off . Uneven stiching . My reaction was that these were `` seconds '' . Not first quality merchandise . Will be returning them No excuse for this poor quality . Buying manufacturer 's seconds is one thing , IF you know that is what you are getting .
 The length and waist are a little shorter/smaller than the same size pants from other manufacturers .
 I ordered three different styles of Docker 's pants , all in size 34x32 -LRB- the other being Dockers Men 's Pleated Original Khaki and Dockers Men 's Pleated Never Iron Cotton Khaki -RRB- . The other two fit fine -LRB- and I regularlywear 34x32 pants -RRB- , whereas this one is distinctly smaller both in waist size and inseam . Worse , since `` too small '' is viewed by Amazon as a customer error even though the problem clearly lies in the product itself , they want me to pay for the return shipping !
 The stitching on the left front pocket was defective . I repaired it myself rather than spend the time and effort to return it . I love the style and fit of this these pants but I wish the vendor would do some QC before shipping the item . This does n't promote repeat business .
 I have had it with all the overseas made slacks running small that I have ordered on Amazon . This is my third order of slacks . When I bought Dockers a couple years ago , they were Stain Defenders size 36x32 and they still fit me perfectly . This is the third order of of various types of slacks I ordered this year size 36x32 that have not fit properly . These are far smaller than 36x32 . If you order a size larger they might fit you , but I do n't think it proper that the sizes are off like this in the first place . The three pair I received from Flat-front Classic Fit Original Khaki with Individual Fit -LRB- tm -RRB- Waistband order were made in the Dominican Republic . One other thing . I just got in some slacks from JC Penney size 36x32 and they fit just fine .
 These Dockers pants look expensive , are heavier cotton , and they are color-fast . At $ 70.00 - $ 80.00 a pair , they are overpriced . I bought a pair of Dockers several years ago , and after only 4 months of wear -LRB- 2 or 3 times a week -RRB- , they frayed , and I could no longer wear them . I did not buy another pair until recently , as the material looked heavier and harder-wearing . I bought a pair , and this time around it frayed in even more places , and has completely fallen apart . This is one case where paying more for a product does not guarantee quality .

 I got this gown in a much larger size than needed , but after the first washing it shrank horribly . Not only that , when it shrank it became all cockeyed too ! One of the side seams is now half way in the front of the gown . NOT PLEASED AT ALL !!!!!

 Whatever it says is the material , this is made of hard stuff that is not comfortable . These pants look odd and they are odd . Also , this is certainly not relaxed fit as advertised . The one I received was way too small , not the stated size . I returned them . Be forewarned .

 These ones have no pockets ! A small gripe in comparison to the following . . I purchased five different colors of these shorts at the same time and they were all delivered together . The problem is that they are all different sizes of the same size , if you get my meaning . When I order LG , I want them all to be LG , regarless of what the label says . I have some that go down the my knees , others that are 4-6 inches above the knee . . No consistancy at all . They were made in a couple different countries -LRB- El Salvador , Haiti and the Dominican Republic to be exact -RRB- , but measurements should be the same everywhere -LRB- I thought -RRB- .

 I have absolutely no complaint about Quality of Carhartt , excellent brand ! My complaint s about amazon return policy , I ordered this suit for my boyfriend birthday . I ordered for rush delivery also , I had to return this product for an exchange in size . I printed the return label , put the exchange form in the box for the correct size . However 2 days after I I shipped item back , I received an e - mail from amazon stating a refund would go back onto my card within 7 to 10 days . I called amazon , asked how come they could n't ship out my exchange . I was then told , we can only exchange the product for the exact size , and colored that you ordered . I thought how crazy is this return policy , if I wanted the same size & color why would I had returned the original item ! So what took me 5 minutes to locate on the website , two minutes to spend $ 142.77 + $ 8.98 shipping for what I thought was going to be a great gift for my boyfriend because he works outside , ending up being an experience from hell with Amazon Customer Service . In return for being a loyal customer for 8 non-stop years this is the thanks I get . I ordered the product on the 18th , paid rapid shipping received it on the 20th , sent item back on the 26 in new condition . Amazon told me , I have to wait 7 to 10 days for a refund , then ordered the product again , then wait 3 to 5 days to receive the correct size . 15 days people is how long this process is going to take . I 'd rather go to Carhartt website pay full price for the item , knowing that integrity is behind their name . Opposed to ever dealing with Amazon again , and the unprofessional staff in which is n't trained properly in custome service . One says , you 'll have your product within 3 days . The supervisor states ill have my product within 12 to 15 days , can this company get on one page . Public Viewrs & Customers please be aware of the manipulation of Amazon.comPast Loyal Customer ,

 I ordered three different styles of Docker 's pants , all in size 34x32 -LRB- the other being Dockers Men 's Pleated Original Khaki and Dockers Men 's Pleated Never Iron Cotton Khaki -RRB- . The other two fit fine -LRB- and I regularlywear 34x32 pants -RRB- , whereas this one is distinctly smaller both in waist size and inseam . Worse , since `` too small '' is viewed by Amazon as a customer error even though the problem clearly lies in the product itself , they want me to pay for the return shipping !
 The stitching on the left front pocket was defective . I repaired it myself rather than spend the time and effort to return it . I love the style and fit of this these pants but I wish the vendor would do some QC before shipping the item . This does n't promote repeat business .
 I have had it with all the overseas made slacks running small that I have ordered on Amazon . This is my third order of slacks . When I bought Dockers a couple years ago , they were Stain Defenders size 36x32 and they still fit me perfectly . This is the third order of of various types of slacks I ordered this year size 36x32 that have not fit properly . These are far smaller than 36x32 . If you order a size larger they might fit you , but I do n't think it proper that the sizes are off like this in the first place . The three pair I received from Flat-front Classic Fit Original Khaki with Individual Fit -LRB- tm -RRB- Waistband order were made in the Dominican Republic . One other thing . I just got in some slacks from JC Penney size 36x32 and they fit just fine .
 These Dockers pants look expensive , are heavier cotton , and they are color-fast . At $ 70.00 - $ 80.00 a pair , they are overpriced . I bought a pair of Dockers several years ago , and after only 4 months of wear -LRB- 2 or 3 times a week -RRB- , they frayed , and I could no longer wear them . I did not buy another pair until recently , as the material looked heavier and harder-wearing . I bought a pair , and this time around it frayed in even more places , and has completely fallen apart . This is one case where paying more for a product does not guarantee quality . Save your hard earned dollars for other brands .
 This is a solid well-made casual pair of pants . But from the first few daysof wear and from the first careful wash wrinkles were everywhere . Maybethe exact phrase `` wrinke-free '' as in some Van Heusen shirts is a moreaccurate phrase to look for when trying to find clothing that wrinkles less.Also it is advertised as `` stretch '' but does not and thelabel says `` 2 % spandex . ''
 Ordered 2 pair , same size as I currently wear . I tried them on when they came in . Fit was more snug than other pairs of Dockers I have in the same size . When I went to wear one of the pairs to work , and removed the labels , I noticed the finish work on the button holes to be very poor . Extra thead hang off . Uneven stiching . My reaction was that these were `` seconds '' . Not first quality merchandise . Will be returning them No excuse for this poor quality . Buying manufacturer 's seconds is one thing , IF you know that is what you are getting .
 The length and waist are a little shorter/smaller than the same size pants from other manufacturers .

 I have had the wallet for less than a month and the spring clip is already too weak to hold bills properly !
 A lot bigger than expected . The clip does n't hold the money very well and it 's a mess fumbling with the money trying to get it in and out of the wallet . I gave it a try for a couple weeks but never came to liking it so I gave it away and bought another style .
 The clip at the center of this money clip stopped working correctly after about a week . This was a waste of money .
 I purchased this to replace a similar wallet as it had a couple of extra card slots.It has a movable money clip metal insert . The clip opens wide to insert money then supposedly clips shut to hold it.Mine would not stay closed.I hate the hassles involved in returning an item so I did not file a claim or report this to the seller.I super glued it shut . It is quite loose now unless it has a lot of bills in it , but at least it is not flying open.I definitely prefer the clips that are fixed and made of a spring type metal
 The cash clip wallet holds a good number of credit cards and other inportant information . However , the metal clip that is to hold your cash in place will not stay clamped down . It pops up and the cash bills are just loose . It is too risky to try using it . It may work fine if you have very few credit cards to carry but that is not the case with me . I have personal and business credit cards , insurance cards , AAA card , etc. . The wallet just can not handle that much . I was disappointed in the product . If it is going to have all these slots for cards , it ought to be able to handle a full load .
 I have loved my HP 's in the past . I had numerous pairs and wore them often . I bought the big 5 pack because they were so great . I am 5 ' 5 '' and 125 lbs and they are just rotten baggy ... ugh , what a pain in the neck -- going to have to send these back ... why in the world they do n't offer sizes is beyond me ...

 These ones have no pockets ! A small gripe in comparison to the following . . I purchased five different colors of these shorts at the same time and they were all delivered together . The problem is that they are all different sizes of the same size , if you get my meaning . When I order LG , I want them all to be LG , regarless of what the label says . I have some that go down the my knees , others that are 4-6 inches above the knee . . No consistancy at all . They were made in a couple different countries -LRB- El Salvador , Haiti and the Dominican Republic to be exact -RRB- , but measurements should be the same everywhere -LRB- I thought -RRB- .
 Whatever it says is the material , this is made of hard stuff that is not comfortable . These pants look odd and they are odd . Also , this is certainly not relaxed fit as advertised . The one I received was way too small , not the stated size . I returned them . Be forewarned .

 I have absolutely no complaint about Quality of Carhartt , excellent brand ! My complaint s about amazon return policy , I ordered this suit for my boyfriend birthday . I ordered for rush delivery also , I had to return this product for an exchange in size . I printed the return label , put the exchange form in the box for the correct size . However 2 days after I I shipped item back , I received an e - mail from amazon stating a refund would go back onto my card within 7 to 10 days . I called amazon , asked how come they could n't ship out my exchange . I was then told , we can only exchange the product for the exact size , and colored that you ordered . I thought how crazy is this return policy , if I wanted the same size & color why would I had returned the original item ! So what took me 5 minutes to locate on the website , two minutes to spend $ 142.77 + $ 8.98 shipping for what I thought was going to be a great gift for my boyfriend because he works outside , ending up being an experience from hell with Amazon Customer Service . In return for being a loyal customer for 8 non-stop years this is the thanks I get . I ordered the product on the 18th , paid rapid shipping received it on the 20th , sent item back on the 26 in new condition . Amazon told me , I have to wait 7 to 10 days for a refund , then ordered the product again , then wait 3 to 5 days to receive the correct size . 15 days people is how long this process is going to take . I 'd rather go to Carhartt website pay full price for the item , knowing that integrity is behind their name . Opposed to ever dealing with Amazon again , and the unprofessional staff in which is n't trained properly in custome service . One says , you 'll have your product within 3 days . The supervisor states ill have my product within 12 to 15 days , can this company get on one page . Public Viewrs & Customers please be aware of the manipulation of Amazon.comPast Loyal Customer ,

One pair had been re-hemmed -LRB- very poorly -RRB- . Very disappointed but had to keep and use because he needed for his job .
 I ordered three different styles of Docker 's pants , all in size 34x32 -LRB- the other being Dockers Men 's Pleated Original Khaki and Dockers Men 's Pleated Never Iron Cotton Khaki -RRB- . The other two fit fine -LRB- and I regularlywear 34x32 pants -RRB- , whereas this one is distinctly smaller both in waist size and inseam . Worse , since `` too small '' is viewed by Amazon as a customer error even though the problem clearly lies in the product itself , they want me to pay for the return shipping !
 The stitching on the left front pocket was defective . I repaired it myself rather than spend the time and effort to return it . I love the style and fit of this these pants but I wish the vendor would do some QC before shipping the item . This does n't promote repeat business .
 I have had it with all the overseas made slacks running small that I have ordered on Amazon . This is my third order of slacks . When I bought Dockers a couple years ago , they were Stain Defenders size 36x32 and they still fit me perfectly . This is the third order of of various types of slacks I ordered this year size 36x32 that have not fit properly . These are far smaller than 36x32 . If you order a size larger they might fit you , but I do n't think it proper that the sizes are off like this in the first place . The three pair I received from Flat-front Classic Fit Original Khaki with Individual Fit -LRB- tm -RRB- Waistband order were made in the Dominican Republic . One other thing . I just got in some slacks from JC Penney size 36x32 and they fit just fine .
 These Dockers pants look expensive , are heavier cotton , and they are color-fast . At $ 70.00 - $ 80.00 a pair , they are overpriced . I bought a pair of Dockers several years ago , and after only 4 months of wear -LRB- 2 or 3 times a week -RRB- , they frayed , and I could no longer wear them . I did not buy another pair until recently , as the material looked heavier and harder-wearing . I bought a pair , and this time around it frayed in even more places , and has completely fallen apart . This is one case where paying more for a product does not guarantee quality . Save your hard earned dollars for other brands .
 This is a solid well-made casual pair of pants . But from the first few daysof wear and from the first careful wash wrinkles were everywhere . Maybethe exact phrase `` wrinke-free '' as in some Van Heusen shirts is a moreaccurate phrase to look for when trying to find clothing that wrinkles less.Also it is advertised as `` stretch '' but does not and thelabel says `` 2 % spandex . ''
 I wore these socks once to a wedding ; they had a `` run '' in them within a couple of hours . Admittedly it was an outdoor wedding , involving a longish walk on a dirt road , but it 's not as if I was crashing through the underbrush -LRB- I was wearing a nice outfit and had no desire to get messed up -RRB- . Bummer the socks got ruined so fast ; they were really pretty : - -LRB-
 Disposable shirt , wear once and throw away . Washed it and it literally began to fall apart and unravel . Not worth even the $ 5 bucks I paid for it .
 Whatever it says is the material , this is made of hard stuff that is not comfortable . These pants look odd and they are odd . Also , this is certainly not relaxed fit as advertised . The one I received was way too small , not the stated size . I returned them . Be forewarned .
 I have loved my HP 's in the past . I had numerous pairs and wore them often . I bought the big 5 pack because they were so great . I am 5 ' 5 '' and 125 lbs and they are just rotten baggy ... ugh , what a pain in the neck -- going to have to send these back ... why in the world they do n't offer sizes is beyond me ...
 I was not satisfied with my purchase and wanted to return the pants . There was no packing slip nor return info in the box . I accessed Amazon and through Amazon I was able to send an email to the supplier . I have still not gotten a response . In addition , it said I only had 20 days to resolve this . Great customer service , NOT !
 Ordered 2 pair , same size as I currently wear . I tried them on when they came in . Fit was more snug than other pairs of Dockers I have in the same size . When I went to wear one of the pairs to work , and removed the labels , I noticed the finish work on the button holes to be very poor . Extra thead hang off . Uneven stiching . My reaction was that these were `` seconds '' . Not first quality merchandise . Will be returning them No excuse for this poor quality . Buying manufacturer 's seconds is one thing , IF you know that is what you are getting .
 The length and waist are a little shorter/smaller than the same size pants from other manufacturers .

 A standard business card will not fit in any of the credit card slots except putting them in with the currency . That gets them dirty . The slots need to be about 1/4 inch longer
 The size . The inseam was 26 inches . Stated 30 . The waist to shoulder was to long.the crotch hung down , had bund over to reach the pocket .

 My son wanted to be Albert Einstein for Halloween -LRB- 2006 -RRB- . The `` Einstein Heroes in History Kit '' seemed like a good way to get started on his costume . It contained a white wig and mustache . The wig was fine , but the glue on the mustache had dried up completely , leaving a flaky yellow residue on the back . Well , what 's an Einstein costume without a mustache ? I bought some eyelash glue -LRB- $ 4.50 for a little bottle -RRB- , thinking that would solve the problem , but the strong smell was n't exactly a hit with my 11 year old , and he ended up getting a big red mark over his lip when I tried to apply it . He had to wear a sign that said `` I 'm Albert Einstein '' when he went trick-or-treating . I wore a wild brown wig and a sign that said `` I 'm Einstein 's mother '' when I gave out candy .
 Its a good wig . It just does n't look anything like the picture on the package . It is basically a bright white curly clown wig .
 The appearance of the wig and mustache was great , I actually used this item for my son in a church skit . My son actually portrayed some else . The wig was white so I had to dye it which really was n't a problem . The main issue I had was with the mustache it did not stick at all . This may seem minor to some but it meant a great deal to me . When I purchase a product I want the full use of it not partial .
 I was very disappointed in this product , especially the mustache . It looks absolutely nothing like the picture . It 's actually a tiny little rectangle with sparse fuzz on it . The wig is really curly , again the product photo was misleading .
 This item is advertised as a replica of the I dream of Jeannie bottle from the series of the same name . It 's an inflatible item as stated by the vendor . The problem is it 's very difficult to inflate and even when you do -LRB- and it takes a long time -RRB- it is not a `` replica '' of the I dream of Jeannie Bottle . It 's described in a mis-leading matter and after this I found a real replica and it 's night and day . This one I deflated but that sure did n't take long.I feel it 's also a high price between the tag price and shipping for what it is . It looks like something you 'd float in a pool .
 I was very disappointed in this item . I thought it was a `` bottle '' and it is `` just a balloon . '' If you can find a REAL Genie Bottle , I sure would be interested in looking at it .
 The bottle LOOKS pretty . . but it was very flimsy . It was for a Halloween costume . . so it served its purpose . . but I would n't waste my money on it again if I had the choice .
 Flimsy basket came apart and the handle came off the first day of play . My daughter asked why Toto looks scary . The stuffed toy dogs muzzle expression looks sort of frightening . Total waste of money .
 This was a waste of money . When I received it and took toto out of the basket he was Scary looking ! My daughter would have been petrified of him . They made him showing sharp teeth . He did n't look anything like toto at all .

 This is a solid well-made casual pair of pants . But from the first few daysof wear and from the first careful wash wrinkles were everywhere . Maybethe exact phrase `` wrinke-free '' as in some Van Heusen shirts is a moreaccurate phrase to look for when trying to find clothing that wrinkles less.Also it is advertised as `` stretch '' but does not and thelabel says `` 2 % spandex .

 Ordered 2 pair , same size as I currently wear . I tried them on when they came in . Fit was more snug than other pairs of Dockers I have in the same size . When I went to wear one of the pairs to work , and removed the labels , I noticed the finish work on the button holes to be very poor . Extra thead hang off . Uneven stiching . My reaction was that these were `` seconds '' . Not first quality merchandise . Will be returning them No excuse for this poor quality . Buying manufacturer 's seconds is one thing , IF you know that is what you are getting .
 The length and waist are a little shorter/smaller than the same size pants from other manufacturers .

 I ordered three different styles of Docker 's pants , all in size 34x32 -LRB- the other being Dockers Men 's Pleated Original Khaki and Dockers Men 's Pleated Never Iron Cotton Khaki -RRB- . The other two fit fine -LRB- and I regularlywear 34x32 pants -RRB- , whereas this one is distinctly smaller both in waist size and inseam . Worse , since `` too small '' is viewed by Amazon as a customer error even though the problem clearly lies in the product itself , they want me to pay for the return shipping !
 The stitching on the left front pocket was defective . I repaired it myself rather than spend the time and effort to return it . I love the style and fit of this these pants but I wish the vendor would do some QC before shipping the item . This does n't promote repeat business .
 I have had it with all the overseas made slacks running small that I have ordered on Amazon . This is my third order of slacks . When I bought Dockers a couple years ago , they were Stain Defenders size 36x32 and they still fit me perfectly . This is the third order of of various types of slacks I ordered this year size 36x32 that have not fit properly . These are far smaller than 36x32 . If you order a size larger they might fit you , but I do n't think it proper that the sizes are off like this in the first place . The three pair I received from Flat-front Classic Fit Original Khaki with Individual Fit -LRB- tm -RRB- Waistband order were made in the Dominican Republic . One other thing . I just got in some slacks from JC Penney size 36x32 and they fit just fine .
 These Dockers pants look expensive , are heavier cotton , and they are color-fast . At $ 70.00 - $ 80.00 a pair , they are overpriced . I bought a pair of Dockers several years ago , and after only 4 months of wear -LRB- 2 or 3 times a week -RRB- , they frayed , and I could no longer wear them . I did not buy another pair until recently , as the material looked heavier and harder-wearing .

 Dockers ? Flat-front Classic Fit Original Khaki with Individual Fit -LRB- tm -RRB- WaistbandOrdered thru Macys for husband as work slacks . Pants rec 'd were not made of the same soft cotton fabric as ones we had bought in stores previously . Scratchy , stiff and seem to attract lint and hair .

 Costume is made very cheaply , and the head piece tore as i took it out of the package . I wouldnt recommend this particular brand of costume if you plan on using this for more than one event .
 As soon as we took it out of the package , one of the `` hair buns '' fell right off . It also looks like the other one will soon . So we 're already sewing it to fix it . We 'll also have to make some kind of chin strap for it , because like one of the previous posters said , it 's way too big for a newborn . When we ordered it , we we 're on the fence on which size to get . We decided on the smaller one . It turns out the smaller one is even way too big . I ca n't imagine the land of giant babies where these must have been made . So , yeah , its cute , but it looks like they spent $ 1.50 on the materials and had a 2 year old sew it .
 I bought the smallest size for my little girl 's first Halloween . She was born in May and has been in the 75th percentile all the way . So I was very surprised when I received this costume and it was HUGE on her . I even double checked the packaging , sure they had sent me the Infant -LRB- 6-12 month -RRB- in error . Nope . Although she was 5 months old , the costume went a good twelve inches past her feet . So , we ended up getting a different costume for her for this year and hope she 'll be able to wear it next year .

 I wore these socks once to a wedding ; they had a `` run '' in them within a couple of hours . Admittedly it was an outdoor wedding , involving a longish walk on a dirt road , but it 's not as if I was crashing through the underbrush -LRB- I was wearing a nice outfit and had no desire to get messed up -RRB- . Bummer the socks got ruined so fast ; they were really pretty : - -LRB-
 I hated this tank top ! I bought several different colors and the material is awful . It is like nylon and lint gets stuck all over it ! I normally buy camis to layer my clothes and wo n't buy this ever again .
 I like the picture , but I ordered it yellow , it came neon green and it had a hole in the corner on the bottom . Not worth the cost .
 Not only does it not hold anything , but if you try to put a `` normal '' amount of cards into it , it then pulls away from the frame . I really had hoped this would be a wallet that I could use for years .
 i was very excited about this wallet , and very sad when i had to return it . the leather on the exterior and the interior lining are beautiful ... but once i put in my ID and ATM cards - which did n't even fill half of the available card slots - the wallet was too full to close ! the wallet is larger than i would prefer , but i did not mind when i ordered it because it looks like it holds so much , but if you want to be able to close it , you seriously can not put more than your ID and a few dollars in it . what a shame .
 As long as you do n't need real Army PT gear , these are fine . My son joined the Army in Jan 2007 and was issued a set of PT gear for basic training that he described as grey sweats with the black lettering `` ARMY '' on the chest and pant leg . He had lost his set in the laundry . I ordered these , but he could n't use them . He said they could n't pass for the real thing .

 Results are in
 I 'm very disappointed on the quality of this product . It was nice while it lasted 1 hour the most ! I wish I could get my money back .
 Year after year they never , EVER have an adult Spider-Man costume that includes gloves and boots . Is it really that difficult to include those as well ? I mean , come on !
 A one time , maybe 2 uses you will get as the fabric is inferior ; has many `` runs '' - like in your nylon stockings , so there is no repairing that can be done to it . Seems to be made the same as a childs ' costume only bigger ? For an adult we expected it would have been manufactured with a higher quality fabric/design .
 the sizes run to small . for example , my girl wheres a small size in everything and this was way to small !
 I am really disappointed with the sun helmet I ordered . The sun helmet I received was completely different from my previous sun helmet . The shape and size of the brim and the light weight of this helmet allows the wind blows it up and off my head . I have the velcro strap over as far as it will go and the hat is still not secure enough on my head to keep it from blowing up . I am trying to figure out a way to fix it so that it will be usable . Any suggestions are welcome . Doris Ainsworth
 This costume is cute in the picture , but not in person . It says that it will fit up to a size 14 , however it does n't even come close . The head band was broken . Very poorly made .
 the best thing about this wig was the two cute barrettes that came with it . The size is too large for children , the bangs are awful and it was so itchy my daughter could n't wear it on Halloween . No more wigs on-line for us !
 It is adorable but wo n't stay on her head . Band is tooo big . Wish I had known it was flat and unsupported . Made both Grandmother and Princess unhappy . On to find one more crown-like , that will rest a little more on top of her head .
 My neice loved the headband but had to take it off for it kept falling off . It matched her outfit perfectly .
 We put this on our daughter 's wishlist because she loves to dress up and a flashing crown seemed like a great idea . I did n't expect it to be great , but I was surprised by how cheap it was . The feathers immediately come off . The button to turn it on and off does n't function very well . The flash is ok , but does n't match the tiara . All in all , it is cheap and not worth the money .
 This comes in several little pieces and the quality was absolutely horrible - cheapest thinnest material that looked and felt poor . Huge disappointment - we never even wore it . Pieces were lost immediately .
 I bought this little red riding hood costume from Costume Craze going by the sizing chart they gave . When I got the costume , it was too small for my daughter . I contacted the company to exchange the item because they misinformed me about its actual size , and they refused to pay the shipping and handling to return the item . I will never buy from Costume Craze again !!!
 I bought this costume for my daughter , and I realized very soon that it was a huge mistake . The material is very cheap , and she could n't wear it twice . However , for the price you pay , it 's worth a shot as a disposable costume .
 I ordered this , thinking I could improve upon it to make it a little better . Not worth it . I ended up using an entirely different costume . IT DOES N'T LOOK LIKE THE IMAGE !! Do n't waste your money or time on this
 This product was okay to wear once ; they fit me okay at first but by the end of the day , the material stretched creating unflattering wrinkles in the pelvic area . Too pricy for what they 're worth . I would n't recommend them .

 The length and waist are a little shorter/smaller than the same size pants from other manufacturers .
 These shorts are very thin and offer little coverage at the gym . Perfect for exhibitionists . The waistband is unattractive , I would never wear them without a t-shirt hanging over the waist .
 I purchased 3 pairs of these shorts to replace a favorite pair I purchased 2-3 years ago . The new shorts were made of VERY THIN material . I dried them on low heat - they shrunk significantly and I ca n't wear them .
 The shorts were a good fit for the first wear but shrunk down to almost unwearable with one wash . If you are going to buy this product -LRB- which I would n't recommend -RRB- , buy at least a size larger than you normally would !
 The item I received has a very wide waistband . This is not how it is pictured in the photograph . Also , the waistband is too wide -LRB- and not teamed with elastic -RRB- , just a drawcord . As a result , the fit is quite , quite poor ; there is very little adjusting one can do without the waistband bunching up . Result = poor fit . Quite disappointing and MISLEADING promotional photograph .
 The shorts were fine but not at all the quality I expected . They were much thinner than the ones I was trying to replace . They were also a very dull color of gray compared to the usual , light gray color .

The other two fit fine -LRB- and I regularlywear 34x32 pants -RRB- , whereas this one is distinctly smaller both in waist size and inseam . Worse , since `` too small '' is viewed by Amazon as a customer error even though the problem clearly lies in the product itself , they want me to pay for the return shipping !
 The stitching on the left front pocket was defective . I repaired it myself rather than spend the time and effort to return it . I love the style and fit of this these pants but I wish the vendor would do some QC before shipping the item . This does n't promote repeat business .
 I have had it with all the overseas made slacks running small that I have ordered on Amazon . This is my third order of slacks . When I bought Dockers a couple years ago , they were Stain Defenders size 36x32 and they still fit me perfectly . This is the third order of of various types of slacks I ordered this year size 36x32 that have not fit properly . These are far smaller than 36x32 . If you order a size larger they might fit you , but I do n't think it proper that the sizes are off like this in the first place . The three pair I received from Flat-front Classic Fit Original Khaki with Individual Fit -LRB- tm -RRB- Waistband order were made in the Dominican Republic . One other thing . I just got in some slacks from JC Penney size 36x32 and they fit just fine .
 These Dockers pants look expensive , are heavier cotton , and they are color-fast . At $ 70.00 - $ 80.00 a pair , they are overpriced . I bought a pair of Dockers several years ago , and after only 4 months of wear -LRB- 2 or 3 times a week -RRB- , they frayed , and I could no longer wear them . I did not buy another pair until recently , as the material looked heavier and harder-wearing . I bought a pair , and this time around it frayed in even more places , and has completely fallen apart . This is one case where paying more for a product does not guarantee quality . Save your hard earned dollars for other brands .
 This is a solid well-made casual pair of pants . But from the first few daysof wear and from the first careful wash wrinkles were everywhere . Maybethe exact phrase `` wrinke-free '' as in some Van Heusen shirts is a moreaccurate phrase to look for when trying to find clothing that wrinkles less.Also it is advertised as `` stretch '' but does not and thelabel says `` 2 % spandex . ''
 I ordered this for my son for Halloween - it 's a standard , inexpensive costume , but it does not come with the axe in the picture - very dissappointing , especially since it 's only 5 days until Halloween !
 very very unhappy ... i received 2 pairs of what was supposed to be the same jean , both were supposed to be of beige color ????? not ! one was beige the othe a off black color ! ... and also looked as id someone had tried them on and took them off and left the legs inside out and THAT is how the company had the audacity to ship it to me ... i will NEVER PURCHASE PRODUCTS FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN !
 Yikes ! The quality is awful and the fit was just bizzare . Skirt is absolutely nothing like the picture ; it is very short -LRB- does n't even pass the crotch of the bodysuit -RRB- . The bodice fit nicely but the sleeve holes were so tiny you could barely fit a marker through them much less my daughter 's skinny little arm . Sleeve and skirt material is super flimsy . After the sleeves tore to shreds when we tried it on , I managed to cut them open and trim with ribbon to open the arm holes and fix the damage but the material is so shoddy it would barely hold a stitch . Then I had to sew on a full skirt so my little girl would n't be trick or treating in a bathing suit ! Also had to cut off the extremely tacky and dented plastic brooch on the front . If we had more time I would have replaced it ; it ended up looking okay but for all the work I put in I could have made one from scratch . Just awful !
 Ordered 2 pair , same size as I currently wear . I tried them on when they came in . Fit was more snug than other pairs of Dockers I have in the same size . When I went to wear one of the pairs to work , and removed the labels , I noticed the finish work on the button holes to be very poor . Extra thead hang off . Uneven stiching . My reaction was that these were `` seconds '' . Not first quality merchandise . Will be returning them No excuse for this poor quality . Buying manufacturer 's seconds is one thing , IF you know that is what you are getting .
 The length and waist are a little shorter/smaller than the same size pants from other manufacturers .

 This is a solid well-made casual pair of pants . But from the first few daysof wear and from the first careful wash wrinkles were everywhere . Maybethe exact phrase `` wrinke-free '' as in some Van Heusen shirts is a moreaccurate phrase to look for when trying to find clothing that wrinkles less.Also it is advertised as `` stretch '' but does not and thelabel says `` 2 % spandex . ''
 Ordered 2 pair , same size as I currently wear . I tried them on when they came in . Fit was more snug than other pairs of Dockers I have in the same size . When I went to wear one of the pairs to work , and removed the labels , I noticed the finish work on the button holes to be very poor . Extra thead hang off . Uneven stiching . My reaction was that these were `` seconds '' . Not first quality merchandise . Will be returning them No excuse for this poor quality . Buying manufacturer 's seconds is one thing , IF you know that is what you are getting .
 The length and waist are a little shorter/smaller than the same size pants from other manufacturers .
 I ordered three different styles of Docker 's pants , all in size 34x32 -LRB- the other being Dockers Men 's Pleated Original Khaki and Dockers Men 's Pleated Never Iron Cotton Khaki -RRB- . The other two fit fine -LRB- and I regularlywear 34x32 pants -RRB- , whereas this one is distinctly smaller both in waist size and inseam . Worse , since `` too small '' is viewed by Amazon as a customer error even though the problem clearly lies in the product itself , they want me to pay for the return shipping !
 The stitching on the left front pocket was defective . I repaired it myself rather than spend the time and effort to return it . I love the style and fit of this these pants but I wish the vendor would do some QC before shipping the item . This does n't promote repeat business .
 I have had it with all the overseas made slacks running small that I have ordered on Amazon . This is my third order of slacks . When I bought Dockers a couple years ago , they were Stain Defenders size 36x32 and they still fit me perfectly . This is the third order of of various types of slacks I ordered this year size 36x32 that have not fit properly . These are far smaller than 36x32 . If you order a size larger they might fit you , but I do n't think it proper that the sizes are off like this in the first place . The three pair I received from Flat-front Classic Fit Original Khaki with Individual Fit -LRB- tm -RRB- Waistband order were made in the Dominican Republic . One other thing . I just got in some slacks from JC Penney size 36x32 and they fit just fine .
 These Dockers pants look expensive , are heavier cotton , and they are color-fast . At $ 70.00 - $ 80.00 a pair , they are overpriced . I bought a pair of Dockers several years ago , and after only 4 months of wear -LRB- 2 or 3 times a week -RRB- , they frayed , and I could no longer wear them . I did not buy another pair until recently , as the material looked heavier and harder-wearing .

 Dockers ? Flat-front Classic Fit Original Khaki with Individual Fit -LRB- tm -RRB- WaistbandOrdered thru Macys for husband as work slacks . Pants rec 'd were not made of the same soft cotton fabric as ones we had bought in stores previously . Scratchy , stiff and seem to attract lint and hair . One pair had been re-hemmed -LRB- very poorly -RRB- . Very disappointed but had to keep and use because he needed for his job .

 I am a medium ... I have been a medium for about 20 years . This medium fits me as if it wree a large or even an extra large . I also wish that the tag was non-existent -LRB- as other moisture wicking t-shirts have evolved towards -RRB- . Good price ... Yet you might want to keep looking .
 Sized a little too big for me other than that I guess I need to grow into itWhich can be used to motivate

 The quality of this backpack is rather poor and comparable to many that are sold at Walmart for $ 15.00 , so I paid twice as much ! The bottom fabric is not sturdy enough to take the daily cramming of schoolbooks , and i doubt will last more than 3-4 months . Actually , I did find one backpack at Walmart that did have a pretty sturdy bottom about a year and a half ago for only $ 15.00 ; it finally wore out and since it is n't the beginning of the school year , Walmart 's stock of backpacks is too limited at this time . That 's why I thought I 'd try to buy one online . I 'll never do that again . Some things should only be bought in person .

 I just bought this laptop backpack so taht I could carry my powerbook along with books . I expected the laptop slot to be padded on the bottom , the most important place for padding since you put your bookbag down all the time . I always gently put the bag down ... yet I still ended up getting a DENT in my brand new laptop . I 've been carrying the laptop around in non-laptop bags , and have n't had any problems , so I expected no problems with a bag that was designed to carry a laptop.other than that , it 's a pretty bag w / lots of compartments , so it 's great as a regular bookbag . . but the laptop slot seems to do nothing .

One pair had been re-hemmed -LRB- very poorly -RRB- . Very disappointed but had to keep and use because he needed for his job .
 Ordered 2 pair , same size as I currently wear . I tried them on when they came in . Fit was more snug than other pairs of Dockers I have in the same size . When I went to wear one of the pairs to work , and removed the labels , I noticed the finish work on the button holes to be very poor . Extra thead hang off . Uneven stiching . My reaction was that these were `` seconds '' . Not first quality merchandise . Will be returning them No excuse for this poor quality . Buying manufacturer 's seconds is one thing , IF you know that is what you are getting .
 The length and waist are a little shorter/smaller than the same size pants from other manufacturers .
 I ordered three different styles of Docker 's pants , all in size 34x32 -LRB- the other being Dockers Men 's Pleated Original Khaki and Dockers Men 's Pleated Never Iron Cotton Khaki -RRB- . The other two fit fine -LRB- and I regularlywear 34x32 pants -RRB- , whereas this one is distinctly smaller both in waist size and inseam . Worse , since `` too small '' is viewed by Amazon as a customer error even though the problem clearly lies in the product itself , they want me to pay for the return shipping !
 The stitching on the left front pocket was defective . I repaired it myself rather than spend the time and effort to return it . I love the style and fit of this these pants but I wish the vendor would do some QC before shipping the item . This does n't promote repeat business .
 I have had it with all the overseas made slacks running small that I have ordered on Amazon . This is my third order of slacks . When I bought Dockers a couple years ago , they were Stain Defenders size 36x32 and they still fit me perfectly . This is the third order of of various types of slacks I ordered this year size 36x32 that have not fit properly . These are far smaller than 36x32 . If you order a size larger they might fit you , but I do n't think it proper that the sizes are off like this in the first place . The three pair I received from Flat-front Classic Fit Original Khaki with Individual Fit -LRB- tm -RRB- Waistband order were made in the Dominican Republic . One other thing . I just got in some slacks from JC Penney size 36x32 and they fit just fine .
 These Dockers pants look expensive , are heavier cotton , and they are color-fast . At $ 70.00 - $ 80.00 a pair , they are overpriced . I bought a pair of Dockers several years ago , and after only 4 months of wear -LRB- 2 or 3 times a week -RRB- , they frayed , and I could no longer wear them . I did not buy another pair until recently , as the material looked heavier and harder-wearing . I bought a pair , and this time around it frayed in even more places , and has completely fallen apart . This is one case where paying more for a product does not guarantee quality . Save your hard earned dollars for other brands .
 This is a solid well-made casual pair of pants . But from the first few daysof wear and from the first careful wash wrinkles were everywhere . Maybethe exact phrase `` wrinke-free '' as in some Van Heusen shirts is a moreaccurate phrase to look for when trying to find clothing that wrinkles less.Also it is advertised as `` stretch '' but does not and thelabel says `` 2 % spandex .

 This was much bigger and heavier than expected ; virtually no different than the regular `` NON-Flat '' folding umbrellas . I was expecting the small , light ones that were in the stores.I 'm sure as an umbrella it 's fine .

The three pair I received from Flat-front Classic Fit Original Khaki with Individual Fit -LRB- tm -RRB- Waistband order were made in the Dominican Republic . One other thing . I just got in some slacks from JC Penney size 36x32 and they fit just fine .
 These Dockers pants look expensive , are heavier cotton , and they are color-fast . At $ 70.00 - $ 80.00 a pair , they are overpriced . I bought a pair of Dockers several years ago , and after only 4 months of wear -LRB- 2 or 3 times a week -RRB- , they frayed , and I could no longer wear them . I did not buy another pair until recently , as the material looked heavier and harder-wearing . I bought a pair , and this time around it frayed in even more places , and has completely fallen apart . This is one case where paying more for a product does not guarantee quality . Save your hard earned dollars for other brands .
 This is a solid well-made casual pair of pants . But from the first few daysof wear and from the first careful wash wrinkles were everywhere . Maybethe exact phrase `` wrinke-free '' as in some Van Heusen shirts is a moreaccurate phrase to look for when trying to find clothing that wrinkles less.Also it is advertised as `` stretch '' but does not and thelabel says `` 2 % spandex .

 The size 52 is like 38 or 36 . I had to send it back .
 Dockers ? Flat-front Classic Fit Original Khaki with Individual Fit -LRB- tm -RRB- WaistbandOrdered thru Macys for husband as work slacks . Pants rec 'd were not made of the same soft cotton fabric as ones we had bought in stores previously . Scratchy , stiff and seem to attract lint and hair . One pair had been re-hemmed -LRB- very poorly -RRB- . Very disappointed but had to keep and use because he needed for his job .
 I ordered three different styles of Docker 's pants , all in size 34x32 -LRB- the other being Dockers Men 's Pleated Original Khaki and Dockers Men 's Pleated Never Iron Cotton Khaki -RRB- . The other two fit fine -LRB- and I regularlywear 34x32 pants -RRB- , whereas this one is distinctly smaller both in waist size and inseam . Worse , since `` too small '' is viewed by Amazon as a customer error even though the problem clearly lies in the product itself , they want me to pay for the return shipping !
 The stitching on the left front pocket was defective . I repaired it myself rather than spend the time and effort to return it . I love the style and fit of this these pants but I wish the vendor would do some QC before shipping the item . This does n't promote repeat business .

 Ordered 2 pair , same size as I currently wear . I tried them on when they came in . Fit was more snug than other pairs of Dockers I have in the same size . When I went to wear one of the pairs to work , and removed the labels , I noticed the finish work on the button holes to be very poor . Extra thead hang off . Uneven stiching . My reaction was that these were `` seconds '' . Not first quality merchandise . Will be returning them No excuse for this poor quality . Buying manufacturer 's seconds is one thing , IF you know that is what you are getting .
 The length and waist are a little shorter/smaller than the same size pants from other manufacturers .

 Hello - I bought 2 bad kitty keychains for $ 4 bucks each , they arrive with a huge price label on both , impossible to remove . SO basically , only one side of the keychain was cute , the other side was gross - DUH ! Why would they do that ! FRUSTRATING

 I ordered this slip for my daughter , it was not at all as pictured . It was cheaply made and the material was very poor quality . When I went to return it I found out there was a $ 15.00 restock fee , -LRB- WHICH IS N'T MENTIONED ON THE ORDER SITE -RRB- plus I had to pay to ship it back . SO I AM OUT $ 20.00 FOR A $ 39.00 SLIP THAT I CAN NOT , NOR WOULD NOT USE BECAUSE OF THE SUBSTANDARD QUALITY . DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME !
 The petticoat arrived a day late for the party for which my granddaughter had ordered it . It was terribly scratchy and too long , so , even if it had arrived on time , she would n't have been able to wear it . I wish she had n't opened it because now I ca n't find the paper work to return it .
 I bought 2 of these bras , and only got one use out of EACH bra!The zipper broke on each bra , on the first time I wore them . First of all , the zipper did not fasten securely at the top where it should fasten nicely , and then the zipper was made so poorly that it broke off on each bra.I am thoroughy disappointed in this product .
 The middle of the right front pocket was riveted to the right pant leg . The jeans were unwearable . These pants were definitely defective .
 The material was very cheap and not lasting . For the amount of money , it could have been a little more durable . The color was kind of pretty.States the bottom is a thong - Incorrect - It is a string bikini . I felt like was was misled and paid too much for what it actually turned out to be .
 I MIGHT buy it fir less than 10 bucks.Cheap material . Cheap construction .
 The musette bag that arrived -LSB- ... -RSB- was constructed of flimsy nylon with one tiny strap to hold it together . It looks NOTHING AT ALL like the picture !!! Bait and switch ! There is no cotton canvas at all . It 's a very thin nylon , so thin you can see right through it . It looks like a cheap little thing one might pick up at a dollar store . It 's useless !
 I purchased 3 pairs of these shorts to replace a favorite pair I purchased 2-3 years ago . The new shorts were made of VERY THIN material . I dried them on low heat - they shrunk significantly and I ca n't wear them .
 The shorts were a good fit for the first wear but shrunk down to almost unwearable with one wash . If you are going to buy this product -LRB- which I would n't recommend -RRB- , buy at least a size larger than you normally would !
 The item I received has a very wide waistband . This is not how it is pictured in the photograph . Also , the waistband is too wide -LRB- and not teamed with elastic -RRB- , just a drawcord . As a result , the fit is quite , quite poor ; there is very little adjusting one can do without the waistband bunching up . Result = poor fit . Quite disappointing and MISLEADING promotional photograph .
 The shorts were fine but not at all the quality I expected . They were much thinner than the ones I was trying to replace . They were also a very dull color of gray compared to the usual , light gray color .
 These shorts are very thin and offer little coverage at the gym . Perfect for exhibitionists . The waistband is unattractive , I would never wear them without a t-shirt hanging over the waist .
 I have previously owned 2 of these but now it is larger . The wrist is about 1 '' larger in diameter and it about 3/4 '' wider . The material is also lighter . I prefer the earlier type . I love the arm pocket concept and I have worn one daily for about 5 years in place of carrying a purse , but this is too large for me and I have worn out the old one . I will miss it !!
 The item that I wanted was OUT OF STOCK , they contacted me when I started wondering about my security arm pocket , they told me that I had a choice , that they were expecting the item for `` next week '' or I could cancel my order , I told them that I could wait for 2 weeks but they should tell me if they did not have the item for me to cancel . approximately 2 weeks went by and I asked again and they told me that all of the items came with an exception of the arm pocket , the I decided to e-mail and cancel my order , they were nice , and andwered back -LRB- fast -RRB- that the order was canceled , then I got another e-mail by amazon that they were going to credit my money back to my card , it went fast , and the money is at the bank.The only bad thing about this is when you are buying , you get your confirmation about the product , you think that it should be on its way ... . they do not say that they are out of stock , THAT I DID NOT LIKE ... and you are waiting and waiting with no idea that the product is not on its way ... they should tell us immediately , if people do not ask , they could be waiting for some time to get the product of their choice .
 Great quality fabric and construction but very uncomfortable to wear , which is most important . There are far better values in boxer briefs available .
 Watch out ! Once you place this order , you ca n't go back and change it . Amazon is now allowing other vendors to sell their products on Amazon . While Amazon gets your money and sends it to the vender , it does not provide the ability to you to change or cancel an order ; you have to contact the vendors directly yourself , which can be quite troublesome as each vendor has a different method and policy . If you think you are dealing with Amazon , think again !
 These did nothing special and they started to come apart almost immediately . I certainly hope that these are not supplied to our men in uniform . They deserve much better .
 Bearing in mind that these are supposed to be `` glove liners '' one size fits all is grossly inaccurate . I have large hands -LRB- 9.5 inches around the knuckles -RRB- , and these are big on me . mainly the fingers which are about 1/2 inch too long !!!! Complete waste of 6 bucks . Very fast shipping though . PS I really hate giving bad reviews .
 Hate the pair of gloves I had bought ! They did not even fit properly despite buying a size that usually fits my palm . Above that , these gloves are very uncomfortable too and offer no protection from the cold weather . I do n't recommend you buying this product .
 The shirt I bought was XXL for a reason ... I am fat . While it fit just fine in my chest , The stomach area was narrow .
 I have never got such a bad purchase from Amazon . Offcourse I was attracted by the brand and the price . The shirt was having a real bad sizing . It was not large or medium while ordered for a large one . It still is haning in my closet and is useless.The design looks as if at the first look itself it can be identified as a discontinued model or design or something.Do not waste your money on this .
 I received two of these shirts of the same size . Both were too small for the indicated size and were incorrectly cut.Avoid .
 This shirt is too long to wear inside or out . Not Ralph Polo quality , just style .

 I have been buying `` THE MOUNTAIN '' T-shirts for years , and I will no longer continue to purchase this product as the quality of `` THE MOUNTAIN '' T-shirts has severly deminished to the point it offends me . On reciept of my order , these shirts look nothing like what is posted on amazon , the colors are completely different-of low quality , and the quality of the material is nothing short of a cheap shirt out of mexico .

 As a Halloween costume , this hat looks more like a witch 's hat than a cowboy hat . It was difficult to keep the hat from flopping over . We ended up going with a real cowboy hat instead .
 I was not impressed with this Jockey product -- a big surprise . I generally buy Jockey because they have quality products . These pantyhose are unpleasantly rough to the touch , and do not have enough elasticity . They tend to pool around my ankles after a couple of hours , and bag at the knees . Ick .
 My 18 month old daughter was very uncomfortable in this outfit . I cut the elastic on the arms for extra room , but the material was still too scratchy . I thought it ran really small , as she is very petite as it is . The price and look were great , but not practical for a young toddler .
 I was very upset when receiving this costume !! It looked NOTHING like the picture !!! No hood , short sleeved , very cheap . Now I have to find something else for my 5 month old in 3 weeks and have the hassle of sending it back .
 I bought this for my baby 's first birthday . It looks cute on her but there are some details that I do n't like . 1st , the elastic bond on the sleeve . 2nd , I think the size would n't fit infants beyond 12 months old . My baby will be a year old in less than 2 wks and it just fits her perfectly . 3rd , it would be hard to change a diaper because you need to take off the whole thing . Because of that , I will just have my baby wear it for a couple of picture taking then change her to a different minnie mouse outfit .
 Costume adorable but sequins come off too easily . By the end of the day half were missing . I tried to glue some back on when costume was first received but by the time Halloween came and went most had come off .
 I bought this costume for my daughter 's first b ` day as I was doing Minnie Mouse theme . Material is very very cheap.It looks pretty in picture but when i received it , I was disappointed . Not worth the money I paid . Also , It is tight for my daughter . she usually fits in 12 months clothes , but this one was is very tight . Its wastage of money . I will not recommend to spend 17 bucks on this costume
 the costume looks adorable but its not . its made so cheaply ! the sleeves are mesh and so uncomfortable . the bottom of the sleeve had elastic i guess so it can look poofy but it was so tight on her arms it made a mark . i had to return it . the skirt part had no body to it . it had no tafeta . i dont recommend it . i ended up buying one drectly from disney store and that one was soooooooooo adorable !!
 The middle of the right front pocket was riveted to the right pant leg . The jeans were unwearable . These pants were definitely defective .
 This costume was awful - I turned right around and returned it . I am 5 ' 4 &#34; , size 10 , and ordered this in a Large . The top was a bit snug -LRB- I usually wear a medium top -RRB- but the bottom was so big and extremly unflattering . The skirt made my hips look like it was a foot rounder than it really is . Had I known how to sew , I would have thought about keeping it and making some alterations but I 'm not that domestic -LRB- unfortunately -RRB- .
 I bought this bra for 2 reasons it has a racerback and it is medium intensity . It was only 1 of those . I bought the size according to the chart it was to tight . It was like wearing a breast binder , not comfortable at all . This is designed for high intensity a very small breast tissue . If you are that you 'll love it , I 'm not and I do n't .
 I 've had the most frustrating time trying to return these gloves ! I 'm not happy as many here agree , that the laces do n't allow for the girth of the arm and wrist area . Also , the company All American something orders from other companies because I 've been dealing with the manufacturer directly . The manufacturer LoverSource will ONLY refund the buyer . They do n't have the ability to credit an account for Me to hold for later purchase or credit My Amazon.com account . Now I 'll need to see if this LoveSource even has a website to see if I can exchange these gloves . If I ca n't exchange , I 'm stuck losing My gift , refunding the buyer who ordered the gloves from My Wishlist . There does n't seem to be any guarantee for the Amazon member to keep credit when any product ordered from an Amazon wish list .
 This is not the product in the picture . The picture is a fingerless glove . The product is a fingered glove.I accidentally got 2 -LRB- thinking I 'd clicked on the wrong thing the first time -RRB- and was rather frustrated.What they are is fine , it 's just not what 's in the picture .
 Unless you have sticks for arms , the strings are too short , and a bit thick . Shoelaces might be better for these gloves . They do look good , if you get long enough laces though . They are shiny black , thin material , kinda cheap , but you get what you pay for . I used them for a halloween costume .
 BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT FOR MY BOYFRIEND I WILL BE SENDING IT BACK . IT LOOKS WORN IM SURE ITS THE STYLE BUT I DIDNT LIKE IT . THE KOI AND THE GRAFFITI WRITING IS COOL AND IT HAS LITTLE BUD LEAVES INSIDE THE HOOD I WAS JUST THROWN OFF BY THE WASH. . . IF IT LOOKED LIKE A NEW SWEATER IT COULD HAVE BEEN COOL .

 Hate to say this but when someone advertises a `` Polar '' coat , you expect something quite a bit warmer than a knit sweater.Unfortunately , that is about as warm as this jacket is.Even calling this thing a jacket is giving it more credit than it is due.When I first looked at it , I thought they had made a mistake and shipped me the LINER from a winter jacket since that is about how warm this thing is , but unfortunately it is n't just the liner but the entire jacket.Perhaps in Vietnam where this garment is made it may actually be warm when worn in the far Northern part of Vietnam where the lowest temperatures reach as low as 45 degrees , but here in Northern Illinois where we have already had a half dozen sub-zero days this Winter with another one due tomorrow it is useless . Ir is nothing more than a light Spring or Fall Jacket , NOT a winter `` Polar '' jacket.So if you are looking for a warm jacket , you have come to the wrong place . The only `` Fleece '' you will find here is as you are fleeced out of the money you thought you were spending on a winter jacket .
 I was n't sure if this was a woman 's or man 's fleece , but normally a woman 's M is a little too snug on me , but this M was too big . If you 're a woman , order a size or two smaller !
 I 'm 170cm male with around 34 '' chest . I ordered the small one , it fits OK but the shoulder to the elbow area seems too baggy for my taste -LRB- shoulda gone XS -RRB- . The zipper seems ok , color is exactly as in picture . One major disappointment is that the inner lining of the pocket is NOT FLEECE . That got me quite upset since I was hoping to bask my hands in comforting fleece .
 The Tee Shirt I ordered was XL , and it is marked XL , but it is actually size Medium -LRB- 2 sizes smaller than labeled -RRB- , and I never washed it . I bought it , but will never be able to wear it because it is too small for me . Also , the cotton is not as thick as I would have liked . The Tee is made in Bangladesh for a company located in the UK .
 The materials and quality are good on this wetsuit but the neck line and chest area fit too loosely to adequately preserve warmth . After one use in cold water my legs were warm but my torso was as cold as it would have been with no suit .
 After thirteen months , the fabric is failing . They typically get worn only once a week . Not acceptable for a pair of boxers that cost sixty-two dollars

 Bought this sword as part of a knight play costume . It 's hollow and easily bent eventually splitting down the seam . Would be ok for Halloween when it wo n't get used a lot , otherwise , do n't waste your money if its for actually play .

 Purchased these thinking that they were of good quality - not too bad - but really not worth the extra bucks . I found them very tight at the top/under knee and then loose in the foot - and I wear this type every dayI would not recommend -

 Tried these in a 66 waist . Their characterization of these as &#34; Relaxed Fit &#34; is ridiculous . The waist was a 66 -LRB- I ordered larger to get a loose fit -- my waist is really a 64 -RRB- but the seat and thighs were nowhere near proper proportions for a person this large . It was as though I was trying to fit into a funnel that was overly wide at the waist and impossibly small at the knee . I 'd recommend skipping this brand in larger sizes .
 No era lo que se mostraba en las fotos , los sujetadores de la correa vino con 5 y en la foto salen con 7 . .
 I do n't know where they are making these jeans now a days , but be prepared to have them altered , The measurements are all off . I had to have mine altered by a taylor .
 I ordered 1 pair of Wrangler 's and they could n't seem to get them shipped out for whatever reason . When I order something simple , I do n't expect to wait weeks to receive it and if there 's a problem that holds the order up , I expect an e-mail to let me know , which never happened ! I finally canceled the order because my son started school and they were still telling me it would be a couple more weeks before they even shipped ? Unless you plan on waiting forever for your order , I do not recommend this company !
 nice jeans however the belt loops were to small , it would be nice if wrangler made the loops the same size .
 Their the smallest 35 's I have ever seen . They would n't fit my son at all and were very tight on my grandson that wears a 33 .
 I bought three pairs of these jeans for my husband and they have all ripped in only three months . All the rips start in the back pocket . Save your money and buy a brand that will last longer -- if you can find one .
 I purchased 3 of these jeans -LRB- 34x32 -RRB- and they are not 34 at all . I have other jeans and they fit perfectly , these one are too small . Very disappointed .
 On me , they fit poorly when compared to the &#34; other &#34; big brand who makes lots of denim jeans . Tight in the wrong places where the others are looser fitting . No problems with the quality , just not a good fit for a mid sized round guy with short thick legs , lol .
 I love Amazon.com , but these Wrangler jeans look similar to Wrangler jeans sold in America ; but they are NOT the same as Wranglers sold in America . My husband says the cut is different and they do n't fit him as well . We noticed that the Wrangler label on the jeans is the older style than what is used on their jeans now . I 'm not sure if they 're just really old old Wranglers that were found in some warehouse or if they are impostors made in another country with the older Wrangler label on the back . Also , these jeans have stitching on the rear pockets and I guess the current -LRB- official -RRB- Wranglers do n't have back pocket stitching anymore . My husband says , `` no more internet jeans for him ! '' He wants to try on clothes in person .
 I received my jeans in reasonable time and the label on the jeans indicated they were a 28 inch inseam . However , when I wore them , they were dragging on the floor . I then measured them with a tailor 's tape and the jeans inseam measured 30 inches . My wife will now have to correctly size them .
 Ordered up a pair , reviews look good , got them fairly quickly , tried them on , they fit good . The right hand from pocket felt like there was something in it , like an `` Inspected by # 277 '' note , but it was just the wrinkled and crispy pocket itself . I inspected it closer , and it was full of holes ! The front left pocket had the same problem . Bummer . Sending back for refund . . not taking another chance , I 'll just go to the store and get jeans .
 I ordered Men 's Wrangler Relaxed Fit Jean size 40x34 . When we received the package the shipping receipt AND the label attached to the outside of the pants said the pants were size 40x34 . However , when he tried the jeans on the jeans did not fit right . We then checked the inside tag and found that they were really 36x32 . We will be returning the jeans . I am usually pleased with Amazon.com however this particular item was a birthday present -LRB- he received the jeans one day before his birthday so there is no way to get a replacement pair here by tomorrow , his birthday -RRB- . Hopefully the return process will be smooth and they will send us the right size .
 If you are a long time Wrangler wearer , as I am , do n't be fooled by these . I made the mistake of keeping the three pair I ordered even though it is obvious that they are NOT the same as the original 31MWZWK jeans . They felt pretty good , so I decided to give them a try . These jeans are thinner material , have a different label , and shrank in size right after I washed them . They do n't have the rivet on the pockets and are generally cheaper in feel . Since these are the jeans that came up when I typed in 31MWZWK , I believed that that was what I was getting . I actually think that they might be a `` knock-off '' rather than the real thing . By the time I realized I no longer wanted them , it was too late to return them for a refund . I feel really ripped off .
 I usually never order jeans online and against my better judgement did so . If you dont really care about how your jeans sits on your body then you will find it fine , but the cut and fit was simply too relaxed for me . At the end of the day , leaves you looking sloppy .
 Ped&iacute; unos pantalones 34x36 y me llegaron unos 36x32 . Afuera en la etiqueta dice 34x36 sin embargo dentro del pantal&oacute;n en la etiqueta dice 36x32 . Por tanto no me sirvieron y me quedaron super grandes .
 The material is a little thin for hard work . Good think I ware them around the house and not on the farm
 I bought one jeans jacket , and was looking for a colour match pant . The colour did not match , and I was highly displeased . I would have returned it .
 The jeans fit well and looked nice when they first arrived . However , they have already fallen apart . I am very disappointed with this purchase . I picked up a pair of Levis and a pair of Kirkland -LRB- Costco -RRB- jeans all around the same time . I am not very happy with the expensive Levi jeans either but at least they are n't falling apart . The most comfortable of the 3 pairs is acutally the Kirkland brand which I got for under $ 10 . I have worn them many more times than the Wrangler jeans and they are holding up just fine . I will NEVER buy another pair of Wrangler jeans .
 Smaller than they should be -- I 've ordered these exact brand , model and size at several other retailers in the past , with no issues . But even though the Amazon product showed the same information , including the same product numbers on the actual tags , their size is definitely not the same . I ordered the 40x38 , but when I compare these to supposedly identical jeans purchased in the past , these Amazon ones are about 2-3 inches smaller at the waist.Other than that they are good jeans , but for online clothing sales it 's imperative to carry accurate sizes since people ca n't try them on in advance ...
 I needed a new pair of Wranglers because all of my jeans were 4-5 years old - and looked it . I was shocked and disappointed to find that these Wranglers did n't have that new-blue look . They look like the 5 year old Wranglers that they were supposed to replace ! Amazon 's description did n't mention that these pants had a used look ; I 'll be returning them . I learned an important lesson
 I had ordered the Wrangler loose fit jeans of the same size last week , and LOVED them . I was looking for a replacement for Levi 550s and 569s , as they had turned to junk recently -LRB- easily ripped , shrank up in both directions -RRB- . The loose fit Wranglers were a PERFECT fit . Not so with these . The exact same size in the relaxed fit was OK for length , but instead of a 38x32 -LRB- as on the sticker -RRB- , I think it was about a 32x30 . Never have I seen such a difference in sizing amongst the same manufacturer . Poor quality control ; I 'd lose my job immediately if I let product like this ship !
 When I got it and tried it on , I discovered zipper sticks all the time ~ 1/2 way down , 3/4 way down , etc. . That 's the cheap part . Now , having worn it several times , I 've discovered that the white pocket bulges out as a matter of course - but just on the right side . That 's the poorly made part . Headed for the Salvation Army .
 Wranglers have always been sized perfectly for me for years -- buy them at Target , do n't even bother to try them on , wash them , wear them . But the first time they were ordered from Amazon , the `` relaxed fit '' is so tight I have to do the old 80 's trick of lying down on the bed to get them to button . The waist might stretch , but the hip pocket is so tight I ca n't get my wallet in/out without making a scene . I asked the gift giver for the Amazon return label , and she looked so offended I dropped the subject.I think Wranglers are great jeans -- if these were factory seconds I wish they had been marked -- and priced -- accordingly .
 I 've been wearing Wrangler relaxed fit jeans for many years now , always ordering from Amazon because they always have my size . I may have to reconsider after the last few pair . As previous astute reviewers have mentioned , these jeans are not only missing the rivets , but they shrink A LOT . I have my own washer and dryer . I wash cold and tumble dry with cold air and still these jeans shrink WAY too much , going from comfortable to ballcrushers in one wash and dry cycle . Some reviews have mentioned defects and I have now joined that crowd . I bought a pair back in April . Do I wear my new jeans right away ? No , but I like to have a backup pair or two because I wear them to work and having a new clean pair on hand is important . I tore open the packing on the new pair this morning and was wondering if I had brain damage as I sipped coffee and tried unsuccessfully to get my belt in the belt loops , wondering what was going on ... until I realized the jeans HAD NO BELT LOOPS . What in the holy hell use is a pair of Wranglers without belt loops ? And what has happened to the quality control of these jeans that a defect like that could go unnoticed ? Since it is now near the end of June it is too late for me to return the jeans without going through all kinds of bull ____ , so I am EXTREMELY disappointed with Wrangler AND Amazon . Now some of you might say , `` Jack , why did n't you just open the goddamned package when you got them and give them a look see ? '' My response ? `` They are Wranglers from Amazon . I checked that I got the right size and color , why should I have to check for belt loops ? '' Please note I 'm a long-time Amazon shopper who has rarely had to return anything . So ... anyone want a free pair of jean with no ____ ing belt loops ? For Christ 's sake . I guess I 'll see what Levi 's has to offer in relaxed fit and hope I do n't get shafted again with missing belt loops or one giant pantleg or some other insanity.-Update 2011 07 18 - Two weeks ago I unwrapped the last pair of Wranglers I had tucked away from my last purchase . For two weeks they were great - a good fit , with a bit of room in the butt and crotch -LRB- I have to bend and squat and sometimes get right down on the floor under desks at work , so a bit of room helps avoid the dreaded testicular crush -RRB- . On the weekend I washed these jeans . NO detergent , just water . COLD water only , for a 20 minute wash and rinse cycle . They went in the dryer , COLD AIR DRY only , for about twenty minutes . Then I let them hang and finish drying at room temperature . When I put them on this morning they had shrunk at least 1 full size . I felt like my gonads were being crushed by an angry Sumo wrestler . That CA N'T be normal . Should I just buy jeans 2 or 3 sizes bigger from now on and assume they will shrink ? This is crazy .
 Disappointed . Size I ordered from Amazon is the size I always buy/wear from stores . The pair received , while marked as correct size ordered , were almost too small for me to even get on and zipped-up right out of the bag . I ca n't imagine how I would have gotten them on after a few washings/shrinking . They were made in Mexico , for whatever that is worth . I do n't see the point in buying clothes online anymore if you cant trust accuracy of sizing , and if that is n't trustworthy , what can one conclude about quality of materials , workmanship , etc. . ?
 I ordered a pair of these for my husband in November 2011 and he loved them . Great fit , super comfy and looked good . So I ordered him two more pair for Christmas in the same size . Well , they fit nothing like the exact same item we 'd ordered in November . They were easily a size too small and he could barely get them buttoned . I agree with the earlier reviewer ; these jeans bore no resemblance to the pair we bought from Amazon only a month before . I returned them and I 'm reluctant to order anymore -- even in a larger size -- because now I really do n't know what we 're going to get . Both orders of the Wrangler Men 's Rugged Wear Relaxed Fit Jean were made in Mexico and had tags indicating size 33x30 , but the first pair were easily an inch larger in the waist and you can tell by the numbers on the tags they must have been made in different factories . It 's disappointing to say the least . If Wrangler is going to have other countries make their jeans , they need to apply consistent patterns and standards . It 's called `` quality control '' !
 These have to be counterfeit , as the seams are sub-standard . No where near the quality of Wrangler jeans bought at a brick & morter store.Stay away , these are FAKE Wranglers !!

 Hate to say this but when someone advertises a `` Polar '' coat , you expect something quite a bit warmer than a knit sweater.Unfortunately , that is about as warm as this jacket is.Even calling this thing a jacket is giving it more credit than it is due.When I first looked at it , I thought they had made a mistake and shipped me the LINER from a winter jacket since that is about how warm this thing is , but unfortunately it is n't just the liner but the entire jacket.Perhaps in Vietnam where this garment is made it may actually be warm when worn in the far Northern part of Vietnam where the lowest temperatures reach as low as 45 degrees , but here in Northern Illinois where we have already had a half dozen sub-zero days this Winter with another one due tomorrow it is useless . Ir is nothing more than a light Spring or Fall Jacket , NOT a winter `` Polar '' jacket.So if you are looking for a warm jacket , you have come to the wrong place . The only `` Fleece '' you will find here is as you are fleeced out of the money you thought you were spending on a winter jacket .
 I was n't sure if this was a woman 's or man 's fleece , but normally a woman 's M is a little too snug on me , but this M was too big . If you 're a woman , order a size or two smaller !
 I 'm 170cm male with around 34 '' chest . I ordered the small one , it fits OK but the shoulder to the elbow area seems too baggy for my taste -LRB- shoulda gone XS -RRB- . The zipper seems ok , color is exactly as in picture . One major disappointment is that the inner lining of the pocket is NOT FLEECE . That got me quite upset since I was hoping to bask my hands in comforting fleece .
 This product was cheap , so I did not expect world class rain gear when I ordered it , but even that did not stop me from being dissapointed . The fit is good , and it is comfortable . It also keeps you dry , until it rips.The first thing that ripped on mine was the the inner button up flap , this happened the second time I wore it . Next , I brushed up against something with the back , and it ripped . Currently the buttons on the sleeve cuffs are starting to rip out . The top flaps on the plastic are starting to rip as well . However , since it is plastic , you can use super glue and scrap plastic to repair holes.It is bright and it fits good , so that is why I gave it 2 stars . It would probably be a great jacket for use by a construction flagger or someone that does not do a lot of movement and physical work . As a tow truck driver , I have to roll around on the ground under cars and do other stuff that causes this coat to not be satisfactory .
 I got this for my dad to wear and the first time he wore it the crotch area ripped . I contacted the seller and was pleasantly surprised when they said that they would ship out a replacement the next day . A couple weeks went by and no replacement so I emailed them again and they said they would go check and reship a replacement . STILL NO REPLACEMENT PANTS ! Ended up going spending a little bit extra and getting him a good pair that would not rip the first time he wore it . Sadly disappointed .

 These QUEEN size knee high nylons with cotton soles will DEFINITELY stay up for you ... in fact , they will almost cut off your circulation . I bought them for my mother for a gift . She told me she could n't use them as they were so tight , so she told me I could have them . I have the world 's skinniest legs -LRB- literally NO calfs -RRB- . That being said ... these QUEEN size knee highs are so tight on my skinny legs that even I can not wear them . They are so tight that they almost cut off my circulation and caused excruciating pain from the tightest band in the world at the top ! It is too late to return these , or I would . Do NOT waste your money ! The company needs to go back to the drawing board on this product !!

 This was cute at first look . But once it arrived I was let down . The v in the front goes all the way down to my belly button . It is sheer and you would have to wear some short of tank under it which would dominate over the cutness of the shit . I will be returning this . sad .
 This product is in Junior sizing 3x which is about a 16 in women 's sizes . A 3x in women 's sizes is a 22-24 , a long way from a 16 ! Fabric flimsy .
 I had this over shirt out of the packaging for all of 10 minutes when one of the rhinestone buttons fell off . I have a long torso and the the flair sat well above my hips and made me appear to be a lot wider than I am . If you have a narrow shape this shirt may work well for you , but if you have any curves to you at all I would n't recommend this item for you at all .
 I bought this gorgeous blouse based on the photo . Lace all over , Rhinestone buttons , flared bottom ... thought it would be great for my daughter to wear at a formal event on our cruise -LRB- with a camisole underneath , of course -RRB- . Well , the blouse , sized medium , ran so small that my daughter , a size 8 , could n't get it on . And since there is no elastic , zipper and the buttons are ` faux ' , the only way to put it on is over your head . She was afraid that the delicate material would rip . The company I bought this from shipped very quickly , so I hope that this rating is just for the blouse and will not effect the rating of the service I received from the store .

 Briefs do n't fit as good on me as they look on display . The bottom edges do n't stay firmly in place as it looks on the display . They tend to wrinkle and bundle up in the crotch area not long after wearing them . The size and look when I put them on the first time are pretty good . They just do n't stay that way after brief use .

 The product in the picture looks wonderful , and that 's why I purchased it . But , what the company actually ships is extremely different from the picture and very disappointing for the price I paid . It was just a sheer purple material with gold coins attached by some crocheting . Had I wanted something so flimsy I would have paid much less and gone somewhere else . If you are looking for a quality belt , this is not the belt you are looking for.The company should be ashamed for it 's false advertisement . Showing a customer one product and then sending another just show that they do n't value their customers and have no problem taking their money and lying to them .
 The product does exactly what it says it can do , after trying many others I love the design and appearance of this under my bras . I have very large breasts for my size and work in a very conservative formal environment ; the last thing I want/need are my nipples showing under my clothes . I loved them , at first . The reason I have rated it so low is that I can not wear the nipple covers , I wore them without complaint twice , the third time I felt itchy and had red markings around my nipples.The last time I wore them I washed them before wearing , put them on and had to take them out 15 minutes later that lasted more than 24 hours . They are great , if you have insensitive skin that does not irritate easily .
 Ca n't wear it with white shirts , make you look like you have giant nipples and with certain shirts you can see the outline of it . I would n't recommend it .
 I found that these caused irritation to my sensitive skin ; I found the use of the silicone composition product work much better .

 This bandana is terrible . It looks nothing like the picture . Instead of being `` tie dye '' it is a blotchy mess of light pink , sky blue , and light yellow . It seems like it was made for girls , but that 's just my opinion
 I 'm of average height -LRB- 5 ' 8 '' -RRB- but this `` tunic '' does n't have enough length . It does n't reach the top of my legs and the arms are short too . I ended up giving them to my shorter friend . So if you 're over 5 ' 5 '' , do n't buy . Material is nice though .
 I was n't sure if this was a woman 's or man 's fleece , but normally a woman 's M is a little too snug on me , but this M was too big . If you 're a woman , order a size or two smaller !
 I 'm 170cm male with around 34 '' chest . I ordered the small one , it fits OK but the shoulder to the elbow area seems too baggy for my taste -LRB- shoulda gone XS -RRB- . The zipper seems ok , color is exactly as in picture . One major disappointment is that the inner lining of the pocket is NOT FLEECE . That got me quite upset since I was hoping to bask my hands in comforting fleece .
 The jacket does fit big , but that is n't my problem.The problem is that a tooth broke off of the zipper on the first zipping.Returned .
 I received my jacket in a timely manner but I ordered the wrong size and sent it back for another size . As of this date I have n't received my jacket or a response from the company .

 Hate to say this but when someone advertises a `` Polar '' coat , you expect something quite a bit warmer than a knit sweater.Unfortunately , that is about as warm as this jacket is.Even calling this thing a jacket is giving it more credit than it is due.When I first looked at it , I thought they had made a mistake and shipped me the LINER from a winter jacket since that is about how warm this thing is , but unfortunately it is n't just the liner but the entire jacket.Perhaps in Vietnam where this garment is made it may actually be warm when worn in the far Northern part of Vietnam where the lowest temperatures reach as low as 45 degrees , but here in Northern Illinois where we have already had a half dozen sub-zero days this Winter with another one due tomorrow it is useless . Ir is nothing more than a light Spring or Fall Jacket , NOT a winter `` Polar '' jacket.So if you are looking for a warm jacket , you have come to the wrong place . The only `` Fleece '' you will find here is as you are fleeced out of the money you thought you were spending on a winter jacket .

 These QUEEN size knee high nylons with cotton soles will DEFINITELY stay up for you ... in fact , they will almost cut off your circulation . I bought them for my mother for a gift . She told me she could n't use them as they were so tight , so she told me I could have them . I have the world 's skinniest legs -LRB- literally NO calfs -RRB- . That being said ... these QUEEN size knee highs are so tight on my skinny legs that even I can not wear them . They are so tight that they almost cut off my circulation and caused excruciating pain from the tightest band in the world at the top ! It is too late to return these , or I would . Do NOT waste your money ! The company needs to go back to the drawing board on this product !!

 Not really the Mil-Spec type quality I was hoping for . The strap clasps are plastic and detach easily . They have n't broken , but I do n't see them standing up to much real abuse . I 've had them detach quite easily on a couple occasions as well when i put my hand on the clasp while carrying it on my shoulder , -LRB- since it 's a rather natural place to rest your hand . -RRB- Having one end of the strap detach sends the bag to the ground pretty quickly if there 's any weight in it .
 It seems cheap and poorly made . It rips too easily . If I had the chance , I would go back and buy something else .
 This bra and panty set broke the fisrt time I wore it , the metal broke on the cuffs . It is very poorly made , and I would advise anyone against buying it . You have a better chance of quality buying bras out of a van on the side of the road .
 i ended up only keeping the choker . this bikini is so freaking crappy . it broke when i took it out of the package . .

 The description of the item lead me to believe it was a cammy with a built-in lined bra cup . Not just a shelf bra top . I did not want a top I could buy anywhere with shipping charges associated .
 I was in a wedding , and had to wear a strapless gown . Being well-endowed , finding a bra/slimmer was tricky . I ordered this one , along with four others , and this was the WORST ! It 's very thin fabric , so it has very little support in the bust . The piece was not as slimming as the others I tried . The slip rides up when you walk or sit , and the top slides down , without thick fabric or stays . If you are a D-cup or over , I would not recommend wasting your time or money with this one !

 !!! the shirts came ripped and stained !!! do not waste your time and your money ... poor quality !! the worst shopping experience !!! not recommended at all
 The TV ads promote the idea of no &#34; bacon neck &#34; - with nice flat collars with no wrinkling / crumpling . I had bacon neck with these the first time I wore them -LRB- which I hate -RRB- . Also - one of the shirts in the package had already been repaired , there 's a big , bumpy , uneven seam on the right breast that would be noticeable if I wore it under a dress shirt . Also - they tape the shirts together with clear tape , inside of the packaging , and there does n't seem to be a pattern about where they put the tape and it stretches the shirts when you take it off . So I put them all through the washer and dryer when I first got them and there were several pieces of tape that came off in the washer and dryer -LRB- I thought I had gotten it all -RRB- . Great message with the no bacon neck collars , but terrible product .
 These t shirts are the worst , they are see - thru thin , the stitching is so bad the shirt will probably not make it thru one washing.I would return them but it is not worth the time to repackage them . I will not bother wearing them they would probably have holes by the end of the day
 Very thin tees - no better than the kind you 'd get at Wal-Mart . Save your money .
 These shirts are okay if you are looking for some cheap undershirts . Other than that I would n't recommend them . The material is pretty thin and you really ca n't wear it on its own . The fit is okay but I wish they were a little longer in the torso area . If you are pretty tall they might be too short for you .
 These were the incredible shrinking t-shirts . With each washing they seemed to get smaller and smaller ... and I know how to wash clothes . Just something about this brand ... not worth buying unless you get them way bigger than you need to begin with .
 Fabric is way too thin , comes out of the dryer a wrinkled mess , looks like hell , and the stay-flat collar is just marketing hype . These tee shirts are suitable for nothing except washing the car . Do they shrink ? I 'll never know since I would never wear these shirts in public . A mistake .
 The fabric is to thin and it feels cheap . I 'm not sure what 's happened to this line of T-Shirts but the quality use to be much better . I recommend you try something else and do n't waste your money on this !
 While the backpack seems well designed with enough pockets and space , it has two flaws . The first is very poor padding on the bottom of the pack . My backpack fell off my suitcase while standing in line at the airport , landing on the bottom . The computer screen cracked as the result of a two foot drop . The second flaw is that the zipper that closes the computer compartment can be separated from the body of the flap covering the computer . The nylon shreds and releases the zipper entirely . This is most noticable when the body of the backpack is full with other papers and the corner of the computer pushes on the zipper . I have had two Ogio metro packs -LRB- got from my employer -RRB- and both failed at the computer pouch zipper .
 When my oldest son purchased an OGIO Metro Pack I thought it was a well thought out backpack . It seemed to be the perfect backpack for our needs so I ordered two more , one for both my younger son and myself . After just two months all three OGIO Metro Packs are coming apart at the seams . Either OGIO has compromised their quality or we were stuck with a shoddy knock off . Before purchasing these backpacks , both of my sons had OGIO backpacks that lasted well over 3 years of hard wear . I 'm very disappointed and unfortunately did not keep the receipts . I guess the lesson here is BUYER BE AWARE OF ONLINE PURCHASES . When ordering through Amazon.com , you never know if the company that you end up ordering the product from is truly and authorized seller of the product that you are ordering .
 I 'm a Network Engineer and I travel a lot for work . I needed a laptop backpack that looked good and did everything I needed . After much research I ran into the OGIO Metro . I did my homework on it and from what I saw and read , it was the best thing ever made since sliced bread . I went ahead and ordered me an Indigo colored one . When I got the bag was I was impressed . Let 's now fastforward 2 months . Stitching started to come apart with the zipper that held the laptop in , stitching also started to came apart by the handle of the bag . The stitching on the zipper on the bottom pocket started to come apart . A few days later the zipper broke . I can no longer close the bottom pocket . Called OGIO about this issue and I 'm getting a replacement bag . Unfortunately , since the Metro is no longer being made they are sending me a Santo.If you are looking for a new laptop bag look elsewhere . I also read reviews on this bag and other OGIO bags and they all appear to have the same issues with the stitching . Sorry to say , while the bag looks good and feels good the durability is none!I 've been eyeing other bags and came across this one
 This bag is good , but none of the zippers work . When you unzip one , it gets stuck or does not close when you slide it . I called Ogio and they were not helpful at all . Wish I could give it zero stars .
 I miss the old-school shadow box Umbros soccer shorts which apparently are only made these days for seven-year old girls . These shorts seemed like a good substitute and have been on my shopping list for years . I finally ordered a pair and there is a weird cut in the crotch area . The search continues .
 First , I 'm a big man , so this product does n't fit me well . With the strap fully extended , it 's not quite large enough for me . Secondly , I think it looks kinda silly -- the strap gets twisted easily and does n't lay on my body flat.Maybe the leather version is more substantial than the cheaper version .
 I did not like to product . This product does not give the breasts a natural smooth shape . I felt like I was wearing my grandmother 's bra .
 Design is reasonable and simple . Material and stitching could be stronger ; wore out earlier than expected .
 The jacket does fit big , but that is n't my problem.The problem is that a tooth broke off of the zipper on the first zipping.Returned .

 We bought this for our 14 year old son . He pointed out that it broke as soon as he wore it . We definitely noticed it was flimsy when we took it out of the packaging . And certainly not worth the $ 22 we spent on it -LRB- NOTE . Actual cost for items was $ 12 plus tax and shipping . -RRB-

 This item is described as a French Foreign legion hat , but the French issue a white kepi -LRB- kepi blanc -RRB- and this hat as I received it is actually tan in color . This looks like a Nazi hat from WWII . I strongly urge anyone considering purchasing this item to consider taking your business elsewhere . I am not dissing the seller as far as any other items they may be selling , but as far as this item goes , be aware . I wrote the seller and they replied in a very defensive manner .
 I like the color -LRB- hibiscus -RRB- , but ... Buttons are so loosely attached to the shirt that they fell off on the very first day of wearing !

 I 'm 170cm male with around 34 '' chest . I ordered the small one , it fits OK but the shoulder to the elbow area seems too baggy for my taste -LRB- shoulda gone XS -RRB- . The zipper seems ok , color is exactly as in picture . One major disappointment is that the inner lining of the pocket is NOT FLEECE . That got me quite upset since I was hoping to bask my hands in comforting fleece .
 I read many positive reviews on this bra , which is why I was surprised to be disappointed once I put it on.It is comfortable and very stretchie all over , fits true to size , my complaint is in the cups , there is no support at all , some ladies stated this bra gave the the look of torpedo boobs ... That may be an improvement over having them look like a couple of wet noodles ! I was looking for true support without under wires , and this does NOT deliver . Not even worth the postage to send it back ! Good thing I also ordered a Glamorise Magic Lift , which is AWESOME , I will be ordering more of those and no more of these .
 I love the look of this bra when it stays in place , which is n't for long . The front strap around the midsection keeps riding up underneath the girls and then makes them look funny ... like they are hanging down . If they had a stiffer material so that you do n't have to keep pulling down the front , it would be perfect . The look and feel of the bra is wonderful as long as you keep tugging at the front to pull it back in place : -LRB-
 We ordered for 2 . One of them was a used one . Smelt some strong odor . Hence we returned back to Amazon . Amazon processed the return and we got our money back without any issues . This type of Bra is very good .
 So disappointed this does n't fit ! I 'm wondering if these are seconds ? I 've worn this style & size for years , love it . I hate underwires and while support is not as good , it 's close and far more comfortable . I 'd just bought a white one locally but they did n't have beige in my size . I checked Amazon for something else and a Bali bra popped up in the section of items others have bought . I 'd never thought to look on Amazon -- silly me , I usually check EVERYTHING on Amazon ! -- and was VERY pleased to find it and at a great price too . Ordered the size I 've worn for years , same size as white one I 'd just bought . It came quickly , I tried it on and right away the fit was odd , gaps at the sides of each cup where they are joined to the back . Checked sizes on labels , they matched . Tried my new white one again -LRB- I 'd not yet washed it -RRB- and it fit fine . I compared the two for total band width , thinking it was maybe mislabeled for size . Nope , both were same width . Then I noticed the beige one I 'd ordered had substantially more width in the band area under the cups -- over 3/4 of an inch wider in that area , although entire bra is same width . I thought , that ca n't be it , tried it again , still an odd fit . Then compared it to 3 older ones -- thinking they 'd have stretched through wearing and would rule that out as the issue . Nope , the band width in the cup area was still noticeably less than the new one , in one case over an inch smaller . My conclusion is that probably the extra 3/4 of an inch causes the gaps . I am not sure if reordering will solve this problem but I sure hope it does .
 These are for torpedo boobs ! Not at all as shown in the photograph ! Did not like it at all and returned it immediately !
 I 've been trying to find a replacement for a Bali bra that was discontinued a few years ago . This one looks just like it and says it 's `` satin '' , but it 's stiff and scratchy , even after a couple washings . They used to offer a wide , padded strap , but ca n't find that either . This strap is narrow and cuts in after a short time of having it on . I do n't like it and have only worn it once because it 's very uncomfortable .
 Since I have had some success with Bali lingeries , I decided to give this style a try . I am full figured . I did n't like this one at all because it did n't seem to have a good fit . A good fitting bra should fit flush against your breastbone , but this one did n't do that , perhaps because it is softcup -LRB- a lingerie fitter did tell me once that full figures need the shaping of underwire ; perhaps that explains it -RRB- . This bra does n't support , but rather just kind of squishes you into a unflattering and uncomfortable look which has no lift or definition at all . And I doubt it would be good even as a sleep bra or `` home '' bra either . I do n't think it is right for full figured types , but since bras are such a personal garment it 's possible others may feel differently .
 No real support for big chested girls.Was good for a week and then it was useless.Was much more impressed with a JMS bra that I got later .
 Not sure why it 's called double support bra , because there is no support . The straps do not stay in place causing the girls to drop ... so will not reccommend to anyone if they are REALLY LOOKing for SuPpOrT .
 Was ok for the cost , but did not support well in cups . And was not cotton where it needed to be for comfort sake -LSB- inside under band -RSB-
 I modeled this bra for my husband and he agreed it gave me a rather pointy silhouette , nothing like what was pictured -LRB- though that may have more do with the difference in bust size between myself and the model -RRB- . The support is adequate and the bra wears comfortably , but I 'll feel self-conscious in anything form-fitting . I usually fit a 36D to DD , depending on the brand -LRB- in Bali models , typically D -RRB- , so maybe a bigger cup would help . But , I suspect this problem is inherent in the design of the bra itself . It may also be worth noting , though the bra is listed as `` wire-free , '' there is a plastic band running vertically on the lateral edge of each cup . It 's flexible and does n't bother me , but might be a problem for others .
 Wow , I 'm pretty shocked as to how many positive reviews this bra has . The cup is shaped very weird , When on , it makes my boobs look like torpedoes ! And it pushes them wayyy to far apart . They stick out too much on the sides and just makes the shape of my chest look un-natural . No bueno . I see other reviewers have had the same experience as me with this bra . I sent it back immediately!The Bali # 3372 is the one that makes my boobs look great and feel great , even though it 's itchy sometimes . This one looked almost the same , so I gave it a try . But the way it looks on is very different from the way it looks off .
 Not what I was expecting - too uncomfortable . Sizing was off and I thought is was th stlye I usually like - guess not .
 This is very irritating to wear . Feels tight yet it is the same size as the rest of my other bra 's and they fit fine . I will not get bra'a from amazon again .
 Easily the worst bra I 've ever worn . The lacing dug into my skin making it impossible to wear . I am a tall , average build woman with a 38dd chest . The bra fit but i could stand it for more than 5 minutes . Everything dug into my skin
 The title says it all . This bra is not comfortable . Also , the cup does not fit properly . I put it in the charity box after one wearing .
 Only reason i even gave this item an 1 star was because the order arrived before due date . This bra is cheap and horrible ! It does not support anything . Not to mention the bra makes your breast look pointy . it 's shaped funny . i am n the process of returning this item a.s.a.p ! -LRB- and i really hate returning things -RRB-
 I 've bought this same style for years at the store and online and it seems the sizing must have changed . This one is much , much higher than it normally is , the cup seems bigger too . So , I guess I 'll just wear it under certain shirts that are cut high . But I will have to go back to the stores to buy any more in the future .
 The jacket does fit big , but that is n't my problem.The problem is that a tooth broke off of the zipper on the first zipping.Returned .
 I received my jacket in a timely manner but I ordered the wrong size and sent it back for another size . As of this date I have n't received my jacket or a response from the company .

 Hate to say this but when someone advertises a `` Polar '' coat , you expect something quite a bit warmer than a knit sweater.Unfortunately , that is about as warm as this jacket is.Even calling this thing a jacket is giving it more credit than it is due.When I first looked at it , I thought they had made a mistake and shipped me the LINER from a winter jacket since that is about how warm this thing is , but unfortunately it is n't just the liner but the entire jacket.Perhaps in Vietnam where this garment is made it may actually be warm when worn in the far Northern part of Vietnam where the lowest temperatures reach as low as 45 degrees , but here in Northern Illinois where we have already had a half dozen sub-zero days this Winter with another one due tomorrow it is useless . Ir is nothing more than a light Spring or Fall Jacket , NOT a winter `` Polar '' jacket.So if you are looking for a warm jacket , you have come to the wrong place .

 I 'm 170cm male with around 34 '' chest . I ordered the small one , it fits OK but the shoulder to the elbow area seems too baggy for my taste -LRB- shoulda gone XS -RRB- . The zipper seems ok , color is exactly as in picture . One major disappointment is that the inner lining of the pocket is NOT FLEECE . That got me quite upset since I was hoping to bask my hands in comforting fleece .

 This outfit is very cute , but the pieces to the suit all come separately and are meant to be velcroed on to the suit . The velcro is not strong enough to hold and the velcro for the shoulder pieces are positioned incorrectly , so we were not able to wear them at all . Overall , not quality enough - I would not recommend .
 I expected this product to be a little more sturdy . The helmet was made of VERY thin plastic , not the formed thick kind I thought it would be . The shoulder pieces and shield on front are velcro .
 My grandson age 3 squealed when he saw the costume and immediately asked , Where 's the sword ? '' There was none . The helmet and shoulder pads made of very thin plastic were dented by being caught in the shuffle by the end of the day , but he never came back to play with it , preferring his OLD spiderman costume over everything under the tree . The shirt is nice with elastic sleeves . Supply your own bottoms . All in all a little pricey for the quality .
 Costume is much to small to wear clothing under to be warm and I got a size bigger than my son wears !
 My 2 1/2 yr old son loves this costume . but even the first time he wore it the chest plate and shoulder pads were constantly falling off -LRB- especially the shoulder pads -RRB- And the helmet was flimsy and way to big for my kids head most the time we were helmet free . And the helmet was one of the reasons i bought this one .
 I made an order on December 10th for a Christmas present , which was said to arrive on or before December 20th . I did not receive it and sent an email on December 21st . They had somehow misplaced the order and would have it to us , and sent us a `` 10 % '' off discount on our next purchase with them -LRB- which will be never -RRB- . So time goes by and we never receive our purchase . On January 12th I send them another emailing asking them about it and they had `` no idea what happened to our order and could not send a replacement because they were out of stock ! '' so they refunded our money after over a month of bull crap !! Do NOT go through this company.They also say things are in NEW condition , and they are obviously used once received , with scuff marks , scratches , etc. .

 The costume came with stars on the sleeves instead of spiderwebs - truly dissapointing . Also , very shapeless , very different than pictured . Would not recommend .
 What is pictured is not what you get . It has orange sleeves with a different design on them . Trust all the reviews on this and do n't buy it .
 This is not the item pictured . We got a dress with bright gold star designs on the sleeves . We wanted the one shown in the photo . Very disappointed .
 the sleeves came with stars on them and the belt was orange not black , I was disappointed because it was n't as advertised
 The shape of the socks are horrible . The elastic opening fits around the ankle just fine , but then the rest of the sock just balloons around the feet . It 's not shaped to fit the foot at all . My daughter refuses to wear these , but I ca n't return them because we threw away the packaging right away . Bad buy .
 This costume has really frilly edges , so if your kids are like most kids and want to wear their costume before and after halloween you can forget about it . The frilly edges just come apart from simple wear and running or walking around it . The only thing decently made of this costume was the belt and the head band . It does not come with an eye patch or sword . Your better off taking a white shirt and cutting a design in it . At least you could wear it more than an hour without it starting to fall apart . The cheapest costume I 've ever seen and I buy 5 costumes a year .
 Purchased these thinking that they were of good quality - not too bad - but really not worth the extra bucks . I found them very tight at the top/under knee and then loose in the foot - and I wear this type every dayI would not recommend -
 I had filled it out the right way , then it came up again . I did n't realize and I said I was happy with it thinking it was another order . This shirt is beautiful . But it would fit a 3 year old . NOT my 15 year old I bought it for . Since it was listed with other shirts that were the size we DID need . It was confusing apparently there ARE for teenagers or adults .
 I purchased this group of BabyLegs because it said they were `` stretchie '' and could fit newborn to child and everyone in between . Well , my son weighed 20lbs and I certainly could n't get these on his legs without leaving HORRIBLE red marks that cut deeply into his thighs and ankles.Needless to say , I was horrified . I had purchases no less than 7 pair of these for the winter , and my baby could only wear 2 pair which are called `` supersofts '' and do n't have the terribly tight cuffs on each end.Be forewarned ... if your baby is not on the thin side of the scale , these will not fit .
 While these gloves are warm and comfy , I am saddened that they are unraveling on the second wear . They have not been put under any stress . I was hoping for the price they would hold up , but the $ 2 walmart version holds up sooo much better .
 I thought these were going to be very soft , but they were scratchy like rough twine . Looked great when wearing them .
 The quality of the costume was very low and not what is pictured . The material on the shirt/tunic did not have finished edges -LRB- as shown -RRB- but was rough cut and already fraying when it arrived . The material itself was very thin , a different color and impossible to get the wrinkles out . If you want something that does not look like you cut it out of a sheet , do not purchase this item . I returned it , five days before Halloween .
 Looks great on the picture but when you open the pack the costume seams are not sown , the fabric is so thin as not to be there and the belt ... !! Look elsewhere for a Jedi costume .
 It should work for the one night it is needed . Do n't think the `` boots '' will hold up even through one wear . Really over priced . The costume in the bag does n't even match the packaging . It is about what should be expected for this type of costume , but the price tag does n't match . It should probably be about half the price . My youngest son 's costume is a WAY better quality for a whole lot less . Would never have bought this if I 'd found a better option . My little guy had his heart set on being a jedi and I could n't talk him out of it . If you have even the slightest sewing ability , you could make something much nicer and cuter . Too bad my little jedi 's mom is n't craftier .
 I bought this for my 6 year-old to wear for Halloween . I really was n't expecting great quality since these costumes are usually pretty cheap , but this is beyond cheap . The boots are n't sewn on correctly . One boot faces front and one faces backward , which mean when he wears it , he has to twist one of the pant legs so the boot is facing the right direction . My son does n't seem to care though , so I wo n't be returning it even though I should . Also the velcro that holds the back together is only sewn with a few stitches so I do n't expect it to last more than a few wears .
 Ordered the Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn Deluxe Child Costume for son for Christmas . Based on the measurements provided , I purchased a size medium . It runs very large and my son was swimming in it . It is the usual costume quality , nothing fancy . Also , purchased Darth Vader costume for my daughter and again , it ran very large and I have tall children .
 I bought this custom for my son . Before I placed the order , I read the review on this custom . I thought in general it 's not bad . However , after I got the custom , I 'm extremely disappointed with quality . The edges of the custom are not sewed , which are different form the picture shown on the website and the picture is misleading . The worst part is the neck cut is too small . My son likes the custom . I have n't decide what to do . If I want to keep it , I have to do some work on it .
 Very disappointed with this purchase . Velcro hanging off . Not well put together at all , threads hanging off as edges not overllocked or finished . Nothing deluxe about this !
 I 'm very disappointed in this costume ! The picture shows a costume with hemmed edges , and a nice belt made on faux leather . Not so . All edges were raw cut edges and the belt was painted and ugly , and wo n't hold up . The size we bought for my son was 8-10 . He wears and 8 and has size 4 feet . The boot covers came no where close to fitting over his shoes . This one is going back .
 I ordered this costume for my boy 's starwar birthday party but was quite disappointed with the followings : -1 . The workmanship of this costume is poor .2 . No seam sewing .3 . Not true to size , runs big4 . does n't looks like picture indicate .5 . Not cotton , will be hot for summer .
 I received these knee highs in good time but the product itself is like putting a tight rubber band under your knees . Not comfortable at all . All that 's necessary to keep good knee highs up is putting lotion on your legs every day . These are not recommended . I gave them all to Goodwill .
 Glove is well made , but it does not get warm enough to do any good . Even at temperature in the upper 30 's hands still get cold after 10 minutes . May be better off investing in the 12 volt type .
 If found this ad very misleading . My son was very excited to have a full costume for his 5th Birthday party and we were both surprised to see that only the robe was being provided not the Star Wars Jedi Robe Costume .
 My nephew really loved , but I was a little surprised with the quality versus the price .
 The picture shows a lot more , but in the end , it 's a robe . Nothing more . No belt , no pants , no shirt , no light saber , no boots , it 's just a robe . For what you get , it 's over priced . Easy to miss based on how it 's advertised.Joel
 This Jedi robe is a perfect halloween costume for your kids , includes a hood , with sleeves , that 's it . But your child will feel like a protector of the galaxy , wearing this nice Jedi robe . Item does not include tunic , tan shirt , illusional pull over belt , or boot tops , it 's just a basic jedi robe .
 It looks nice in the picture , however it is more of a `` trucker '' hat style , then a baseball cap style . It sits really tall , instead of form fitting to the head . The fabric was strange too . It was n't like a normal hat , it was more of a velvet feel to it . So weird.Also , beware , they do n't give refunds , only `` store credit '' .
 It ran way too small , at least 2sizes too small , so had to return it , otherwise have nothing else I can comment on .
 I ordered these in small and they were huge . Looked more like a large to me . I put them on and they feel right off . I sent them back .
 These are supposed to be polyester and cotton ... they are not they are ramie -LRB- which is cotton -RRB- and cotton ! BIG difference!also ... the pink camo and the olive green are totally different in size even tough they are both mediums ! also ... the zipper on the olive pair -LRB- even though they are labeled `` womens '' are on the wrong side .
 love the color , arrived promptly , but they are literally swimming on me . Very large fit for a small and I did n't receive any packing materials/paperwork that would allow me to return them . So ... stuck with a huge pair of pants I will donate as I can not wear them .
 This item arrived on time , in great condition , and exactly as described BUT the shirt does not fit me and i 'm 5 ' 6 '' and 115lbs . I 'm not a big girl at all and it does n't fit me . The material is so harsh on your skin , it left lines on me and I only tried it on for 5 minutes . It 's uncomfortable to wear , I do n't like it . It really sucks and I am most disappointed .
 This waist cincher did nothing for me . Very hard to put on . Maybe if you are a size 14 or below it might do something but not for the plus size woman .
 It is simultaneously too big -LRB- even though I ordered down a size indicated from the size chart , I can slip my finger between the garment and my skin if I suck in -RRB- and too small - too short , as it 's cut up in the front - which makes it flip up in the back .
 I got a size bigger so it will not bend but that didnt work the quality is great but it just doesnt do the job i was asking for . I guess i was expecting a miracle but i guess its back to the diet n gym i go
 the color is nice . I have bought other brands of body stockings and the sizing was always perfect , plus means for a heavy woman , not tall . This is the first disappointing plus size I have gotten . It is for someone over seven feet tall not someone over 150 lbs . It should be labeled as an extra tall not a plus size . What a waste of fabric . If you are extremely tall and thin , this might be nice . If you are over 150 lbs and under six feet , do not waste your money or time .
 Item is not as nice as it appears . Company was completely unresponsive . Do n't recommend .
 The quality is not the best on this costume ... And the head part of the costume that is connected to the shirt , is not flesh color as shown in the picture ... It is orange .
 I bought this for my husband , he could n't use it because of its unpractical design ...
 Plain and simple , i bought this wallet with money clip brand new . When it arrived , the money clip on the outside of the wallet had rust on it . Rust on it ! on a brand new wallet . I 'm still using my old wallet .
 This wig is made very cheap and not worth the money at all ! Hair falls out very easy and looks nothing like the picture ! And has a lot more black than green

 Warning about Amai Unmei !!! -LRB- Lovely clothes - horrendous customer service -RRB- I bought this beautiful -LRB- gorgeous -RRB- dress from Amai Unmei for my daughter 's wedding . It cost a lot of money but was well worth it - or at least should have been . This dress is cut on the bias and lays beautifully . It was perfect when my daughter and I picked it up at the store . The day of the wedding it looked GREAT - for less than twenty minutes . I put the dress on and within about five minutes my daughters noticed a stretch or pucker that just appeared out of nowhere . I had done nothing ... no food on it ... no stretching ... no pulling ... NOTHING ! Within another ten or fifteen minutes a second flaw appeared , parallel to the first and both at an angle consistent with the bias of the material . This gorgeous dress is really sleek and all one color , so the damage was obvious but the wedding was starting and I had no option but to walk my daughter down the isle with my dress looking that way.Our family was traveling and busy , so probably a couple of weeks later I took the dress into the shop . Vanessa was n't there so I left it with an explanation and asked that she call me . Long story short
 I did not like the service I got when I bougth this product , because I ordered one set of arms , and I end up with 3 sets , 2 from the same order , wich i returned , and I got credit for only one , and as far as buying more stuff from you guys , I would think twice before doing it .
 The sizing is described incorrectly . A XL = a 6 in girl sizes.Also , Old Glory , the company this sweatshirt is sent from , refuses to change their sizing descriptions AND will not give you back your shipping money.The company is poorly managed and rude , and you will be disappointed with the product -LRB- since no one over the age of 8 can fit in it -RRB- . If you like the sweatshirt , buy it from another website with PROPER SIZING and polite personnel .
 Assuming I received a correct item , it is actually a pair of 22 '' long gloves with no maker label and mainly made of nylon . Wearable but cheap looking . No responses after calls and emails to the seller .
 First of all , these gloves are not what I consider satin , they are very thin stretchy nylon . The gloves are small which was fine with me , as I have small hands , but the tips of the fingers have clumsy stitching aross them . I suppose it could be for reinforcement purposes , but it actually highlights the lower quality of these gloves . They are ok for a costume , but not to wear anywhere else . If I was aware of the low quality of these gloves I would not have purchased them , for now they are going in the ` dress-up ' box .
 These gloves are very narrow and do not stretch . The fingers ripped while trying to get them on so the material is cheap also.I did not hear boo from this company after returning the gloves . Did n't get my money back . Do n't buy anything from them period .
 This T was poorly made . When worn it hung crookedly . Would not even wear it to bed , let alone in public . Very uncomfortable !!
 i purchased this tanktop about a year ago when i put it on it didnt fit and i got a large and it was more like fit for small or medium the material isnt that good i ended up keeping it just for around the house but i wouldnt reccomend this product to anyone there are much better ones on amazon and around
 The product is way to big for the average adult head . I have a 7 1/4 - 7 1/2 size head . The Knit cap was way too big . It really looks funny . I never wear it because it looks silly . This is for the adult size . It seems others are happy with the youth . Unless you have a HUGE Mellon I would not suggest this purchase
 There is so little cotton the briefs are almost sheer . They will wear out in no time at all . Normally I wear size 36 but due to a previous review , I ordered size 38 . They are tight . Not for me .
 Unless you a really small man , these are not for you . Order 2 sizes above what you normally wear or you will be sorry . They will be very uncomfortable fitting .

 The price was great and delievery was fast , but within an hour of use and oh boy did it rain the pants ripped open and then there was no reason for me to wear it anymore.The jacket was better but not much sorry to say I got what I paid for . I am normally a 2 xl for this product and the way the size was made maybe a 4 xl would of worked , but mine did n't last long enough for me to know . I was buying it for cycling and this product was n't even good enough for walking .

 If you want the real thing do n't buy this beret . It 's cheaply made , nylon , and any soldier who 's ever had a real beret on should NOT be okay with wearing this thing . I would n't think of disgracing the uniform by wearing this beret with my ASU 's . I 100 % disagree with the two reviews above me . If you need a beret do yourself a favor and talk to your supply sergeant .

 I ordered this gas mask for my husband , who wanted to use it for a costume . It arrived with both eyes shattered . I am currently dealing with Allergy-Be-Gone to see if I can get my money back , but this seems to be a consistent problem . They are not packaged properly when shipped , just put in a box and mailed . I had terrible customer service and did n't get any response until I left negative feedback . Just be aware , the product is decent but might arrive damaged , and dealing with Allergy-Be-Gone is a pain .
 well the mask is pretty sweet but the mask came with a cracked lens , a broken strap , and the eye wholes leak . I did not send it back because I was not planning on using it for actual protection from toxic gases , but for show . I also did not want to wait another 2 weeks for it . The shipping was 8 bucks and the mask did not come for about 2 weeks . This was very annoying to wait on . In all the mask was way to expensive for the quality It had .
 Delivered to me today were two Belgian gas masks with broken lenses . I was informed that they can not be returned.The masks and the cartridges looked defective and previously used . I can not help concluding that the dealer `` Allergy be Gone '' is not selling these to use for protection.Whoever used these in an emergency will not know any better because he/she will be dead .
 I have been looking for gold shoes and I found these . I was disappointed in them ! I thought they would have more sparkle than they really do . Needed them for a wedding , but never got a chance to wear them because they came to late . I decided to keep them anyways ... was still bummed about them !

 This blouse was shorter than I hoped . It 's barely to my waist . I do n't know about you , but with the pants styles being so low cut , I need a longer top . I 'm going to send it back for a refund .
 I ordered these pants to replace an old pair of Danskin yoga pants that I absolutely love , which were apparently discontinued . From the website photos and description , this appeared to be the same style . However , where the old pants has a soft but snugly fitted waistband , and more of a drape , these have a thick , wide and firm waistband that is uncomfortable -LRB- not tight but just ungiving -RRB- and is already starting to ` bend ' slightly . In fact , I was thinking of returning them .
 I have this bra in nude ... LOVE it !! Comfy , cool , etc. , etc. . I ordered it in black for a special weekend occasion ... when I went to wear it , the sizing was at least 3 inches off & I had no choice but to wear an extender ... it worked , but not well . The following day -LRB- Sunday -RRB- , I sent an email explaining the situation to HerRoom ... 3 days later I finally get a response saying that I wore the bra , so I 'm stuck with it & sometimes bras just come in different sizes . Really ?!!? We 're talking 3 INCHES -LRB- at least !! -RRB- !! This is n't the first time I 've gotten a raw deal with this company -LRB- prior I bought undies ... took them out of bag to find a hole & never wore them ... they would n't accept them back , since they were out of the bag !? -RRB- . So again , I love the bra , but would NEVER buy from HerRoom again .
 I wear a 34DD and always wear minimizers . I need an athletic bra for the summer to wear with tank tops as i am running around with my 4 year old constantly . I ordered two different bras as they had similar reviews . This one makes your boobs very pointy ... like I said ... like torpedo boobs ... it also did not squeeze them in like I would have hoped . The other bra I bought is the Natori medium control underwire sportsbra . It was a bit more expensive , however it gives you the support and the comfort you need ... as well as a very flattering back line which is hard to come by when you have a larger chest weighing them down . I would pass on this one and buy the Natori !!!
 This `` Lunaire Coolmax Sports bra '' is actually a good bra as far as support and a nice smooth fit , and is also pretty effective at keeping the moisture -LRB- sweat -RRB- under control.Hence my two star rating instead of one . But I will never get to use it again as the underwires are torturous ! At 57 I am not new to underwires , I 've been making use of them for a few decades now , and I have never been so uncomfortable unless the bra was getting really old and thin from so many washings to the point where the underwire started poking through the seam.This bra 's underwire started digging into me right from the start . I know the size was okay , as I mentioned the fit was perfect -LRB- in both cup and width -RRB- . It was already washed and worn , so I did n't return it and because of the price I did n't want to throw it away . So I put it away and tried it again on one of those days where everything else was in the laundry . Same thing - although it did get me to do my laundry immediately , as I could n't stand being in the darn thing for more then an hour.I see mixed reactions to this bra from the reviews - but for me it was just a torture chamber and it 's not something I would recommend.The best sport bras I have found that have the same features are by Champion -LRB- with or without underwire -RRB- . Even the ones that do n't have underwires are quite supportive even in larger sizes and absorb sweat nicely as well . And they are very comfortable too.Have a great workout and Happy Shopping ... Laurie
 I ca n't believe this is marketed as a sports bra . It does nothing to prevent bounce . It 's being returned right away ! Really disappointed .
 ordered a 34DD like i usually wear and it was too tight . replaced it with a 36DD and the cups were too big . returned it for credit .
 I really wanted this bra to work , but I just tried it on , and I am promptly returning it . It was very uncomfortable and just did n't fit me right . Too big in some places , too small in others . The fabric seems like it would keep you dry , but it feels funny on my skin . I am a 40DD and I was hoping I could use this for running , but I put it to the up and down the stairs test and did not feel at all supported . Maybe there 's no such thing for big girls like me ! As someone else mentioned , it does come up really high in the front too . My biggest complaint though is the way it made me look ! Seriously pointed cone boobs going on . My search for the perfect sports bra continues ...
 The material is a little thin for hard work . Good think I ware them around the house and not on the farm
 I bought one jeans jacket , and was looking for a colour match pant . The colour did not match , and I was highly displeased . I would have returned it .
 Tried these in a 66 waist . Their characterization of these as &#34; Relaxed Fit &#34; is ridiculous . The waist was a 66 -LRB- I ordered larger to get a loose fit -- my waist is really a 64 -RRB- but the seat and thighs were nowhere near proper proportions for a person this large . It was as though I was trying to fit into a funnel that was overly wide at the waist and impossibly small at the knee . I 'd recommend skipping this brand in larger sizes .
 No era lo que se mostraba en las fotos , los sujetadores de la correa vino con 5 y en la foto salen con 7 . .
 On me , they fit poorly when compared to the &#34; other &#34; big brand who makes lots of denim jeans . Tight in the wrong places where the others are looser fitting . No problems with the quality , just not a good fit for a mid sized round guy with short thick legs , lol .
 When I got it and tried it on , I discovered zipper sticks all the time ~ 1/2 way down , 3/4 way down , etc. . That 's the cheap part . Now , having worn it several times , I 've discovered that the white pocket bulges out as a matter of course - but just on the right side . That 's the poorly made part . Headed for the Salvation Army .
 I bought three pairs of these jeans for my husband and they have all ripped in only three months . All the rips start in the back pocket . Save your money and buy a brand that will last longer -- if you can find one .
 I purchased 3 of these jeans -LRB- 34x32 -RRB- and they are not 34 at all . I have other jeans and they fit perfectly , these one are too small . Very disappointed .
 nice jeans however the belt loops were to small , it would be nice if wrangler made the loops the same size .
 I love Amazon.com , but these Wrangler jeans look similar to Wrangler jeans sold in America ; but they are NOT the same as Wranglers sold in America . My husband says the cut is different and they do n't fit him as well . We noticed that the Wrangler label on the jeans is the older style than what is used on their jeans now . I 'm not sure if they 're just really old old Wranglers that were found in some warehouse or if they are impostors made in another country with the older Wrangler label on the back . Also , these jeans have stitching on the rear pockets and I guess the current -LRB- official -RRB- Wranglers do n't have back pocket stitching anymore . My husband says , `` no more internet jeans for him ! '' He wants to try on clothes in person .
 I received my jeans in reasonable time and the label on the jeans indicated they were a 28 inch inseam . However , when I wore them , they were dragging on the floor . I then measured them with a tailor 's tape and the jeans inseam measured 30 inches . My wife will now have to correctly size them .
 These have to be counterfeit , as the seams are sub-standard . No where near the quality of Wrangler jeans bought at a brick & morter store.Stay away , these are FAKE Wranglers !!
 Ped&iacute; unos pantalones 34x36 y me llegaron unos 36x32 . Afuera en la etiqueta dice 34x36 sin embargo dentro del pantal&oacute;n en la etiqueta dice 36x32 . Por tanto no me sirvieron y me quedaron super grandes .
 I 've been wearing Wrangler relaxed fit jeans for many years now , always ordering from Amazon because they always have my size . I may have to reconsider after the last few pair . As previous astute reviewers have mentioned , these jeans are not only missing the rivets , but they shrink A LOT . I have my own washer and dryer . I wash cold and tumble dry with cold air and still these jeans shrink WAY too much , going from comfortable to ballcrushers in one wash and dry cycle . Some reviews have mentioned defects and I have now joined that crowd . I bought a pair back in April . Do I wear my new jeans right away ? No , but I like to have a backup pair or two because I wear them to work and having a new clean pair on hand is important . I tore open the packing on the new pair this morning and was wondering if I had brain damage as I sipped coffee and tried unsuccessfully to get my belt in the belt loops , wondering what was going on ... until I realized the jeans HAD NO BELT LOOPS . What in the holy hell use is a pair of Wranglers without belt loops ? And what has happened to the quality control of these jeans that a defect like that could go unnoticed ? Since it is now near the end of June it is too late for me to return the jeans without going through all kinds of bull ____ , so I am EXTREMELY disappointed with Wrangler AND Amazon . Now some of you might say , `` Jack , why did n't you just open the goddamned package when you got them and give them a look see ? '' My response ? `` They are Wranglers from Amazon . I checked that I got the right size and color , why should I have to check for belt loops ? '' Please note I 'm a long-time Amazon shopper who has rarely had to return anything . So ... anyone want a free pair of jean with no ____ ing belt loops ? For Christ 's sake . I guess I 'll see what Levi 's has to offer in relaxed fit and hope I do n't get shafted again with missing belt loops or one giant pantleg or some other insanity.-Update 2011 07 18 - Two weeks ago I unwrapped the last pair of Wranglers I had tucked away from my last purchase . For two weeks they were great - a good fit , with a bit of room in the butt and crotch -LRB- I have to bend and squat and sometimes get right down on the floor under desks at work , so a bit of room helps avoid the dreaded testicular crush -RRB- . On the weekend I washed these jeans . NO detergent , just water . COLD water only , for a 20 minute wash and rinse cycle . They went in the dryer , COLD AIR DRY only , for about twenty minutes . Then I let them hang and finish drying at room temperature . When I put them on this morning they had shrunk at least 1 full size . I felt like my gonads were being crushed by an angry Sumo wrestler . That CA N'T be normal . Should I just buy jeans 2 or 3 sizes bigger from now on and assume they will shrink ? This is crazy .
 Disappointed . Size I ordered from Amazon is the size I always buy/wear from stores . The pair received , while marked as correct size ordered , were almost too small for me to even get on and zipped-up right out of the bag . I ca n't imagine how I would have gotten them on after a few washings/shrinking . They were made in Mexico , for whatever that is worth . I do n't see the point in buying clothes online anymore if you cant trust accuracy of sizing , and if that is n't trustworthy , what can one conclude about quality of materials , workmanship , etc. . ?
 I ordered a pair of these for my husband in November 2011 and he loved them . Great fit , super comfy and looked good . So I ordered him two more pair for Christmas in the same size . Well , they fit nothing like the exact same item we 'd ordered in November . They were easily a size too small and he could barely get them buttoned . I agree with the earlier reviewer ; these jeans bore no resemblance to the pair we bought from Amazon only a month before . I returned them and I 'm reluctant to order anymore -- even in a larger size -- because now I really do n't know what we 're going to get . Both orders of the Wrangler Men 's Rugged Wear Relaxed Fit Jean were made in Mexico and had tags indicating size 33x30 , but the first pair were easily an inch larger in the waist and you can tell by the numbers on the tags they must have been made in different factories . It 's disappointing to say the least . If Wrangler is going to have other countries make their jeans , they need to apply consistent patterns and standards . It 's called `` quality control '' !
 Smaller than they should be -- I 've ordered these exact brand , model and size at several other retailers in the past , with no issues . But even though the Amazon product showed the same information , including the same product numbers on the actual tags , their size is definitely not the same . I ordered the 40x38 , but when I compare these to supposedly identical jeans purchased in the past , these Amazon ones are about 2-3 inches smaller at the waist.Other than that they are good jeans , but for online clothing sales it 's imperative to carry accurate sizes since people ca n't try them on in advance ...
 I needed a new pair of Wranglers because all of my jeans were 4-5 years old - and looked it . I was shocked and disappointed to find that these Wranglers did n't have that new-blue look . They look like the 5 year old Wranglers that they were supposed to replace ! Amazon 's description did n't mention that these pants had a used look ; I 'll be returning them . I learned an important lesson
 Their the smallest 35 's I have ever seen . They would n't fit my son at all and were very tight on my grandson that wears a 33 .
 I do n't know where they are making these jeans now a days , but be prepared to have them altered , The measurements are all off . I had to have mine altered by a taylor .
 I ordered 1 pair of Wrangler 's and they could n't seem to get them shipped out for whatever reason . When I order something simple , I do n't expect to wait weeks to receive it and if there 's a problem that holds the order up , I expect an e-mail to let me know , which never happened ! I finally canceled the order because my son started school and they were still telling me it would be a couple more weeks before they even shipped ? Unless you plan on waiting forever for your order , I do not recommend this company !
 I usually never order jeans online and against my better judgement did so . If you dont really care about how your jeans sits on your body then you will find it fine , but the cut and fit was simply too relaxed for me . At the end of the day , leaves you looking sloppy .
 Ordered up a pair , reviews look good , got them fairly quickly , tried them on , they fit good . The right hand from pocket felt like there was something in it , like an `` Inspected by # 277 '' note , but it was just the wrinkled and crispy pocket itself . I inspected it closer , and it was full of holes ! The front left pocket had the same problem . Bummer . Sending back for refund . . not taking another chance , I 'll just go to the store and get jeans .
 I ordered Men 's Wrangler Relaxed Fit Jean size 40x34 . When we received the package the shipping receipt AND the label attached to the outside of the pants said the pants were size 40x34 . However , when he tried the jeans on the jeans did not fit right . We then checked the inside tag and found that they were really 36x32 . We will be returning the jeans . I am usually pleased with Amazon.com however this particular item was a birthday present -LRB- he received the jeans one day before his birthday so there is no way to get a replacement pair here by tomorrow , his birthday -RRB- . Hopefully the return process will be smooth and they will send us the right size .
 If you are a long time Wrangler wearer , as I am , do n't be fooled by these . I made the mistake of keeping the three pair I ordered even though it is obvious that they are NOT the same as the original 31MWZWK jeans . They felt pretty good , so I decided to give them a try . These jeans are thinner material , have a different label , and shrank in size right after I washed them . They do n't have the rivet on the pockets and are generally cheaper in feel . Since these are the jeans that came up when I typed in 31MWZWK , I believed that that was what I was getting . I actually think that they might be a `` knock-off '' rather than the real thing . By the time I realized I no longer wanted them , it was too late to return them for a refund . I feel really ripped off .
 They look nice but they do n't fit . Not even close . They were so unbelievably tight that I measured them . The tag inside the jeans is marked with the size that I ordered , but they actually measure at about 4-5 inches smaller in the waist . The price was pretty low , so I 'm wondering if they were rejects from a third world country manufacturing plant . Better to buy jeans in person than online .
 I had ordered the Wrangler loose fit jeans of the same size last week , and LOVED them . I was looking for a replacement for Levi 550s and 569s , as they had turned to junk recently -LRB- easily ripped , shrank up in both directions -RRB- . The loose fit Wranglers were a PERFECT fit . Not so with these . The exact same size in the relaxed fit was OK for length , but instead of a 38x32 -LRB- as on the sticker -RRB- , I think it was about a 32x30 . Never have I seen such a difference in sizing amongst the same manufacturer . Poor quality control ; I 'd lose my job immediately if I let product like this ship !
 Wranglers have always been sized perfectly for me for years -- buy them at Target , do n't even bother to try them on , wash them , wear them . But the first time they were ordered from Amazon , the `` relaxed fit '' is so tight I have to do the old 80 's trick of lying down on the bed to get them to button . The waist might stretch , but the hip pocket is so tight I ca n't get my wallet in/out without making a scene . I asked the gift giver for the Amazon return label , and she looked so offended I dropped the subject.I think Wranglers are great jeans -- if these were factory seconds I wish they had been marked -- and priced -- accordingly .
 The jeans fit well and looked nice when they first arrived . However , they have already fallen apart . I am very disappointed with this purchase . I picked up a pair of Levis and a pair of Kirkland -LRB- Costco -RRB- jeans all around the same time . I am not very happy with the expensive Levi jeans either but at least they are n't falling apart . The most comfortable of the 3 pairs is acutally the Kirkland brand which I got for under $ 10 . I have worn them many more times than the Wrangler jeans and they are holding up just fine . I will NEVER buy another pair of Wrangler jeans .
 My son was really excited about this costume ! It shipped quickly ; however the mask broke immediately . I called and the customer service was not good at all . They ended up giving us a 10 % discount , but I was very disappointed . Very poor quality !
 I love that little white cross on red and normally expect a quality product when I buy them.I had this bag for about 2 months of daily use before the two serious failures appeared.In two locations on the bag the nylon came unstitched
 the packaged arrived pretty quick but the hat wasnt what i expected ... more pics of the cap would have been nice ?
 I called customer service to get advice on what size to purchase after giving them my measurements and purchased a size 5 as told . This bra might work for some people , but not being able to adjust the straps makes it fit too close to my neckline . I would like to return it , but wore it once to workout in so now I am out of money and still do n't have a nice bra to wear . I would n't suggest ordering this online !
 I believed all the Oprah hype and bought this sports bra . What a huge disappointment . This sports bra will stop the bounce , even if you are a DDD or F cup , but ... it is so uncomfortable ! I gave it 2 stars only because it does keep the girls in place , but the positives stop there . It really smashes you down and it 's hard to breathe . Yes mine fit right , so please do n't say that I needed a bigger size . The problem is that it 's really really thick material , seems to be several layers actually , and then the bra itself is built like something you 'd see in a World War II movie , more like getting ready to drive a tank than go for a jog . It reminds me of something Dr. Evil 's assistant Frau Farbisina from Austin Powers would wear . My husband could not stop laughing when he saw me in this thing . It really does not look like the pictures in person . The pictures make it look positively sexy compared to what you will really look like in that thing . The band is really thick and it does n't give . I mean there should be SOME give to the thing , even if it is supposed to keep things in place.Now I could overcome how ridiculous the thing looks if it were comfortable to wear , but the looks part is precisely why it 's so awful . The neck line is so high that unless you wear a boxy men 's T shirt the bra will show . The back also rides high and it put a lot of pressure on my shoulders . Because your girls are being smashed down , instead of supported and kept in place , if you are on the larger busted side , it pulls the weight down on your shoulders . You have to do some serious adjusting , but even then , it just kills my shoulders , which then makes me want to cut my workout short to get out of that thing . It 's really more of a contraption than a garment . I 'm sure the person who invented this was a man . NO way would a woman do that to other women!If you are a DDD or higher , I suggest you go somewhere to try this bra on before ordering it and make sure it works for you . For me , I ca n't even stand looking at it in my closet , but I waited too long to return it and I ca n't bear tossing out the money I paid for it . If I want to dress like Dr. Evil 's assistant for Halloween one year , I 'm sure I 'll break it out . Of course I will likely pass out from not breathing , but hey as long as the girls stay put .
 I 'm only a 34C but ca n't stand the slightest bounce . I found this bra at a local store so I was able to give it a test run by running in place in the changing room . I tried several sizes and found it did not provide the support I needed , especially for the price . It was also difficult to put on and take off . Luckily the store also had the Moving Comfort Maia which I tested and then purchased as it performed well . This was 2 yrs ago and I still run in it , though I think it is time for a new one .
 I purchased this because of the amazing reviews for how supportive this bra is for large busted women . I am a runner and just ca n't quite find enough support . This was n't it either . The fabric felt like it did n't breathe and just wearing it around my apartment felt it was too restrictive around my ribcage to breathe deeply . For $ 60 it should have some sort of adjustment around the ribcage . And I am not that large around ... I wear a 38D normally . For the $ $ I would try something else .
 I ordered mine based on their fit guide and it was way way too small . I sent it back and shopped locally instead .
 by measurements/sizing charts etc I ordered the size that should have fit 34D - it was way too big up front - I returned it and got myself 34D moving comfort Maya instead . Much better fit for me .
 Please save your time and money and do n't order this sports bra . I have researched sports bras and tried many sports bras . After the research , I had to try Enell . Everyone was positive about it . I did read several comments about the thick seam across the breast , but I ignored the comments and ordered the bra . I was so excited to receive the bra in the mail , but after putting on the sports bra , I was extremely disappointed . The bra is supportive and holds you in place but you can not wear the bra to the gym under a t-shirt . It looks awful with a thick seam over your breast and it is impossible to hide . So , I returned the bra . Trust me , do n't waste your money !!
 I was looking for a good sports bra to wear while I work out and found this one through various reviews and was excited to have a bra that had lots of support for larger women particularly during exercise . When I received the bra I took the labels off and put it on . I wore it around the house before going to the gym . I did n't like it mainly for two reasons
 Super intense ... I figured out that a regular sports bra is just the way to go ... None of the sizes would fit right on me . Either the banding was too tight and the cup just right or the other way around .
 This is more like a harness than a Bra . I do n't know if it would be comfortable or not as I could not even get it fastened . The sizing was very confusing . The only good thing about it was it was easy to return .
 Not at all what I expected . Background info . Chesty 36 DD , looking for a good sprots bra.Thought from all the reviews it would be a GREAT product , but that is just not the case.First it is extremely hard to get into . I thought that may be OK if it worked . There are no less than 25 front hooks and since the bra needs to be so tight you really ca n't pull the bra closed to hook it.So off to the 2nd option of hooking all the hooks and then pulling it over my head ... well this worked for getting the bra on . I was amazed at how tight the bra was , but figured hey the tighter the better nothing will move!Again , just not the case . I found that my ratty champion sports bra did a MUCH better job . I was hopeful even with the unattractive `` uniboob '' look that it would work . At this stage of the game I am function over form.In a nutshell , the bra is overpriced , hard to get into , does not stop movement and has a disctinct uniboob look . You could even see the top of the bra peaking out from my shirt.Just all around uncomforable and not worth it.The search goes on ...
 Jansport has really gone downhill in the past 10 years . It used to be that the top 3 brands were Jansport , Eastpak , and High Sierra . Now Eastpak only deals with the european market . High Sierra has gone into uber industrial -LRB- non casual -RRB- backpacks that are a cross between urban and hiking . And Jansport still produces casual school/day treker backpacks but unfortunately the quality has gone down a lot . They do n't produce the leather/suede bottoms anymore . Now , the bottoms rip and wear out more easily and the entire fabric is a lot thinner and cheaper . I compared one I purchased last week at Staples to one that I had 10 years ago and the one purchased recently will probably wear out faster than the one 10 years back . That 's a little ridiculous . You can really feel how thing the fabric has become , it 's sad . I do n't think they 're even produced in the US anymore , probably China . They 've made no changes to it besides putting some padding in the back . But it 's really lost the appeal that it once had . I ca n't believe you could walk into a Walmart , Kmart or Target and find wall to wall of quality Jansports with leather bottoms and now the closest thing you can get is this piece of crap . Thanks Jansport , maybe in 10 more years you 'll reduce down to a burlap sack or a coffee bean bag . BTW , the jansport I just purchased has been returned .
 I purchased this product for my 1st grader . He liked the design ; I liked the Jansport brand -LRB- I have had several Jansport backpacks and always was very happy -RRB- . Well , the backpack was so thin I could read this review online through the material . The backpack was so lightweight that my son 's water bottle could put a hole through its side . The bottom had such little support that a wet paper grocery bag would provide superior results . In summary -- I returned the product the day after it arrived at my home . I actually contacted the seller and asked him/her if this was a knock-off , and he reassured me that it was a genuine product . Although I could n't believe him completely , the vendor was very nice and professional about returning the backpack .
 The color of the real thing is dark gray which is very ugly . And I have tried to return this item , but I failed because UPS did come to pick the package in three days . And I am leaving in two weeks so I am afraid I can not get the refund at that time so I gave up to return this item . This is an awful experience !
 This product is cheap and the stitching was all over the place . It was made overseas and it shows . I will never buy from this company again . It 's doubtful this thing will last 3 weeks as it 's so thin and flimsy . I would like to warn anyone who is considering buying one of the Jansport bags online . Go to a store and look at it first and buy it there . I would have never EVER bought this bag if I was able to check it out first . Either way , it made my 7 year old happy , and i 'm sure she will be upset that it has torn up within a month . Buyers BEWARE .
 I got excited when i came across this bag because of the colour and when i received it i was very disappionted the colour is nothing like the one in the picture and i am so not happy with this bag .
 This is n't really worth the price . Based on strength and utility alone , I 've seen cheaper backpacks at Wal-Mart , etc. that far outshine this little thing . This is really quite small , do n't let the big numbers fool you.I guess I could suggest this for elementary schoolers , but as a college student this really does n't work for me . I remember carrying even more books in high school , so yeah , that 's out too . When you get this , you 're really just paying for the name brand . They pocket the difference by sacrificing quality .1 . Smaller than it looks .2 . Very thin fabric .3 . The joke they call ` padding ' does n't keep the sharp edges of any book from sticking into your back .4 . The straps feel very weak , and I do n't feel comfortable carrying all my books in it .5 . The backpack has a tendency to ` slide ' down ; the buckle does n't hold the straps well , so the nylon slides past it and causes the straps to loosen against your will .
 For the quality and size of this backpack , it is way overpriced . I can buy a large size gym bag for the price of this backpack .
 It is really low quality and the straps are uncomfortable.I bought it for my daughter If I had seen it before I would not buy it . I think it is not good for a child . Because comfort is more important for them than adults.I will not return it but will not use for school.I am very disappointed.It is like a joke !!!
 So i bought this backpack because I needed to keep my books somewhere so I could carry things in my hands . I am 17 and a senior in High School . I ordered on the 21st or 22nd of December -LSB- I know I got the rest of my items before Christmas -RSB- and got the bag on the 6th of January . which was a drag.I got the bag at the material is pretty lousy , the straps are stiff and worst of all ... its really small . I am 5 ' 7 '' and this bag looks like a little kid 's backpack . I just got ta say that if you are older than 10 or 11 , find a new backpack or you will just look like a grown person who stole some little helpless kid 's backpack .
 I bought 3 of these to replace worn out back packs . I thought they would be great quality , but from the appearance they look no better than the ones they already had that fell apart after 3 months . I was really disappointed by how thin they are .
 I really like the color and it is aesthetically pleasing in my opinion . I 'm not sure if they sent me the wrong size or something but it is really small . It looks like a first graders back pack , not one for a college student .
 From the description '' ... giving it enough space to store two to three textbooks , a large binder , two to three spiral notebooks ... `` Not sure what textbooks and notebooks these guys used to measure it , but my daughter had to pack 2 middle-school textbooks , 1 binder and 1 spiral notebook and they would not fit . We had to go and buy her a different backpack .
 I bought this backpack for my son for his freshman year of high school . He came to me two days later and told me he had too many things from his classes and they would n't all fit in this pack . Together we tried to make room for everything and were able to squeeze it all in . However , the backpack started coming apart at the seams a week later .
 This bag was going to be for me to use at college , and quite frankly it was WAY too small for that . It is more made for elementry to middle school kids . So luckily I have a little sister to give it to , but otherwise , I 'm pretty disappointed .
 This was supposed to be large enough for an adult . It 's really meant for a Jr. . High school student . A waste !
 the straps would loosen by itself when carring the bag on your back ... . i dont like it . Also the material is flimsy . but we all know that jansport lasts long ...
 I could n't believe it was a jansport . It is the sorriest excuse for a backpack I have seen in awhile . More like something from the K-mart bargain basement . Would definitely not suggest buying it .
 Very disappointed in this backpack . My daughter was happy with it , but myself as a mother knows that it will last no longer than a couple of months . There is absolutely no lining within the back . Fits all her books though she says ...
 I saw this bag well displayed with multi-divisions -LRB- sections -RRB- and got attracked to it because that was what I wanted but to my surprise , is far from what it was displayed . I am very much disappointed , it will not serve my purpose and I hate it that I do not even know what to do with it . it was totally wrong product display .
 The shipping time is ok , but the color is totally wronge . It is impossible to carry the kind of color to outside .
 It is REALLY FRUSTRATING ... I ASKED FOR WHITE/SILVER STARS , it seems to be a problem with the product , they sent me the WHITE/SILVER TWINKLE STARS one ... I purchased it in amazon ONLY because I needed SPECIFICALLY the WHITE/SILVER STARS in the RIGHT DAY ... This order was time sensitive , anyhow everybody can make mistakes , so I called to let them know that It was wrong and they told me that they will fix it , they will not make the same mistake they will resend the backpack ... . they ask me to send it back and they sent me `` THE RIGHT ONE '' but today -LRB- 24 days after -RRB- I got in the mail AGAIN THE WRONG BACKPACK ! ... Not to mention the other hydration pack that I bought in the same order that got lost in the mail ... I just want to place the complaint , I feel really frustrated and do n't want to hear again a customer service representative telling me that `` he assure me this will not happen again `` My recommendation
 the shoulder strap is already broken and it has only been 6 weeks . its a weak backpack , considering that i put it to gentle use
 I bought this backpack for college and after 9 months it tore in three places . Terrible quality . I paid 5 Bucks to mail it in for repair under warranty and after two months with no responce I called and found out that they wo n't fix anything because the damage happened , `` as a result of normal use , '' ... well is n't that exactly why companies have a warranty ? So that if the product you buy from them shows manufacturing defects that become evident through normal use the product is replaced ? This company is a joke and only profits on the fact that they have huge name recognition , but this product was of very low quality and the warranty is a fraud .
 I purchased this , thinking that it was hot pink , but to my surprise the backpack was a unexpected salmon color &#34; pink . &#34; Do n't be fooled by the description -LRB- Pink Prep -RRB- .
 The material for the body of the bag is very thin and I 'm worried it wo n't last me through the school year . It 's not a comfortable fit with the weight of my texts no matter where the straps are adjusted . I admit it looks really cute and you ca n't beat the price , but if i were to see that bag in a store where i could touch it and feel the material , i would not have purchased it - even despite how inexpensive it was .
 I bought this backpack for my 12-year old Goddaughter who was visiting from Brazil . She wanted this particular brand because it happens to be in fashion down there . However , I fail to understand why it costs so much considering the poor quality of the material and the overall product . I can buy a much much better backpack , padded , strongly made and with lots of compartments making it much more useful , for a lot less money . I think the product is way overrated and unless your kid wants it for the `` fashion '' aspect of it , I 'd look for something else of better quality .
 My kids have used JanSport backpacks in the past and we have n't had a problem with them . However , I ordered this one in the beginning of September . My daughter has used it for about 2 weeks and it has already ripped . I am very disappointed in JanSport .
 I got my first JanSport backpack when I was in elementary school , and it lasted until my senior year of high school . A while later in college , I decided to buy a backpack , and naturally went for another JanSport.My first disappointment was that the backpack was n't a true navy color -- it 's dark blue , not navy . That I could live with , however . The drastic decrease in quality was the biggest disappointment . Within months , the backpack had small holes in it . I bought this size because I 'm an English major who rarely has textbooks to carry around , so I was n't even carrying anything heavy or sharp . After roughly a year of use , the backpack had several good-sized holes in it.The straps also began to come unattached from the top of the backpack ; the fabric started to fray terribly , and by the week , the straps came off more and more . I was perplexed , since I 'd carried much heavier things in my older backpack for much longer . Before I 'd even had the backpack two years , one of the straps had almost completely come off . I sewed it back on using heavy duty thread , but within a couple of weeks the stitches no longer held because the fabric had frayed even further . I did n't have much choice but to replace it.The last thing is , JanSport backpacks are no longer machine washable . I threw my first backpack in the washer dozens of times . With this one , I had to try to hand wash it if it got a stain on it . Backpacks get enough use that they should really be machine washable . And they should be much more durable than this one was .
 The backpack shown in the picture is not the same as the one delivered . My daughter was quite disappointed . The one delivered is a cute backpack , but not what I thought I was ordering . The one pictured has bright purple ; the one delivered has very dark purple that is n't noticible . The one pictured has purple straps at the top and on the bottom of the shoulder straps . The one delivered has all black ... So , the only things purple on the one we got are the zipper pulls . By the time we got it we were afraid if we sent it back , my daughter would not have a new one by the first day of school . So , we added our own purple to it . I 'll think twice about ordering from here again .
 Purchased it for junier high school student . it 's not big enough and also you can not image how large it actually will be . Overall , it 's low cost and low quality bag and you can buy it at local sports authority cheaper and easy to return or change it if you do n't like it after receiving . Will not buy those bag anyway .
 I received my bag and it looks exactly like i wanted it . Problem is it 's cut like someone has used a knife or razor to cut it a whole 5cm cut on the top of the bag . This is not what i really imagined to get .
 I bought these gloves to use as motorcycle gloves when it gets down around 30 degrees . They work better than the ones they replaced but , on a 45 minute ride in bitter cold they did n't quite stand up as I had hoped . Maybe I was asking too much . Where O where is my perfect glove ?

 Sizes run small , material very thin , did n't wash well - net-net
 the total price of almost ten dollars -LRB- including shipping -RRB- was n't worth it . the quality was very thin and the sewing was n't professionally done - the buttoned down part by the neckline was not straight and there were threads loose here and there . i would have kept it if it was just thin but the sewing was just too cheap looking .
 The vendor did not ship the merchandise I ordered . The customer service is poor . The vendor tried to get paid for merchandise I did not have after I returned the shirts .
 I ordered this product with pocket . Received it without pocket . The product is of good quality and I will keep it anyway .
 I ordered 3 of these Polo Shirts , and I regret wasting my money . I did n't read the reviews until after I placed my ordered and they were right . The fabric is EXTREMELY thin and a bit transparent , and the stitching was horrible . Very LOW QUALITY . I seriously do n't recommend you buying this product , cause you just gon na end up returning it .
 I love Amazon.com , but these Wrangler jeans look similar to Wrangler jeans sold in America ; but they are NOT the same as Wranglers sold in America . My husband says the cut is different and they do n't fit him as well . We noticed that the Wrangler label on the jeans is the older style than what is used on their jeans now . I 'm not sure if they 're just really old old Wranglers that were found in some warehouse or if they are impostors made in another country with the older Wrangler label on the back . Also , these jeans have stitching on the rear pockets and I guess the current -LRB- official -RRB- Wranglers do n't have back pocket stitching anymore . My husband says , `` no more internet jeans for him ! '' He wants to try on clothes in person .
 I received my jeans in reasonable time and the label on the jeans indicated they were a 28 inch inseam . However , when I wore them , they were dragging on the floor . I then measured them with a tailor 's tape and the jeans inseam measured 30 inches . My wife will now have to correctly size them .
 On me , they fit poorly when compared to the &#34; other &#34; big brand who makes lots of denim jeans . Tight in the wrong places where the others are looser fitting . No problems with the quality , just not a good fit for a mid sized round guy with short thick legs , lol .
 When I got it and tried it on , I discovered zipper sticks all the time ~ 1/2 way down , 3/4 way down , etc. . That 's the cheap part . Now , having worn it several times , I 've discovered that the white pocket bulges out as a matter of course - but just on the right side . That 's the poorly made part . Headed for the Salvation Army .
 These have to be counterfeit , as the seams are sub-standard . No where near the quality of Wrangler jeans bought at a brick & morter store.Stay away , these are FAKE Wranglers !!
 Ped&iacute; unos pantalones 34x36 y me llegaron unos 36x32 . Afuera en la etiqueta dice 34x36 sin embargo dentro del pantal&oacute;n en la etiqueta dice 36x32 . Por tanto no me sirvieron y me quedaron super grandes .
 The material is a little thin for hard work . Good think I ware them around the house and not on the farm
 I bought one jeans jacket , and was looking for a colour match pant . The colour did not match , and I was highly displeased . I would have returned it .
 Tried these in a 66 waist . Their characterization of these as &#34; Relaxed Fit &#34; is ridiculous . The waist was a 66 -LRB- I ordered larger to get a loose fit -- my waist is really a 64 -RRB- but the seat and thighs were nowhere near proper proportions for a person this large . It was as though I was trying to fit into a funnel that was overly wide at the waist and impossibly small at the knee . I 'd recommend skipping this brand in larger sizes .
 No era lo que se mostraba en las fotos , los sujetadores de la correa vino con 5 y en la foto salen con 7 . .
 I bought three pairs of these jeans for my husband and they have all ripped in only three months . All the rips start in the back pocket . Save your money and buy a brand that will last longer -- if you can find one .
 I purchased 3 of these jeans -LRB- 34x32 -RRB- and they are not 34 at all . I have other jeans and they fit perfectly , these one are too small . Very disappointed .
 nice jeans however the belt loops were to small , it would be nice if wrangler made the loops the same size .
 I 've been wearing Wrangler relaxed fit jeans for many years now , always ordering from Amazon because they always have my size . I may have to reconsider after the last few pair . As previous astute reviewers have mentioned , these jeans are not only missing the rivets , but they shrink A LOT . I have my own washer and dryer . I wash cold and tumble dry with cold air and still these jeans shrink WAY too much , going from comfortable to ballcrushers in one wash and dry cycle . Some reviews have mentioned defects and I have now joined that crowd . I bought a pair back in April . Do I wear my new jeans right away ? No , but I like to have a backup pair or two because I wear them to work and having a new clean pair on hand is important . I tore open the packing on the new pair this morning and was wondering if I had brain damage as I sipped coffee and tried unsuccessfully to get my belt in the belt loops , wondering what was going on ... until I realized the jeans HAD NO BELT LOOPS . What in the holy hell use is a pair of Wranglers without belt loops ? And what has happened to the quality control of these jeans that a defect like that could go unnoticed ? Since it is now near the end of June it is too late for me to return the jeans without going through all kinds of bull ____ , so I am EXTREMELY disappointed with Wrangler AND Amazon . Now some of you might say , `` Jack , why did n't you just open the goddamned package when you got them and give them a look see ? '' My response ? `` They are Wranglers from Amazon . I checked that I got the right size and color , why should I have to check for belt loops ? '' Please note I 'm a long-time Amazon shopper who has rarely had to return anything . So ... anyone want a free pair of jean with no ____ ing belt loops ? For Christ 's sake . I guess I 'll see what Levi 's has to offer in relaxed fit and hope I do n't get shafted again with missing belt loops or one giant pantleg or some other insanity.-Update 2011 07 18 - Two weeks ago I unwrapped the last pair of Wranglers I had tucked away from my last purchase . For two weeks they were great - a good fit , with a bit of room in the butt and crotch -LRB- I have to bend and squat and sometimes get right down on the floor under desks at work , so a bit of room helps avoid the dreaded testicular crush -RRB- . On the weekend I washed these jeans . NO detergent , just water . COLD water only , for a 20 minute wash and rinse cycle . They went in the dryer , COLD AIR DRY only , for about twenty minutes . Then I let them hang and finish drying at room temperature . When I put them on this morning they had shrunk at least 1 full size . I felt like my gonads were being crushed by an angry Sumo wrestler . That CA N'T be normal . Should I just buy jeans 2 or 3 sizes bigger from now on and assume they will shrink ? This is crazy .
 Disappointed . Size I ordered from Amazon is the size I always buy/wear from stores . The pair received , while marked as correct size ordered , were almost too small for me to even get on and zipped-up right out of the bag . I ca n't imagine how I would have gotten them on after a few washings/shrinking . They were made in Mexico , for whatever that is worth . I do n't see the point in buying clothes online anymore if you cant trust accuracy of sizing , and if that is n't trustworthy , what can one conclude about quality of materials , workmanship , etc. . ?
 I ordered a pair of these for my husband in November 2011 and he loved them . Great fit , super comfy and looked good . So I ordered him two more pair for Christmas in the same size . Well , they fit nothing like the exact same item we 'd ordered in November . They were easily a size too small and he could barely get them buttoned . I agree with the earlier reviewer ; these jeans bore no resemblance to the pair we bought from Amazon only a month before . I returned them and I 'm reluctant to order anymore -- even in a larger size -- because now I really do n't know what we 're going to get . Both orders of the Wrangler Men 's Rugged Wear Relaxed Fit Jean were made in Mexico and had tags indicating size 33x30 , but the first pair were easily an inch larger in the waist and you can tell by the numbers on the tags they must have been made in different factories . It 's disappointing to say the least . If Wrangler is going to have other countries make their jeans , they need to apply consistent patterns and standards . It 's called `` quality control '' !
 I had ordered the Wrangler loose fit jeans of the same size last week , and LOVED them . I was looking for a replacement for Levi 550s and 569s , as they had turned to junk recently -LRB- easily ripped , shrank up in both directions -RRB- . The loose fit Wranglers were a PERFECT fit . Not so with these . The exact same size in the relaxed fit was OK for length , but instead of a 38x32 -LRB- as on the sticker -RRB- , I think it was about a 32x30 . Never have I seen such a difference in sizing amongst the same manufacturer . Poor quality control ; I 'd lose my job immediately if I let product like this ship !
 Wranglers have always been sized perfectly for me for years -- buy them at Target , do n't even bother to try them on , wash them , wear them . But the first time they were ordered from Amazon , the `` relaxed fit '' is so tight I have to do the old 80 's trick of lying down on the bed to get them to button . The waist might stretch , but the hip pocket is so tight I ca n't get my wallet in/out without making a scene . I asked the gift giver for the Amazon return label , and she looked so offended I dropped the subject.I think Wranglers are great jeans -- if these were factory seconds I wish they had been marked -- and priced -- accordingly .
 The jeans fit well and looked nice when they first arrived . However , they have already fallen apart . I am very disappointed with this purchase . I picked up a pair of Levis and a pair of Kirkland -LRB- Costco -RRB- jeans all around the same time . I am not very happy with the expensive Levi jeans either but at least they are n't falling apart . The most comfortable of the 3 pairs is acutally the Kirkland brand which I got for under $ 10 . I have worn them many more times than the Wrangler jeans and they are holding up just fine . I will NEVER buy another pair of Wrangler jeans .
 I usually never order jeans online and against my better judgement did so . If you dont really care about how your jeans sits on your body then you will find it fine , but the cut and fit was simply too relaxed for me . At the end of the day , leaves you looking sloppy .
 Ordered up a pair , reviews look good , got them fairly quickly , tried them on , they fit good . The right hand from pocket felt like there was something in it , like an `` Inspected by # 277 '' note , but it was just the wrinkled and crispy pocket itself . I inspected it closer , and it was full of holes ! The front left pocket had the same problem . Bummer . Sending back for refund . . not taking another chance , I 'll just go to the store and get jeans .
 I ordered Men 's Wrangler Relaxed Fit Jean size 40x34 . When we received the package the shipping receipt AND the label attached to the outside of the pants said the pants were size 40x34 . However , when he tried the jeans on the jeans did not fit right . We then checked the inside tag and found that they were really 36x32 . We will be returning the jeans . I am usually pleased with Amazon.com however this particular item was a birthday present -LRB- he received the jeans one day before his birthday so there is no way to get a replacement pair here by tomorrow , his birthday -RRB- . Hopefully the return process will be smooth and they will send us the right size .
 If you are a long time Wrangler wearer , as I am , do n't be fooled by these . I made the mistake of keeping the three pair I ordered even though it is obvious that they are NOT the same as the original 31MWZWK jeans . They felt pretty good , so I decided to give them a try . These jeans are thinner material , have a different label , and shrank in size right after I washed them . They do n't have the rivet on the pockets and are generally cheaper in feel . Since these are the jeans that came up when I typed in 31MWZWK , I believed that that was what I was getting . I actually think that they might be a `` knock-off '' rather than the real thing . By the time I realized I no longer wanted them , it was too late to return them for a refund . I feel really ripped off .
 They look nice but they do n't fit . Not even close . They were so unbelievably tight that I measured them . The tag inside the jeans is marked with the size that I ordered , but they actually measure at about 4-5 inches smaller in the waist . The price was pretty low , so I 'm wondering if they were rejects from a third world country manufacturing plant . Better to buy jeans in person than online .
 Smaller than they should be -- I 've ordered these exact brand , model and size at several other retailers in the past , with no issues . But even though the Amazon product showed the same information , including the same product numbers on the actual tags , their size is definitely not the same . I ordered the 40x38 , but when I compare these to supposedly identical jeans purchased in the past , these Amazon ones are about 2-3 inches smaller at the waist.Other than that they are good jeans , but for online clothing sales it 's imperative to carry accurate sizes since people ca n't try them on in advance ...
 I needed a new pair of Wranglers because all of my jeans were 4-5 years old - and looked it . I was shocked and disappointed to find that these Wranglers did n't have that new-blue look . They look like the 5 year old Wranglers that they were supposed to replace ! Amazon 's description did n't mention that these pants had a used look ; I 'll be returning them . I learned an important lesson
 Their the smallest 35 's I have ever seen . They would n't fit my son at all and were very tight on my grandson that wears a 33 .
 I do n't know where they are making these jeans now a days , but be prepared to have them altered , The measurements are all off . I had to have mine altered by a taylor .
 I ordered 1 pair of Wrangler 's and they could n't seem to get them shipped out for whatever reason . When I order something simple , I do n't expect to wait weeks to receive it and if there 's a problem that holds the order up , I expect an e-mail to let me know , which never happened ! I finally canceled the order because my son started school and they were still telling me it would be a couple more weeks before they even shipped ? Unless you plan on waiting forever for your order , I do not recommend this company !
 I bought these gloves to use as motorcycle gloves when it gets down around 30 degrees . They work better than the ones they replaced but , on a 45 minute ride in bitter cold they did n't quite stand up as I had hoped . Maybe I was asking too much . Where O where is my perfect glove ?

 unless u want your partner thinks u are having a terrible skin rash , , , , , dont buy the red color !!! wasnt impressed at all , , maybe z black one would have been nicer !!
 I had to return this thing . It was the wrong size but even if it was n't I would have returned it anyway because its the ugliest sweater I have ever seen . Amazon was awesome on the whole returns process as always though .
 Not much to like about this sweater ... upon opening the bag , it reeks of some type of plastic/rubber smell -- if you 've ever thrown something made of plastic into a fire -- you 'll recognize the smell immediately ! It also had some kind of ` crease ' across the midriff , that bulged out like a sore thumb . After the first washing , the smell and the crease pretty much went away -- but both were still faintly noticeable . The sizes do run a little small , but they DO stretch , so you might be OK with that . I 've worn it 3 times since I got it , and after the third washing , the material on the elbows/shoulder patches are falling apart , and developing a ` threadbare ' look ... in other words , spend the money and buy a REAL wool , commando , sweater -- not this China-made , plastic crap . For the price they 're charging -- it is n't worth it .
 the sweater was to long on the bottom and the sleeves . Also the sweater was harsh on the skin . We returned the sweater with no problem . Usually my husband takes a 2X .
 I was really looking forward to receiving this sweater and disappointed that it has to be returned . The body of this sweater is too tight and too long . I am 6 ' and the size XL I purchased comes down almost below my `` backside '' without stretching . I 'll admit the days of washboard abs are behind me but only someone built like Ryan Reynolds would look good in this sweater . This is not designed for the average guy .
 Pirate Petite Sz 3T To 4T - So poorly made that the item does not even match the image included with the costume . The silver ribbon sewn onto the front of the dress was upside down and the bandana flaps were inside out , so they were black instead of red . The black boots that you slip over shoes are very cheap-looking shiny plastic . Straight out of the package , there were already snags in several areas of what 's suppose to be sparkly material over the striped portion of the dress . Also runs smaller than you you may expect . Luckily , the seller quickly sent me a return label after I sent her photos of what I received . BE WARNED
 the brief was very poorly made with raw uneven seams . one leg opening was larger than the other . the item did not dry within 3-4 hrs . as advertised . it was extremely expensive for the poor quality . i would have returned it for a refund except the cost of shipping and the return shipping cost did not make sense .
 I bought this set of five onesies for my daughter , at the same time I bought some pricier ones for her at cafepress . These ones shrunk after the first wash and in some cases you could n't read what was written in them anymore . The more expensive ones are still the same size and color . Obviously , you get what you pay for .
 These were the right size for my baby ... until I washed them once . They shrank ! Also , the armholes are tight on my baby -LRB- He is 6 months , wearing a 12 month size . Mind you he is in the 97th percentile in height and weight , so he is a big baby , but more tall than wide -RRB- . I no longer want to even use these because they are too small after one washing . They still technically fit , but they are tight and do not look comfortable in the crotch area . One good thing
 The packaging the bodysuits come in smells real strong of rubber but the smell does come out of the bodysuits once they are washed . The writing is very small to read , I would expected the lettering to be a bit larger and the sizing is a little off . The 12 month size compares to an 18 month size in comparable brands . Overall a fair product but I would not purchase again .
 The overall quality of this product is really bad . The material is very poor and the letters look like an at home iron on transfer project .
 These pants are very long , also they do n't pass the squat test . If you do n't know what I mean ... they are thin and things show when you squat .
 I would definitely not buy anymore clothes of this brand . They were so long ! I 'm 5 ' 5 '' , and they came way passed my feet . It also is cheaply made . This was a bad purchase .
 The cotton fabric was flimsy and would n't hold up well over time . I was charged $ 7.25 for shipping and handling . The pants were way too long -LSB- I 'm 5 ' 3 -RSB- so I ended up giving them away to my sister who 's 5 ' 7 . You 'd be better off buying spandex pants at Target or WalMart than purchasing them through this seller .
 The material of the item was very soft but there were no instructional photos that came with it . It is very hard to figure out how to get this item to actually look like a shirt . I loved the pics online but if they could have sent a few pics or written instructions , it would have made this a really nice piece . As of right now , I just have a really nice piece of material with a couple straps
 These did n't look as good in person as they did in the picture . They were a bit long , but what I liked least was the bunched up elastic waistband . Not flattering ...
 Do n't be fooled by the photo , they look like they are cute , cropped and snug fitting but they are long , baggy and ugly . Returned them the same day I received them .

 I purchased this in size small , it has huge cups that are definately not for a small busted person . it looks ridiculous .
 These have to be counterfeit , as the seams are sub-standard . No where near the quality of Wrangler jeans bought at a brick & morter store.Stay away , these are FAKE Wranglers !!
 I love Amazon.com , but these Wrangler jeans look similar to Wrangler jeans sold in America ; but they are NOT the same as Wranglers sold in America . My husband says the cut is different and they do n't fit him as well . We noticed that the Wrangler label on the jeans is the older style than what is used on their jeans now . I 'm not sure if they 're just really old old Wranglers that were found in some warehouse or if they are impostors made in another country with the older Wrangler label on the back . Also , these jeans have stitching on the rear pockets and I guess the current -LRB- official -RRB- Wranglers do n't have back pocket stitching anymore . My husband says , `` no more internet jeans for him ! '' He wants to try on clothes in person .
 I received my jeans in reasonable time and the label on the jeans indicated they were a 28 inch inseam . However , when I wore them , they were dragging on the floor . I then measured them with a tailor 's tape and the jeans inseam measured 30 inches . My wife will now have to correctly size them .
 Ped&iacute; unos pantalones 34x36 y me llegaron unos 36x32 . Afuera en la etiqueta dice 34x36 sin embargo dentro del pantal&oacute;n en la etiqueta dice 36x32 . Por tanto no me sirvieron y me quedaron super grandes .

 Their the smallest 35 's I have ever seen . They would n't fit my son at all and were very tight on my grandson that wears a 33 .

 I needed a new pair of Wranglers because all of my jeans were 4-5 years old - and looked it . I was shocked and disappointed to find that these Wranglers did n't have that new-blue look . They look like the 5 year old Wranglers that they were supposed to replace ! Amazon 's description did n't mention that these pants had a used look ; I 'll be returning them . I learned an important lesson
 On me , they fit poorly when compared to the &#34; other &#34; big brand who makes lots of denim jeans . Tight in the wrong places where the others are looser fitting . No problems with the quality , just not a good fit for a mid sized round guy with short thick legs , lol .
 When I got it and tried it on , I discovered zipper sticks all the time ~ 1/2 way down , 3/4 way down , etc. . That 's the cheap part . Now , having worn it several times , I 've discovered that the white pocket bulges out as a matter of course - but just on the right side . That 's the poorly made part . Headed for the Salvation Army .
 I do n't know where they are making these jeans now a days , but be prepared to have them altered , The measurements are all off . I had to have mine altered by a taylor .

 These did n't look as good in person as they did in the picture . They were a bit long , but what I liked least was the bunched up elastic waistband . Not flattering ...
 Do n't be fooled by the photo , they look like they are cute , cropped and snug fitting but they are long , baggy and ugly . Returned them the same day I received them .
 The hat was to small for my 2 year old grandaughter and was not returnable .
 The sizes are clearly marked inside the packaging as `` small , sizes 5 - 6.5 '' . The sticker the vendor put on the package , of all 8 pairs I received said `` Size 9 '' . So as you can imagine , they did n't fit .
 ordered the smallest size i could get for my girlfriend , received the largest i guess they figure if the color is right thats enough . just in time to be useless before our vacation hiking trip , thanks alot

 I like this bra , but after wearing it for 1 month , the wire poked out through the fabric . I tried to return it on Amazon , and was not able . I hope the seller will provide me some way to return this bra , as it is a faulty product . I have used this type of bra before , and its just fine . I am appauled though , that after 1 month , the wire would break through on this bra , since it is such a very expensive bra .
 By the way , I 'm not `` John '' obviously , but we ca n't figure out how to change the name . Anyway , I 'm Charlene . I should have know better than to buy a bra recommended by Oprah Winfrey ! This extremely expensive minimizer was fine on the first couple of days , then it started to gap in front between the cups with the ends of the underwires poking through my shirts . Eventually -LRB- 2-3 weeks later -RRB- the fabric in the back started to separate . And it did n't even do a good job minimizing . There are much better alternatives out there , much more reasonably priced .
 This bra constricted my breasts at the top and created an odd pear shape . Not at all flattering for those with breasts that are full on top .
 Sizing Did n't seem to be right . Myself and a friend tried it on and both of us had the same comment . I had tried on one in a store a few months ago and just remembered the size I needed .
 This product is nothing but junk - I would have returned it , but after postage cost and the venders restocking fee - I would owe more money . Do n't buy this product !
 I used to own the predecessor to this item , the Victorinox NXT Collection Large Mobilizer 24 '' Expandable Upright , UPC code 674204040218 . I presume my previous piece of luggage was Version 2 , and the version now available for sale is Version 3.0 . My previous piece of luggage was the best piece of luggage I had ever owned , so when it was recently lost , I tried to get an exact replacement . I soon found out that that item was no longer available , but an upgrade , the NXT 3.0 , was . Assuming it was basically the same piece of luggage with some possible improvements , and noticing that it was the exact same price I had paid a year or so earlier for my previous luggage , I bought this item without much further thought.However , once it arrived , I could n't have been more disappointed . Compared to its predecessor , this item is a piece of junk . Almost everything about the previous version that made the previous version so delightful to own has been modified , and it seems that the new item is made much more cheaply , but sold at the same price . The garment bag now holds much less than it used to , no longer can hang on a door while you 're loading or unloading it , and the `` hook '' where hangers go is much more flimsy than it used to be . They 've done away with the shoe bag ; I guess now I have to purchase that separately . Also , it used to have a very easy-to-use attachment for attaching a second , smaller bag ; they 've replaced it with a strap that 's much less convenient , and now you have to leave the front pouch open to use this new strap . Hopefully nothing will fall out if you try to use it ! And although only icing on the cake , they 've replaced the sturdy plastic name and address tag with a flimsy piece of paper that certainly wo n't survive as long as the bag is supposed to!It 's possible that , if you 've never owned a Victorinox-made piece of luggage , you might be modestly impressed with this piece of luggage . But if you 've ever owned a Victorinox item before , be forewarned
 DO NOT order from Luggage Online and/or Amazon . It took them 48 hours to tell me that they were canceling the order I placed because the goods were out of stock -LRB- items similar to this one -RRB- . At the time of my order , the `` Pricing and Availability : '' chart indicated they were IN STOCK and ready to ship . Save yourself the frustration . Their system clearly does not work well .
 I am a bit disappointed in the quality . It looked like a possible reject off the factory line . There are threads uncut and the velcro was sewed wrong in one of the side pockets.You really should not expect too much . You may find something better quality in some of your local cheap department store chain .
 Poor quality -- bad material ; bad `` workmanship '' . The velcros around the wrist are not sewn in right -- it scratches my hand and arm . ` Though I can fix that pretty easily by re-sewing it -LRB- and maybe get rid of the velcros in pockets while I 'm at it -RRB- , the pockets are made of wrong material
 I bought 3 fleece with different size but the Size of the fleece are not proper . Though it says Medium / Large / XL , everything was in same size and the length is not proper as the measurement mentioned .
 IF YOU ARE A WEIGHTLIFTER OR BODYBUILDER , THE YOKE PIPING WILL CUT INTO YOUR LATS AND PECS UNLESS YOU BUY A LARGER SIZE THAN USUAL . THIS RESTRICTIVE BAND MAKES THE JACKET RATHER UNCOMFORTABLE . THE VELCRO IS N'T QUITE RIGHT EITHER . THE MATERIAL ITSELF IS NICE TO THE TOUCH , BUT THE DESIGN IS FLAWED ... WAS N'T WORTH EVEN THE SALE PRICE .
 The T-shirt 's material is extremely THIN . After a few washes , it becomes a rag anytime . A cheaper T-shirt at WalMart is far better product than this brand name .
 This dress is cheap and gaudy looking ... nothing like it looks in the photo online . Also the expedited shipping is a rip off ... they charged $ 18.00 for what was Priority Mail ... I sent it back the same way and the cost was only $ 6.20 .
 I did not like to product . This product does not give the breasts a natural smooth shape . I felt like I was wearing my grandmother 's bra .
 The travel pack arrived promptly and apparently in good condition . My problem is that is had a very strong odor . I ca n't describe it other than it 's maybe a chemical smell that is emitted from the plastic ? I am very sensistive to odors and could n't imagine all my son 's clothes smelling like this bag while we were on vacation . I ca n't say if this was an anomaly . I do know that I once bought a cheap set of luggage from a department store and one of the 5 pieces ended up having the same odor . I thought it was because I had left something wet in it and tried everything to get the odor out , dousing it with Febreze , to no avail . Since my experience showed that the odor would not eventually dissipate , I thought it best to return the travel pack .
 You advertised and sold to me 6 pr boxer briefs . I recieved 2 pr . That is a rip off .
 I have yet to reccived tham so I can not review tham till I reccive them.Thank you , Robert Butz
 Okay for a kid . Nice pattern but the camoflague pattern sells at the dollar store . It 's ok looking , just cheap quality.Not horrible , but not great .
 This hat is of very poor quality . Bad crafting and materials . Look elsewhere , as this is not worth the cost .
 I have an regular camo hat that I bought from a surplus store in the late 90s . There is no way that the one I just bought will last that long .
 When I received the costume it looked as I expected and thought we were going to be happy . But when we put it on my son , it was too small . The mask did n't fit at all over his head and the neck was WAY too small to close . So we just decided not to close the back -LRB- which was going to be covered by the cape anyway -RRB- and not wear the mask . But then my son complained that it was too itchy -LRB- I was surprised , because it seems like it would be soft -RRB- . So for Halloween he wore it long enough for me to take a couple of pictures -LRB- without the mask -RRB- and that was it .
 The costume is really cute but the size is n't true . I am a size 10-12 depending on the product and I ordered a Large which is 12-14 and I could n't even get it past my arm pits , it seemed more of a size 9-10 than a 12-14 . It also comes with a headband -LRB- with no feather -RRB- which I did n't think it did but it is really big and I would need to take it in an inch or so to make it fit .
 Unfortunately I was unable to use this item because when I originally placed the order it did not got through . When I tried again they no longer carried the size I wanted . I went w / a different size & unfortunately it did not fix . I had to send it back .
 I had a pair of these IZOD Chino pants that I bought in a department store about a year ago that were well made , using good , thick cotton material . I wanted another pair just like them and I could n't find them in the store , so I found them on Amazon and ordered them . They are not making the pants with the same material , they are cheaply made out of some thin cotton material . I usually do pretty good ordering through Amazon , but this time I did n't .
 Chinos are made from a much lighter fabric than these pants . The Sizing was horrible . I wear a 36 waist . My Levi 501s are a 36 and fit like a glove . I wanted a more comfortable fit for work , so i ordered a 38 . First , the waist is WAY too small . It feels like a 34 . Second , the rest of the pants are VERY baggy and loose . They look and feel horrible . My waist is being choked and the rest just hangs off . I bought Gap original khakis as a replacement , and they are an improvement in every way including cost -LRB- they were $ 15 on clearance -RRB- .
 I bought these for work , and while they 're OK for very casual days , they do n't hold a crease sharply , and they do n't drape well . They just look thick and clumsy .
 These pants looked , felt and wore beautifully but after 2 weeks the seams started to loosen and tear.Aweful .
 Pants indicated in the paper labels and bag which is size 36 x 32 , but in reality is size 38 x 32 , as says the label on fabric attached to it . Very nice pants but I can not use .
 Izod fits me well and ordered these pants to replace one that I was very happy with . However , these were cut way too skimpy and did n't fit . Additionally , the color is pumice , which I thought would be an off white like the pants they were replacing , but there very white .
 The Izod American Chino is not worth the cost . While they are comfortable -LRB- the minimum requirement of any pant -RRB- , they are more comparable to Lee Stain-Resistant pants which sell for about $ 18 at Kohls and that is what these pants should sell for . I ordered 3 but returned 2 . I kept the Pumice ones only because I liked the color a lot . If you want Izod casual Chinos I recommend the Madison series instead . More comfort , better material , better made .
 They are stiff , crinkly , and much too big . I ordered the right size but I am swimming in them . The waistband goes up over my navel or else the pants cuffs drag under my shoes . Oh well , pay cheap , get cheap .
 It is really sad to get a different color degree than you saw and except from the photo . I was really disappointed and I had to get another one from different place .
 Okay for a kid . Nice pattern but the camoflague pattern sells at the dollar store . It 's ok looking , just cheap quality.Not horrible , but not great .
 This hat is of very poor quality . Bad crafting and materials . Look elsewhere , as this is not worth the cost .
 I have an regular camo hat that I bought from a surplus store in the late 90s . There is no way that the one I just bought will last that long .
 This bra -LRB- and 2 other Warner 's bras I bought at the same time -RRB- had something that poked me right near the clasp . I had to return them as they were so uncomfortable . It had something to do with the vertical whip-stiching instead of horizontal I think .

 I contacted this seller to ask why shipping cost was so high with no answer . I was charged $ 30.00 shipping for a $ 4.80 bag that the item came in . I will never purchase from this seller again and I recommend to all buyers on Amazon to stay away from this seller . Customer service is horrible !!!
 The Pokemon costume I ordered was advertised to be a LARGE 7 . My son wears a boys size 6-8 , and the costume was about six inches too short . LARGE 7 , by who 's standard ? Further , my son was super upset because the ears on Pickachu did n't stand up like the picture showed plus the hat was too small to fit over his head . To wear the costume I would need to do some serious rigging -LRB- did n't have time to do this ... reason for ordering online in the first place -RRB- , but because my son cried untill his eyes and cheeks were red and puffy , and i had nothing else for him to wear I ran around with my head cut off trying to make it work.Furhter , the back of the cosutume had a huge slit opening from the middle of the back to the neck with one flimsy tie at the neck . For a halloween costume meant to be worn in late October , it was innapropriately thin and cheaply made offering no warmth or protection what so ever . Given that the costume was too small , I had to cut the hat to make it fit , and he had to wear a ton of clothes underneath to keep warm , the end result was not a good one . The price of the product was grossly high given the pathetic product quality . I felt totally ripped off . When I called costomer service to inquire about the size and quality , I was told it was a regular size and its quality was standard ? This was a flat out lie , or the service person did n't know what the hell he was talking about , since I 've been buying halloween costumes for ten years for three kids which have all been less expensive , better made , and much better looking.So , there you go . The costume i ordered got an F review , and i will never order a costume online again from Amazon . My son is a huge Pokemon fan , and it was really discouraging and sad to see him so upset about something he was so looking foward to . For nearly fifty dollars the whole experience sucked royally for every one.PS . this review format sucks too . There is no spell check option , and quite frankly I do n't have the time to appease writing critics , but i 'm sure you get the pioint . This product got not stars even though Amazon made me pick at least one to submit this review!Jessica Ryan
 i was VERY disappointed in the quality of this costume for the price ! i paid 59.99 plus shipping for a costume that came in a flat envelope made of cheap foam for the hat and paper thin polyester body . there was no description for this item to describe what it was . it had a picture and that was all ... smart on the sellers end . all my son wanted was to be picachu and i thought i would be getting a little better quality item than one found in the dollar store .
 This costume arrived very quickly . However , the quality was not worth the price . The material was shoddy , the workmanship was poor . This cost $ 50 . including mailing . I could have made it for half the price and it would have been much better . I have since seen a similar costume in a store for $ 20 . I doubt that my grandson will even wear the thing . It 's probably torn up by now .
 The costume was exactly what I was looking for and made the child exceptionally happy . However , the hat/mask was wierd and I could not figure out how to get it on . I ended up ordering another Pikachu Mask . The whole costume was very cheaply made and way over priced , but I had no choice .
 My son was so excited to be Pikachu . However , the mask for this costume not only sits on top of the head , like the picture shows , but it made of flimsy fabric . My son did n't feel as though he looked like Pikachu , and did n't wear the mask part - he wished the mask had been the plastic kind . He wore the costume a few times before Halloween , and the seam between the neck and shoulder ripped , so it was pinned Halloween night . For the price they charge for costumes nowadays , I expect them to hold up a little better .
 Hat did not come in a good shape ... its ears never stayed up as in picture ... Quality is not good ! I wish I could have seen the back of the hat on the display picture since its not a fully rounded hat !
 For a big and tall pant , this is an awful fit . I wear a 44W x 34L , so I was glad to find that Amazon carried Docker 's in this size . Saves a trip to the mall . Price seemed good . When I got these pants I was very disappointed . While the fit in the waist and length were tight on , the butt and the thights were sized like a skinny jean a teenage boy might wear . Not at all the fit I was expecting . Very misleading . I have bought the `` signature '' khaki through JC Penney in their stores tons of times so I thought I was getting the same thing with a nice comfortable fit , you know , the things dockers are know for . I was really disappointed that amazon would not reimburse the shipping saying that incorrect fit is not their problem . I told them it was a case of incorrect descriptions , but they did n't care . How the hell did they win for best customer service a couple years ago ? I do n't see it . Do n't buy these unless you a tall fat guy who wants a really tight pair of pants .
 I expected the same Dockers I 've been buying for years . These are not them . The waist does n't close with a button . It closes with a hidden button and a hook . It 's more like dress pants . The color I got is called `` cloud '' which makes me think white . I have several older pairs that I think of as white . The color is more like a light-khaki instead . And finally , there is a piece of elastic in the left and right sides so that the waist can expand . I 've never seen such a feature on Dockers and do n't like it . It makes the pants too loose and they do n't hold my shirt tail in . I can cinch up the belt but then it looks all pleated at the waist . The delivery was not a problem but these were the only available Dockers I could find in 40x36 anywhere on Amazon and they do n't have the features I wanted . I already washed them and its too late to return or I would .
 Other reviews dead on , these are not what I expected , I took a chance because I needed green pants , the waist size was right , but the pants are tight in the thigh and butt area , I do not like the elastic above both side pockets , I probably will not wear again , salvation army for these !
 Bought a size larger than I am , pants were loose in the waist , but looked like skinny jeans on my thighs . I did n't have time to return them , so I just wrote them off and ordered WAY larger . Legs fit , waist could fit an elephant . However , after two weeks both pairs are already falling apart . The pocket seems have split , and they both have random holes that Remind me of rotting canvas . They also wrinkle if you look at them . I have never owned a fabric that wrinkles so quickly.DO NOT BUY ANY OF THESE PANTS . The size does n't matter , the style does n't matter , they are all absolute garbage . Dockers used to be a quality brand , now they are even pants fit for the homeless .
 As you can review my purchases with you they are quite a few and never have I complained because there was no reason . Sadly there is always a first time , the Dark Khaki pants I bought at the part where it streches the cloth ripped open , this happened on both sides and I was very very surprised , I tried to put them on once and that was when it happened , I took it to a tailor to fx them but told me the cloth was rotten , pudrid.I want to know with my record with you can you please send me no charge a new pair of pants , if you send them to me I will be able to return the ones I have in the package you send me the new ones if you want me to return them , I have already spent $ 20.00 trying to fix them but with no success.Please let me know your feed back . I wrote a few days ago to the packaging division with no answer up to know.I hope I have better luck with you.With kindest Regards , Jules Garcia
 I gave this product 1 star only because I ca n't give it 0 . Unfortunately I bought three pair of these pants . They fit fine in the waist , seat and hips , but were cut so shockingly lean in the legs as to be unwearable . -LRB- No , my weight/size has n't changed since an earlier purchase of these pants in the same size . -RRB- I see another reviewer commented on this same problem . Dockers has apparently drastically altered its sizing - or it has a new supplier who has no idea how to size pants.I also bought several pairs of shirts and had the same problem with them . They fit the torso fine but I felt like my forearms were going to split the material , and I could barely button the cuffs . It 's as if the sleeves were from a child 's shirt . Same thing with the pants . There may be some men somewhere in the world who can wear these pants and shirts , but they must be tiny-boned and without a muscle in their arms and legs.I have completely lost confidence in Dockers . They ca n't make the price low enough for me to ever buy any of their clothing again . Even if it were free , what good is an article of clothing that you ca n't wear without physical discomfort ?
 The product that was sent was NOT what was listed in the online site . The retail site was nice enough to refund the purchase ; however , their customer service never admitted to the listing error .
 i didnt evan last 20 min in the . as soon as i put them on walked down stairs and sit hdown they split right down the middle . i still have them but dont know if i can exchange or not
 Much to my disappointment , these pants arrive with elastic band torn out of them ; I have had to take to local cleaners to repair the band = $ 20.00 cost out of pocket ; I was going to order two more pair , but have canceled said order !!!
 The stretch waistband is the worst design in 15 years of wearing Dockers . Had to sew it closed to stabilize the waistband . Shirt would n't stay tucked and waistband stretch mechanism tended to fail . STAY AWAY FROM THIS CATASTROPHE OF POOR DESIGN !
 These Dockers are very poorly made of low quality material.Of four pairs that I purchased two pairs were unwearable after the first use.I have several pairs of Dockers that I have worn for more than ten years and do n't recall ever having a seam failure . I have experienced a belt loop tearing out , but this was after many years of normal wear.I ordered these items from my Amazon order history as direct replacements of those received from earlier ordersThe problems with the new pants occurred the first or second time I wore them . One pair these new pants have ripped out at the seam and the other ripped from the waist line to the back of the knee away from any seams.I do n't believe that the pants I received were made by Dockers even though they had the Docker labels .
 Come on Amazon , get with the it and put up decent description!These are not your standard Dockers!They are the comfort wait which unless you know what it is you will most likely hate it .
 Long-time Dockers fan , wearing 38x36 khakis . `` Modern waistband '' is not an accurate or complete description of an elastic , poorly designed panel for those with roller-coaster waistlines . For me this feature detracts from the fit . I have had the same waistline for over thirty years and do n't need elastic for a fit -- elastic that will likely create problems over time without adding value . I returned my order with regrets that Dockers had ruined the fit that I have enjoyed for so long . Pants otherwise were the same old Dockers that I have grown to appreciate . Now I have to look elsewhere for a proper fit .
 I chose this rating because the inseam was not 36 &#34; . I measured after I noticed they looked a little shorter than usual . A little more attention to detail please . The inseam was 35 1/2 &#34; . When you are tall and have difficulty finding pants that 1/2 ' makes a big difference .
 The description of this pant mentions a `` modern waistband . '' It should say a `` stretch '' or `` elastic '' waistband -LRB- that when extended shows the white lining of the pockets ... like cheaper pants from other retailers ... like the one that starts with `` J.C. '' -RRB- . Unlike the Dockers I have always purchased , this is a design downgrade that I was not expecting based on the item description and my prior purchases . Had to return the pants.I will say that Amazon made the return process easy and free ... way to go Amazon ! 5 stars on their commitment to customers .
 I returned the 2 pair of Dockers for a refund . The material was not worth the expensive price tag , even on sale . I found a higher quality pant from another brand for about a third of the price . Much happier . Amazon was great to work with however .
 I was unable to wear this hat to a party because even though it was advertised as `` one size fits all '' , there was no indication that it was a child 's hat . I was extremely disappointed and wasted the $ 12 .
 This hat says one size and does n't tell you it is a child 's hat so it was wasted money . This was for our Church VBS . I wo n't buy from this company ever again . False advertising !
 Claimed it was for people 14 and over , but it was way too small , and I do n't have a big head . I 'd recommend only for small children .
 This conductor cap was very fine quality . It was well worth the time , effort and money it took to get it . We have a very happy grandson !
 It 's too small and it arrived with a big scratch . There 's no way they could n't have noticed it .
 These are SMALL !!!! The feathers get ink on your palms and back , but what do you expect for 15 bucks .
 The quality of the feathers are good . The wings look great . But what 's up with the super long arm straps ? Instead of sitting on my shoulder blades like they do on the model on the packaging , they sag on my back because they are way too long.If I am wearing it incorrectly , which I highly doubt because I 've wore other wings before and it seems like a simple enough concept , at least there should be a pamphlet with directions . A product like this should be easy to wear . I do n't get why the manufacturer constructed the arm straps this way .
 I liked the price of these , but the quality left something to be desired . About a dozen or more of the feathers fell off . The black dye rubbed off on the back of the shirt I was wearing with these . Some of the dye also got on my hands when I handled the wings -LRB- turned my fingers grayish -RRB- . I probably would n't buy these again but the price was right for a once a year Halloween costume .
 I was very disappointed in this set . One pair was very loose in the crotch to begin with and a second pair became loose in the crotch after just a few times of wearing and washing .
 Was not aware that these are not manufactured or shipped by JAVOedge . These are generic branded adapters . Beware when buying , I 'm not sure why the seller put JAVOedge 's name on the `` manufactured by '' field . It is very misleading . I ended up buying the adapter again from JAVOedge : Cingular Blackjack i607 Port to 3.5 mm Stereo Headphone Adapter
 I 've gone through 3 of these now , and the average lifespan has been about a week . The housing for the adapter is held together basically by nothing , and splits open after about a week of use , and just wo n't stay together after you fix it . I 'm going to get another and try super gluing the seam of the plastic housing to see if I can get some use out of one of these insanely overpriced items .
 Great product . But every time you turn the volume up and down it makes a really loud clicking noise right in your ear . So I used mine for a day and then never used it again.Still a good product minus the loud clicking noise .
 This adapter did n't last over two months even with the little usage that I had put it through . The plastic casing for the i607 port broke off and left exposed wires that ended up breaking as well .
 I brought two tops , but to my disbelief one of the tops had a small hole -LRB- about the size of a pea -RRB- in front ! . I just want potential buyers to be aware . Otherwise it is a good buy .
 This looked like a cute to and for $ 4 who could beat it . Well , I know why it was so cheap . Although it would have been really cute under a jacket or even byitself the one strap was twisted the wrong way so I had to return it . It could have just been a fluke and probably does not effect all of the supply .
 I have been looking for a purple fleece vest in the stores and did n't have any luck . Was very happy when I found one on the net.The vest is cut a little long , I am not a short person , 5 ' 5 '' , but on the whole I am very happy with it.I originally ordered a X large and returned it for a large.I was very happy with the companies attitude on returning the X large .
 i ordered a ladies large and it was like a men 's extra large . Other than that , it was nice and fluffy . I loved the purple color .
 I had to return it because I felt that the design was poor . Although the fabric of this wallet makes it quite thin -LRB- and seemingly flimsy -RRB- , when I put my cards in it it was just as thick as my original wallet but the cards were harder to access .
 At first my husband loved this wallet -- it fixed the giant bulging wallet problem for sure . However , after less than a couple of months of use -LRB- just past the return window time frame -RRB- the seam going between the two card slots on one side came undone . This makes the one side of the wallet virtually useless . The problem is , and you can see this if you look closely at the picture , that the seam only is about 3/4 of an inch long -- it does n't extend the length of the pocket . I 'm sure that pulling cards in and out a few times a day would be better supported by a seam that runs the length of the pocket .
 It 's a pity Amazon allows items like this one - a joke on the buyer . Product of such extremely low quality that does n't deserve $ 0.99 price . It is impossible that five stars reviews of this product were given by actually satisfied buyers .
 This is the cheapest possible piece of nylon -LRB- or similar material -RRB- sewed into a wallet shape . You would never buy this if you saw it in a store . It is a rip-off at this price . Amazon should be ashamed to carry this item . If you have a sense of humor , you will laugh , then get annoyed . Otherwise , you 'll just be annoyed . How this could get good reviews is beyond my understanding .
 This wallet lives up to the claim of being a super slime wallet . The layout of the pockets is good however that is where the benefits stop.Issue 1
 I was impressed with the concept of `` the Worlds Thinest ... '' so I purchased from Amazon . One of the many reasons I choose to purchase from Amazon is thier liberal return policy which is basically if you do n't like it you get your money back . Anyway when I received the billfold I was surprised to learn that it is a very thin -LRB- thus the name -RRB- and extremely flimsy item . I left it setting on my coffee table and my wife and both of my children that are still at home comented about it bring junk . I decided instantly that I would send it back to Amazon . I do n't know why but over the next few days I went on Amazon to get return authorization but was unable to find the link . That said time passed to the point I would not feel fair asking for a refund anymore . Even if I did I would be unable to find the package . Anyhow and anyway I would say DO N'T BUY IT ! with Christmas only been two days away I feel it necessary to wish you Merry Christmas !

 There is no doubt this a thin wallet since your cards are essentially separated into 4 separate stacks by the compartments . What is also true is that credit cards and anything else you carry EASILY SLIPS OUT.If you do n't fold the wallet completely open and squeeze the contents you are bound to have the experience of having all or most of what 's in your wallet fall out when using it.This wallet is worth about $ 1.00 .
 It 's fake wallet of the world , fake , fake ... . Ever Made . It will be better now the material first . I not recomended ever Fake , Fake , Fake ...
 At first I thought this would be a great wallet . But in a few weeks the credit card holders began to fall apart . It finally got to the point where the cards were falling out.I also purchased the Junior for my kids , it was so cheap looking my kids kept it to remind me of the fine gift I got them . You might as well use a ziploc bag . lol
 This is my first review and I feel compelled to leave one . This may be the worlds smallest wallet but it also looks and feels like the worlds CHEAPEST wallet . It is made of a plastic jacket type material like you would wear in a rainstorm . I really do n't know who would want to use this wallet . It also makes noise when you use it like its a paper bag .
 What appealed to me about this wallet was it 's alternative idea of how to slim down a wallet while at the same time not having to discard your multiple credit cards . I think it 's an innovative concept , but ultimately , I was not impressed after having received it . Firstly , the material might as well be wax paper . It literally crinkles while in hand causing me to only assume it will not last . It 's puzzling how cheap this wallet is made . Second , the cash pouch is not impressive either . The need to dig deep into a wallet to retrieve cash was annoying . And finally , you might be able to store 16 credit cards , but sorting through each unorganized slot to find the right one was well , not efficient . Not a good product by any means in my opinion .
 Several reviewers have commented that some of the other reviewers must be getting paid for favorable reviews of this . I think they just may be from owners who have only had the wallet for a few weeks.I had this product for four months before ditching it and starting the search for another wallet.I love the concept -- this is just not executed well.My main problem is with the card-pockets . They do n't work . When I started , I tried to trim-down the number of cards I was carrying , and ended up with about 12 -- 3 to each pocket . Apparently , that 's not enough in each one , as the cards would slide out every time the wallet was opened.After a few weeks of dropped cards and frustration , I re-arranged things a bit . Two pockets ended up with 1 card each , and the other two had about 5 each . This fixed the sliding-out problem rather well.Unfortunately , it created another problem , as the seam between two of the pockets came un-stitched . Now I had the sliding out problem compounded with sliding AROUND . Each time I opened the wallet , I 'd end up with a bunch of cards sliding out to the middle ... not fun.I have seen the suggestions and customer-service fixes in these comments . Credit cards are a standard-size -- the manufacturer should n't be telling customers they have to re-stitch or move the seam for the wallet to work properly . Also , I do n't feel wallets are items that need `` retraining '' for their owners to properly handle them . I 've been using wallets for 35 years ... and they 've all worked better than this one.I 'm disappointed because at first , I really liked it -- it 's really thin , and that 's great . But until they figure out how to handle cards so that they are secure , yet easy to remove , I will look elsewhere .
 I would spend the $ .50 and buy a bag of chips . This thing crinkles like a chip bag and feels about as durable .
 This is definitely much more thin than your regular wallet . If that is all you care about then you would rate this a 4 or a 5 . However , it sounds like you have a crumpled up diaper in your pocket . The material makes a strange crunchy sound in your hand and in your pocket that really ca n't be ignored if you care at all about that sort of thing .
 First off , cards do n't actually fit in the pocket . I had to force a single card into the pocket . That caused the seams to tear . This was a regular old debit mastercard , nothing like an Amex Black . US dollars only barely fit into the cash pocket . Forget about any currency even 2mm wider . This is supposed to be a European model . It 's a joke . If you really want to spend $ 15 and not get anything for it , just send it to me . I 'll be happy to give you a worthless folded piece of paper in exchange .
 I bought this after reading a review of it and when I got the wallet , I could n't believe my eyes . It 's clear that the vast majority of reviews you see about it on the internet are by people hired to post good reviews.This is the biggest rip-off I 've ever seen . $ 22.50 for this ? A little piece of rip-stop worth 2 pennies ?? The cards slide around in the stupid thing and fall out when you open it and paper bills do n't fit neatly . . it 's ugly looking , it sounds stupid and no normal man would be caught dead bringing it out . Total junk .
 This thing looks cheap , feels cheap and is n't worth the money . It makes me realize why we farm out jobs to China ! If you give this thing to someone as a gift , they will see you as a # 1 CHEAPSKATE !
 This wallet is thin , but the material feels like thin plastic , and makes a loud crinkle sound whenever it 's used in any way . . much like the sound you might get crinkling up newspaper for the fireplace . It 's actually kind of humerous when you pull it out and open it in a store
 I should have researched this product more . I ca n't stand it . A better alternative is credit-card sized nylon pouch which zips closed to keep everything securely contained . Chisco makes them really cheap , and they are stylish and durable . REAL heavy duty nylon is so much better , not this thin stuff that you have to buy `` extra '' units of just to replace every year or so . A marketing gimmick . I see no real advantage to this . I do n't believe all the customer reviews either .
 SecurityPro was very quick with their delivery and the item is as stated and pictured . It works well in keeping me cool while in the sun . I have only used it in the heat ; I wet it down and wrap it around my head and neck , facemask usually down . My main problem with it is the material leaks lots of green dye . I have handwashed it half a dozen times , let it soak overnight a few times , run it through a washing machine four times -LRB- once accidentally with other clothes which are now a dull green -RRB- , and it still bleeds dye whenever its wet . I would buy from SecurityPro again in the future , but will definitely be steering clear of the 8537 Green/Black Shemaghs .
 I have been looking for a purple fleece vest in the stores and did n't have any luck . Was very happy when I found one on the net.The vest is cut a little long , I am not a short person , 5 ' 5 '' , but on the whole I am very happy with it.I originally ordered a X large and returned it for a large.I was very happy with the companies attitude on returning the X large .
 i ordered a ladies large and it was like a men 's extra large . Other than that , it was nice and fluffy . I loved the purple color .
 Okay for a kid . Nice pattern but the camoflague pattern sells at the dollar store . It 's ok looking , just cheap quality.Not horrible , but not great .
 This hat is of very poor quality . Bad crafting and materials . Look elsewhere , as this is not worth the cost .
 I have an regular camo hat that I bought from a surplus store in the late 90s . There is no way that the one I just bought will last that long .
 I saw a green bag as you see , but got delivered a tan . . nothing near the bag in design or color ! :-LRB- Very dispappointed . Please do not buy this ... Its cheating of what they show and what they send . .

 This item looked different than shown in the description ; not ugly , but nothing great either . Definitely ran small , in my opinion . I would n't buy this again .

 I have used Dickies mens work pants for the restaurants I have worked at for many years and their sizing is always wrong . I have worn 34 '' waist in them for awhile like all my other shorts/pants but when ordering the red shorts it was like I was trying to fit into pants i wore in H.S. and that was 15 years ago at a 30 '' waist . Also when they say a 13 '' inseem , ya if itis measured 13 '' below ur crotch . the dude in the pic for the shorts must be 8 ' tall !!!!!
 Dickie pants and shorts made in Mexico were comfortable and fit properly . My most recent puchases were made in Nicaragua and were horrible . The cut was wrong , waistline was wrong , the fabric was terrible . I 'll never buy Dickies again .
 I like a little bagginess in my shorts , so I ordered these in a larger size than I usually wear . Apparently , I did n't go large enough . I literally own pants supposedly two sizes smaller than these , and they fit me fine . These should have been quite big on me - and I ca n't even get the zipper up half way . I 'm not returning them because , for what I paid and what I 'd have to pay to ship them back , I just do n't think it 's worth it . I do n't recommend purchasing shorts from this company unless you can try them on - I certainly wo n't be buying from them again . I feel like I got ripped off .
 Looking for sturdy shorts , you found em.The fabric is so tough , it will barely bend . More like canvas than cloth.The length is good and long - past the knee.The reason these got sent back is old-man waist - they fasten above the bellybutton .
 I 've ordered these shorts 4 days ago and they still ca n't seem to get it shipped out of their warehouse . Do n't bother with this buy them from your local store . Who knows when I will receive them .
 I have never had a problem ordering clothes online but these shorts are ridiculous . They are a full four and a half inches narrower than advertised , which goes way beyond what is acceptable for a clothing company . Now I know that some clothing companies tend to `` trim '' the patterns a little short and I should n't expect anything less from this particular company , however , I am actually insulted that dickies gets away with such a high level of cheap , scammy bull % # ^ * .
 Stiff , hash material . Poorly fitting . Not worth buying . I got better shorts at a local target for less than half the price .
 Dickies Men 's 13 Inch Inseam Work Short With Multi Use Pocket , Khaki , 36 is my worst buying experience through Amazon . The price is normal but the cloth is so though -LRB- like a plastic table cloth -RRB- that you feel as if you are touching a sand paper . And the style of it ? My wife and my sohn started laughing as I first tried it on . How they produce and sell something like this ? I returned the item right away .

 These T 's are a bit on the small side and the cotton is not as soft and does n't have the thread count I am used to in Hanes.Usually I like these T 's but they seem small and less comfortable than my past experience with these shirts .
 this t-shirt arrived squished/rolled into a ball put in a dry cleaners plastic and then boxed in a tiny carton . I had 2 steam iron it twice , then wash it upon which the pink faded then tried again to iron the wrinkles . . it looked like a rag which I am now using it as such
 Xl was more like a large . It was rolled up and shoved in a wrapper . The xxl that I bought separate was the right size and folded nicely .
 I have three very old Hanes black tees , two of which are now so worn they have to be consigned to the rag bin . Hate to do it ; I love those shirts . But after maybe eight years of wear I guess it 's time . So I ordered 4 replacements and they arrived today . Hanes should be pretty red-faced about continuing to call these Beefy-T shirts . Nothing beefy about them , they are pretty lightweight . Certainly not as heavy as the old shirts . But worse , and why I 'm sending them back , is the uneven stitching in the shoulder . One badly stitched shoulder on each of two shirts . The material does n't lie flat but appears to `` bubble '' up near the collar . Looks bad . Sorry , Hanes , you had it but you lost it . I guess a $ 7 tee shirt is too much to hope for anymore .
 I 'm an average build size medium ; not overweight nor athletic build . I used to buy a Hanes pocket t-shirt which fit just great ; a generous cut which allowed freedom of arm motion and a slight drape off the shoulder which did n't cling to the body , allowing some air space between the shirt and my skin . This size is not the same as the medium of these beefy t-shirts . These newer Hanes products are very form fitting and more of an athletic cut ; tight around the shoulders and chest and draping close to the skin . The chest width as measured at the armpit is 20 '' whereas the older version was 21-21 .5 '' , resulting in a big difference in fit . The old size is in between the new medium and large . The newer medium is too tight and the large is , well , too roomy for a good look . The color palette is super but the fit is not the same as it used to be for size medium ; the older size does n't exist anymore so be aware of that when you order .
 I ordered this shirt and it showed up rolled up into a ball and stuffed into a clear plastic bag . No original Hanes packaging at all . After opening there was a bunch of loose threads hanging off . Definitely makes me suspect of the whole thing . There is a Hanes logo screen printed in it , but since there 's no packaging , who knows if it really is Hanes or not . I also found the neck hole larger than other tshirts I own . Disappointed , but since it was only $ 10 I 'll just keep it for painting or something .
 Good loose fit and heavy material , But loose threads that pull out after first washing . Poor construction - made in Haiti .

 I brought two tops , but to my disbelief one of the tops had a small hole -LRB- about the size of a pea -RRB- in front ! . I just want potential buyers to be aware . Otherwise it is a good buy .
 This looked like a cute to and for $ 4 who could beat it . Well , I know why it was so cheap . Although it would have been really cute under a jacket or even byitself the one strap was twisted the wrong way so I had to return it . It could have just been a fluke and probably does not effect all of the supply .
 Several weeks ago I bought a bag and the provider has not yet sent to my address . You currently have no qualification to me . if you 'll be sent warning

 Love this hat but when ordering the drop-down size window provides for small , medium , large , x-large . I ordered a medium based on the sizing information provided by Amazon . But , when I received the hat it was sized as S/M . Too small . A waste of my time and money for shipping . Amazon needs to correct the window for choosing the hat size .
 I brought two tops , but to my disbelief one of the tops had a small hole -LRB- about the size of a pea -RRB- in front ! . I just want potential buyers to be aware . Otherwise it is a good buy .

 I received this shirt in an order of 4 . As another reviewer said , it looks great . HOWEVER , when I washed the thing , poor quality issues showed . First off , there are many folded areas in the shirt that are not sewn or tacked , so they wrinkle , a lot . This includes the ` lapels ' . Secondly , the corners of the button placket are also folded and not tacked , and turn inside out , and are a pain to dig out . Thirdly , I have many tropical type shirts , and these are by far the `` messiest '' looking coming out of a hot dryer , and many of my shirts cost less than $ 15 . If you do the ironing , you will hate these shirts , and since I am single and do not iron ... ; - -RRB- Do they look good ? Yes . If you take your shirts to the cleaners , or have a significant other that does the ironing , you may love it . -LRB- though the cleaner would have to pay close attention when pressing this one -RRB- If you ARE the significant other , you will not love it.To be fair , since I have washed these a number of times since this review , they have relaxed and are more in line with what I expect . I still would like to see a bit more attention to detail in the tailoring though .

 The sizes are sized to small and the material is very cheap . It will shrink two sizes on first wash .

 This was so large and made a crunching sound , I could never wear it . It 's big and bulky and just would n't look right under anything .
 I bought the Alexander sweatshirt . The quality is substandard . The shoulders are off and the product is basically irregular ! Although the company 's statement shows that they accept returns and exchanges , after I received the item , I discovered that they do not either exchange or return because the item is considered a personal item -LRB- despite the fact that they have these items in stock -RRB- .
 I ordered three different styles of Docker 's pants , all in size 34x32 -LRB- the other being Dockers Men 's Pleated Original Khaki and Dockers Men 's Pleated Never Iron Cotton Khaki -RRB- . The other two fit fine -LRB- and I regularlywear 34x32 pants -RRB- , whereas this one is distinctly smaller both in waist size and inseam . Worse , since `` too small '' is viewed by Amazon as a customer error even though the problem clearly lies in the product itself , they want me to pay for the return shipping !
 The stitching on the left front pocket was defective . I repaired it myself rather than spend the time and effort to return it . I love the style and fit of this these pants but I wish the vendor would do some QC before shipping the item . This does n't promote repeat business .
 I have had it with all the overseas made slacks running small that I have ordered on Amazon . This is my third order of slacks . When I bought Dockers a couple years ago , they were Stain Defenders size 36x32 and they still fit me perfectly . This is the third order of of various types of slacks I ordered this year size 36x32 that have not fit properly . These are far smaller than 36x32 . If you order a size larger they might fit you , but I do n't think it proper that the sizes are off like this in the first place . The three pair I received from Flat-front Classic Fit Original Khaki with Individual Fit -LRB- tm -RRB- Waistband order were made in the Dominican Republic . One other thing . I just got in some slacks from JC Penney size 36x32 and they fit just fine .
 These Dockers pants look expensive , are heavier cotton , and they are color-fast . At $ 70.00 - $ 80.00 a pair , they are overpriced . I bought a pair of Dockers several years ago , and after only 4 months of wear -LRB- 2 or 3 times a week -RRB- , they frayed , and I could no longer wear them . I did not buy another pair until recently , as the material looked heavier and harder-wearing . I bought a pair , and this time around it frayed in even more places , and has completely fallen apart . This is one case where paying more for a product does not guarantee quality . Save your hard earned dollars for other brands .
 This is a solid well-made casual pair of pants . But from the first few daysof wear and from the first careful wash wrinkles were everywhere . Maybethe exact phrase `` wrinke-free '' as in some Van Heusen shirts is a moreaccurate phrase to look for when trying to find clothing that wrinkles less.Also it is advertised as `` stretch '' but does not and thelabel says `` 2 % spandex . ''
 Dockers ? Flat-front Classic Fit Original Khaki with Individual Fit -LRB- tm -RRB- WaistbandOrdered thru Macys for husband as work slacks . Pants rec 'd were not made of the same soft cotton fabric as ones we had bought in stores previously . Scratchy , stiff and seem to attract lint and hair . One pair had been re-hemmed -LRB- very poorly -RRB- . Very disappointed but had to keep and use because he needed for his job .
 Ordered 2 pair , same size as I currently wear . I tried them on when they came in . Fit was more snug than other pairs of Dockers I have in the same size . When I went to wear one of the pairs to work , and removed the labels , I noticed the finish work on the button holes to be very poor . Extra thead hang off . Uneven stiching . My reaction was that these were `` seconds '' . Not first quality merchandise . Will be returning them No excuse for this poor quality . Buying manufacturer 's seconds is one thing , IF you know that is what you are getting .
 The length and waist are a little shorter/smaller than the same size pants from other manufacturers .
 I have three very old Hanes black tees , two of which are now so worn they have to be consigned to the rag bin . Hate to do it ; I love those shirts . But after maybe eight years of wear I guess it 's time . So I ordered 4 replacements and they arrived today . Hanes should be pretty red-faced about continuing to call these Beefy-T shirts . Nothing beefy about them , they are pretty lightweight . Certainly not as heavy as the old shirts . But worse , and why I 'm sending them back , is the uneven stitching in the shoulder . One badly stitched shoulder on each of two shirts . The material does n't lie flat but appears to `` bubble '' up near the collar . Looks bad . Sorry , Hanes , you had it but you lost it . I guess a $ 7 tee shirt is too much to hope for anymore .
 I 'm an average build size medium ; not overweight nor athletic build . I used to buy a Hanes pocket t-shirt which fit just great ; a generous cut which allowed freedom of arm motion and a slight drape off the shoulder which did n't cling to the body , allowing some air space between the shirt and my skin . This size is not the same as the medium of these beefy t-shirts . These newer Hanes products are very form fitting and more of an athletic cut ; tight around the shoulders and chest and draping close to the skin . The chest width as measured at the armpit is 20 '' whereas the older version was 21-21 .5 '' , resulting in a big difference in fit . The old size is in between the new medium and large . The newer medium is too tight and the large is , well , too roomy for a good look . The color palette is super but the fit is not the same as it used to be for size medium ; the older size does n't exist anymore so be aware of that when you order .
 I ordered this shirt and it showed up rolled up into a ball and stuffed into a clear plastic bag . No original Hanes packaging at all . After opening there was a bunch of loose threads hanging off . Definitely makes me suspect of the whole thing . There is a Hanes logo screen printed in it , but since there 's no packaging , who knows if it really is Hanes or not . I also found the neck hole larger than other tshirts I own . Disappointed , but since it was only $ 10 I 'll just keep it for painting or something .
 Good loose fit and heavy material , But loose threads that pull out after first washing . Poor construction - made in Haiti .
 These T 's are a bit on the small side and the cotton is not as soft and does n't have the thread count I am used to in Hanes.Usually I like these T 's but they seem small and less comfortable than my past experience with these shirts .
 this t-shirt arrived squished/rolled into a ball put in a dry cleaners plastic and then boxed in a tiny carton . I had 2 steam iron it twice , then wash it upon which the pink faded then tried again to iron the wrinkles . . it looked like a rag which I am now using it as such

 Okay for a kid . Nice pattern but the camoflague pattern sells at the dollar store . It 's ok looking , just cheap quality.Not horrible , but not great .
 This hat is of very poor quality . Bad crafting and materials . Look elsewhere , as this is not worth the cost .
 I have an regular camo hat that I bought from a surplus store in the late 90s . There is no way that the one I just bought will last that long .
 I have been looking for a purple fleece vest in the stores and did n't have any luck . Was very happy when I found one on the net.The vest is cut a little long , I am not a short person , 5 ' 5 '' , but on the whole I am very happy with it.I originally ordered a X large and returned it for a large.I was very happy with the companies attitude on returning the X large .

 I 'm gon na start this review by saying , I 'm a Nirvana fanatic . I purchased this shirt last year , and was doing some christmas shopping this year and ran across it again . I wore this shirt probably twice , firstly , the fabric is really thick and got all stretched out and misshaped after only wearing it twice . I hate this shirt . I have a few other nirvana t 's that are much , much better made then this one . In fact I 've had them for about 6 years and they still look nice .
 Got this for Halloween . Normally I support my local costume shop but this was about $ 60 compared to $ 20 on Amazon , so we could n't pass that up . Looks fantastic , just like in the pictures . But , the stitching came loose almost immediately and was not receptive to our efforts to fix it . If you want something to wear for one night , go for it . If you 're looking for something to toss in the dress-up box for kids to use day in and day out , not such a great deal . That said , my kids still play with it .

 I bought the Alexander sweatshirt . The quality is substandard . The shoulders are off and the product is basically irregular ! Although the company 's statement shows that they accept returns and exchanges , after I received the item , I discovered that they do not either exchange or return because the item is considered a personal item -LRB- despite the fact that they have these items in stock -RRB- .

 bag was durable and expedited refund . However , the measurements of this backpack were not what was stated . So i ended up spending $ 13 on shipping of an item i could not use .
 The book bag is nice to look at but horrible to use !!!!! The zippers on the big parts do not stay zipped and the straps that draw the book bag together do not stay closed . I almost lost my Macbook out of it in the airport because the bag would n't stay shut . I 'm only using this bag until my new book bag arrives from LLBean ... I have to wear it on my stomach instead of my back though , so I can keep zipping it back up and making sure my stuff does n't fall out ...
 This product looks bigger in the picture than it really is . The padding is inadequate and there are a lot of unnecessary straps . The only up side is ... it 's cheap .
 Bag was too small and arrived wet due to heavy rain . -LRB- However the Bag was sealed in plastic so nothing happened to it.I would just say that this bag is way TOO SMALL for High school students . You would be better off with a JanSport bag from a local store ...
 DD picked out this backpack for school . The size is perfect , however , the zipper is a nightmare . The main pouch zipper broke the first week and does n't close . Her backpack is constantly open because of a bad zipper , and school work falls out and gets lost . This is my first High Sierra backback and am wondering if they have quality issues .
 The zipper broke on this within two weeks of use . I was looking for a large backpack for my high schooler , and this is large . It does hold the books . But without a zipper , ... . I need a new backpack !
 I ordered a backpack for Christmas that my daughter has been wanting for a long time , blue and black plaid Fatboy . They sent the wrong color . The one they sent is a puke green . I immediately contacted `` seller '' through Amazon . I could n't just simply return the item since there was no return address on the invoice in the box . After contacting `` seller '' through Amazon , I did receive and email from OnlineSports saying they apologize and that they would be sending me return labels so I could send back the wrong item . So far ... No return labels have been sent . I tried looking up `` OnlineSports '' ... `` online '' but it seems they do n't exist . This is very frustrating . I sent another email through Amazon to `` contact seller '' and received a reply that was just a copy of the previous email . Someone at Amazon or OnlineSports needs to give me an address I can send this item back to AND ... REFUND my money .
 i hate it it took 9 weeks for it to come and it was a diffrent colori hate it i hate it
 ******** UPDATE ********** I would consider this bag to be inferior to the exact one it replaced . My daughter uses it in the same manner as the original -- to carry her books back and forth to school . As I noted in the earlier comments below , the stitching in the shoulder straps has almost completely come undone . At some point I expect the bag to be completely functionless when a strap completely breaks . I 'm willing to accept wear and tear around the body of the pack , but a broken strap renders a backpack useless.I WOULD NOT recommend this pack after seeing how quickly it is coming apart at the seams . ************************ This review is mostly based on our previous pack of the same model which lived its first year as a daypack for weekends and vacations . It served us well for a week at Disney World and held everything that our family of four needed each day at the parks . When my daughter entered 7th grade she needed an adequate pack to carry textbooks , binders , etc. back and forth to school , so this pack was large enough to suit her needs . After four years of heavy daily use we finally replaced it with the new one in this review.For most of the past year this bag was completely functional even though it had several holes worn through in the bottom . Granted , it would n't have lasted too much longer , but the fact is , even in a severely worn state , it still held several heavy textbooks and supplies . For that I give this bag FOUR STARS.I have to ding this bag for the following reasons :1 -RRB- Stitching in the padded shoulder straps began to come undone within the first year of using this bag . I would consider the shoulder strap padding to be a high-wear/stress area and would expect better construction here .2 -RRB- Not `` hydration compatible . '' For me , it does n't necessarily mean you ca n't easily adapt a hydration bladder , but I also use the sleeve that would hold a bladder to hold my laptop whenever I need to pack it with me . This may not be a deal-breaker for some people.Overall , this is a great pack that worked well for us . I trust that our new one will serve just as well .
 The straps on the side meant to make the backpack more compact get in the way whenever trying to zip and unzip . I would much rather have bought a North Face backpack .
 I ordered this backpack based off the reviews saying it held a lot of books/laptop/etc . When it got here , I was not sure that the folks who wrote the reviews were looking at the same bag as I was . I currently use a Code Alpha bag that has tons of room . I was hoping that this would at least compete with the bag I currently have . No such luck . This bag is an AVERAGE sized backpack . I work 12 hour shifts , where I bring schoolbooks , books for work and lunch/snacks in everyday . This bag would maybe hold my lunch and a single book.It does appear to be well made and looks good , but with the name `` Fat Boy '' , I just expected a larger bag .
 This backpack is fairly decent . Only spent around $ 30 . Pro 's : - Fair amount of storage , but definitely IS NOT a lot more than competition . - Front pocket is logically organized . - Shoulder straps are n't terribly uncomfortable . Bearable.Con 's : - Material feels cheap . Will likely break within a year . - Zippers are cheap . Definitely not as nice of zippers compared to my old Swiss Gear pack , which lasted about 4 years and went to Afghanistan and back before it broke . - Zippers go all the way down to bottom of pack . This can be annoying considering when the zippers are opened even the slightest amount , they have a tendency to open all the way to the bottom by themselves , causing the contents of the pack fall out . When you try to zip them back up , the size straps that are used to compress contents of pack get in the way . A small hassle for a cheap pack I suppose . - Side straps do not unbuckle in any way except for unthreading the strap through the plastic cinch . - There is a flap that covers the zipper of the main compartment for the entire length of the zipper . Seems to get in the way / makes zipper hard to find . - I have a 17 '' laptop . Laptop does not fit in backpack without compromising the safety of the laptop . But then again this pack was n't designed to fit a 17 '' laptop . - Stitching is already coming apart . Very cheap stitching.Summary : I 've had this backpack for less than a month and if I had the opportunity to buy this again I would n't . The pack maximum lifespan will be about a year of soft usage . It 's beginning to fall apart , and the build quality overall is cheap . I have had High Sierra products in the past that just fell apart , and I thought maybe they had fixed their manufacturing / engineering issues . Wrong.My last pack was a Swiss Gear pack that cost about $ 60 . It lasted me four years , was very comfortable and was extremely rugged in every sense of the word . I would recommend staying away from this High Sierra pack and biting the bullet and forking out a little more money for a pack that will survive normal to heavy usage for more than one year .
 This backpack was delivered at the end of January and by the end of April was falling apart . My daughter has used it quite normally back and forth from school and she 's not particularly rough with her things . Two seams have split open and the binding along the edge of one shoulder strap has come off .
 I got this backpack in September for my 4th grade daughter . Great size . She could but all her books -LRB- one heavy textbook and some notebooks -RRB- , snack , light coat , and all the notes she writes with her friends . Loved it , until the zipper broke . For a month now I 've been realigning the teeth to get it to close . Did n't even last five months . She loves the High Sierra designs , but I 'm afraid to waste my money only to have another zipper break .
 Bought this purse right after the holidays and it arrived on Jan. 8th . Loved it loved it loved it !!! Until right before Valentine 's Day . The chain attached to the back -LRB- used to hook the flap closed -RRB- came apart . As I was emptying it out to send back for an exchange , I noticed that the inside seams - on both sides at the top - were torn about an inch or so and fraying . So I decided to just return it . It was a gorgeous bag , but for having it only a month it should n't have come apart like that . Do n't know if it was in the seller 's warehouse for too long , or if it was a manufacturing issue or what . Had it held up , I 'd have given it a 5 star rating .

 I have an regular camo hat that I bought from a surplus store in the late 90s . There is no way that the one I just bought will last that long .
 Well I was going hiking and like to wear comfy sweatpants to rest and be warm afterwards . I got these fast from Amazon Prime -- put them on and yes they were comfy , fit great , the length was a bit long but that made me happy . THEY HAVE WHITE POCKETS !!!!! What is that -- so they are sadly going back -- White pockets -- no matter what you do they stick out . So I am going to order another brand and hope they do n't have WHITE POCKETS !!! Who thought of that ?????
 I ca n't overstate how poorly these sweat pants fit . For reference , I ordered the Medium size.The crotch on these pants hangs just above the knees , and the pant legs are about 6 inches too long . I have no idea who on earth these were designed to fit . Before I purchased these I was very close to buying a different pair of pants , but I changed my mind because these were much cheaper . I wish I had followed my original intuition.The only redeeming quality of these pants is that they are cheap . But this truly is a case where you get what you pay for.These pants are not worth buying at any price . Skip them .
 The pocket design on these pants is weird which you can already tell a little bit by the picture . The insides of the pocket are white and because of the way it 's cut they are always exposed which makes it look very odd . Other than that the sizes are off - the small is a medium at best . I would just go to your local store instead since I tried to find similar products on the website but they are way too expensive .
 Needed new open-bottom heavyweight sweatpants ... live in them after work and on weekends in winter ... always ordered from Penneys but theyquit making the nice heavy ones purchased for past 20 yrs ... anyway , have had nice heavy Champion sweatshirts in the past so ordered these ... ordered usual XL size . . the pair received were labeled XL but were very tight and pulled down off backside when sitting or bending over ... thought maybe they were sized for women ... no rise area whatsoever ... anyway , returned them and received prompt refund ... still looking for 9 oz or more heavyweight open bottom sweatpants ... can not find any at big box stores ... all their material is thin & flimsy ...
 The material and style was great . However , it wasw 4-5 inches too long ... too much of an error to live with . I sent it back and the refund was given .
 I received one pair of `` Champion Men 's Double Dry Classic Fleece Open Bottom Pant , Black , X-Large '' with the open bottom , but was surprised that the other had the elastic open legs .
 Champion Men 's Double Dry Classic Fleece Open Bottom PantI ca n't believe the poor workmanship on these pants . 1st the seam on the right leg is sewn crooked , 2nd the pocket on the left side is sewn to the back waist band , making it impossible to put your hand into it . Since I no longer have the invoice , I guess i 'm out of luck in trying to return it . Worst product I 've ever gotten from Amazon !
 What more can I say ? When the waist string to tighten it breaks after scarcely using it more than a handful of times within a nine-day period , it 's 1-star and back to Amazon with you .
 The crotch on these sweat pants is way too long ; the fit is odd . The length was also REALLY long , which is okay becuase that can be fixed . But I ca n't imagine why the crotch is as long as it is ; no body type would fit these . Really awful . Unfortunatley , I did n't realize it until after I washed them , so I plan on either giving them to good will , or throwing them out . Such a waste .
 The fit is good and they are comfortable , but mine -LRB- dark grey -RRB- suffered pretty bad piling on the crotch after the first wearing/washing -LRB- line dried -RRB- . Not super happy about that . Perhaps I should have washed them inside out ? I 'm not convinced these are going to last many washings .
 These pants are alright , but after running in them and washing them , the cotton on the pants starts to frazzle.UPDATE
 I ordered three pairs of these pants ... but have only received two of them . The two that I did get ... I like . Nice quality and good weight of material.HOWEVER ... one pair came from a company called Fogdog , and that 's where the trouble started . I ordered a pair of navy blue XL open bottom wicking sweat pants . What I received was a boys size 8 Columbia Ski jacket . The packing slip was correct ... but the item in the box was not.I called them directly , and was told `` no problem . . new pants will be shipped out . . and a prepaid label will be sent to you for the return . '' Some days go by ... and nothing happens . I then called them back ... and was then told that `` we ca n't help you ... you need to call another department that deals just with Amazon orders . '' Odd thing ... items are pulled from the exact same warehouse -LRB- per them -RRB- , and they have the same exact physical address . ???? Anyway ... I was then told that the correct item will not be shipped ... I have to return the item ... and then I will then get credit for it ... and then will have to reorder the thing . To make a long story short ... I ordered another color via Amazon from another partner seller.Update

 The yellow band accross these make the sunglasses look cheap . Even at the discount price -- I would pass on these .
 As is often the case with `` designer '' goods , I think it probably cost more in raw materials to make the super cool case for these sunglasses , than for the sunglasses themselves.They are feather light , have the feel of a pair you would find in a higher-end Walgreens , and yield a pretty poor image when worn.We were lucky enough to pick these up on the cheap . For 30 bucks , they 're value - the case is at least . For MSRP , there 's better out there .

 Based on other reviews , I ordered a size larger than I needed , and it is still way too small ! It seems like too much of a pain to return , so it is a total waste .

 Extremely poor service . Product did not ship on time . They did NOT expedite as they charged . Product did not arrive . NEVER , EVER DEAL WITH THIS COMPANY .
 Ordered the jumbo 27x27 but received one with dimensions of 22 '' x 24.75 '' . Do n't waste your money buying from these guys .
 Colors do n't match any other ACU gear I have . Bandana has a brownish tint and all colors look faded . I would not recommend nor purchase again .
 the American flag bandana is disproportionate and it says `` made in china '' right on it . . that 's just terrible . I 'm actually considering throwing it away
 okthey shorted me 2 bandanas and took a week to answer me and charged me $ 35 shipping on $ 5 in items , light items too.poor . the auto system on there view was stock and never contacted me in a timely fashion.I do n't count a legal reply on your customer window as a reply giving a false sense of customer service.never again from these people again .
 This was a bandana , it was made of cloth , and is black , it serves the purpose of any other bandana , and was really over priced , cheaper at walmart , and less hassle of shipping a bandana
 I was just looking for a red colored bandana for Airsoft and I thought this would work ... Unfortunately , I was wrong . It is not a RED camo bandana - it 's more of a BRICK color -LRB- more brown than red -RRB- . I would NOT suggest anyone buying this .
 I was under the impression that I was going to receive multiple bandanas . I received one . Probably would not have ordered if I knew this was the case . I would not recommend ordering from this account .
 How 's that for contradiction . My husband was so excited to get this and wear it while riding his Harley . He got stuck in the rain and the colors on the flag started bleeding . Completely destroyed , since the white has turned pink .
 these bandanas are nothing the add says they are . Any other positive reviews are probably from the company themselves . They absorb nothing , are a rough , polyester type , good for decorating only . Do n't buy these unless thats your need .
 I wanted an American Flag Bandana and this one was pretty cheap , so I bought it . I guess you get what you pay for . It is made of a coarse material , not very comfortable to wear . There is a large `` Made in China '' marking on one corner , which I do n't like to see on my American Flag , not that I care where it was made . Lastly , the colors ran as soon as I washed it , luckily I just washed it in the sink and not with my clothes , but the white stripes are now pinkish . I thought these colors do n't run ! Oh well at least it was cheap .
 I bought this product to go with a subdued pink camouflage pants I bought and love . It was cheaply made and basically looks like a piece of cloth with the edges sewn . There is little pink in it and the pink is so light it is difficult to see .
 I thought it would be better/thicker material for the price . It says 100 % cotton but feels like sandpaper . It smells like pesticide .
 One side of the bandana is very faded and light . Poor quality and low thread count . Though the pattern and colors are attractive I still say , `` Do n't bother . '' There are better ones available . Also had a snag/knot in it .
 Thinner than expected , stiff and itchy even after washing , and all three that I ordered came out of the package with stains on them.If you want a cheap bandana , cut up an old t-shirt . These are n't worth the admittedly small cost .
 The print was only on one side of the bandana . VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT IT DID NOT PROVIDE A STATEMENT IN THE DESCRIPTION ...
 when i washed this thing the colours bled like the elevator from the shineing . it was intantly ruined . made in china
 I purchased -LRB- 6 -RRB- of the 27 '' x 27 '' Tigers stripes and a Digital Camo bandanas , and the material is like wearing canvas . I even washed them 3 times and used tons of fabric softener to no avail . . I emailed the company to find out what material that they were made from and they claimed they are 100 % cotton , which i know they 're not . . Its to bad because i love the tiger striped ones alot because of the print . . I just wished the company would tell the truth to there customers .
 Thin . Poorly dyed . Cheap.The bandana I purchased was an olive drab paisley -LRB- trainmen as they call it -RRB- . I 'm not sure what I expected for like 4 bucks , but it was more than I got . I would n't recommend using these for anything . These are really cheap.Lets look at the advertised product.Made From 100 % Cotton ! - Maybe ... but with only 20 % of the fabric one would expect!Measures
 We ordered several different colors and patterns , all by Rothco . The others were thin but serviceable , and we should have expected that the low price would reflect the quality ; but the black one is worthless . After being worn once , and washed once , the edges began to unravel . I suppose it is better than using , say , a paper towel or maybe a brown paper sack but never again will we order anything like this from Rothco .
 I dislike this product . It would cost more to return the products then to keep them . I 'm terribly unhappy because when I opened up delivery and looked at the product I felt like I had ordered placemats . I double checked my order and it said bandana 's but I will never use these . I just lost money .
 Yes , clearly there is an image of an eagle , a globe , and an anchor , but the details are hardly consistent with that familiar icon loved by all leathernecks . I use it as a liner for my bike helmet , and it was cheap , but do n't buy it for the emblem . I ca n't call it a true Marine Corps Emblem , it 's just a haphazard knock-off . I suppose those in China who manufactured it do n't see significance in the discrepancies , but I do .
 This item does not run true to standard sizing . We ordered women 's large and it is so small it looks more like a girls size large . There is no way , if this is standard sizing , that an XLarge would fit either . Unless you are very petite , we suggest not purchasing this product . John and Miriam Ganze

 i ordered a ladies large and it was like a men 's extra large . Other than that , it was nice and fluffy . I loved the purple color .
 Design is reasonable and simple . Material and stitching could be stronger ; wore out earlier than expected .
 Based on other reviews , I ordered a size larger than I needed , and it is still way too small ! It seems like too much of a pain to return , so it is a total waste .

 Began to rip at the seams after less than a year of use .
 I purchased this wallet in -LRB- nero -RRB- black on black and I was very disappointed with the quality for the price ! Also I never received a certificate of authenticity which was upsetting , Amazon did give me a small discount as they did not have another one to exchange it for but I even offered to take another color but they were sold out ! I just do n't think it was very good quality for Fendi !

 The hat was suppose to be an XL size yet it would n't even fit my friends head who normally wears a Medium . All of this after having to wait almost 3 weeks for it to deliver . Very disappointing .
 I took a gamble and bought this ... and I found out it 's not as cool as I thought it would be.I still use it ... mostly out of guilt .

 Three weeks ago , I purchased this t-shirt for my grandson , who was becoming a big brother . He was very excited about the t-shirt until we notices that there was a large tear in the side seam of the shirt . My daughter does not have a sewing machine , so I had to sew the seam by hand in order for it to be ready the the arrival of the baby sister . That was disappointing for both me and my grandson . He loved the picture and the message , however.I 'm the BIG Brother , T-Shirt - New Big Brother Gift Idea !
 What you can not see when you look at this T here is that it has company 's website address in front , right below the the caption ... it appears as a blur on the website pic . Why would i want that on our Baby 's shirt ?
 URL in blue box under the word brother makes the tshirt look like it should be given away free . Hard to see it before u buy it due to bad photo . I would n't give as a gift .

 This was a sub contractor to Amazon , who I really love doing business with . However when my order arrived , instead of getting white crew socks , I got black , shorty socks . Additionally , the 24 pack of black crew socks in the order were much smaller than I expected . I ordered size 5-9 and I wear a size 7-1/2 . The socks were amazingly tight , and I could n't wear them . The whole order was bad and there was n't an easy way to return the order . I 'll never order from this vendor again and will probably not order socks from Amazon again either .

 The picture is very deceiving . When I put the hat on my head , it did n't look the same . Also , the material and the texture is very different . The hole is too big and I could n't even cover my nose properly . I do n't even want to waste my time returning it . I will just trash it . I tried rating it for 0 star , but it did n't let me . So I am rating it 1 star .
 This ski mask is of good material
 I bought this ski mask for my husband to wear on his way to work on his scooter . When it arrived I was very unhappy to see a sticker on it warning that it contains lead , which is known to cause reproductive and health issues , as well as birth defects.Are you kidding ? It 's a SKI MASK . Now my husband has to spend another week freezing his face off while we wait for a different ski mask to replace this one .
 My product arrived fast but it was different from the image posted here . While the quality is good , it is short and the hole is too big , twice as big as in the picture . I wanted a balaclava that only exposes my eyes but if I try to adjust it , my neck becomes exposed . They must have sent me a wrong one or an irregular .
 the ski mask is not NEARLY as long as pictured . it does not cover the neck , it only covers the chin at best .
 The mask is way too short . It barely is enough to go over your chin , much less cover any part of your neck . If you try to adjust the mask so that only your eyes show , then it rides up high and your neck is totally exposed .
 If you got the one with the right size then congratulations to you , because many people -LRB- including me -RRB- got the small one . The mask only covers up to your chin , the hole is too big , looks nothing like the one in the picture . It 's basically a beanie with a hole in the middle.If you really want a ski mask then buy this one , but there 's a chance that you might get the small crappy version that me and a few others got . You have been warned .
 I was very excited to order this project , only to be extremely dismayed by the company 's shipping policy . They were charging me to ship each item individually , over $ 4 PER ITEM , for 20 masks . My shipping came to over $ 60 , for standard shipping , for an item that could n't possibly weigh enough to warrant that kind of shipping . I figured it was a glitch of some sort , but when I contacted the seller directly to inquire , they said it was Amazon 's policy to group items into one order , but that they -LRB- the seller -RRB- still charged a $ 3 shipping fee per item , regardless . I ca n't stand it when sellers do this bait and switch - offer a really low price on an item and then make up for it by overcharging you for shipping . I see this sort of practice on E-bay a lot , but never expected to see it on Amazon !
 Definitely not as pictured . The hole is oddly-shaped , and the front barely covers the chin . Spend the extra few dollars and get one on eBay .
 The only good thing about this product is that it arrived on time . The fabric is different , the seams around the eye hole and bottom were horribly done and the two layers of fabric were uneven . The eyehole was small and the neck of the mask only went down to right below my chin . It did n't even touch my neck . Overall , this is the worst thing I 've ever bought . Do n't buy from this provider or else all you 'll get is a cheap reject that was made in China .
 I ordered 2 of these masks , one blue and one grey . They 're supposed to be one size fits all but the blue one was much larger than the grey . In fact , the grey must have been a child 's ski mask because it was too tight along the forehead -LRB- painfully tight -RRB- and the part that is supposed to cover the neck , only covered half the neck . I had to take a pair of scissors and cut the elastic around the eye hole so that it would n't be so tight.It would be a great mask -LRB- I know because the blue one that fits is great -RRB- but you ca n't trust the seller - misleading.I noticed that the blue one was sent from a different seller even though they were both ordered at the same time . I wo n't order from this seller again .
 Reasonable fabric - Eye opening works fine - Way too tight for my head - I gave it to my grandson and it fits him fine - Pretty cost effective also , so buy one for your kids BUT do not buy it for the adults
 Do not purchase , it is a mask with only the mouth hole in it . There are no eye holes , seems like the company is taking badly manufactured products with defects and trying to sell them as something else .
 Pros :1 . CheapCons :1 . though it does protect u from the wind ... i found it a bit porous .2 . the stuff stinks like hell and needs a wash before first use .3 . found the visor irritating
 The mask is of good quality but the hole for the eyes is too small -LRB- O ordered a BLACK one -RRB- . I bought this for my 9 years old but it only will be useful for my toddler . It fits loose to my toddler but the hole for the eyes is made for his size . It cover the neck for an adult but I can not see anything since it covers the sides of my eyes .
 I never got a chance to send back so now I am stuck with two hats that dont fit . Im tring to find someone with a small head to give them too .
 Wanted something I could carry on the motorcycle and cover my ears , still lookin ' . Does n't look at all like the pic , the brim flops right in front of your face so you ca n't see where you are going . Looks like a girls hat .
 Another made in China rip-off , could have gotten the same thing for less than $ 5.00 at the local flea market
 I bought the Alexander sweatshirt . The quality is substandard . The shoulders are off and the product is basically irregular ! Although the company 's statement shows that they accept returns and exchanges , after I received the item , I discovered that they do not either exchange or return because the item is considered a personal item -LRB- despite the fact that they have these items in stock -RRB- .
 I thought I was getting clip on to the pants suspenders . Not clip to a belt . The problem with these is that the clip rubs against my back and left a very nasty bruise . That and the fact that I wanted to wear suspenders not a belt . If I have to wear a belt to use the suspenders that sort of defeats the purpose of the suspenders . I want one or the other . Not both .
 These have to be hooked to a belt and that was not clear in the description . Otherwise they were just what they said they were .
 Why oh why would I be buying suspenders if I have a belt ? One of my biggest pet peeves is when douchebags wear belts and suspenders at the same time ; now I know those douchebags wear Perrys . I 'm tall so my options were very limited , but had I known or had the description been clearer in saying &#34; these suspenders can only be worn by douchebags also wearing belts &#34; , I 'd have moved right along .
 Do n't bother . Tried to retun them but had to pay for the shipping back , lots of bother about paper work blah blah.Trying to think of a way to re-purpose the elastic since I ca n't use these stupid things.Would be nice if the listing was more explicit.Belt AND suspenders ? JeezaLou , how insecure do you have to be to purchase TWO items to do ONE job .
 These suspenders require you to wear a belt . There should be no reason to wear both . Although they 're satisfactory when worn , you 'll look like a clown wearing suspenders and a belt .
 THE SUBJECT SAIDS IT ALL.UGLY , DID N'T LOOK LIKE PICTURE , UGLY , DID N'T LOOK LIKE PICTURE . UGLY , DID N'T LOOK LIKE PICTURE
 I was looking for the clips that attach to your pants not the belt.xxxxx xxxx xxx xxx xx x
 These braces are more for style than function since they attach to your belt ... the aesthetics are good but that 's about it
 Pros : Look good ... Contras : Bad quality glass ... Broke after the first fall -LRB- lasted 6 weeks -RRB-
 Adult sized is debatable ... the shirt did n't even fit my 12yr old son . He had to wear his last year 's costume because he felt ridiculous in this costume . Poor quality mask and shirt . : -LRB-
 I purchase this outfit for my 4 yr old daughter to wear at her big sisters CHEER competitions . The colors match the school colors . The picture makes it look as though it is more fitted through the mid-section . It sort of just hangs very loose and looks frumpy . The turtle neck is short so you will always have to wear it under something . I washed it on cold but the colors faded a lot from just one wash . Great for pretend play but not worth the price .
 Horrible quality product . I received something that looks nothing like what is in the photo -LRB- it hooks onto a bra , so obviously it goes up much higher than the one in the photo -RRB- and does not slim at all . I do n't really need that much slimming , just a little bit , but it does nothing . All it really did was leave weird bumps around my thighs that can be seen under a dress or pants . It looks like you are wearing a nylon panthose tube and slims just as well as that would . I will not use this product and want to return it but was told I can only exchange and not return , which is pretty bad considering it does n't even look like what I ordered.Do NOT order this .
 I have worn and washed this product gently only a few times , however the elastic is already coming undone . I like the thong aspect , but the quality is not there for the price .
 `` Firm Control '' ? ... that is total crap ... This product is flimsy and thin . Instead of FIRMING things up , SLIMMING things down , or CONTROLLING the jiggle of unwanted fat / rolls , this product took my many LITTLE rolls and turned them into one BIG roll that makes me look like I am PREGNANT ! I am uploading a pic of my wearing this product under a dress I bought . Check them out !

 I ordered this around Halloween hoping it would look nice like it does in the picture . However it doesnt even look close . The jacket and pants are silky polyester looking , something Peter Pan wears ... The mask is foam which I really dont care since I have a $ 200 latex & fiberglass . But anyways no matter what site you see this on , theyre all the same . Crap . The rubber spine and pieces showing are nice , you could rip them out and sew them onto some dickies if you want . .
 Very high-quality pants , and I love the feel of them when wearing . However , be warned of two things :1 -RRB- When you wash the pants , plan to spend some time ironing them . They come out of the dryer looking like crumbled up tissue paper . Also plan on steam ironing them after a day of wearing . They start to wrinkle in the crotch and thigh area after just a few hours of wearing .2 -RRB- The crease on the pant leg is extremely hard to find after they 've been washed . I thought I had found it initially and ironed the pants accordingly , only to find out the next morning that I 'd missed the crease by about half an inch , and now had two creases running down the pant leg . My recommendation is not to iron them immediately after they come out of the dryer , but let them hang for a couple of hours . The crease becomes more apparent the longer they set out.Also , if you need the length adjusted , take to a good tailor . The one I went to adjusted the cuff , but I guess he did n't make his seam at the bottom of the pants as permanent as the original one . After they were washed , the cuff reverted back to the original seam , even though the top off the cuff was sewn to the seam of each leg . This resulted in an uneven and horrible looking cuff , which I had to spend a lot of time straightening and pressing out with an iron.I love linen , but not enough to spend this much time taking care of `` casual '' trousers . I 'll be taking these pants back . This is far from the norm for Jos. A. Banks .
 These pants were very cheap and were not worth the cost . I do not recommend . I would recommend Calvin Klein linen pants , as they are ideal for wearing during the summer .
 for a product with a title 12-Neon sunglasses , i A -RRB- only got one pair , and B -RRB- you ca n't even see out of the lenses
 i only got one pair of these cheap sunglasses . it 's not a good deal if you only get one pair !
 no issues with the seller - quick shipping . i simply can not see through the glasses and the lens almost pop out every time i pick up a pair .
 Like many others here , I only received one pair of these sunglasses . The one I did receive was scuffed on the lenses . The fit also seems to be for children . Called Amazon for an immediate return .
 i bought these thinking theyre neon as the title said but they ARE NOT !!!! and its not 12 different colors its 4 colors 3 of eachh !
 i really did n't think that these glasses were categorized a toy ... lenses are terrible , theyre all blurry and they fall out real easy . not worth the money at all .
 I purchased 2 sets of this product for my daughter 's 80 's bday party and received the items and more than 1/2 of the items were defective-lens were very blurry , received sunglasses with missing lens -LRB- and the missing lens were not included in the box -RRB- , and also received broken sunglasses . This item is cheaply made and does break easily . This product is good for a one or two time use or in my case perfect for a party favor bag . But did wish the product was not damaged .
 They are very cheap yes , but do n't plan on actually wearing them , as the lens are hardly transparent . They look as if they are made of normal injection molded plastic , and just thin enough to be slightly transparent . They are basically as dark as a welding glass , I was able to look directly at lights with them on.In short , they are basically worthless other than sitting on your head .
 Ive tryed everywhere looking for these glasses finally found them got them in NOT what i ordered they look like little kid baseball glasses or something
 someone has to be stupid to pay so much money for such an ugly peace of garbage , it is so not worth it for this amount of money i can buy 5 PRETTY and nice outfits
 These jeans are terrible , when I finally get them on I feel like a wool mermaid.If I want to move I have to do the worm . I gave them two stars because my worm skills are so premium now .
 I expected a real woolen cap like I had in the Navy in 1957 . To much man made material . In those days they were still issuing caps made in WW @ I guess when oil was acarce .
 The photo shows a hat with thick yarn , with a chunky , sturdy look to it.The actual item was knitted with thin yarn and when held up to put on , you could see daylight between all the stitches.It would not keep any U.S. Navy person warm for long.Service : Hat $ 6.95 Shipping and handling $ 6.30 Return shipping by me -LRB- first class -RRB- $ 1.51 Return fee
 Purchased this item for my uncle , it is described as 100 % wool and as a genuine navy watch cap , the item received was small and clearly not wool , others have described as a cheap knock off , so buyer beware . Sold by
 Unless the Navy has changsd their standards for the wool watch cap , I amafraid the cap I purchased was not the real thing !
 First of all , the label says this cap is made to DOD specifications , which any manufacturer can say . It is NOT U.S. Navy issue . More importantly , I found it to be too small and tight . This hat would not fit any jarhead I ever met ! `` For sanitary reasons , '' the seller does NOT accept returns on hats . And even if they did , their shipping policies on returns would make it more expensive than the hat itself . So unless you have a tiny head , do n't order this hat because once you get it , you 're stuck with it !
 The wool watch cap did serve its purpose , and kept my head warm for couple days . Then I start getting the itch on head , so I figured it because the hat is new . I looked over the care instruction , and could n't find any on the inside label or on the website . Without thinking too much , I put it in the washer and dryer . Now my hat is sooo small that a 1 month baby ca n't fit in . Worst product I ever got on Amazon !
 The costume arrived in a noodle box , the wand was bent , and the fabric was scratchy ... not as cute as the one in the photo . Not happy ... no refunds or exchanges ... very sad ... doesnt even rate 1 star ... Do n't waste your money on this product . .
 I generally like Wrangler products , but these slacks were disappointing . The material itself was good , but the construction was absolutely poor . It took only a couple of wearings before the clasp started to pull from the material . Several washes and the clasp was gone . But since it has a button no big deal right ? Well , not exactly , that disappeared a couple of washes later.The fit was good -LRB- one of the reasons I like Wrangler , they do n't just take `` skinny cuts '' and make them bigger , these are made properly for size -RRB- ... that being said the finish on these was not up to snuff .
 These pants are of low quality and the sizing is n't even close . Possibly made by a blind edward scissorhands . Please save your money and do not purchase .
 I specifically bought these pants because one of the pictures showed the elastic band feature on the side ... but these pants DO N'T have that feature . So NOT what I wanted . boo ... The color was a darker khaki than the pictures show but honestly more what I was looking for and the material was truly strong like people commented ... but still the main feature I wanted was wrong .
 When I recieved the pants I tried them on and the only thing I noticed was the button was already about to fall off , but I have sewed many buttons in my day and this did n't bother me too much . After a washing I actually put them on for work for the first time and they are almost like bell bottoms . I do n't like `` skinny '' pants that get way narrow down there but these were down right baggy . Then the button fell off so I had sewed that back on and put them back on for work . I found myself walking on the cuff and after measuring found the inseam to be about 33 1/2 inches , which is a bit long for pants that are supposed to be 32 inches . This would have been one star but the material is kinda nice and I will probably wear these on days I know I 'll be doing something dirty at work , just sitting here they do feel kinda okay . Other than that I would almost believe I got these from a first year fashion student who has n't learned to measure and sew yet .
 It gives nice separation . Good fabric . Be careful about sizing . I felt it was a size bigger than other brands . The under wire digs in a lot in the middle . Very uncomfortable .
 This used to be a great bra until they changed it and they no longer make it with a molded cup . It 's a nice bra if you 're looking for that style but I 'm an older woman who need help in the support dept with a molded cup !
 Unfortunately I ordered the wrong size and had to return this product . However , had I ordered the right size , I still would have returned it . The description states `` smooth cup '' which I took to mean that it would be discreet , even in cold weather . This was not the case , the cup has thin material and would not hide anything . Although it is a pretty bra , it 's not good to wear under form fitting clothes . : -LRB-
 I was really hopeful that this bra would fit well and be supportive . I wear a 30F so comfort and support are important to me and also hard to find . The original one that I ordered was tiny . It looked more like a DD , so I went up two cup sizes . The second one I received fit , I suppose . There was no side support and only two clasps in the back . It did not provide a very natural or flattering shape at all . More like a kinda pointy shape with some extra shoved under my arms . Just disappointing . I 've had two children and nursed them both , and besides unless they 're fake a 30F ai n't standing at attention without some help . This bra just did not live up to the hype the other reviewers gave it and i really wanted it to because it is really pretty : -LRB-
 This bra was great except the underwire is not covered enough so it stabs you ALL day . Was very disappointed ... sent 2 back . Also the bra was itchy in cups .
 Remember Madonna 's early 90 's look ? Not very flattering . I felt like I had ice cream cones on ! I will be returning this product .
 While this bra offers support it 's seems cause so much irritation and the top of the under wire on both sides rubs against the skin a lot causing tons of soreness and redness . I was fitted by a bra boutique as well so improper size is n't the issue .
 I 'd love the bra if only it had fit . I bought an 38F , which should be my size . This lovely bra fit in the back . The lift is great . I was disappointed to find it way too small in the cup .
 I ordered 2 bras at the same time , one from another brand and this one - both the same size . The other one fit perfectly , this one was about 3 cup sizes too small . I ordered an F cup and probably got a D or maybe DD .
 I have a love and hate relationship with Panache bras . I wear 40hh and there are not alot of bras in my size . I usually wear the Panache Tango plunge but I thought it was the balconette . This bra is cut way too high to be considered a balconette . The bra fit was horrible . It gave my breasts a horrible shape . I would love to describe it for you but it is not normal . The wires under the arm are high but not as high as alot of the Panache bras . The wire between the breasts is as high as a full cup bra and they spread the breasts unnaturally far apart . The cups are awful if you are heavier on the bottom part of your breasts . I have never really seen an extremely large breasted woman who has top fullness . The cups pucker at the top . They do not lay flush with breast . I would definitely not reccomend this bra . If you are looking for something a little sexier and low cut go for the Tango plunge . It is a much better fit .
 This bra is not recommended for those with a a small frame and large chest . I ordered a 28G and it stabbed , did not hold , and hurt my shoulders . After 20 minutes I was in pain and set it back ! Cheap material , scratchy , and overall not able to support a heavy weight !
 I ordered this bra based on the many people who seemed to like it . I was prepared to be shocked if it worked out . Sadly , it was not to be.In fairness , I ordered a bra that was too big , simply because I really did n't know what was going to work . After trying all of the several bras I ordered in some different sizes , I can say that I am probably a 42J -LRB- US measurement -RRB- . Which means I probably needed a 42H in this particular bra.Unlike some of the other underwires I ordered , this one hits my ribcage in a strange way that is not especially comfortable . The wires are also not as protected by a band or very much cushioning.The straps are useless . This bra is made as though it 's for a linebacker . Whatever frame they modeled it on had huge very wide shoulders . I predict on many women the straps will slide off constantly . I 'm a medium to large frame , my shoulders from point to point across my back are about 18 inches , and this bra 's straps want to be out there off my shoulders by another inch or two at least.I suspect this bra may run a little bit large , compared to others . The cups are outrageously large , and they are large in places that naturally large women are typically not . The pretty lacy material at the top was flapping around and folding over there was so much of it . Obviously the bra is made for women that have much of the breast tissue on top , rather than underneath . It might be a good bra for any woman who has had an enlargement , since the breast is usually fuller on top afterwards.This bra seems a little more cheaply designed than the other bras I purchased . The material seems a bit more flimsy.Overall it is not a bra I would order again . I wo n't return it , but it wo n't be a bra I wear often . It will probably be my laundry day bra .
 Out of all the bras I ordered size 32F , this is the only one that actually fit . Unfortunately , the look was totally unflattering . It made my chest look like two squished cones . Had to return .
 This is a pretty and well made bra but definately not true to sizing . Many bra makers make `` fashion '' bras it seems and they have some kind of formula for anything over a C cup . Well , they do n't work . I 'm average-to-small build but with natural large cup . Did n't even begin to come close to the right cup size . My sister who is 3 cups sizes smaller than me -- fit perfectly ! She looked great in this bra . Bras will say that they are for the larger sizes -LRB- C and up -RRB- but are not . Bali is true to sizing for me , but everyone is different . This one is being returned .
 ok I bought this bra hoping that it would be comfortable and fit perfectly . I 'm a 44f and I was falling out of this bra my breasts are heaving and they just weighed the bra down . When I bent over the wires would jab into my armpits . Also the middle of the bra between my breasts would rub me and it was very uncomfortable .
 Have bought this size bra before from other bra makers -LRB- 34 G -RRB- , but this one was way too small . Extra disappointment on returning it unworn and within one day of receipt and being charged close to $ 20.00 from Amazon for the privilege of ordering this on a special offer plan .
 I bought this bra based on the positive reviews that I read from various sites . The material , style and color are quite lovely . I was excited to try it on . Then my self-esteem fell through the floor
 This used to be a great bra until they changed it and they no longer make it with a molded cup . It 's a nice bra if you 're looking for that style but I 'm an older woman who need help in the support dept with a molded cup !
 Unfortunately I ordered the wrong size and had to return this product . However , had I ordered the right size , I still would have returned it . The description states `` smooth cup '' which I took to mean that it would be discreet , even in cold weather . This was not the case , the cup has thin material and would not hide anything . Although it is a pretty bra , it 's not good to wear under form fitting clothes . : -LRB-
 It gives nice separation . Good fabric . Be careful about sizing . I felt it was a size bigger than other brands . The under wire digs in a lot in the middle . Very uncomfortable .

 I have 9 of these things ! They are roomy and sturdy right up until you need to wash them . After that , they are small and start to fray . I was excited when I first received them , but now I am rather disappointed . It did n't matter if they were dried in the dryer or not . I washed some and hung them to dry and they still shrunk and wrinkled and started to tatter after a couple uses . Then I washed and dried some in the dryer and the result was the same ! I would have to say now that I do not recommend this product .
 I received this item fast , so the shipping works well!But I 'm not sure if this item is authentic.The real kabbalah red string should be made of wool , and this item did n't seem like one .
 This string come from Arkansas it is not a holy string from isreal bought from someone less fourtonate than many people . Its a shame people fall for these hoaxes .
 WARNING . THIS COMPANY IS A JOKE . NO CUSTOMER SERVICE.NO HELP WITH DEFECTIVE MERCHANDISE . STAY AWAY !
 I bit . When the knee socks arrived , I opened the package and found that the upper edge was faux patent leather . Translation
 I ordered this bra based on the many people who seemed to like it . I was prepared to be shocked if it worked out . Sadly , it was not to be.In fairness , I ordered a bra that was too big , simply because I really did n't know what was going to work . After trying all of the several bras I ordered in some different sizes , I can say that I am probably a 42J -LRB- US measurement -RRB- . Which means I probably needed a 42H in this particular bra.Unlike some of the other underwires I ordered , this one hits my ribcage in a strange way that is not especially comfortable . The wires are also not as protected by a band or very much cushioning.The straps are useless . This bra is made as though it 's for a linebacker . Whatever frame they modeled it on had huge very wide shoulders . I predict on many women the straps will slide off constantly .

 I have a love and hate relationship with Panache bras . I wear 40hh and there are not alot of bras in my size . I usually wear the Panache Tango plunge but I thought it was the balconette . This bra is cut way too high to be considered a balconette . The bra fit was horrible . It gave my breasts a horrible shape . I would love to describe it for you but it is not normal . The wires under the arm are high but not as high as alot of the Panache bras . The wire between the breasts is as high as a full cup bra and they spread the breasts unnaturally far apart . The cups are awful if you are heavier on the bottom part of your breasts . I have never really seen an extremely large breasted woman who has top fullness . The cups pucker at the top . They do not lay flush with breast . I would definitely not reccomend this bra . If you are looking for something a little sexier and low cut go for the Tango plunge . It is a much better fit .
 This bra is not recommended for those with a a small frame and large chest . I ordered a 28G and it stabbed , did not hold , and hurt my shoulders . After 20 minutes I was in pain and set it back ! Cheap material , scratchy , and overall not able to support a heavy weight !
 This is a pretty and well made bra but definately not true to sizing . Many bra makers make `` fashion '' bras it seems and they have some kind of formula for anything over a C cup . Well , they do n't work . I 'm average-to-small build but with natural large cup . Did n't even begin to come close to the right cup size .

 I 'd love the bra if only it had fit . I bought an 38F , which should be my size . This lovely bra fit in the back . The lift is great . I was disappointed to find it way too small in the cup .
 I was really hopeful that this bra would fit well and be supportive . I wear a 30F so comfort and support are important to me and also hard to find . The original one that I ordered was tiny . It looked more like a DD , so I went up two cup sizes . The second one I received fit , I suppose . There was no side support and only two clasps in the back . It did not provide a very natural or flattering shape at all . More like a kinda pointy shape with some extra shoved under my arms . Just disappointing . I 've had two children and nursed them both , and besides unless they 're fake a 30F ai n't standing at attention without some help . This bra just did not live up to the hype the other reviewers gave it and i really wanted it to because it is really pretty : -LRB-
 This bra was great except the underwire is not covered enough so it stabs you ALL day . Was very disappointed ... sent 2 back . Also the bra was itchy in cups .
 Remember Madonna 's early 90 's look ? Not very flattering . I felt like I had ice cream cones on ! I will be returning this product .
 While this bra offers support it 's seems cause so much irritation and the top of the under wire on both sides rubs against the skin a lot causing tons of soreness and redness . I was fitted by a bra boutique as well so improper size is n't the issue .
 I ordered 2 bras at the same time , one from another brand and this one - both the same size . The other one fit perfectly , this one was about 3 cup sizes too small . I ordered an F cup and probably got a D or maybe DD .
 First off , they are paper thin . Maybe some people prefer that . Also , they are too short . I have a medium build and am 6 feet tall and no one seems to make a white T-shirt that can tuck into my pants . Furthermore , this shirt requires unreasonable washing requirements considering it 's basically underwear . It requires that you wash it in cold water and dry in low heat and no bleach.On the plus side , there is an attractive polo logo on the bottom of the shirt . I guess that 's why they are a little pricey too .
 The shirts are paper thin , the collar will `` collapse '' after a couple of washes.I like my white undershirts to ride a little higher up , at least closer to my neck , these collars sag down to the top part of my chest .
 I 've now tried twice to order these pants . Both times the orders could n't be fulfilled by the vendor and were canceled .

 I did read the few reviews first but thought wth . It is so hard to find a dressy black vest that does n't look SUPER cheap in the back . I buy most of my work clothes from the junior dept or New York & Co. . At NYC I am typically a size S or XS in dress shirts . So when I ordered the smallest size available -LRB- 6 -RRB- in ths vest I was dispointed that it was so big . It is not tappered at all ! So I will have to pay someone money on top of the $ 32 the vest cost and the $ 12 shipping . After all is said and done this vest will end up costing me at least $ 60 ! This is a very thin , plain , black vest ! I just hope the end result is worth the money .

 Do not buy this sweatshirt if it is really for a tall person . I was upset because this was a gift and Amazon said I would have it before Christmas which I did n't . but when I got it I was so glad it was late . The arms are so short and it shrunk so much when I washed it . I would have been embarrassed if I would have given as my gift .
 I 'm 6 ' 3 &#34; and a big guy so i ordered my pullover hoodie in 4x tall . When it came it was paper thin and the sleeves stop above my wrist . the Gildan hoodies are half the price and better quality . so much for trying to buy a better named product . never again
 The size was okay , not as big as I hoped for and the neck opening was too small . My husband cut the opening to create more room . I 'll know better next time .
 Beware , this item is NOT a zip front hoodie as the item description says . It is a pullover !
 It was too small and instead of returning kept it for my husband still a little snug and too short .
 IT OK BUT ITS NOT LONG ENOUGH I WOULDNT PREFER THIS TO NO ONE EVEN 360 AROUND THE WORLD HA
 My wife got these for me and I said never again . When ordering , she thought they came two pair per box but they did n't . These are a nice product , but you can find them cheaper at retail shops .
 These briefs were not usable since there is no open fly on the front of the brief . The front of the brief is completely sewn together . I had to get rid of these . My money was wasted on these .
 I ordered this for my grandson and was very disappointed to see it still listed for sale although I was told it was out of stock.Amazon ... get on the ball .

 What a badly designed jacket . I was given one as part of a management gift at work and I was shocked . The jacket is all outof proportion , with the arms being extremely large and puffy . also it seems the arms are way to long in comparison to the body of the jacket . The tapered back of the jacket -LRB- there are 2 pleats -RRB- gives the wearer the appearance of a hunch back as well as giving the wearer shoulders that are wider than the rest of the body . The only good thing about this jacket is that your dog would love it as a bed since it is overly bulky . Mind you the jacket is stiffer than Andie MacDowells acting ... Not a good choice of jackets ...

 When i ordered this Item I made sure to double check and make sure I ordered the right item . The listing is decieving because it says pants and shirts , you dont get both your suppose to select top or bottom and size , so you have to make sure you choose corectly which I did . I selected the regular length top and when my order shipped I recieved a pair of pants . The shipper insisted I made the error of ordering the wrong item , which I know for a fact I didnt . Bottom line is the listing is decieving even to the shipper . If you buy any one of these items pants or shirts your just taking a gammble on just that , you will either recieve a pair of pants or a shirt . Poor listing and poor shippment , Waste of time .

They do not lay flush with breast . I would definitely not reccomend this bra . If you are looking for something a little sexier and low cut go for the Tango plunge . It is a much better fit .
 This bra is not recommended for those with a a small frame and large chest . I ordered a 28G and it stabbed , did not hold , and hurt my shoulders . After 20 minutes I was in pain and set it back ! Cheap material , scratchy , and overall not able to support a heavy weight !
 I ordered this bra based on the many people who seemed to like it . I was prepared to be shocked if it worked out . Sadly , it was not to be.In fairness , I ordered a bra that was too big , simply because I really did n't know what was going to work . After trying all of the several bras I ordered in some different sizes , I can say that I am probably a 42J -LRB- US measurement -RRB- . Which means I probably needed a 42H in this particular bra.Unlike some of the other underwires I ordered , this one hits my ribcage in a strange way that is not especially comfortable . The wires are also not as protected by a band or very much cushioning.The straps are useless . This bra is made as though it 's for a linebacker . Whatever frame they modeled it on had huge very wide shoulders . I predict on many women the straps will slide off constantly . I 'm a medium to large frame , my shoulders from point to point across my back are about 18 inches , and this bra 's straps want to be out there off my shoulders by another inch or two at least.I suspect this bra may run a little bit large , compared to others . The cups are outrageously large , and they are large in places that naturally large women are typically not . The pretty lacy material at the top was flapping around and folding over there was so much of it . Obviously the bra is made for women that have much of the breast tissue on top , rather than underneath . It might be a good bra for any woman who has had an enlargement , since the breast is usually fuller on top afterwards.This bra seems a little more cheaply designed than the other bras I purchased . The material seems a bit more flimsy.Overall it is not a bra I would order again . I wo n't return it , but it wo n't be a bra I wear often . It will probably be my laundry day bra .
 Out of all the bras I ordered size 32F , this is the only one that actually fit . Unfortunately , the look was totally unflattering . It made my chest look like two squished cones . Had to return .
 ok I bought this bra hoping that it would be comfortable and fit perfectly . I 'm a 44f and I was falling out of this bra my breasts are heaving and they just weighed the bra down . When I bent over the wires would jab into my armpits . Also the middle of the bra between my breasts would rub me and it was very uncomfortable .
 Have bought this size bra before from other bra makers -LRB- 34 G -RRB- , but this one was way too small . Extra disappointment on returning it unworn and within one day of receipt and being charged close to $ 20.00 from Amazon for the privilege of ordering this on a special offer plan .
 I was really hopeful that this bra would fit well and be supportive . I wear a 30F so comfort and support are important to me and also hard to find . The original one that I ordered was tiny . It looked more like a DD , so I went up two cup sizes . The second one I received fit , I suppose . There was no side support and only two clasps in the back . It did not provide a very natural or flattering shape at all . More like a kinda pointy shape with some extra shoved under my arms . Just disappointing . I 've had two children and nursed them both , and besides unless they 're fake a 30F ai n't standing at attention without some help . This bra just did not live up to the hype the other reviewers gave it and i really wanted it to because it is really pretty : -LRB-
 This bra was great except the underwire is not covered enough so it stabs you ALL day . Was very disappointed ... sent 2 back . Also the bra was itchy in cups .
 Remember Madonna 's early 90 's look ? Not very flattering . I felt like I had ice cream cones on ! I will be returning this product .
 While this bra offers support it 's seems cause so much irritation and the top of the under wire on both sides rubs against the skin a lot causing tons of soreness and redness . I was fitted by a bra boutique as well so improper size is n't the issue .
 I 'd love the bra if only it had fit . I bought an 38F , which should be my size . This lovely bra fit in the back . The lift is great . I was disappointed to find it way too small in the cup .
 I ordered 2 bras at the same time , one from another brand and this one - both the same size . The other one fit perfectly , this one was about 3 cup sizes too small . I ordered an F cup and probably got a D or maybe DD .
 I 've now tried twice to order these pants . Both times the orders could n't be fulfilled by the vendor and were canceled .
 My wife got these for me and I said never again . When ordering , she thought they came two pair per box but they did n't . These are a nice product , but you can find them cheaper at retail shops .
 These briefs were not usable since there is no open fly on the front of the brief . The front of the brief is completely sewn together . I had to get rid of these . My money was wasted on these .
 I was extremely disappointed by this product . I expected it to project large shadows on the wall several feet away . However , the light did n't project more than about two feet , and even then , it was so dim that you could not make out the figures at all . Setting it closer to the wall was no help either ; not only did that make the images EXTREMELY small -LRB- on the order of an inch or two -RRB- , they also had an annoying `` overlap '' that made it seem like you had double vision . I would not recommend this product to anyone .
 I really wanted a shadow lantern similar to the one in the movie Sleepy Hollow . Instead this was all I could find . The price is right but that 's about all to recommend it . First it 's an energy hog . I went through two sets of batteries in 48 hours . The lamp was not bright either . So I tried wiring it to a power supply but the lamps keep burning out . The poor quality reflector and dome distort the images . I 'll use this as a stopgap measure until I can find a more suitable lantern from the movie .
 i thought that this toy would create a beautiful atmosphere for Halloween in a dark room but it 's too dim , you can hardly see the figures . . not worth it
 I 've now tried twice to order these pants . Both times the orders could n't be fulfilled by the vendor and were canceled .
 We bought these last Christmas for my 8 year old daughter and her best friend so that they could communicate with each other without tying up the phone line . 2 miles ? More like 2 feet . The range on these things are horrible . We first tried them out in our house in rooms that are about 20 feet away and it was spotty or unintelligible . Trust me that I was n't expecting a whole lot when I bought these , but there is n't much about them that made it worth the money . The picture quality was so poor -- often the screen was completely black even after adjustments and focusing a flashlight on my daughter 's face to get more light on her ! Needless to say , they were returned . We bought a webcam instead for a lot less money and they can `` see '' and talk to each other that way !
 This is the dumbest toy i 've ever seen.You are better off with a reguler cell phone with clear sound and pictures.This is a waste of time and money.Hope it gets discontiuned .
 My 10 year old daughter received a pair of these for Christmas from her grandparents . They were really fun on Christmas Day and we were able to chat clearly from different parts of the house . That is the extent of the fun that she has gotten out of this toy.Her best friend lives four blocks away and they are unable to contact each other . I tested the distance by going for a walk while she stayed at home and I lost her after going up the street only two blocks!The picture quality is horrible ; it 's best just to use the cute character icons that come loaded with the phone . This was a great concept , but your kids will only use it around the house and maybe on the playground at school , if you let them take it . The 2-mile radius is not a realistic claim for any neighborhood.I do not recommend these to anyone .
 Needless to say , this product is a piece of crap ! Did Hasbro seethe demand for this product and throw the casing together to gettheir money ???? My nine year old received a pair of these ChatNows for Christmas from Santa . This was the main item and most important item she had asked for . When we inserted the batteries , only one worked . Now what ????? We 're from Ontario , Canada and have searched everywhere for these and everyone is completely sold out . We even tried Toysrus in the U.S. . There are none anywhere . But reading all of these reviews , I might just return these to the store and get some money back . Does n't sound to me like I should wait for any stock . Thanks for the advice .
 what a waste of money and a very big disappointment for my grandson does not work
 I have an underprliviledged goddaughter whom I allow to get just about anything she 'd like on birthdays and Christmas . At Thanksgiving she asked for a ChatNow as her Christmas present . After much difficulty locating this item and its accessories , it was a done deal and very happy with myself . This little girl had tears in her eyes as she opened the gift . I got the batteries installed a.s.a.p. . We powered them up and started talking . Communication seemed clear , and they resemble actual cell phones . Both have cameras built-in and take poor pictures or maybe the display on the camera/phone is poor . The text messaging aspect worked ok after the screen contrast was turned up . But then the contrast was too high to view the poor pictures . I guess you could just keep changing the settings . The final disappointment came when she took them home . Hasbro claimed a range of 2 miles . These failed at 3 blocks in a flat semi-rural suburban setting . Her best friend lives 1/2 mile away and this was the entire reason she chose this item . She just wanted to take pictures , do some text messaging , and chat . I guess it does all these things in a quite limited nature.It has many features which explains the cost , and ok if you 're playing with the kid next door .
 I 'm not too surprised to read the other bad reviews on this costly toy . It simply does n't work in any type of residential area . Who did Hasbro think they 'd sell this toy to then ? Many of my daughter 's friends got this and they were all very excited . They all live in a .75 mile area and none of them can chat . We -LRB- the parents -RRB- all made sure they were on the same channel and reread the instruction book to make sure they kids were using it proper -- STILL NOTHING . Such a dissapointment from what I thought was a reputable toy company . I 've e-mailed Hasbro . . wonder if they 'll even bother with responding .
 do not get this toy it does not work , my daughter has ` nt used it once since she got it , she ca n't connect with her friend that only live .8 miles away . We ca n't return it because it comes in a hard plastic box that you have to tear open . Just do yourself a favor and do n't waste $ 70.00 dollars .
 I purchased this toy for my 10yo grandson who had just returned from St.Jude 's Hospital in remission from an arduous battle with leukemia . This was the ONLY thing on his Christmas list for his granddad and I . This was the most disappointing fad since the pet rock . This chid who overcame the odds by withstanding painful tratments for over a year , followed by being uprooted from his home by Hurricaine Katrina leaving behind his friends , and school for the 2nd time in as many yearswithout sheading a tear . Imagine everyone 's heartbreak when he broke down and cried because he was so disappointed . Imagine how his grandfather and I felt when he appologised to us for making us buy this `` piece of crap '' and offered to do chores when he visits this summer to pay us back ! He tried to text his sister with only hit or miss luck . It only worked if the were in the house together . All of their friends received thes things also but they had no luck communicating with each other . The camera took pictures but the color and quality was horible . Nothing about his trash worked the way it was advertised to . I am so angry at the Hasbro company for marketing this junk to the most easily influenced segment of our world 's population . It is truly SHAMEFUL that Hasbro would target preteens , who just want to grow up and have their own cell phone , by selling these pieces of naval lint which are not a good as the old walkie talkies of my day . Two tin cans tied together with a piece of string worked better than this junk ! Hasbro and the con men working in their development and marketing departments owe all of the parents and kids taken in by them a full refund and a heartfelt appology . This appology should be written in every newspaper in every town where anyone purchased this junk . Hasbro WAS one of the few toy manufacturers that I have trusted for years but I will be extremely skeptical of any product they sell in the future . I am hoping for that appology , not for us parents , but for the millions of disappointed kids who have been jaded by Hasbro 's owners and employees . I am truly hoping for that appology BUT I WON , T HOLD MY BREATH !!!!!!!!!!
 I think the phone is BAD because you can only be two miles away.The pictures are green .
 i have n't got this toy yet but i look at the reviews and they say this toy is bad this toy is good well i do n't know if i should get it or not if it is a bad toy or not i have a 75 $ giftcard and my 2 sisters are getting one to and my 1 bro is shareing one with me and i saw that if my 2 sisters are getting one then i could call 1 of them or my bro and we could chat but the thing is that it is only a 2 mile range and i heard that it has some screensavers and alert tones and ringtones and i think that would be cool but the 2 mile range i do n't know if that will work and i do n't know if i take the batteries out all the stuff will be gone if some one could wright a review that would be great i allways chech the reviews out every day so if someone could help me out that would be great and i want the truth if you do thanks : -RRB-
 I wanted this toy so badly for Christmas because i thought it was excactly like a cell phone ! I got it for christmas and I tried calling my friends house with it.It didnt work !!! THen I relized you could only call people with chatnows !!! No one I knew had chat nows because they all had cellphones ! My parents wont let me have a cell . Since it came with two I decided to give one to my friend who lives 4 houses down from me !! It didnt work when I called her . THe connection was bad . Many times I couldnt reach her ! I thought it was going to be awesome because it could take pics . but the pictures were horrible ! Most of them were just a black screen when I took it !!! RIPP OFF !!!
 Umm if you really want this product I thinks its a waste of money even if it is free to talk , but you are only getting 2 miles of range . So I really suggest that you get a prepaid camera phone and it would be cheaper . and if kids do you use alot of minutes on the prepaid just take it off of them , but see how responsible they can be with it unless they are under 8 or 9 then you should just get this . that would be smart . the Camera on this is JUNK ! and its dumb because i dont think you can talk to your friends that have regular walkie-talkies . So therefore its retarded
 What do you think of 2 miles ? What do you think of the very stupid , unclear , green camera ? I know what I think , I think they should go right back to where they started . They need to lower the price ... Dramatically . 70 dollars ?! decrease the size ! It 's huge . And give it 50 miles atleast . This thing is expensive ! For what you get you could get a walkie-talkie for 30 dollars . This does not much more then a walkie talkie and the extras in it are pretty boring considering they do n't work well and there is very few . They need to make it in color . The ideas great , the actual thing is not .
 For everybody that thinks that this awful little toy is ANYTHING like a cell plone , it 's not . It 's a walkie-talkie . These things are very , very bad . when it says `` two mile range '' , what it means is , `` two mile range in a wide open desert with no trees , no buildings , and no people '' . I feel sorry for all of the little kids who are going to get these for christmas , give one to their friend on the other side of town , and find that they do n't work . I know that they are TOYS , but on the commercial , they trick kids into thinking that they are cell phones . Do NOT buy this toy for your kids . Instead , get one of those little kiddie cell phones that you can use to call them with . They will thank you .
 I got a chatnow for christmas along w / my brothers and sister . At first I thought it would n't be that bad . When you try and call someone and you are trying to talk to them , there is a VERY LOUD scratching/breaking up noise in the background and it takes a very long time for the call to `` connect '' even when they are 8 ft. away . Then when you try and take a picture , the color is green and very hard to make out what you 're trying to take a picture of-unlike the crisp clear black and white picture they show you on the chatnow screen . I do n't think that it is a very good product .
 -LRB- ... -RRB- my best friend and i split the cost and bought this toy with our christmas . We had spent hours in front of hasbro.com lokking at the features of it . We thought it would be great . We could talk wenever we wanted . Wen we finally got them we opened them with anticipation . What a disapointment ! the pictures are blurry it dosenot work if you are over a mile apart , it is way bigger then an acual cell phone . IT IS A PIECE OF JUNK . THE TOY IS A PIECE OF JUNK DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY . My friend and i let my mom sell them on ebay . peoplle acual biddid on them . we got payed 200 dollars -LRB- of course we split it -RRB- now i have an acual camera flip cell phone . And with the lef over money we bought a paif of really good walkie talkies with a 50 mile range . Please take my advice . DONT BUY THIS TOY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 I got this for my niece for Christmas this year and I am very dissatisfied with the product itself . She is enjoying the toys which I am very happy about but for the money it cost it is very cheaply made . It does n't recharge you have to buy batteries for it ,4 per hand held . It has misled the children into believing that they can talk to anyone they wish and that is not the case . They can chat with someone that has a chat now with in a 2 mile radius . I just think that the product is very misleading to children .
 I am 10 years old . I really wanted a Chat Now for Christmas . I received them , but when I put batteries in them on Christmas morning , only one worked . Now they are all out of stock , so I can not get a new one .
 We bought this toy for our 8 year old son for Christmas . All his friends in the area -LRB- within 2 miles -RRB- were getting it too . He has been disappointed time and time again . He added all his friends to his buddy list and so far the only one he can talk to lives directly across the street from us . His best friend is two blocks away and is not in range . This toy was a total waste of money and should be named CHAT NEVER !!!
 This phone needs lots , a bigger screen , better pictures , and better reception . PLEASE , 2 miles ?! $ 70 ?! Why . I 'm thinking that adults think kids are n't the greatest ... But , in some ways I see why they think I know why they think that way -LRB- Kids should n't have cellphones -RRB- , please though , put more miles and a better camera in ! I know this is just a toy but I wouls expect this out of a $ 30 product . This product seems nicely glorified but badly organized . I 'll only give an award for the wonderful idea .
 I 've now tried twice to order these pants . Both times the orders could n't be fulfilled by the vendor and were canceled .
 I was disappointed with Hanes womens ankle socks which I expected to be much thicker and durable . One of the threads snagged and came undone after only one wear and the socks do not appear to be holding their shape after one washing .
 My household has been wearing these for years . -LRB- That 's the only reason I felt comfortable buying them over the internet without trying them on , first ; we have always loved these socks . -RRB- BUT the packs I just received are thinner and feel cheaper and less cushiony than the ones we 've bought in the past . When pulling the sock on it feels like my fingers might poke a hole through the fabric.I might even suspect that these were `` fake '' Hanes , but I do n't know anything about product counterfeiting , so I wo n't actually make that accusation.In any case these socks do not feel as comfortable and I suspect they will not be anywhere near as durable as I 'm used to.I gave the product two stars because at least the socks fit my feet !
 I bought these at Christmas time , and by March several had holes in the heel . Not durable - save your money !

 I ordered 2 bras at the same time , one from another brand and this one - both the same size . The other one fit perfectly , this one was about 3 cup sizes too small . I ordered an F cup and probably got a D or maybe DD .
 I have a love and hate relationship with Panache bras . I wear 40hh and there are not alot of bras in my size . I usually wear the Panache Tango plunge but I thought it was the balconette . This bra is cut way too high to be considered a balconette . The bra fit was horrible . It gave my breasts a horrible shape . I would love to describe it for you but it is not normal . The wires under the arm are high but not as high as alot of the Panache bras . The wire between the breasts is as high as a full cup bra and they spread the breasts unnaturally far apart . The cups are awful if you are heavier on the bottom part of your breasts . I have never really seen an extremely large breasted woman who has top fullness . The cups pucker at the top .

 This is a pretty and well made bra but definately not true to sizing . Many bra makers make `` fashion '' bras it seems and they have some kind of formula for anything over a C cup . Well , they do n't work . I 'm average-to-small build but with natural large cup . Did n't even begin to come close to the right cup size . My sister who is 3 cups sizes smaller than me -- fit perfectly ! She looked great in this bra . Bras will say that they are for the larger sizes -LRB- C and up -RRB- but are not . Bali is true to sizing for me , but everyone is different . This one is being returned .
 ok I bought this bra hoping that it would be comfortable and fit perfectly . I 'm a 44f and I was falling out of this bra my breasts are heaving and they just weighed the bra down .

 I usually wear a size 12 to 14 but I have a 38D bra size and often things are too small on top . I ordered a 1X and it was WAY too small for me in the bustline . The info on sizing is totally wrong . It does look cute and the lace is soft though . Sexy looking . Color is great . There is no support in the cups which are smallish , maybe for a B cup . The thong is one size fits all .

 This bra is not recommended for those with a a small frame and large chest . I ordered a 28G and it stabbed , did not hold , and hurt my shoulders . After 20 minutes I was in pain and set it back ! Cheap material , scratchy , and overall not able to support a heavy weight !
 This is a pretty and well made bra but definately not true to sizing . Many bra makers make `` fashion '' bras it seems and they have some kind of formula for anything over a C cup . Well , they do n't work . I 'm average-to-small build but with natural large cup . Did n't even begin to come close to the right cup size . My sister who is 3 cups sizes smaller than me -- fit perfectly ! She looked great in this bra . Bras will say that they are for the larger sizes -LRB- C and up -RRB- but are not . Bali is true to sizing for me , but everyone is different . This one is being returned .
 ok I bought this bra hoping that it would be comfortable and fit perfectly . I 'm a 44f and I was falling out of this bra my breasts are heaving and they just weighed the bra down . When I bent over the wires would jab into my armpits . Also the middle of the bra between my breasts would rub me and it was very uncomfortable .
 Have bought this size bra before from other bra makers -LRB- 34 G -RRB- , but this one was way too small . Extra disappointment on returning it unworn and within one day of receipt and being charged close to $ 20.00 from Amazon for the privilege of ordering this on a special offer plan .
 What a badly designed jacket . I was given one as part of a management gift at work and I was shocked . The jacket is all outof proportion , with the arms being extremely large and puffy . also it seems the arms are way to long in comparison to the body of the jacket . The tapered back of the jacket -LRB- there are 2 pleats -RRB- gives the wearer the appearance of a hunch back as well as giving the wearer shoulders that are wider than the rest of the body . The only good thing about this jacket is that your dog would love it as a bed since it is overly bulky . Mind you the jacket is stiffer than Andie MacDowells acting ... Not a good choice of jackets ...
 The Samsonite Cruisair was expensive for what it is . After several uses , the plastic latch broke . I called Samsonite - they do not have a replacement part that I can buy . I can , however , drive 50 miles to a repair center . Just say no to Samsonite !
 I purchased this suitcase last year , to replace an older samsonite hardside that i had for many years . it finally fell victim to the many flights and rough handling by baggage handlers , so i decided to get the same type . unfortunately samsonit did n't make that type any more , so i got the 29 '' spinner . it 's very cheesily made . the lock are cheap plastic and broke after a few uses . now i have to use a strap to keep it together . they need a better idea .
 We bought two of these suitcases -LRB- shame on us -RRB- because we had previously had great luck with Samsonite . Both of them have broken due to the cheap plastic used in the latches . . We had to haul them 30 miles to get repaired -LRB- with the same cheap latches -RRB- .
 well the buckle sure looks a lot different from the photo ... the quality is not very good & the paint was cracked in the middle so that is not good.I ca n't really yse it now because of the cracked paint?I feel that the manufacturers should send me a fresh piece of better Quality .

 I ordered this bra based on the many people who seemed to like it . I was prepared to be shocked if it worked out . Sadly , it was not to be.In fairness , I ordered a bra that was too big , simply because I really did n't know what was going to work . After trying all of the several bras I ordered in some different sizes , I can say that I am probably a 42J -LRB- US measurement -RRB- . Which means I probably needed a 42H in this particular bra.Unlike some of the other underwires I ordered , this one hits my ribcage in a strange way that is not especially comfortable . The wires are also not as protected by a band or very much cushioning.The straps are useless . This bra is made as though it 's for a linebacker . Whatever frame they modeled it on had huge very wide shoulders . I predict on many women the straps will slide off constantly . I 'm a medium to large frame , my shoulders from point to point across my back are about 18 inches , and this bra 's straps want to be out there off my shoulders by another inch or two at least.I suspect this bra may run a little bit large , compared to others . The cups are outrageously large , and they are large in places that naturally large women are typically not . The pretty lacy material at the top was flapping around and folding over there was so much of it . Obviously the bra is made for women that have much of the breast tissue on top , rather than underneath . It might be a good bra for any woman who has had an enlargement , since the breast is usually fuller on top afterwards.This bra seems a little more cheaply designed than the other bras I purchased . The material seems a bit more flimsy.Overall it is not a bra I would order again . I wo n't return it , but it wo n't be a bra I wear often . It will probably be my laundry day bra .
 Out of all the bras I ordered size 32F , this is the only one that actually fit . Unfortunately , the look was totally unflattering . It made my chest look like two squished cones . Had to return .
 I have a love and hate relationship with Panache bras . I wear 40hh and there are not alot of bras in my size . I usually wear the Panache Tango plunge but I thought it was the balconette . This bra is cut way too high to be considered a balconette . The bra fit was horrible . It gave my breasts a horrible shape . I would love to describe it for you but it is not normal . The wires under the arm are high but not as high as alot of the Panache bras . The wire between the breasts is as high as a full cup bra and they spread the breasts unnaturally far apart . The cups are awful if you are heavier on the bottom part of your breasts . I have never really seen an extremely large breasted woman who has top fullness . The cups pucker at the top .

 I 'd love the bra if only it had fit . I bought an 38F , which should be my size . This lovely bra fit in the back . The lift is great . I was disappointed to find it way too small in the cup .
 I was really hopeful that this bra would fit well and be supportive . I wear a 30F so comfort and support are important to me and also hard to find . The original one that I ordered was tiny . It looked more like a DD , so I went up two cup sizes . The second one I received fit , I suppose . There was no side support and only two clasps in the back . It did not provide a very natural or flattering shape at all . More like a kinda pointy shape with some extra shoved under my arms . Just disappointing . I 've had two children and nursed them both , and besides unless they 're fake a 30F ai n't standing at attention without some help . This bra just did not live up to the hype the other reviewers gave it and i really wanted it to because it is really pretty : -LRB-
 This bra was great except the underwire is not covered enough so it stabs you ALL day . Was very disappointed ... sent 2 back . Also the bra was itchy in cups .
 Remember Madonna 's early 90 's look ? Not very flattering . I felt like I had ice cream cones on ! I will be returning this product .
 While this bra offers support it 's seems cause so much irritation and the top of the under wire on both sides rubs against the skin a lot causing tons of soreness and redness . I was fitted by a bra boutique as well so improper size is n't the issue .
 I ordered 2 bras at the same time , one from another brand and this one - both the same size . The other one fit perfectly , this one was about 3 cup sizes too small . I ordered an F cup and probably got a D or maybe DD .
 I use to have the same type of wallet made by COACH it was very good at securing credit cards and money . This wallet has pockets that are too big . After having my credit cards fall out in my pocket I stopped using it . I would not recommend this wallet to keep credit cards secure . I will try to find another COACH . A complete waste of my Amazon Gift Certificate .

 I bought these for a birthday present and was sadly disappointed -LRB- as was the birthday girl -RRB- They are cut like hospital scrubs and had a very stiff feel to them . The seams were also exposed and rough . They did come in a cute bag according to my wife , but she had me return these as soon as she took them out of the bag .
 It seems to be nice as far as silk goes , but I was surprised about the plain look . It is nothing fancy . It had little pieces of thread that needed to be cut . But it seems to wear and wash well . Also , it can be condensed to a small and light size for travel . The orange color came off onto the sheets !
 they 're a bit smaller than the size chart says . Ca n't return them either ... Guess I better lose some weight . They 're well put together though . I have ordered some XL 's that are really comfortable and durable .

 I received this bag as a gift -LRB- I had put it on my Amazon wishlist -RRB- and it is PERFECT for my needs -LRB- gym bag with enough room for a change of clothes , two small towels , toiletries , hair dryer -RRB- . I like all of the pockets , the size and design . . HOWEVER the bag smells TERRIBLE !!!! It smells so ridiculously musty that I can hardly stand using it . Ugh . I wish it did n't stink so bad and part of me wonders if this is why it was offered at such an incredible discount .
 On the top , U-shaped zipper , one of the two sliders came off after two months use . Otherwise , the bag is a nice size , has nice features , and has sturdy fabric .
 I should have tried it out in the store first . It 's too large for a 5 foot 4 woman and always remember to empty the water bottle before taking it any where . I use it to bring work out gear to and from the office . Once even a third full its uncomfortable to carry the 5-6 blocks to the office.I will probably give it to my 6 foot brother . Its a good heavy bag though - just more serious than I need .
 The Elvis costume I received for my son was terribly damaged . It had loose stitching , frayed braiding , missing beading , and a 2 prong crown belt instead of a 3 prong . I immediately called `` Costume Craze '' about the damaged product and they were extremely rude and unhelpful . They said it would take 2 weeks to get a replacement and that I would be charged for an additional costume until the damaged one was returned . In order to have them expedite me a costume , I would have to pay an additional $ 24 . I could n't believe it ! Last year , I was sent a wrong item from a different company and they fixed the problem within 2 business days without any additional payment or confusion . It was quick and easy . `` Costume Craze '' ... not so much . Then , I had to call 3 different times in order to get a return shipping label . Each time they said it was sent to my email and verified the address , but yet I did n't receive the label until the last day to return the costume . Now I am stuck waiting to see if and when they actually credit my account . I highly recommend you order this costume from another company and do not waste your time or money dealing with `` Costume Craze . ''
 i bought this for going out for clubbing seeing so many great reviews and attracted by the amazing price.first , when i tried on , i thought what i pay is what i get.the design is really sexy and nice , but it was slightly large to me -LRB- 5.3 ' , 108lb -RRB- and the material looks cheap.i thought the material issue may be ok once u get into club in the dark lighten up , but i dont wan na wear it when it is bright outside because it gives me cheap looks . i guess im gon na return this .
 Hate it ! Maybe it is good for wearing at home . . But definitely , you ca n't go out with it . At least not me ; -RRB-

 I have a love and hate relationship with Panache bras . I wear 40hh and there are not alot of bras in my size . I usually wear the Panache Tango plunge but I thought it was the balconette .

The wires under the arm are high but not as high as alot of the Panache bras . The wire between the breasts is as high as a full cup bra and they spread the breasts unnaturally far apart . The cups are awful if you are heavier on the bottom part of your breasts . I have never really seen an extremely large breasted woman who has top fullness . The cups pucker at the top . They do not lay flush with breast . I would definitely not reccomend this bra . If you are looking for something a little sexier and low cut go for the Tango plunge . It is a much better fit .
 This bra is not recommended for those with a a small frame and large chest . I ordered a 28G and it stabbed , did not hold , and hurt my shoulders . After 20 minutes I was in pain and set it back ! Cheap material , scratchy , and overall not able to support a heavy weight !
 I ordered this bra based on the many people who seemed to like it . I was prepared to be shocked if it worked out . Sadly , it was not to be.In fairness , I ordered a bra that was too big , simply because I really did n't know what was going to work . After trying all of the several bras I ordered in some different sizes , I can say that I am probably a 42J -LRB- US measurement -RRB- . Which means I probably needed a 42H in this particular bra.Unlike some of the other underwires I ordered , this one hits my ribcage in a strange way that is not especially comfortable . The wires are also not as protected by a band or very much cushioning.The straps are useless . This bra is made as though it 's for a linebacker . Whatever frame they modeled it on had huge very wide shoulders . I predict on many women the straps will slide off constantly . I 'm a medium to large frame , my shoulders from point to point across my back are about 18 inches , and this bra 's straps want to be out there off my shoulders by another inch or two at least.I suspect this bra may run a little bit large , compared to others . The cups are outrageously large , and they are large in places that naturally large women are typically not . The pretty lacy material at the top was flapping around and folding over there was so much of it . Obviously the bra is made for women that have much of the breast tissue on top , rather than underneath . It might be a good bra for any woman who has had an enlargement , since the breast is usually fuller on top afterwards.This bra seems a little more cheaply designed than the other bras I purchased . The material seems a bit more flimsy.Overall it is not a bra I would order again . I wo n't return it , but it wo n't be a bra I wear often . It will probably be my laundry day bra .

 Remember Madonna 's early 90 's look ? Not very flattering . I felt like I had ice cream cones on ! I will be returning this product .
 While this bra offers support it 's seems cause so much irritation and the top of the under wire on both sides rubs against the skin a lot causing tons of soreness and redness . I was fitted by a bra boutique as well so improper size is n't the issue .
 I 'd love the bra if only it had fit . I bought an 38F , which should be my size . This lovely bra fit in the back . The lift is great . I was disappointed to find it way too small in the cup .
 I ordered 2 bras at the same time , one from another brand and this one - both the same size . The other one fit perfectly , this one was about 3 cup sizes too small . I ordered an F cup and probably got a D or maybe DD .
 Have bought this size bra before from other bra makers -LRB- 34 G -RRB- , but this one was way too small . Extra disappointment on returning it unworn and within one day of receipt and being charged close to $ 20.00 from Amazon for the privilege of ordering this on a special offer plan .
 This is a pretty and well made bra but definately not true to sizing . Many bra makers make `` fashion '' bras it seems and they have some kind of formula for anything over a C cup . Well , they do n't work . I 'm average-to-small build but with natural large cup . Did n't even begin to come close to the right cup size . My sister who is 3 cups sizes smaller than me -- fit perfectly ! She looked great in this bra . Bras will say that they are for the larger sizes -LRB- C and up -RRB- but are not . Bali is true to sizing for me , but everyone is different . This one is being returned .
 I have a love and hate relationship with Panache bras . I wear 40hh and there are not alot of bras in my size . I usually wear the Panache Tango plunge but I thought it was the balconette . This bra is cut way too high to be considered a balconette . The bra fit was horrible . It gave my breasts a horrible shape . I would love to describe it for you but it is not normal . The wires under the arm are high but not as high as alot of the Panache bras . The wire between the breasts is as high as a full cup bra and they spread the breasts unnaturally far apart . The cups are awful if you are heavier on the bottom part of your breasts . I have never really seen an extremely large breasted woman who has top fullness . The cups pucker at the top . They do not lay flush with breast . I would definitely not reccomend this bra . If you are looking for something a little sexier and low cut go for the Tango plunge . It is a much better fit .
 This bra is not recommended for those with a a small frame and large chest . I ordered a 28G and it stabbed , did not hold , and hurt my shoulders . After 20 minutes I was in pain and set it back ! Cheap material , scratchy , and overall not able to support a heavy weight !
 I ordered this bra based on the many people who seemed to like it . I was prepared to be shocked if it worked out . Sadly , it was not to be.In fairness , I ordered a bra that was too big , simply because I really did n't know what was going to work . After trying all of the several bras I ordered in some different sizes , I can say that I am probably a 42J -LRB- US measurement -RRB- . Which means I probably needed a 42H in this particular bra.Unlike some of the other underwires I ordered , this one hits my ribcage in a strange way that is not especially comfortable . The wires are also not as protected by a band or very much cushioning.The straps are useless . This bra is made as though it 's for a linebacker . Whatever frame they modeled it on had huge very wide shoulders . I predict on many women the straps will slide off constantly . I 'm a medium to large frame , my shoulders from point to point across my back are about 18 inches , and this bra 's straps want to be out there off my shoulders by another inch or two at least.I suspect this bra may run a little bit large , compared to others . The cups are outrageously large , and they are large in places that naturally large women are typically not . The pretty lacy material at the top was flapping around and folding over there was so much of it . Obviously the bra is made for women that have much of the breast tissue on top , rather than underneath . It might be a good bra for any woman who has had an enlargement , since the breast is usually fuller on top afterwards.This bra seems a little more cheaply designed than the other bras I purchased . The material seems a bit more flimsy.Overall it is not a bra I would order again . I wo n't return it , but it wo n't be a bra I wear often . It will probably be my laundry day bra .
 Out of all the bras I ordered size 32F , this is the only one that actually fit . Unfortunately , the look was totally unflattering . It made my chest look like two squished cones . Had to return .
 ok I bought this bra hoping that it would be comfortable and fit perfectly . I 'm a 44f and I was falling out of this bra my breasts are heaving and they just weighed the bra down . When I bent over the wires would jab into my armpits . Also the middle of the bra between my breasts would rub me and it was very uncomfortable .
 This jacket was a good price so I decided to try it . But , when I tried it on , I decided it was a little too purple and just not what I was looking for .
 I ordered 26/28 size , and i got that only , but i measured it , it came out 30/32 , and it was too big for me.I have to return the item , also the way it looked nice on site , it is rather dull otherwise ...

 I was really hopeful that this bra would fit well and be supportive . I wear a 30F so comfort and support are important to me and also hard to find . The original one that I ordered was tiny . It looked more like a DD , so I went up two cup sizes . The second one I received fit , I suppose . There was no side support and only two clasps in the back . It did not provide a very natural or flattering shape at all . More like a kinda pointy shape with some extra shoved under my arms . Just disappointing . I 've had two children and nursed them both , and besides unless they 're fake a 30F ai n't standing at attention without some help . This bra just did not live up to the hype the other reviewers gave it and i really wanted it to because it is really pretty : -LRB-

 I 've now tried twice to order these pants . Both times the orders could n't be fulfilled by the vendor and were canceled .
 I did not like to product . This product does not give the breasts a natural smooth shape . I felt like I was wearing my grandmother 's bra .

 I am not excited about these glasses . It was not clear from the description that it was a C5 version , meaning not only the out dated logo but the outdated color as well . And the styling was not what I expected in person . I carry these in the car as a back up pair , but wear them very little .

 I ordered 1 pair - they came and were tapered - I liked them so I ordered another pair . Well the 2nd pair came but were not tapered - baggy type . It 's better to order Levi 521 jeans . Whick I did from Dillards .
 size of the pants is very different from levis ' 1 . i am wearing levis oringnal , w32l32 , but this one , i also chose w32l32 , woo , it ; s too long , and maybe i should wear lee w33 or w34 , the waist is very narrow .2 . relaxed means fat ass , and relaxed legs ` very relaxed ' 3 . after i try it ' i ggave it to my friends ~ ~ PS ` made in mexico ` very thick
 Do n't know why it 's so baggy . It seems slim on the image ' Disappointed because the jeans feels great and durable . Just too baggy on the leg ' Lee 's jeans always feel great , that 's why I choose them . P.S. I choose the right size .
 I ordered the Pepperstone , and they developed two holes at the top of the back pockets . I got good , prompt return service from Amazon , but the replacement jeans developed the same holes after one wearing . Rather than go through Amazon again , I am working with the manufacturer -LRB- Lee Jeans -RRB- to investigate this flaw , as it is obviously not just a one time issue .
 I was surprised by the bad quality of the jeans . But Unfortuntaly I did not discover that until you try it on and you can it return it . I did not recommended even for free .

 i got the lavender pair , and sure , they are cute ... never mind the fact they arrived with tears in the lace along the seam in the front .
 I bought this halter piece as gift for my significant other and as soon as I opened the package the halter was falling apart ! It totally ruined my surprise . The thin mesh like material is barely sewn together . Do n't waste your time and money . I had to give it 1 star .

 the product was very pretty but the zipper was very difficult - had trouble getting it to move up and down - it would stickalso - runs very big - order a size smaller than you think you would beI returned it because of the zipper -
 It 's now a National Label . Fabric is thinner . Quality is no longer there . Really a shame ! The Almost-Identical one I ordered before has the Leisure Life label and is a 5-Star quality . I returned the one with the National label .
 I did n't really like this robe . First of all , the color was very different than shown in the picture . After that , it seemed to run a bit large . I returned it .
 I saw this toy online , and I definitely wan na get one . I really like to do makeovers , but my mom wo n't ever let me give her one - I mean , you can wash it right off ! She just refuses anyway . That 's why I wan na get this toy ; so I can do makeovers by myself ! Doing things like this is an opportunity for me to show my great creativity .
 This item looks creepy - it 's a face sticking out of a container ! I would definitely get a styling HEAD with a body , not a styling FACE in a makeup compact .
 Hello , Seams that every time I try to buy lined jeans the waist sizes are mis marked . If you take a tape measure and measure the waist opening it is 2 inches smaller that the label . I ordered size 312 waist but it measured 30 . Dennis
 This company has the worst customer service I have ever experienced . I ordered a Christmas present from them on Dec. 9 , and by Dec 21 I still had n't received it . I checked my Amazon account to find out my order had been cancelled by the company . When I called to find out , they said someone that lived at my address before me never paid their bill and they refused to ship to my address-even though I had already paid for the jeans ! After a 45 minute phone call -LRB- mostly being put on hold -RRB- , the supervisor was going to reorder them but then told me they were no longer in stock . I was extremely upset to find out 3 days before Christmas , esp . when I ordered them 3 weeks before when they were in stock . So , buyers beware ! You never know if the person that lived in your house before you paid their bill !
 I was looking for more cold weather running gear . I read other reviews on this pant and took a chance . I never got to try them on because they sent me the wrong size . Then when I called to return them they had switched companies . So , I had to return the pants and then reorder from the other company . Not worth the hassle for pants I did n't even like looking at . They were super thin material . Buyer beware ...
 The stitching was defective and left a small area unseamed . Decided to keep them because they are out of stock and for the amount I paid , they are n't bad after a bit of patching up . They do come up to my belly button -LRB- I 'm 5 ' 2 &#34; -RRB- , so the woman modeling them in the picture must be much taller . They also get quite baggy after wearing but return to shape after washing . They do run big but not as bad as most other brands I have tried . I have an x-small , and I weigh 110 lb .

 I was excited when I saw this robe for sale . I 've been looking for one similar to this for ages . The last robe I had like this was purchased quite a few years ago . Unfortunately is very worn . I ordered this new robe , thinking it was the same quality of my old robe . When it arrived , it was in a very small package , not what I was looking for . The material was very thin and not of a good quality . I live in San Francisco and need a warm robe daily . This robe looks nice , but it will not keep you warm .
 The robe is inexpensive and ok for the price . The material was cut the wrong way so it is not soft and smooth to the touch . Not bad workmanship , tho . Suits my purpose .
 The material this robe was made from did not meet my expectations . The robe looked great , but it was not soft nor well made .
 The robe was nasty/awful because it was not warm at all , very thin and picked up so much lint/fuzzies that were impossible to get off of it . Recommend going to LL bean and getting the same lounger that will keep you warm as soon as you put in on . Never returned it , just threw it out.Sincerely , Bridget
 They sent the wrong item , wrong color and wrong size . and was told that they could n't send a replaced by Christmas , unless I pay for overnight . I thought since it was their mistake I shouldnot have to pay anything . Item was returned . Will not recommend this company .
 Material was very flimsy & thin . It would definitely keep me warm on these cold nights we get here in the north . Also , check on return policy before ordering & returning .
 i bought this for my mother for a late xmas present . it is early february and i am returning it . she washed it and every little bit of lint and fuzz stuck to it and she says it is very thin . it is a beautiful shade of green .
 Color was great but if you need warmth , do n't buy this . Polyester is thin and felt like ice on my legs !!!
 For a velour lounger , this fabric feels very thin and cheap . I am very disappointed in the quality . Also the color is much darker than pictured online . I do not think they will hold up very well .
 The material is very thin and flimsy and the nap of the velour goes in the wrong direction thus making it feel rough when you run your hand over the material . I sent the robe back and asked for my money back .
 Whoever labeled this toy as durable either does n't have kids or never took it out of the package ! The green part that sticks out from the base of the axe broke within the first minute out of the package following a small drop right after my son started playing with it . What a big disappointment for my 4 year-old who was already in his green ranger costume . . Nonetheless , pretty soon he engaged back into playing even though the axe was ... injured . Within a few minutes there was another breakage at the end of the base . Instead of returning it , I coated the end of the handle with durable black tape and he was able to play with it much longer without any more accidents . He loves it eventhough it 's being mended twice ! He is a real Power Ranger fan ! I recommend the Disney power ranger toys which are made of compacted foamy plastic instead
 Product is made by Classix , 100 % polyester from Korea1 . Collar is not exact fit as you would be led to assume when ordering , it is an EZ fit collar which is elastic2 . Stitching is poor3 . Cuff is not a true french cuffMight as well get a rental tuxedo shirt as this is what a rental shirt looks like

 Maybe it is just a matter of wrong size , but this bra is too bulky and rigid for me . The two cups are also slightly different in shape . I do n't think I will wear it . I have exactly the same size -LRB- 32E -RRB- of another model from Fantasie and it is perfect .
 I just double checked the style number now to make sure I had the right bra because I ca n't believe all of the positive reviews . I am a 34DDD in nearly every size but apparently I am not in this one . I had muffin tops where my boobs were overflowing the cups and the straps were thin and very elasticy . I ca n't imagine feeling support even if I bought a cup size up . If felt like most Victoria Secret bra 's for me where I have to re-adjust the straps three times a day because the metal thing keeps sliding down . I am glad it is doing it 's job for so many other women out there but sadly it did not work for me .
 The bra itself is a lovely material , appears well made , etc. . However , once it 's on , it 's stiff and uncomfortable and creates an awkward pointy profile typically seen in the 60 's . I returned it and got a swift refund .
 I had high hopes for this bra as it has received awards , but I found the cups to make me look very unnatural . They seem to actually `` point '' out and to the right . Not like Madonna , but not what I expected either .
 I bought this t-shirt for my son on impulse , and I am sorry I did . The graphic is not only fuzzy , but the black on the smile actually ran into the yellow , like a bad magic marker drawing . I could have made the same shirt at home with an iron and ink jet iron on transfer material and it would have looked nicer . Save your money !
 This is not a smooth cup bra . I got the natural color . Lighter and pinker than usual . The seams make weird divots all over the front that show under t-shirts and it is n't because it is too big . It fits well , the underwire is lower under the arms . Fantasie is good for short torso women . The material is very scratchy and uncomfortable . Underwire is very stiff . The straps are thin , scratchy and dig . I was very surprised at how uncomfortable it is because Fantasie t-shirt bras are the only ones I wear . I tried to branch out with this one .

 There was another brand that I used over and over for two years and I was hoping these would work the same . They do n't . They feel nice but who 's really feelin them ?! They are so heavy , they just weigh your breasts down . Not exactly what a women needs !! I wish I could find the fabric ones that I once had : -LRB-

 I got this for my 3 year old and the size was fine but the dress was extremely uncomfortable . It is a very thin piece of rough fabric with a piece of felt underneath . The wig looks nothing like the wig in the picture , it is also very cheaply made and my daughter would n't even wear it . I could n't believe it had a nick jr tag on it and it was so cheap . I would stay away from this product or you will definitely have buyer 's remorse .

 This purse and watch is made of inferior , cheap material . The scarf is so short it can barely fit around the neck . This must have been designed for a child as this purse is not big enough to hold a pair of glasses . I regretted ever buying this .

 The way this ad is presented , it appears that you are getting all the scarves - 5 in total . But the price is per scarf . I may have chosen a different one than one received had I knew what I was ordering . They should state that the price is for only ONE scarf . For that reason , I gave 2 stars . The actual scarf is OK . Not crazy about the fabric .

 Hello , Seams that every time I try to buy lined jeans the waist sizes are mis marked . If you take a tape measure and measure the waist opening it is 2 inches smaller that the label . I ordered size 312 waist but it measured 30 . Dennis
 This company has the worst customer service I have ever experienced . I ordered a Christmas present from them on Dec. 9 , and by Dec 21 I still had n't received it . I checked my Amazon account to find out my order had been cancelled by the company . When I called to find out , they said someone that lived at my address before me never paid their bill and they refused to ship to my address-even though I had already paid for the jeans ! After a 45 minute phone call -LRB- mostly being put on hold -RRB- , the supervisor was going to reorder them but then told me they were no longer in stock . I was extremely upset to find out 3 days before Christmas , esp . when I ordered them 3 weeks before when they were in stock . So , buyers beware ! You never know if the person that lived in your house before you paid their bill !

 I was looking for more cold weather running gear . I read other reviews on this pant and took a chance . I never got to try them on because they sent me the wrong size . Then when I called to return them they had switched companies . So , I had to return the pants and then reorder from the other company . Not worth the hassle for pants I did n't even like looking at . They were super thin material . Buyer beware ...
 The stitching was defective and left a small area unseamed . Decided to keep them because they are out of stock and for the amount I paid , they are n't bad after a bit of patching up . They do come up to my belly button -LRB- I 'm 5 ' 2 &#34; -RRB- , so the woman modeling them in the picture must be much taller . They also get quite baggy after wearing but return to shape after washing . They do run big but not as bad as most other brands I have tried . I have an x-small , and I weigh 110 lb .

 Unless your belly is as flat as a board , this shirt will feature however much projects outward to the world as though it were on stage and illuminated by a spotlight . The curved bottom line of the top colored section affords the look of a late-term pregnancy.If you 're OK with such a presentation , then this may be the shirt for you ! ...
 Other Carhartt Jeans of same type and color were perfect . This pair had uneven coloring and a larage dark blue area in the zipper area were it really shows . I kept them , I should have sent them back .
 Not made in USA ... Not measuring the same as a pair I own . Carhartt I am deeply ashamed !!!!!!!
 First I purchased these a few weeks ago . Nice looking heavy built jean . NOT SO ! These are tapered leg which makes them fitt like skinny jeans !!! Tight at the knee , calf , and butt . These have lasted I think about 3 weeks which would equal about 3 or 4 washings . I noticed today that they are already tearing at the pocket . I am a slender guy with no butt so there should be no reason that these are tearing at the corner of the pocket from stress . They do fit a size smaller after you wash them so order a size larger in the waist ! Especially since you ca n't return after you wash them ! I would not recommend these jeans . I have 2 pair of them and I am glad I purchased the 3 other pairs in relaxed fit . They still fit a little tight around the waist after washing so I would suggest you get a size larger in those too .
 Then buy these jeans . They did n't add that they were tapered in the description . Just traditional fit . Had to cut them to fit over my work boots . Ca n't send them back , cuz I 'm in Afghanistan .
 The title says traditional fit , but when I tried the jeans , the have bell bottom legs . I wanted the normal cut around the ankle , not bell bottoms .
 Bought -LRB- 3 -RRB- pair of carhartt jeans from Amazon and they will not stay zipped . I emailed Carhartt to let them know and got no reply from them . These jeans are unusable and I lost $ 80.00 dollars .
 The zipper on the jeans I received was defective and would not zip up or down . They also seemed to fit smaller than the size they were labeled to be . I had to return them .

 We bought several of these velcro hair pieces for our girl and we are not impressed with them at all . They do n't stay on the hair . If you take too much hair , the velcro wo n't close up and if you do n't take enough hair they are too loose so they do n't stay on either . Very difficult to work with .

 This hoodie has a mini-plastic zipper that lasted for about two months after my purchase . At that time the zipper kept separating after being zipped up . Recently -LRB- seven months after purchase -RRB- the zipper completely disintegrated from the hoodie , making it useless . I 'd return it if i could but the one-month return window has past . Easy to see why the return window is one month .
 Was this item a knockoff or a second ? No sewen in tag or label , no fiber content label . The name cuddleduds was stamped on the inside at the back in black ink . The next 2 or 3 lines were smeared and not readable . They do not fit as comfortably as my other cuddle duds . The packaging was not labeled only a code number and the words wash in cold water .
 I purchased one of this bikinis a couple of years ago and it lasted about 4 years before it turned into a transparent suit.I ordered 2 suits through amazon.com , but to my surprise the size 34 that I ordered in reallity is a size 28 , which makes it very unconfortable to wear . So becareful when ordering . Look at the manufacturer 's sizing list -LRB- VERY SMALL LETTERS -RRB- to find the right size . By the way , I had to pay to return these items because I did not read the manufaturer 's sizing chart . Not a happy camper .
 I joined our school 's Shakespeare club last year and needed a costume to fit the time period . I chose this product because , in the picture , it appears to be a grayish navy color . When I pulled it out of the package on the day of its arrival it was an ugly bright blue . And i mean bright . it was also cheaply made of that horrible fake velvet and was incredibly itchy . As for the head piece , it was completely flat and i had to stuff it with tissues to get it to look the way i wanted . I could have made a better costume for less money .
 This costume photos well , but that is the extent of my positive comments . The costume is made very cheaply . I 'm not sure what type of fabric the white part of the costume is made of , but it felt like cardboard . We ordered this costume specially for my daughter to wear on Halloween . While getting my daughter dressed , the sleeves on the gown started to literally tear off . The gold trimming on the gown also started to unravel . Also , the headpiece is a piece of cardboard with fabric wrapped around it . It laid completely flat on her head . A complete waste of money for me and a total disappointment for my daughter . This was a one-time wear costume .
 I was looking for something to offer more modesty when wearing a swimsuit and thought these would help . They are OK but not quite what I was looking for because the folds in the edges show through the fabric .
 Rib Caps are fine as long as they stay on the head . The problem occurred when the conditions were heavy snow and the Ribcap became very wet . I crashed twice and the Ribcap fell off both times . Not only did the Ribcap not protect at all as it flew off , I then had to retrieve the Ribcap from down the slope.Some Ribcaps have ties to secure them but I feel that the non secured Caps are very dangerous as they expand when wet and give a false illusion of protection.I believe that these products should be withdrawn immediately before someone seriously hurts themselves .

 Looked Like a piece of crumpled acrylic fabric . I returned it immediately , and to add insult to injury , would you believe that I had to pay to return it ? I am an `` active/avid '' on-line shopper , and I can honestly say that this has been my most expensive , and disappointing experience . I bought it to give as a christmas gift , but it would have been insulting to give it to anyone . I would not reccommend it to any one - even if it were for free .
 Over-price for what you get . Started fraying after wearing a dozen times . Wanted to return and seller gives you only 7 days to return and charges a 15 % restocking fee .
 I was very excited to get no run pantyhose but these are the worst . The first time I wore a pair of the pantyhose I noticed they did n't feel snug - totally the opposite of control top . I was n't looking for control top but I still appreciate a pair of pantyhose that cling . I washed the pair and wore them a second time around and noticed they were baggy on my knees and ankles . They are like a throwback to pantyhose from 25 years ago before spandex . Totally embarrassing and uncomfortable since so baggy . I am throwing out the rest of my 6 pack .
 Dockers are Dockers , so that 's not the problem . Just be sure you do n't trust the images if you choose to buy these via Amazon . `` Cafe , '' for example , should be `` Coffee . '' Despite the fact that the image for `` Cafe '' shows a stone or very light gray color , `` Cafe '' is actually dark brown . So the product is n't defective , but IS misleading
 I have worn these pants for years ; my size is the same as always . I could n't get them on ; they were so tight I could n't get the button buttoned around the waist . What is going on ? These pants seemed to be cut for a skinny 25 year old , not someone who is a little on the hefty side . Further , the shipping and handling charges are just out of sight ... $ 16.95 above and beyond the already rather pricy product . I would not recommend doing business with this seller at all . You can go to other outlets and get the same thing without the shipping and handling , and there are `` deals '' out there from major store chains . I was really disappointed in this product and the seller . Go to WalMart and get their khakis ; they are very inexpensive and wear like iron .
 I have bought dockers for years but these are cut smaller than they usually are . Even with the `` stretch '' waist band they are tight . So much for an `` extra '' inch . Beware . Try these in a store before you buy .
 I DID NOT GET THE SLACK THAT HAD THE WAISTBAND . I GOT SLACK WITH NO WAISTBAND , SO I SEND THEM BACK AN WAS TRYING TO GE A 42 29 BUT I RECEIVED A E MAIL STATETING THAT THE PRODUCT WAS NO LONGER AVABILITY . SO FAR I ` AM NOT SURE WERE MY REFUND WENT . PLEASE LET ME KNOW.TOM ATKINSON
 I agree , these are cut small ... Buy an inch or two larger than you normally do . The waist band does NOT stretch .
 I got the shippment quickly . But wrong items was sent . I have to return it to the seller . I got the refund pretty quick , but only for the value of product . I spent about & 10 for two way shipping without geting anything .
 Did not like the pants at all , and threw them in the trash rather than pay return postage . Flimsy , smelled of dye , cheap fabric , etc. . Too bad .
 Merchant was out of stock on the second pair of pants , so when it was shipped I was charged $ 9 again when the second pair was in stock weeks later.Will not buy from Amazon vendors again .

 Dockers are Dockers , so that 's not the problem . Just be sure you do n't trust the images if you choose to buy these via Amazon . `` Cafe , '' for example , should be `` Coffee . '' Despite the fact that the image for `` Cafe '' shows a stone or very light gray color , `` Cafe '' is actually dark brown . So the product is n't defective , but IS misleading
 I have worn these pants for years ; my size is the same as always . I could n't get them on ; they were so tight I could n't get the button buttoned around the waist . What is going on ? These pants seemed to be cut for a skinny 25 year old , not someone who is a little on the hefty side . Further , the shipping and handling charges are just out of sight ... $ 16.95 above and beyond the already rather pricy product . I would not recommend doing business with this seller at all . You can go to other outlets and get the same thing without the shipping and handling , and there are `` deals '' out there from major store chains . I was really disappointed in this product and the seller . Go to WalMart and get their khakis ; they are very inexpensive and wear like iron .
 The title says traditional fit , but when I tried the jeans , the have bell bottom legs . I wanted the normal cut around the ankle , not bell bottoms .
 Bought -LRB- 3 -RRB- pair of carhartt jeans from Amazon and they will not stay zipped . I emailed Carhartt to let them know and got no reply from them . These jeans are unusable and I lost $ 80.00 dollars .
 Not made in USA ... Not measuring the same as a pair I own . Carhartt I am deeply ashamed !!!!!!!
 First I purchased these a few weeks ago . Nice looking heavy built jean . NOT SO ! These are tapered leg which makes them fitt like skinny jeans !!! Tight at the knee , calf , and butt . These have lasted I think about 3 weeks which would equal about 3 or 4 washings . I noticed today that they are already tearing at the pocket . I am a slender guy with no butt so there should be no reason that these are tearing at the corner of the pocket from stress . They do fit a size smaller after you wash them so order a size larger in the waist ! Especially since you ca n't return after you wash them ! I would not recommend these jeans . I have 2 pair of them and I am glad I purchased the 3 other pairs in relaxed fit . They still fit a little tight around the waist after washing so I would suggest you get a size larger in those too .
 Then buy these jeans . They did n't add that they were tapered in the description . Just traditional fit . Had to cut them to fit over my work boots . Ca n't send them back , cuz I 'm in Afghanistan .
 The zipper on the jeans I received was defective and would not zip up or down . They also seemed to fit smaller than the size they were labeled to be . I had to return them .
 Other Carhartt Jeans of same type and color were perfect . This pair had uneven coloring and a larage dark blue area in the zipper area were it really shows . I kept them , I should have sent them back .
 I purchased one of this bikinis a couple of years ago and it lasted about 4 years before it turned into a transparent suit.I ordered 2 suits through amazon.com , but to my surprise the size 34 that I ordered in reallity is a size 28 , which makes it very unconfortable to wear . So becareful when ordering . Look at the manufacturer 's sizing list -LRB- VERY SMALL LETTERS -RRB- to find the right size . By the way , I had to pay to return these items because I did not read the manufaturer 's sizing chart . Not a happy camper .
 When the rifle arrived , the wood stock was broken in two because of the complete lack of padding in the package -LRB- the box was WAY to big for the rifle -RRB- . Then when I tried to return it , the Amazon web site said it had no record of ANY orders with them . I WILL NEVER ORDER THROUGH AMAZON AGAIN !
 For the cost , an extremely flimsy proposition . I have worn three of these panty hoses and each has unfailingly developed a run on the first day of wear .
 These stockings ran almost immediately upon putting on . I pull then up and they fit well . I took a few steps and felt the run . It was really disappointing since I live overseas and getting the right color is difficult . I think they may have been dry rot .
 I recently purchased these at a department store . They were cheaper than another type of Hanes pantyhose . I can see why that is . They are incredibly rough and feel like sandpaper on my legs.I would have given them no stars if I could .
 I just received these hosiery and they suck . i bought them becauseof the reviwes , they were good , but what kind of people would ever wearsuch a thing and say that 's great ??? -LRB- i guess ur all fake -RRB- very dissapointed !
 I received the trousers in a timely manner . They were what i expected although they did not fit . I returned them a month ago and have not heard a word from the company .

 I found out about this company on TV and thought it was a cool gag gift for a bachelor party . But after placing my order well in advance , I received absolutely no response from the company . After repeated emails and calls over the course of several WEEKS , I finally asked for a refund . When I finally got a response , the person agreed but never followed through with the refund.I 'm sure they get it right once in a while . But they could not have gotten it more wrong with my order . There are many other mullet wig vendors out there . I 'd rather work with someone that valued my business .

 I ordered these hoping that I 'd have some great new silk pajamas to replace mine that had worn out . Let me tell you , if you 're a small person like I am these are not at all for you . You will be completely drowning in them . I looked like I was 5 years old and playing dress up in my mother 's clothing ; the small is not at all small ... I was highly disappointed .
 What a ripoff.They look very nice but maybe you should n't wear them?I bought them for my girlfriend.She wore them a few times over a few months . When I asked her why shestopped wearing them , she said `` I 'm afraid to wear them because the seams are comingapart '' . She never washed them . They do n't fit her tight.When I spoke to Amazon several months after I bought them , they said `` speak to Intimo '' . We called Intimo several times and left messages . When I sent them an email , theyquickly responded `` we spoke to you already -LRB- ? -RRB- , speak to Amazon '' . Amazon seems to willing to dovery little . If I bought this at a department store , I would n't have a problem -LRB- even after 4 months -RRB- . Caveat emporer.Unfortunately the 90 day return policy on american express purchase protection already expired . -LSB- update -- Amazon is accepting a return after much haggling.I looked at them last night and its not the seems butthe actual material is coming apart -- like a worn elbow of a flannel shirt -RSB- . marty
 These pajamas fit poorly and the quality is poor for the price . I have owned several pairs of silk pajamas and they all washed well and were not wrinkly . These look horrible after one washing . I would not recommend these pajamas .

 When I recieved it , it was nothing like on the picture , meaning that there it is not brown around the neck and the arms which would have given it a cool `` baseball '' look shirt.it 's just the print , with a strange `` skin like '' color that do n't look good at all.It looks cheap.Dissapointed !!

 I ordered two in Cowboy Slim Cut 33x34 . I already had some Wranglers . The waist was way too small , the fly was off to my left in a really weird and very ugly and uncomfortable way . These were made in Mexico , just like the ones I bought at Target , but the badging was different , a rubber badge on the back right pocket , not the thin leather Wrangler badge at the rear right waist . Were these knock-offs ? Not sure . Returned them and went to Target where I got two pair for $ 15.99 each -LRB- they were Original and Legendary Gold , not Cowboy , but still , half the price , pard -RRB- !

 I bought a pair last year , which was early style -LRB- made in Italy -RRB- , it was awsome ! some how I broke the frame . So I ordered this one from UVEX sport , they described it as made in Italy , but actually made in China . The quality was awful ! It slips and the lense had some optical problem . I was forced to returned it after one day . so I glued my old one back and use it as it , and It still works GREAT ! All I can say is `` OVER PRICE KNOCK OFF , ''

 Although the seller was prompt to respond to my inquiry about this item , and to issue a refund for the purchase , the images presented are very misleading . When I first clicked on the image of the Dooney , I say this nice tobacco clored draw string handbag , purched on a beautiful white leather chair . When I clicked to order I did not notice three maybe four other smaller images of an older navy blue and tan handbag next to the tobacco handbag image . Upon closer observation , it dawned on me that maybe since the price of the item was $ 59.00 , I was not getting the tobacco , but the navy . True enough it was the navy . I was very disappointed . Agan , the images that are shown are very misleading .

 I love the way that these jeans fit , one of the more comfortable pairs of jeans . So why might you ask am I giving these jeans such a low rating . . The last 5 pairs of these jeans that I have bought have ripped within 5 times of wearing them and two of the pairs ripped down the back within 2 months of purchasing them . I take good care of my clothes and have not had any issues with other brands but recently they have started using cheaper thinner fabric on these jeans . . I unfortunately am going to have to switch to a different brand due to the lack of quality . If the price was less then I might expect it but these are marketed as the more premium line yet the use the cheaper fabric.Save yourself the money on these , If the fabric is thin and feels cheap that probably means that it is !
 I have returned these for a new pair too many times . Belt loops pulling off , wear holes in the legs , everything happened within a couple weeks of receipt . My last pair is being returned , and I will NOT be getting a replacement
 I have been wearing Silvertab jeans almost exclusively for I believe 15 + years because they fit my legs the best . I was disappointed when I discovered that Levi was no longer making them . I 've tried several lower/mid priced jeans and all of them were too tight for my liking around my hamstrings and quads , including the Levi 569 Loose line . I was surprised to find that the Lee Dungarees Loose Fit Carpenter Jeans have come the closest to fitting how I like them . They are n't a perfect replacement but they are certainly the most comfortable jeans I have come across that are within the price range I feel comfortable paying for some jeans . The only question I have is how durable they will be but time will tell.Update : Roughly 3 months later and I can already say that the durability of these are pretty horrible . Multiple holes have worn into the jeans and bumping into a wooden table at work has left me with a pretty embarrassing hole to try to conceal through the end of the day .

 I purchased one of this bikinis a couple of years ago and it lasted about 4 years before it turned into a transparent suit.I ordered 2 suits through amazon.com , but to my surprise the size 34 that I ordered in reallity is a size 28 , which makes it very unconfortable to wear . So becareful when ordering . Look at the manufacturer 's sizing list -LRB- VERY SMALL LETTERS -RRB- to find the right size . By the way , I had to pay to return these items because I did not read the manufaturer 's sizing chart . Not a happy camper .
 I 'd been searching for a sturdy , hooded , pullover windbreaker with a kangaroo pocket since Jan 2008 . April 2011 I finally found this one . It 's soooo close to perfect that it pains me to say that I ca n't recommend it because it does n't breathe * at all * . It makes me sweat more than I normally would because it does n't breathe and it leaves me and my clothes wet after even short bicycle rides . If the manufacturer changed the material to one that breathes it would be perfect . But as is , it 's very unpleasant . The hunt remains on ...

 My son wanted these jeans so I ordered them for him . When he wore them he said the material is too stiff and they wore out between the legs on about the fourth time he wore them . He was so upset he threw them out and said he will never use dickies again .
 These jeans run very tight through the seat and front . I have well over a dozen pants of identical size -LRB- various brands and styles , some also Dickies -RRB- , and most all of them will fall off me without a belt . I 'm tall and lanky . In these pants , I struggle to get a phone or keys out of the front pockets , and sitting down it 's impossible . Seeing as how these are active work pants , it only makes things more difficult and I avoid wearing them . It 's a shame because they 're fairly robust and look decent .
 These did not fit like my other jeans . I bought 36 x 34 and these are 2-3 &#34; longer . They measure about the same inseam as my other ones -LRB- 34 &#34; -RRB- , but when compared them from the waistband down is where I find the huge difference . I was planning to send them back , but they asked me to pay for shipping to return them . I will just wear them to work around the house . I certainly do not recommend these as a replacement for your regular jeans unless you already realize the fit of these are very different . I will try to upload a picture so you can see what I mean .

 For a Big Man 's product the cut is terrible . Having read that was the case in another review I played safe and ordered two sizes.Neither fit ! Hopefully I 'll lose weight and make use of them in the future but considering my present needs they were a waste of money .

Seeing as how these are active work pants , it only makes things more difficult and I avoid wearing them . It 's a shame because they 're fairly robust and look decent .

 My son wanted these jeans so I ordered them for him . When he wore them he said the material is too stiff and they wore out between the legs on about the fourth time he wore them . He was so upset he threw them out and said he will never use dickies again .
 The dimensions for this product are very important . I did not see that this is not actually a real size head in a jar . The head is actually 1/4 the size of a regular head . The head in the jar is all smashed as well and looks like it was done so to fit in the jar . I would have been better off buying a head and pickle jar and making this myself . There is a reason the price was cheaper than the rest .
 I did not like this product . It was not long enough for my body length , so i was trying to pull up the top for the bra the whole time I was wearing it . The under wire for the bra went halfway down my rib cage . Eventually I just had to undo the bottom and let it slide up my torso so the bra would fit right . In the future I will chose a different style shaper that is made for a normal length torso .
 The second i got this in the mail i tore open the package and tried it on . Took a while to pull it up to try to reach my breasts . The item could be a bit longer in the torso . it seams to pull my breasts down . Hugs the rest of my body nice for my current body shape but gives me granny boobies . I wanted to get this item simply because I wanted a strapless firmer . I am heavier in my upper body than in my lower and hard to find a firmer for the upper body that doesnt flatten the breasts -LRB- small breasts sadly -RRB- . I am going to try to return this but like a dumby i took the tag off .
 I 've been wearing body shapers for years . The Spanx and Lipo in a Box are OK , but too jiggly in the bust . I hoped I 'd get a firmer control at a lower price with this . Yikes . My breasts looked like they were being served up on the half shell . The extra firm control means the mid torso area has several layers of fabric , unbreathing , hot as hell . This thing offered not nearly enough slimming to justify all that fabric . Finally , I needed a pit crew to help get the thing pulled on and up . Yeah , yeah , yeah , but did I look better in my clothes ???? Not any better than the Spanx . This item got filed under `` R '' for `` RETURN . ''
 I ordered this briefer to wear under a bridesmaids dress . It was the most uncomfortable 8 hours of my life . I could have lived with the discomfort if wearing this contraption gave me a sleek look . I do n't think it made any difference at all . The bra cups felt more like a shelf than a cup . I could have worn just a strapless bra and achieved the same look with more comfort .
 This headband fell apart the second day we had it . Definitely NOT worth the money . It 's cute , but wo n't last .
 Since I live overseas , returns/exchanges are next to impossible . So when I received this headband/tiara with a strip of plastic around it that can not be removed without ruining the headband , I was VERY disappointed ! I am assuming it is a problem with just `` mine '' that I received and not a problem in general since the reviews I read before ordering this item were positive . If you , however , receive your headband with a strip of plastic in the front between the sequins and the headband , do not try to cut it off or remove it as it will loosen the sequins and ruin the `` full effect '' of it -LRB- and if like my 4 year old daughter , totally depress her ! -RRB-

 For a Big Man 's product the cut is terrible . Having read that was the case in another review I played safe and ordered two sizes.Neither fit ! Hopefully I 'll lose weight and make use of them in the future but considering my present needs they were a waste of money .
 These did not fit like my other jeans . I bought 36 x 34 and these are 2-3 &#34; longer . They measure about the same inseam as my other ones -LRB- 34 &#34; -RRB- , but when compared them from the waistband down is where I find the huge difference . I was planning to send them back , but they asked me to pay for shipping to return them . I will just wear them to work around the house . I certainly do not recommend these as a replacement for your regular jeans unless you already realize the fit of these are very different . I will try to upload a picture so you can see what I mean .

 I did n't like this shirt . Sent it back . Too puffy - like puffy paint - really rubbery and not attractive
 I agree with the other review 100 % . It was puffy and painted . Unlike them I kept it and after a few washes the wings became cracked and the paint fell off . Terrible product . Aerosmith rocks though ! : D
 So I ordered this costume just a few days ago to get prepared for this years trick or treat . Costume arrived very quickly and I had no problems with the company , at least not yet . Down side is the wings are clearly not the ones that are in the picture . You can look at the edge of the wings a see that the ones pictured are significantly larger . The wings pictured also curve more and come to points , giving it that bat wing look . The wings that come with the costume look like purple and black butterfly wings . The remainder of the costume is identical to what you see in the image . Disappointing considering the thing that makes this costume appear so adorable are the wings . The other problem is the head piece fits me , and this is supposed to be for a 0 to 6 months child . Glad I ordered this early as there is plenty of time to make my own set of bat wings , find a different costume or return this P.O.S.
 On 10/12/09 I ordered a childs costume from brands on sale , when I called on oct 28th -LRB- still had not received order -RRB- I was on hold for over 45 minutes !!!!!!! I then called back & pushed 1 for placing an order and what do you know , they answered right away !!! I told them I had already placed an order and would not wait any longer to find out where my order was , they placed my call with costumer service and all they could tell me was that my order still had not shipped and did ` nt know why , told them I wanted to cancel order , they stated someone would call me back and give me a confirmation # , 2 days later no call , I called back & they said my order had been cancelled . I informed them that this was the worst shopping experience i had ever had and that they should not be in business & did not understand how they could be . On they 're reviews they have some good reviews but I would ` nt doubt that they have someone putting these up for their company . I do not write this type of review unless it is deserved , this is very deserved !!!!
 I order halloween costume for my newburn on 30 September.Right now , first November , I still not reseive my purchase.I reagret , that I purchase from this company.On my son 's first halloween , he was without costume ...
 As the other most recent reviewer stated , the bat wings are nothing like the picture . They are the wings from this other costume : Baby Bat Halloween Costume Bunting NEWBORN-6 MOS.which only cost $ 10 as opposed to the $ 30 I paid for the costume I was supposed to receive . The head piece fits my husband so how it is supposed to fit our 3 month old baby eludes me . Old reviews from previous years say the wings are stiff ; apparently they are using a different model of the costume this year and mixing it with the soft , floppy , round , light purple wings from the cheap costume . I am returning it ; too bad I do n't get a refund for my expedited shipping .

 I ordered these to go with my word girl costume -LRB- I 'm a 36 year old woman -RRB- , and the fingers were all very random lengths , which might work if you were an alien or something ; the gloves were just cheap and weird.Not worth the $ $ , wish they had no stars. : /
 I am fairly petite and these did not work out so well for me . They were not fitted at all and I had to modify them a lot . I could n't send them back because I did n't have the time to return them and look for another pair . I would n't suggest these to anyone with average to small hands/wrists .
 If you are not flat chested , do n't buy this . The head goes too far to the edge and ends up in your armpit and you end up with a headless cheetah
 Pills very easily , warm as long as there is no wind or water . If you have any wind or water at all , be prepared to freeze your fingers .
 After reading all of the comments on these gloves I decided to order them . I was very disappointed . They are supposed to be worn UNDER gloves as a liner but they are sized incorrectly -LRB- too large -RRB- thick , bulky , and scratchy . Thankfully I am able to return them but have to pay AGAIN to ship them back . That is paying twice for something I am unhappy with , does not seem fair .
 I 'm a huge fan of Smartwool socks . I 've given and requested them as gifts , and I 've recommended them to friends countless times . So a couple years ago , when I was in need of some liner gloves to wear under my shell gloves while snowboarding , I decided to see if Smartwool gloves were on the same level as their socks.My first impression when I wore them on the mountain was that they were comfortable , just like the socks , and they definitely helped keep my fingers warm . But then , after my second or third use , I noticed holes forming near the inner knuckle areas of the gloves . It was n't long before the holes were big enough to fit my fingers through . I could n't believe it ! How could a company that puts so much care into their socks make such a poor-quality pair of gloves?I suppose it could have been a fluke , but the speed at which these gloves fell apart scared me off of purchasing anything else from Smartwool beyond their socks .
 Too tight above the knees , and I have skinny legs . I had to give to a friend . I would not recommend buying this unless you are a stick figure .
 These were disappointing only because they were n't rainbow like the photo , just random colors . Although we could have sent them back my other daughter wanted them so we decided to keep them .
 I received these from my wishlist and they are n't thigh highs . They are leg warmers . NOT THE SAME . I am highly disappointed .
 I bought these for my wife and when they arrived we pulled them out of the package to discover many problems . They are very cheap socks to begin with and after examining further I discovered that one of the socks at a dime sized hole in it and the other was unraveling at the toes . There are good thigh high sicks out there , but these are n't one of them
 I 'm sure there are advantages to polyester - but I am not a fan of it . I think it does n't `` breathe '' well or feel good on your skin - this top falls into that category . If you like polyester , this is a nice roomy top . I do think it looks a little bit cheap - but it 's not horrible - and , again , the fit is good .
 Washed it in cold water , blead lots of red out . Came out of the washer wrinkled , I dried it on low , still completely wrinkled , and stiff . It 's like wearing a plastic bag and as noisy . Bad cut . No shoulder room , baggy and not tapered like in the picture . Waste of money . I guess I could cut it up for rags ?
 Youngstown Waterproof Winter Gloves - Unisex Sizing - Free ShippingThese gloves run a size or two smaller than listed . I ordered size extra large , a size I normally wear , and can barely get the gloves on my hands . I kept them because it is to much trouble to return them . I would not recommend them unless you have small hands and order ertra large . .
 I have normal to skinny hands and fingers . I could barely get these gloves on . The wrist sizing was fine , but my fingers barely fit in the glove fingers . The gloves were way too tight . So my fingers could not move - making the gloves useless , and for this price a complete ripoff . I wonder if they were manufactured wrong , considering the high ratings others have given . No excuse either for bad manufacturing considering the cost . I would look elsewhere .
 I wasnt happywith my gloves , besides that they arent water proof like it saidthey was , but trying to put them on was tricky most of the time because of the inner glove would come out in the glove an the fingers wouldnt line up which became a pain . i still have them sumwhere but im looking for a new pair to buy . an not this one .
 I do n't know if glasses were damage , but they are too big . I had to returned them
 The zipper on the jeans I received was defective and would not zip up or down . They also seemed to fit smaller than the size they were labeled to be . I had to return them .
 Then buy these jeans . They did n't add that they were tapered in the description . Just traditional fit . Had to cut them to fit over my work boots . Ca n't send them back , cuz I 'm in Afghanistan .
 The title says traditional fit , but when I tried the jeans , the have bell bottom legs . I wanted the normal cut around the ankle , not bell bottoms .
 Bought -LRB- 3 -RRB- pair of carhartt jeans from Amazon and they will not stay zipped . I emailed Carhartt to let them know and got no reply from them . These jeans are unusable and I lost $ 80.00 dollars .
 First I purchased these a few weeks ago . Nice looking heavy built jean . NOT SO ! These are tapered leg which makes them fitt like skinny jeans !!! Tight at the knee , calf , and butt . These have lasted I think about 3 weeks which would equal about 3 or 4 washings . I noticed today that they are already tearing at the pocket . I am a slender guy with no butt so there should be no reason that these are tearing at the corner of the pocket from stress . They do fit a size smaller after you wash them so order a size larger in the waist ! Especially since you ca n't return after you wash them ! I would not recommend these jeans . I have 2 pair of them and I am glad I purchased the 3 other pairs in relaxed fit . They still fit a little tight around the waist after washing so I would suggest you get a size larger in those too .
 Not made in USA ... Not measuring the same as a pair I own . Carhartt I am deeply ashamed !!!!!!!
 Other Carhartt Jeans of same type and color were perfect . This pair had uneven coloring and a larage dark blue area in the zipper area were it really shows . I kept them , I should have sent them back .

 My wife got these for me and I said never again . When ordering , she thought they came two pair per box but they did n't . These are a nice product , but you can find them cheaper at retail shops .
 These briefs were not usable since there is no open fly on the front of the brief . The front of the brief is completely sewn together . I had to get rid of these . My money was wasted on these .
 It gives nice separation . Good fabric . Be careful about sizing . I felt it was a size bigger than other brands . The under wire digs in a lot in the middle . Very uncomfortable .
 This used to be a great bra until they changed it and they no longer make it with a molded cup . It 's a nice bra if you 're looking for that style but I 'm an older woman who need help in the support dept with a molded cup !
 Unfortunately I ordered the wrong size and had to return this product . However , had I ordered the right size , I still would have returned it . The description states `` smooth cup '' which I took to mean that it would be discreet , even in cold weather . This was not the case , the cup has thin material and would not hide anything . Although it is a pretty bra , it 's not good to wear under form fitting clothes . : -LRB-
 These pants were way too big -LRB- looked about 2 sizes larger -RRB- , and they were incredibly stiff . They would have been very uncomfortable for my daughter to wear all day .

 I just tried this on my son and it ripped putting it over his head . They hole was too small . My other son got the white Anakin costume and it was awesome . It fit great and had an opening in the back and closure to fit . This item has a small hole and only a dolls head could fit through the hole . I have to now sew the rip and reconstruct it too fit over the head . Also the Belt fits me which wasnt as big of a deal cause I can fix that easy with glue and more velcro . Just cut the ends off and revelcro the belt and it will look great .
 I have purchased many costumes for my kids . This has to be one of the poorest made . The picture makes it look very nice . Unfortunately , the leather looking overlay is not anything like the picture . The belt is so incredibly big it fits around my 6ft4inch husband 's waist . I had to cut it down and then re-do the velcro . Part of the belt even fell apart the first time it was used ! Also disappointing is that I am not sure this was even new . The bag had been ripped open , breaking the snap , and taped shut again . I am sure my 6 year old will still use the costume , but I am glad this was purchased for fun dress up and not a halloween costume . It would n't have lasted 1 block !
 This costume was for Halloween ... and it was a disaster . The pants were too long ... they pulled up to my son 's chest . The neck/head opening on the tunic was entirely TOO small ... I doubt my 18 month old nephew 's head would fit through it ! The belt was probably two FEET too long as well . We opted for a different Star Wars costume ... and sent this one back . Hopefully it was n't passed on to another consumer . .
 My 4-year old son loved his Jedi costume but it , as other reviewers have states , is poorly constructed of very thin material . He only wore it three times by Halloween and all the seams were ripping . One shoe covering did n't fit and the elastic to hold it on the bottom ripped away from the costume . As others have said , the belt is absolutely outsized compared to the size of the costume -- we cut ours . Overall , he did n't seem to notice but he will be unable to use this costume going forward to perfect his Jedi skills -- it 's trashed already .
 Super cute costume but fell apart before my son even made it home from his Halloween Party at school and the costume looked horrible by the time we went trick-or-treating . It tore in so many places that it can not even be mended ! Highly unlikely I will ever order from this company again .
 Great deception after receiving the costume . Not identical to the picture . To cheap for what I payed for . Lacking a clear explanation of what of the different sizes .
 I understand that Halloween costumes tend to minimize on quality , with the assumption that kids will only wear it once . But the truth is that after Halloween -LRB- and before , for that matter ! -RRB- , the costumes become dress-up clothes , and they mean THE WORLD to kids.This costume is of such poor quality , I 'm almost shocked . Most importantly , the belt is too large for my husband , much less my five-year-old son . And it smells of rubber so badly that even if he wanted to wear it -LRB- which he does not - despite its ' ` utility belt ' coolness -RRB- I 'm not sure I could bear the smell.Secondly , the hole for the head is WAY too small for son 's normal-sized head . We had to make a cut in the hole to enlarge it.It 's really disappointing . Halloween means A LOT to kids of this age , and I just ca n't believe that it can be that difficult to produce a decent-quality costume for kids - who will wear it again and again .
 I live in Brazil and I bought this item to send to a friend that was coming to my city . when arrived the pants was soo big , the shirt did ' t fit , because can not get into the head . Excuse my english but I 'm brazilian and is not my mother languague .
 My son was so excited to get his Jedi costume this year for Halloween , but I wish I had n't bought this one . the colors did n't even match the picture , the product was extremely poor .
 Beware this product does not come as shown . Made completely out of cheap fabric - no pleather/fake leather material as shown in the product picture . Very disappointed . Belt too big . Head opening too small . Luckily my son did n't notice .
 My 5 yr-old son was so excited but when we opened the box the costume was not as shown . The belt was too big to go our my adult waist , there were two holes that appeared to come from a sharp object cut -LRB- not tear -RRB- and the outfit appears to be coming apart at the seam . The disappointment put my little guy in tears .
 Really expensive for a poor quality costume . The belt is HUGE , made of a sticky rubber-like material , and poorly manufactured -LRB- pieces falling apart before use -RRB- . The shirt/tunic is asymmetrically stitched making one shoulder longer than the other . The collar of the shirt is already unstitching . Can not return because my nephew -LRB- as any child -RRB- does n't care and keeps playing with it .
 i got this for my 10 year old son and it did not fit him , the pants is too long and the shirt is too small !!! not good at all . they charged me for shipping seperate than my rest of orders and had to pay double of what i paid for shipping to return it.no no no for this seller ...
 I understand this is a child 's costume , but as an adult making choices on behalf of our children , the item you receive should actually look like the costume . We received what we ordered , and even the product picture on the packaging looked nice ... . but the actual costume was all one color - brown . There is no black like you see in the preview . It really looks awful.The belt is ridiculous . I wear size 36 '' pants and I can wear the belt provided . We would have to cut up the belt and add Velcro tape to fix this for my son . I think everyone understand that not everything is going to fit perfectly but this is just a different story.My son actually wanted to look like Anakin for Halloween and not some kid with layered brown polyester tunic . I would advise to look elsewhere for Halloween .
 The size small 4-6 has the wrong recommended age in the description . The Amazon description says 6-8 year olds , but when the costume actually arrived , the packaging indicated it was for 3-4 year olds . This is completely confusing as the sizing says 4-6 . It was way too small for my 5 year old son , who is average height and on the slim side.For almost $ 30 , the fabric is very flimsy and the belt looks nothing like the photo .
 The belt broke as soon as my son put it on . There are threads hanging from the seams , looks terrible . It is complete junk ! We bought size Large for my 7 1/2 year old son & it is way too big . My fault as it said 8-10 years old on it . I thought it was size 8-10 , but it was size 12-14 . This is going back .
 Returned this item . It was not good quality and the size was not even close . Would not recommend this item .
 This costume looks like it has a heavy leather-like tunic and boot covers . Not even close . The belt looks nothing like the picture either and is way too big . It 's supposed to attach with velcro but I have to tie it like a sash . Thankfully my son likes it anyways , but I would not have chosen this had I been able to see it in store . I really wonder weather they did n't stuff the package with something different !
 My very small child ca n't even get his head through the hole . His head would have to be the size of an infant to make it through . I will have to return this product.Star Wars Child 's Deluxe Anakin Skywalker Costume , Small
 For the price , the fabric should be a little better quality , my son loves it , but everytime he gets stuck on something the tread just pulls away , like a loose pice of hear !
 Washed it in cold water , blead lots of red out . Came out of the washer wrinkled , I dried it on low , still completely wrinkled , and stiff . It 's like wearing a plastic bag and as noisy . Bad cut . No shoulder room , baggy and not tapered like in the picture . Waste of money . I guess I could cut it up for rags ?

 Dickies - Girls ' Flat Front Pantsi found the same pants at walmart.com for $ 12 each . Why would i pay more in amazon.com ?

 The pants were really nice , but they were too large for my son . I requested an exchange -LRB- same style & color -RRB- in size medium . To date , I have NOT received the exchange . Could you please look into this for me.Thanks , Bonnie Cutler

 The helmet came all smashed and i had to stuff a bunch of t-shirts in it for a week to fill it out . Everything was flimsy . The shoulder 's were completely off shaped and never stayed on the shoulders . The chest , well , it was as bad as the shoulders . I ended up just wearing the shirt and belt and left the chest and shoulders off . Luckily i decided to go as a vampire knight so i left that flimsy helmet off as well as it would n't have really matched just the shirt anyways .

 Do n't support the cruelness that is the fur industry . Foxes are brutally beated and skinned alive just so you can have a `` good looking '' jacket . And you know what , this thing does n't even look that good . In fact , it 's hideous ! Save yourself from being egged and go buy a sweatshirt .

 My daughter 's first birthday party was princess themed so I searched for a little princess costume for her to wear . I came across this Pink Ballerina Princess costume and loved it from the picture . When it arrived , I thought it was as joke . There was no way this 12-18 month costume was going to fit on her . My daughter was average size for her age so it shouldnt have been a problem . I ended up giving it to my friends 5 year old who puts it on her dolls . One of the worst buys I 've made online .

 I have worn Thorlo Running Rolltop Socks for at least 20 years with no problem . I am extremely disappointed in this last purchase in that the elastic at the top is very tight . The opening itself is small and evidently made for a little girl 's foot .

 I purchased 3 of this product for a school play . As soon as we pulled 2 of them out of the bag the feathers fell off ! We will not be able to use them at all unless we figure out a way to fix them ourselves . I emailed the company and never recieved a response . The children our disappointed and I wasted my money .
 We have already sent you a complaint about this product . The item was not as advertized so was of no use to us .
 Arrived quickly . Not as pictured . pictured is the top 2/3 's of wings with a beautiful maribu feather and white . received as fluffy maribu feather along top edge only about 1 inch . the rest of the feathers are the flat type shown on the bottom of product picture and are scraggly looking , not full , not even , not consistent . the bone of the feathers are a dark yellow so does not look very nice . kind of cheesy looking . size received is 18 inches wide by 18 inches long but product description stated 24 inches wide and 21 inches long . very dissapointed . totally not worth it at all .

 I purchased this item because I read some great reviews on it and because I needed a really good supportive jog bra . I was not happy about paying over $ 50.00 -LRB- with shipping -RRB- but I figured it had to be top of the line for that price . I received my bra and it was basically an overpriced sports bra that you could buy at your local walmart . It was very uncomfortable and it was huge . I had to check the size to see if I received the correct one . I do n't know if I received the wrong product but I was shocked to read the reviews and then to get such a low quality item for such a high price . Between shipping and returning it cost me $ 15.00 and I still have no jog bra . . ridiculous . .
