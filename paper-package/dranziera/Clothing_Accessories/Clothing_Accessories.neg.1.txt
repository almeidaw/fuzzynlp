 Other Carhartt Jeans of same type and color were perfect . This pair had uneven coloring and a larage dark blue area in the zipper area were it really shows . I kept them , I should have sent them back .
 Bought -LRB- 3 -RRB- pair of carhartt jeans from Amazon and they will not stay zipped . I emailed Carhartt to let them know and got no reply from them . These jeans are unusable and I lost $ 80.00 dollars .
 Then buy these jeans . They did n't add that they were tapered in the description . Just traditional fit . Had to cut them to fit over my work boots . Ca n't send them back , cuz I 'm in Afghanistan .
 The title says traditional fit , but when I tried the jeans , the have bell bottom legs . I wanted the normal cut around the ankle , not bell bottoms .
 The zipper on the jeans I received was defective and would not zip up or down . They also seemed to fit smaller than the size they were labeled to be . I had to return them .
 Not made in USA ... Not measuring the same as a pair I own . Carhartt I am deeply ashamed !!!!!!!
 First I purchased these a few weeks ago . Nice looking heavy built jean . NOT SO ! These are tapered leg which makes them fitt like skinny jeans !!! Tight at the knee , calf , and butt . These have lasted I think about 3 weeks which would equal about 3 or 4 washings . I noticed today that they are already tearing at the pocket . I am a slender guy with no butt so there should be no reason that these are tearing at the corner of the pocket from stress . They do fit a size smaller after you wash them so order a size larger in the waist ! Especially since you ca n't return after you wash them ! I would not recommend these jeans . I have 2 pair of them and I am glad I purchased the 3 other pairs in relaxed fit . They still fit a little tight around the waist after washing so I would suggest you get a size larger in those too .

 I have purchased two of these , and neither made it past two days of play , but it was fun for my daughter regardless . The glasses fell apart before being worn , the hair quickly becomes a messy animal , the headband is pretty useless , but the microphone has held up for a couple of months.The bag and mic are all that remains , but I do n't regret for a moment the fun we had.The two sets I bought were both blue , but it appears the purple set might be a bit better in quality .
 My 7 year old was dissapointed that it the hair was wavy and with brown streaks . She says Hannah Montana has straight blond hair . Money wasted .
 I bought this based on the review info that I read ! Boy was I disapointed . The wig will not stay on and you can see the net underneath . It also rats easy
 I was excited to get this at a great price . BUT the wig , after 2 days looks like straw . Can not comb throught the plactic hair . Horrible quality , just go to the wig shop to play dress up .
 I ordered these items weeks ago and did not receive them by Christmas , nor was I notified of the status.Thanks for nothing .
 The items in the bag were not exactly the same as shown online . The earings and sunglasses were not the same ones as in the picture when ordering . The same number of items were in the bag , at least . And what was received will hopefully still make our very picky little girl happy .
 The reason I bought this was because the picture showed a microphone . If you buy the purple one it comes with a headset rather than the microphone . Also the description says earrings - they are for pierced ears . Most dress up kits come with clip-ons so anyone can use them . The bag the kit came in was clear plastic , very cheap looking - and nothing with Hannah Montana on it . I was very disappointed and sent it back !
 I ordered this item for my 9-year old daughter on August 27 , 2007 to wear for Halloween . I thought it would arrive in plenty of time , but the date kept getting pushed back . I did find this item on E-Bay Express for twice the price , and I decided to go ahead and cancel my order and order from there . I was n't thrilled to pay more , but I was afraid that as Halloween grows closer it will get harder to find !
 WE WERE VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE PACKAGE WIG IS ALL MATTED AND SNARLED AFTER JUST ONE DAY , HEADBAND LOOKS PRETTY BUT COULD FIT A SMALL DOLL . . MICROPHONE IS CUTE BUT THAT WIG IS TERRIBLE , MY GRANDDAUGHTER WAS SO DISAPPOINTED ,
 I just hung up the phone with a customer service rep for Amazon . They are telling me that the reason some of you have received your order is because you live closer to the warehouse that had it in stock . I do not agree with this . I had placed my order on Aug 20th . It now has been delayed for the fourth time with estimated delivery being Oct 8th -15 th . Customer service could not help me at all with this . I am very displeased with how they handle there orders and customers . As for you that have received your orders Thank God that you live close to one of the warehouses .
 I just ordered this wig also , but was afraid it would not come it time . I also just recently bought it at Justice store for 16.99 , plus 20 % off . I will hang on to the one I just bought from Justice until I receive the one from amazon , or if It does n't come I will cancel my order and keep the one from Justice . Unfortunatly you ca n't always depend on internet , sometimes you got ta go old school !
 I also ordered this wig back on August 10th . My date was moved several times and I even was promised by Amazon that I would receive this wig sometime the week of October 8th . Customer Service even made up a story about how they had one reserved for me from some `` vendor '' somwhere . Needless to say I got an email from Amazon the very next day saying I would get the wig in November and I never got the wig . I got the run-around every time I called . I found the wig at a store locally and bought a bunch of `` Hannah '' accessories . I paid much more money , but I am now guaranteed my daughter can be `` Hannah Montana '' for Halloween .
 Hello all , I want to buy this for my daughter just like you all are . I had called Amazon before placing an order , to make sure if I will get this before Halloween . The CS representative said that this will NOT be delivered before Halloween if I placed the order . The earlier delivery date for this item is early November . I decided not to buy this as it wont be available for Halloween .
 I believe every person who has written a terrible review on this product has every right . I ordered this product on August 10,2007 for my daughter to use as part of her Halloween costume . It was a pre-order item before it was due to be released . The shipment date then got pushed to September now it has been pushed out again to November . Needless to say , it wo n't do me any good at that point and I canceled the order . I went to CLub LibbyLu and purchased all of the items that I needed . They had plenty in stock . Also , as for Amazon and whomever the merchant is that they are dealing with for this product . I think that it is terrible that this item has n't been shipped to all of the buyers who have ordered this months ago and you still have the nerve to display the item as available !!! At least do what other websites do and mark it as temporarily not available until all prior orders have been fulfilled .
 The wig is hard to keep on my daughter 's head . Even worse than that is trying to detangle the hair on the wig . The headband was pretty but useless since it was a very small fit . The microphone pretty much fell apart the first times she used it . After taping it together this is the only items with which she cares to play .
 What a ripoff ! The wig drops hair like a molting dog , the earrings are pierced , -LRB- making them unusable by nonpierced girls -RRB- , and the sunglasses arrived with one bow in the bottom of the package because it was missing a nut and a screw . I DO NOT recommend this product !
 I received the trousers in a timely manner . They were what i expected although they did not fit . I returned them a month ago and have not heard a word from the company .

 beware

 This wig is far too bulky . I am on the petite side , but I really drowned under it . Since it 's already in a ponytail , you ca n't really `` fix/adjust '' it , and have it look halfway decent . I would n't recommend this , unless of course you have a gigantic head , and really want a thick head of hair . Since I had to give it a star , I choose to use my one star for the price of the product ...

 i have no idea why they have a photo of a ` buffy the vampire slayer ' vampire on this item , it is NOT at all like the one shown in the picture . i have no use for it , as i wanted the one that is advertised in the photo online . do n't order this item , because even if they let you return it , YOU have to pay the shipping and handling both ways even though they are falsely advertising it !
 It 's not the same as picture . The brow points are not pointed it is flat like a pan cake so no and I will repeat no depth !!! It is like you drew it on some paper and apply it to face ! So crap ! Very disappointed !
 This bra is extremely uncomfortable and does n't give good support . I will not buy it again . Bali bras that I have worn in the past have been uch better .
 I was eager to recieve it but after 2 calls to Amazon Customer Service it never arrived . Full refund of course !
 comfort is compromised by the inner band -- in front it is a scratchy bare rubbery substance . the support is lacking due to the overall stretchiness on cup fabric , but helps if you need more room than a DD -- still looking for that 4D support that does n't look like it came from Boise Girder and Truss !
 I was trying to find bras that were wireless yet comfortable and supportive . These are not that at all . They do n't support larger breasts . They shrink and bind upon washing . The plastic adjusters they put on the straps broke after the first wash . These are terribly cheap made bras . I will now only buy more expensive , quality made bras I can try on first and see how they are constructed .
 I was not very pleased . This bra is so uncomfortable it feels to small yet it is the same size I always wear . I will never buy bra 's from the internet again .
 I am disappointed wit this bra . I ordered Bali before and loved another style so I gave this one a try since it has great reviews on here . I tried it on right away after i got it in the mail . It was very comfy , BUT no pad or support at all -LRB- I am not a big girl with size 36C -RRB- . They are just like a thin layer of cloth and what make them unacceptable for me is that my nipples were poking out . I can see them though my t shirt and this is summer , not even cold out . I sent them back right away . If you are more than 36C , this may not be a good bra for you .
 Cup is sized strange and all the straps are too tight.It is much too thickI do n't like it
 I 'm sensitive to any type of nylon threads or fabrics in my bras . They scratch and make me itch like crazy . But 100 % cotton bras are hard to find , because too many places do n't take into account the elastic or seam support that may have a low cotton content . So I 've been trying a lot of different bras hoping to find one that uses materials in their construction that do n't bother me.This one did n't work . It looks and feel like it 's well made , but the elastic around the edges is horribly rough . The ends of the weave on the elastic are looped back into the material in a wide loop , leaving thousands of small , stiff loops on the outer edges to rub against my skin . But not only were the edges rough , the flat part of the elastic is very rough as well and feels like harsh woven nylon.The shoulder straps and elastic edging were like sandpaper . I could n't even wear it for five minutes .
 This cotton bra had little or no support for those who require some lift . Would like to have kept it otherwise .
 I bought this bra to accomodate my growing maternity size . The cup size was perfect and the straps supportive , but because it was wireless , the band squeezed extra tight & was extremely uncomfortable .
 The seam of this bra ripped after wearing it once . It was clearly shoddily made . Others of the same size , style and brand in white have held up well .
 I have been wearing the same size bra for about thirty years so I thought it safe to order the Bali bra size 34D . I was shocked at how constricting the sides were while the cup size fit . Let me explain that I am a very petite woman . Most women as small boned as me do n't wear a 34D ! So that is why I was shocked at how tight the bra is . I purchased a two inch extender at Walmart which helped and I am planning to purchase a second two inch extender . No point in feeling like Scarlett O'Hara . I recently heard that wearing bras can cause breast cancer because they constrict the lymph glands in the breast . Being a three year breast cancer survivor I now feel good about wearing my old bras that are loose . I have bought Bali bras in department stores in the past and they have been great but the one I purchased on amazon.com did not fit .
 Just plain bad fabrication . Unacceptably scratchy and rough , the ribbon straps fold in two where they attach to the rings at the top of the cups . There is no way to straighten them out to lie flat , so they bulge out under T-Shits . Also , there is so little material under the cups to form a band which would support the breasts , that the bra justs cuts you off there , again , causing bulging -LRB- and sagging -RRB- . The Bali Women 's Double Support Cotton Stretch Wire-Free Bra # 3036 looks nothing like the picture when you get it on ; what tiny bit of fabric constitutes the band is immediately swallowed up by the large breasts it purports to support . The only wire-free bra for larger women that has a substantial support band is theGoddess Women 's Alice Soft Cup Bra , which I discovered in a bra-buying binge this summer.Finally , Bali Women 's Double Support Cotton Stretch Wire-Free Bra runs large . I wear anywhere from 40DDD - 42DD in other bras . In this , I wear a 40D .
 OMG this bra is so ITCHY , it 's ridiculous . It rides up in the front , no matter what position the back hooks or the front straps are . Bali has changed this bra - it used to be great . Very disappointed .
 This is a very comfortable bra . However , after I wore it for a couple of months the cotton fabric above the cup ripped on one side . I 'm disappointed that it fell apart that quickly .
 It is my own fault , I see , that my bras were an unpleasant surprise . I saw the same number that was on my former bras and hurriedly ordered them . The new ones were a soft knitted fabric in an ugly grey , not like the ones I have worn for years . Why not assign a different number to one that is so different ? Bummer ! I lost my postage for both ways . The picture looks like my white Bali 3036 .

 I have been wearing the same size bra for about thirty years so I thought it safe to order the Bali bra size 34D . I was shocked at how constricting the sides were while the cup size fit . Let me explain that I am a very petite woman . Most women as small boned as me do n't wear a 34D ! So that is why I was shocked at how tight the bra is . I purchased a two inch extender at Walmart which helped and I am planning to purchase a second two inch extender . No point in feeling like Scarlett O'Hara . I recently heard that wearing bras can cause breast cancer because they constrict the lymph glands in the breast . Being a three year breast cancer survivor I now feel good about wearing my old bras that are loose . I have bought Bali bras in department stores in the past and they have been great but the one I purchased on amazon.com did not fit .
 I bought this bra to accomodate my growing maternity size . The cup size was perfect and the straps supportive , but because it was wireless , the band squeezed extra tight & was extremely uncomfortable .
 I was eager to recieve it but after 2 calls to Amazon Customer Service it never arrived . Full refund of course !
 I was not very pleased . This bra is so uncomfortable it feels to small yet it is the same size I always wear . I will never buy bra 's from the internet again .
 I am disappointed wit this bra . I ordered Bali before and loved another style so I gave this one a try since it has great reviews on here . I tried it on right away after i got it in the mail . It was very comfy , BUT no pad or support at all -LRB- I am not a big girl with size 36C -RRB- . They are just like a thin layer of cloth and what make them unacceptable for me is that my nipples were poking out . I can see them though my t shirt and this is summer , not even cold out . I sent them back right away . If you are more than 36C , this may not be a good bra for you .
 Cup is sized strange and all the straps are too tight.It is much too thickI do n't like it
 comfort is compromised by the inner band -- in front it is a scratchy bare rubbery substance . the support is lacking due to the overall stretchiness on cup fabric , but helps if you need more room than a DD -- still looking for that 4D support that does n't look like it came from Boise Girder and Truss !
 I was trying to find bras that were wireless yet comfortable and supportive . These are not that at all . They do n't support larger breasts . They shrink and bind upon washing . The plastic adjusters they put on the straps broke after the first wash . These are terribly cheap made bras . I will now only buy more expensive , quality made bras I can try on first and see how they are constructed .
 I 'm sensitive to any type of nylon threads or fabrics in my bras . They scratch and make me itch like crazy . But 100 % cotton bras are hard to find , because too many places do n't take into account the elastic or seam support that may have a low cotton content . So I 've been trying a lot of different bras hoping to find one that uses materials in their construction that do n't bother me.This one did n't work . It looks and feel like it 's well made , but the elastic around the edges is horribly rough . The ends of the weave on the elastic are looped back into the material in a wide loop , leaving thousands of small , stiff loops on the outer edges to rub against my skin . But not only were the edges rough , the flat part of the elastic is very rough as well and feels like harsh woven nylon.The shoulder straps and elastic edging were like sandpaper . I could n't even wear it for five minutes .
 This cotton bra had little or no support for those who require some lift . Would like to have kept it otherwise .
 This bra is extremely uncomfortable and does n't give good support . I will not buy it again . Bali bras that I have worn in the past have been uch better .
 Just plain bad fabrication . Unacceptably scratchy and rough , the ribbon straps fold in two where they attach to the rings at the top of the cups . There is no way to straighten them out to lie flat , so they bulge out under T-Shits . Also , there is so little material under the cups to form a band which would support the breasts , that the bra justs cuts you off there , again , causing bulging -LRB- and sagging -RRB- . The Bali Women 's Double Support Cotton Stretch Wire-Free Bra # 3036 looks nothing like the picture when you get it on ; what tiny bit of fabric constitutes the band is immediately swallowed up by the large breasts it purports to support . The only wire-free bra for larger women that has a substantial support band is theGoddess Women 's Alice Soft Cup Bra , which I discovered in a bra-buying binge this summer.Finally , Bali Women 's Double Support Cotton Stretch Wire-Free Bra runs large . I wear anywhere from 40DDD - 42DD in other bras . In this , I wear a 40D .
 OMG this bra is so ITCHY , it 's ridiculous . It rides up in the front , no matter what position the back hooks or the front straps are . Bali has changed this bra - it used to be great . Very disappointed .
 This is a very comfortable bra . However , after I wore it for a couple of months the cotton fabric above the cup ripped on one side . I 'm disappointed that it fell apart that quickly .
 It is my own fault , I see , that my bras were an unpleasant surprise . I saw the same number that was on my former bras and hurriedly ordered them . The new ones were a soft knitted fabric in an ugly grey , not like the ones I have worn for years . Why not assign a different number to one that is so different ? Bummer ! I lost my postage for both ways . The picture looks like my white Bali 3036 .

 The title says traditional fit , but when I tried the jeans , the have bell bottom legs . I wanted the normal cut around the ankle , not bell bottoms .
 The zipper on the jeans I received was defective and would not zip up or down . They also seemed to fit smaller than the size they were labeled to be . I had to return them .
 Not made in USA ... Not measuring the same as a pair I own . Carhartt I am deeply ashamed !!!!!!!
 First I purchased these a few weeks ago . Nice looking heavy built jean . NOT SO ! These are tapered leg which makes them fitt like skinny jeans !!! Tight at the knee , calf , and butt . These have lasted I think about 3 weeks which would equal about 3 or 4 washings . I noticed today that they are already tearing at the pocket . I am a slender guy with no butt so there should be no reason that these are tearing at the corner of the pocket from stress . They do fit a size smaller after you wash them so order a size larger in the waist ! Especially since you ca n't return after you wash them ! I would not recommend these jeans . I have 2 pair of them and I am glad I purchased the 3 other pairs in relaxed fit . They still fit a little tight around the waist after washing so I would suggest you get a size larger in those too .
 Then buy these jeans . They did n't add that they were tapered in the description . Just traditional fit . Had to cut them to fit over my work boots . Ca n't send them back , cuz I 'm in Afghanistan .
 Bought -LRB- 3 -RRB- pair of carhartt jeans from Amazon and they will not stay zipped . I emailed Carhartt to let them know and got no reply from them . These jeans are unusable and I lost $ 80.00 dollars .
 Other Carhartt Jeans of same type and color were perfect . This pair had uneven coloring and a larage dark blue area in the zipper area were it really shows . I kept them , I should have sent them back .
 This costume is so cheaply made . The wand fell apart within 15 minutes ; the body suit is held together by Velcro and comes undone and is very uncomfortable . The `` fur '' is coming undone already and she wore it for a simple event for 30 minutes . The wings have velcro straps that came apart at the event and I had to rig it to stay on . I had to hot glue those back together . I bought this for my 4 yr old and I bought the bumblebee costume for my 1 yr old . I would NOT recommend this costume . Very disappointed and my daughter has to wear it 3 more times and now I have to sew it ; glue it ; tie it .
 This was very cheaply made . It did not last three dressings . Not worth the money . My daughter had to go trick or treating with the skirt falling off !
 I ordered this very cute costume for my 3 and a half year old daughter , who is on the small side . The quality was just fine and it had cool accessories but the main part of the costume , the leotard , was way too small . We could not even get it snapped it was so tiny . So in the future , the packagers needs to figure out better sizing .
 Sewing and glued areas broke and fur all came out . Durability was bad . Was able to fix and unable to wear .
 This costume is cute - but is very poorly made . My daughter tried it on and within minutes the strap on the wing and the wand were broken . She only had it on for about 10 minutes . The velcro between the legs does n't quite match up , so it scratches on one side . The `` fuzz '' on the collar & sleeves is barely attached . I 'm not sure it is durable enough to last even for a couple hours of trick or treating . Very disappointed !
 You 'd think that if these people are in the garment industry , they 'd get these size issues straightened out.It says `` Toddler '' in the selection criteria , but when you look at the sizing information it says : General size = ToddlerSpecial Size = -LRB- 2-4 -RRB- -LRB- 1-2 yrs -RRB- Height -LRB- neck to bottom -RRB- = 35 '' - 39 `` What in the world is that describing ? So size 2-4 is for a 1-2 year old ? Huh ? And neck to bottom , does that describing neck to feet or neck to crotch , where the costume ends ? Why do n't they just give the height of the child ? Either way , that 's not describing anything close to the height of a typical -LRB- or even a 95 percentile -RRB- 1-to-2 year old child.Is there some sort of language barrier problem ?

 I have never owned a pair of socks that shrunk more than these socks . They reduced to a fraction of their size , and did so quickly . The wool is soft but this is not a well designed product .
 I have not worn the product yet.However , I am very upset that when I received the socks , a sticker had been put over the original label , and said the socks now have 30 % polyester . I was trying to avoid polyester , as my feet do n't like it . I looked at the labels for all the merino socks , and chose these because they were one of the few that did not have polyester . Very disappointed .
 These socks look fine when new . However , after the first wash they shrunk to about 2/3 size and were too small-wearable but small . Not of high-quality compared to Gold Toe wool-if they are still being made .
 I purchased this pair of socks from the belt outlet . The socks I received look very generic , have no name brand at all on the sock or packaging , and simply had a tag that said `` Windsor Collection '' . On the back it says Garment Group Inc. . Sure does n't sound like ECCO to me . They are Merino , but not the same mix advertised in the description . In fact I noticed the features description and product description do n't even match . An incorrect and almost assuredly inferior product that will be returned . The belt outlet should be ashamed .
 These socks were very comfortable , and looked great.I did not experience sock shrinkage like some people ... they 're wool

 This product is fine . I already have several pairs from another vendor . I like them and wanted more . My original vendor dropped the product . I ordered over the calf and got midcalf .
 Other Carhartt Jeans of same type and color were perfect . This pair had uneven coloring and a larage dark blue area in the zipper area were it really shows . I kept them , I should have sent them back .

Also , there is so little material under the cups to form a band which would support the breasts , that the bra justs cuts you off there , again , causing bulging -LRB- and sagging -RRB- . The Bali Women 's Double Support Cotton Stretch Wire-Free Bra # 3036 looks nothing like the picture when you get it on ; what tiny bit of fabric constitutes the band is immediately swallowed up by the large breasts it purports to support . The only wire-free bra for larger women that has a substantial support band is theGoddess Women 's Alice Soft Cup Bra , which I discovered in a bra-buying binge this summer.Finally , Bali Women 's Double Support Cotton Stretch Wire-Free Bra runs large . I wear anywhere from 40DDD - 42DD in other bras . In this , I wear a 40D .
 OMG this bra is so ITCHY , it 's ridiculous . It rides up in the front , no matter what position the back hooks or the front straps are . Bali has changed this bra - it used to be great . Very disappointed .
 This is a very comfortable bra . However , after I wore it for a couple of months the cotton fabric above the cup ripped on one side . I 'm disappointed that it fell apart that quickly .
 This bra is extremely uncomfortable and does n't give good support . I will not buy it again . Bali bras that I have worn in the past have been uch better .
 I bought this bra to accomodate my growing maternity size . The cup size was perfect and the straps supportive , but because it was wireless , the band squeezed extra tight & was extremely uncomfortable .
 I 'm sensitive to any type of nylon threads or fabrics in my bras . They scratch and make me itch like crazy . But 100 % cotton bras are hard to find , because too many places do n't take into account the elastic or seam support that may have a low cotton content . So I 've been trying a lot of different bras hoping to find one that uses materials in their construction that do n't bother me.This one did n't work . It looks and feel like it 's well made , but the elastic around the edges is horribly rough . The ends of the weave on the elastic are looped back into the material in a wide loop , leaving thousands of small , stiff loops on the outer edges to rub against my skin . But not only were the edges rough , the flat part of the elastic is very rough as well and feels like harsh woven nylon.The shoulder straps and elastic edging were like sandpaper . I could n't even wear it for five minutes .
 This cotton bra had little or no support for those who require some lift . Would like to have kept it otherwise .
 I was not very pleased . This bra is so uncomfortable it feels to small yet it is the same size I always wear . I will never buy bra 's from the internet again .
 I am disappointed wit this bra . I ordered Bali before and loved another style so I gave this one a try since it has great reviews on here . I tried it on right away after i got it in the mail . It was very comfy , BUT no pad or support at all -LRB- I am not a big girl with size 36C -RRB- . They are just like a thin layer of cloth and what make them unacceptable for me is that my nipples were poking out . I can see them though my t shirt and this is summer , not even cold out . I sent them back right away . If you are more than 36C , this may not be a good bra for you .
 Cup is sized strange and all the straps are too tight.It is much too thickI do n't like it
 comfort is compromised by the inner band -- in front it is a scratchy bare rubbery substance . the support is lacking due to the overall stretchiness on cup fabric , but helps if you need more room than a DD -- still looking for that 4D support that does n't look like it came from Boise Girder and Truss !
 I was trying to find bras that were wireless yet comfortable and supportive . These are not that at all . They do n't support larger breasts . They shrink and bind upon washing . The plastic adjusters they put on the straps broke after the first wash . These are terribly cheap made bras . I will now only buy more expensive , quality made bras I can try on first and see how they are constructed .
 I was eager to recieve it but after 2 calls to Amazon Customer Service it never arrived . Full refund of course !
 This product is fine . I already have several pairs from another vendor . I like them and wanted more . My original vendor dropped the product . I ordered over the calf and got midcalf .
 It is my own fault , I see , that my bras were an unpleasant surprise . I saw the same number that was on my former bras and hurriedly ordered them . The new ones were a soft knitted fabric in an ugly grey , not like the ones I have worn for years . Why not assign a different number to one that is so different ? Bummer ! I lost my postage for both ways . The picture looks like my white Bali 3036 .
 The seam of this bra ripped after wearing it once . It was clearly shoddily made . Others of the same size , style and brand in white have held up well .
 I have been wearing the same size bra for about thirty years so I thought it safe to order the Bali bra size 34D . I was shocked at how constricting the sides were while the cup size fit . Let me explain that I am a very petite woman . Most women as small boned as me do n't wear a 34D ! So that is why I was shocked at how tight the bra is . I purchased a two inch extender at Walmart which helped and I am planning to purchase a second two inch extender . No point in feeling like Scarlett O'Hara . I recently heard that wearing bras can cause breast cancer because they constrict the lymph glands in the breast . Being a three year breast cancer survivor I now feel good about wearing my old bras that are loose . I have bought Bali bras in department stores in the past and they have been great but the one I purchased on amazon.com did not fit .

 I ordered the large 100 % Cashmere Shawl . Label says `` Pashmina Boutique '' 100 % Cashmere . After wearing it 2 or 3 times , it sheds terribly , pills and looks awful . Plus , about a week after I ordered from this company , I got a message that my credit card info had been compromised by this vendor 's lack of security.Avoid this company .
 The scarf is lovely and warm but my son ca n't wear it because it sheds white on his black jacket . I 've tried various treatments to prevent the shedding but none work . So the scarf stays in the closet .

The ends of the weave on the elastic are looped back into the material in a wide loop , leaving thousands of small , stiff loops on the outer edges to rub against my skin . But not only were the edges rough , the flat part of the elastic is very rough as well and feels like harsh woven nylon.The shoulder straps and elastic edging were like sandpaper . I could n't even wear it for five minutes .
 This cotton bra had little or no support for those who require some lift . Would like to have kept it otherwise .
 I purchased this item because I read some great reviews on it and because I needed a really good supportive jog bra . I was not happy about paying over $ 50.00 -LRB- with shipping -RRB- but I figured it had to be top of the line for that price . I received my bra and it was basically an overpriced sports bra that you could buy at your local walmart . It was very uncomfortable and it was huge . I had to check the size to see if I received the correct one . I do n't know if I received the wrong product but I was shocked to read the reviews and then to get such a low quality item for such a high price . Between shipping and returning it cost me $ 15.00 and I still have no jog bra . . ridiculous . .
 I was eager to recieve it but after 2 calls to Amazon Customer Service it never arrived . Full refund of course !
 This bra is extremely uncomfortable and does n't give good support . I will not buy it again . Bali bras that I have worn in the past have been uch better .
 I bought this bra to accomodate my growing maternity size . The cup size was perfect and the straps supportive , but because it was wireless , the band squeezed extra tight & was extremely uncomfortable .
 comfort is compromised by the inner band -- in front it is a scratchy bare rubbery substance . the support is lacking due to the overall stretchiness on cup fabric , but helps if you need more room than a DD -- still looking for that 4D support that does n't look like it came from Boise Girder and Truss !
 I was trying to find bras that were wireless yet comfortable and supportive . These are not that at all . They do n't support larger breasts . They shrink and bind upon washing . The plastic adjusters they put on the straps broke after the first wash . These are terribly cheap made bras . I will now only buy more expensive , quality made bras I can try on first and see how they are constructed .
 I was not very pleased . This bra is so uncomfortable it feels to small yet it is the same size I always wear . I will never buy bra 's from the internet again .
 I am disappointed wit this bra . I ordered Bali before and loved another style so I gave this one a try since it has great reviews on here . I tried it on right away after i got it in the mail . It was very comfy , BUT no pad or support at all -LRB- I am not a big girl with size 36C -RRB- . They are just like a thin layer of cloth and what make them unacceptable for me is that my nipples were poking out . I can see them though my t shirt and this is summer , not even cold out . I sent them back right away . If you are more than 36C , this may not be a good bra for you .
 Cup is sized strange and all the straps are too tight.It is much too thickI do n't like it
 I 'm sensitive to any type of nylon threads or fabrics in my bras . They scratch and make me itch like crazy . But 100 % cotton bras are hard to find , because too many places do n't take into account the elastic or seam support that may have a low cotton content . So I 've been trying a lot of different bras hoping to find one that uses materials in their construction that do n't bother me.This one did n't work .

 This cotton bra had little or no support for those who require some lift . Would like to have kept it otherwise .
 The seam of this bra ripped after wearing it once . It was clearly shoddily made . Others of the same size , style and brand in white have held up well .
 I have been wearing the same size bra for about thirty years so I thought it safe to order the Bali bra size 34D . I was shocked at how constricting the sides were while the cup size fit . Let me explain that I am a very petite woman . Most women as small boned as me do n't wear a 34D ! So that is why I was shocked at how tight the bra is . I purchased a two inch extender at Walmart which helped and I am planning to purchase a second two inch extender . No point in feeling like Scarlett O'Hara . I recently heard that wearing bras can cause breast cancer because they constrict the lymph glands in the breast . Being a three year breast cancer survivor I now feel good about wearing my old bras that are loose . I have bought Bali bras in department stores in the past and they have been great but the one I purchased on amazon.com did not fit .
 It is my own fault , I see , that my bras were an unpleasant surprise . I saw the same number that was on my former bras and hurriedly ordered them . The new ones were a soft knitted fabric in an ugly grey , not like the ones I have worn for years . Why not assign a different number to one that is so different ? Bummer ! I lost my postage for both ways . The picture looks like my white Bali 3036 .
 Just plain bad fabrication . Unacceptably scratchy and rough , the ribbon straps fold in two where they attach to the rings at the top of the cups . There is no way to straighten them out to lie flat , so they bulge out under T-Shits . Also , there is so little material under the cups to form a band which would support the breasts , that the bra justs cuts you off there , again , causing bulging -LRB- and sagging -RRB- . The Bali Women 's Double Support Cotton Stretch Wire-Free Bra # 3036 looks nothing like the picture when you get it on ; what tiny bit of fabric constitutes the band is immediately swallowed up by the large breasts it purports to support . The only wire-free bra for larger women that has a substantial support band is theGoddess Women 's Alice Soft Cup Bra , which I discovered in a bra-buying binge this summer.Finally , Bali Women 's Double Support Cotton Stretch Wire-Free Bra runs large . I wear anywhere from 40DDD - 42DD in other bras . In this , I wear a 40D .
 OMG this bra is so ITCHY , it 's ridiculous . It rides up in the front , no matter what position the back hooks or the front straps are . Bali has changed this bra - it used to be great . Very disappointed .
 This is a very comfortable bra . However , after I wore it for a couple of months the cotton fabric above the cup ripped on one side . I 'm disappointed that it fell apart that quickly .

 Other Carhartt Jeans of same type and color were perfect . This pair had uneven coloring and a larage dark blue area in the zipper area were it really shows . I kept them , I should have sent them back .
 Not made in USA ... Not measuring the same as a pair I own . Carhartt I am deeply ashamed !!!!!!!
 First I purchased these a few weeks ago . Nice looking heavy built jean . NOT SO ! These are tapered leg which makes them fitt like skinny jeans !!! Tight at the knee , calf , and butt . These have lasted I think about 3 weeks which would equal about 3 or 4 washings . I noticed today that they are already tearing at the pocket . I am a slender guy with no butt so there should be no reason that these are tearing at the corner of the pocket from stress . They do fit a size smaller after you wash them so order a size larger in the waist ! Especially since you ca n't return after you wash them ! I would not recommend these jeans . I have 2 pair of them and I am glad I purchased the 3 other pairs in relaxed fit . They still fit a little tight around the waist after washing so I would suggest you get a size larger in those too .
 Then buy these jeans . They did n't add that they were tapered in the description . Just traditional fit . Had to cut them to fit over my work boots . Ca n't send them back , cuz I 'm in Afghanistan .
 The title says traditional fit , but when I tried the jeans , the have bell bottom legs . I wanted the normal cut around the ankle , not bell bottoms .
 Bought -LRB- 3 -RRB- pair of carhartt jeans from Amazon and they will not stay zipped . I emailed Carhartt to let them know and got no reply from them . These jeans are unusable and I lost $ 80.00 dollars .
 The zipper on the jeans I received was defective and would not zip up or down . They also seemed to fit smaller than the size they were labeled to be . I had to return them .

 Disappointed . Had purchased other items of theirs , and was not thrilled with this fabric
 This diaper bag was perfect , so I thought , because I am a Precious Moments collector . I received the bag and used it for a short while before it ripped at the pockets . The cheap plastic lining ripped very easily . I would not recommend it , especially for the price !
 The zipper on the jeans I received was defective and would not zip up or down . They also seemed to fit smaller than the size they were labeled to be . I had to return them .
 Not made in USA ... Not measuring the same as a pair I own . Carhartt I am deeply ashamed !!!!!!!

 There 's only one reason that made me not like this product , the way it fits at the waist area . I 'm a size small in dresses for reference and I 'm 5 ' 1 . It did not hug the waist area and the curve of my back . There was a big space that just goes straight up without hugging tight to your waist . I think its because of the fabric or maybe because i have a small waist and a big butt . My waist is 23inch and hips/butt 38inch . But i really think its the fabric . I have other fishnets and they all hug tightly without leaving a space . And I also had to stretch it length wise to fit correctly , so I 'm not sure this will fit taller people .

 I purchased these socks based on the positive reviews , but my experience with them was very different.WrightSock Anti Blister Double Layer Coolmesh quarter socks are sized , which I usually love because my feet are small and `` one size fits all '' socks are generally too big and bulky for me . However , with these socks , I really dislike the sizing because they are not sized correctly . I wear a ladies size 5.5 -6 shoe , so I purchased these socks in the small size -LRB- advertized to fit ladies sizes 4-7 , so they should have fit me perfectly -RRB- . I washed before wearing , following the instructions . When I put the socks on for the first time they were really snug and seemed low , especially in the back . I should have paid more attention , but I went out for my run as usual . After 6 miles or so , the back of my ankle -LRB- right where a running shoe hits - above the heel , below the achilles tendon -RRB- was rubbed completely raw because these socks hot too low to offer adequate protection . By the time I finished my run my ankles and my toes -LRB- due to the tight fit -RRB- were blistered and bloody . Definitely not anti-blister for me , although they might have worked better in a size or two larger . I will not be wearing the socks again and am upset that I purchased them . For me , every other brand I have tried is better -LRB- and that includes cotton socks ! -RRB- I suggest trying SmartWool PhD running socks , Pearl Izumi Elite Wool Socks , Asics -LRB- especially Kayano -RRB- socks instead - they can be a little more expensive , but at least you do n't risk minor injuries by wearing them .
 I found these socks a little thin and flimsy for good work out socks , had wanted some with a little more stretch and ones that fit more snugly .

They do fit a size smaller after you wash them so order a size larger in the waist ! Especially since you ca n't return after you wash them ! I would not recommend these jeans . I have 2 pair of them and I am glad I purchased the 3 other pairs in relaxed fit . They still fit a little tight around the waist after washing so I would suggest you get a size larger in those too .
 Other Carhartt Jeans of same type and color were perfect . This pair had uneven coloring and a larage dark blue area in the zipper area were it really shows . I kept them , I should have sent them back .
 Then buy these jeans . They did n't add that they were tapered in the description . Just traditional fit . Had to cut them to fit over my work boots . Ca n't send them back , cuz I 'm in Afghanistan .
 Bought -LRB- 3 -RRB- pair of carhartt jeans from Amazon and they will not stay zipped . I emailed Carhartt to let them know and got no reply from them . These jeans are unusable and I lost $ 80.00 dollars .

 The title says traditional fit , but when I tried the jeans , the have bell bottom legs . I wanted the normal cut around the ankle , not bell bottoms .

 First I purchased these a few weeks ago . Nice looking heavy built jean . NOT SO ! These are tapered leg which makes them fitt like skinny jeans !!! Tight at the knee , calf , and butt . These have lasted I think about 3 weeks which would equal about 3 or 4 washings . I noticed today that they are already tearing at the pocket . I am a slender guy with no butt so there should be no reason that these are tearing at the corner of the pocket from stress .

 The zipper on the jeans I received was defective and would not zip up or down . They also seemed to fit smaller than the size they were labeled to be . I had to return them .
 The shirt they send is NOT this shirt . It is an ORANGE T shirt , with the sleeves cut off with `` Hulkamania '' across the chest . I would not have paid this price for the shirt they sent me . It does not look an authentic Hogan style shirt at all , just a cheap knock-off . Pretty fraudulent that you have a shirt advertised on your website and you send a different shirt . Great business strategy . I sent a complaint via , I 'll let you know what they respond with .
 I ordered the shirt pictured as a part of a Halloween costume . The previous reviewer is correct . The shirt they send you is NOT this shirt . They send a gold/orange shirt instead . When I emailed them and said what happened , they offered me a bandana at no charge to make up for it . I refused the bandana . They told me that the one they send me is the one they get from the manufacturer and they ca n't help it . I asked for a complete refund but now that it is so close to Halloween I have to scramble to get the right one.I would strongly advise anyone considering this company to go to a more reliable source .
 This shirt looks nothing like what 's in the picture . . It is orange and is made cheaply . It 's maybe worth $ 5.00 . I want my money back Amazon !
 i wanted a tank top LIKE the one hulk hogan would wear . . . i think it 's called a T-bar tank top or something . even an a-top tank top woulda been better . this is a sleeveless t-shirt ... oh well .
 Just got the 1 oz . bottle today . It was mailed in an envelope . I guess that was more economical than a box for such a small bottle , but somewhere along the way it got smushed so that half the bottle 's contents were a tacky coating on the inside of the envelope by the time I got it . So if you order , maybe get a larger bottle than I did , and if it comes in an envelope , do n't open it near any carpeting or furniture , just to be on the safe side .
 Do n't waste your money . This product is terrible . It did not stay on the skin . . as soon as it was applied , it would bunch up and rub right off . A big disappointment .

 I was expecting a simple LARGE bookbag . This is a SMALL book-bag . It 's not 9 '' deep . If it 's 2000 cu . ft. then I need to find a larger volume . If you want something for High School ... this will work , but that 's about all . The free return to ebags was very easy .

 I tried these `` medical '' support pantyhose in my search for the perfect pair of support hose to help the venous return problem in one of my legs . I found them to be expensive and a little on the short side . I found them to fit poorly too . After wearing them for about 2 hours , they started to bag around my ankles and knees . I had to go to the restroom and pull them up every two hours try to reduce the bagging . They also did n't hold up better than the Futuro pantyhose I bought and I could n't tell the difference between the Futuro pantyhose and the Jobst pantyhose when I took them out of the package !! They are fairly sheer , have a slight sheen , more like regular support pantyhose , if you are looking for a pair of pantyhose that offer sheerness without looking like medical grade support hose .
 I was looking for something to soothe my aching legs during frequent air travel , but these ripped as I was putting them on for the first time . What a waste !
 I am waiting for the pantyhoses . They sent the wrong color.I returned them.Elena
 I work outside 8 hours a day in the hot Florida sun . This hat is not worth anything . The brim is maybe an inch which gives ZERO protection ! I guess if you have a bald head and are only looking to protect the top of your head from the sun this hat would work . I was looking for a hat that would allow airflow yet protect my face . This hat does NOT protect any part of your face when you wear it . A baseball cap would protect your face more than this thing would . Save your money and buy an Outdoor Research hat . It does cost more but you get what you pay for !
 To be honest , I really like the style and the design of the jeans . Fit quite well and nicely . However , after just TWO times of being washed , the material fell apart , and the jeans look old and over used . Not happy AT ALL !! I give it two stars because of the design .
 These are the most ridiculously stiff jeans I 've ever touched . They also shrunk around the thigh -LRB- not in length or around waist -RRB- . I guess if you are looking for durable jeans that wo n't tear easily - these would be ideal .
 have worn Wranglers for decades but this is the first time that I purchased them online . I returned them because the seams were out of alignment and that results in the jeans legs being twisted ... and as a result , looking bad .
 I was so disappointed with these jeans I bought for my boyfriend . First of all they are so stiff they can stand up on their own . They have been washed several times and they are still very stiff and they come out of the dryer so wrinkled that they are embarrassing for him to wear .
 These were very tight . You 'd need to be of a very slim build in order to fit into these . I also did n't like the color -LRB- I realize it says indigo but it 's difficult to tell from the pictures - when the arrive in person they 're very indigo -RRB- . I wear this size in several other types of jeans and it has worked out fine .
 Will buy soft jeans in the future , these jeans feel like they were triple starched at a Cinese laundry , and after repeated washings were still tough to get into.Wrangler Men 's Cowboy Cut Slim Fit Jean
 jeans was wrong size order 32 x 32 got like 28 x 32 but jeans size said 32 x 32 jeans was cheap looking will not order any jeans from amazon again !!!!
 The jeans fit well , but the seam on the right leg drifts to the front instead of the side . If I twist the right leg of the jean so that the seams are paralled to the right leg , I can fell that the fabric has a twist to and it will rotate back out of position by almost 90 degrees . It makes me think that these were rejects purchased from Wrangler , as I have not had this experience before with Wrangler jeans . I 'll purchase my next pair in a physical store as opposed to an on line retailer as there was no cost savings .
 I am very disappointed that Wrangler did not pay the $ 15 rebate that was -LRB- I thought -RRB- included with this purchase and would not have purchased the jeans had I known the rebate would not apply . Since the rebate coupon was included right on the Amazon page that featured the jeans , who would have guessed that it did not apply to these jeans , but only to their `` Outdoor Brand '' of jeans , as I was informed by the call center that answered inquiries on the matter . To me this was a very misleading promotion on the part of Wrangler and it sours my attitude toward ever buying anything from them again !!
 Have not received latest 2 items mailed . The 1st was sent last month w/other 2 same items to be shipped later but still no pkg . Way too slow & where is latest pkg supposedly shipped ?
 Most jeans are wash and wear , not these . I wear wranglers exclusvely but these will not be worn much as they MUST be ironed after wash and dry . So many deep set wrinkes and creases you have to steam iron before wearing . I wo n't order any more clothing online . I prefer to have a local merchant to accept my returns .
 They were stiff as a board . We decided to keep them and have washed them several times and they are still too stiff to wear . Wish we had returned them .
 These jeans are very stiff and are so wrinkled after washing that it is even hard to steam iron them enough to wear . They don &#34; t look too bad after concentrated ironing but are still very stiff .
 None of the reviews mention that these jeans fit small , are made of very rough denim and have stitching that irritates bare skin . Maybe they get better with a wash or two , but I was n't willing to risk it . Going back to spending 20 bucks more for Levis , which are always a good bet .
 Dickies - Girls ' Flat Front Pantsi found the same pants at walmart.com for $ 12 each . Why would i pay more in amazon.com ?

 Purchased loved it , then the black coloring started to break off in various parts of the belt . Left a few emails at Kenneth Cole and got no reaction . I will never buy Kenneth Cole again . Good luck
 This belt lasted 1 week . Its a laminated 2 piece belt that after 1 week the belt split into 2 pieces . Would look for a different belt .
 I have got Kenneth Cole products before -LRB- shoes -RRB- , and they used to be made with quality material . I was really dissapoint for the quality of this belt . They say it 's made of leather , but it 's a very bad leather . Get a belt from another brand ...

 The back pack for this takes alot of air and the gun is very odd . My 5 year old son wore this and I had to hem the bottom about 5 inches up .
 We ordered the costume and included blow up proton pack . The Proton pack would not hold air , so was non-usable for the costume .
 This is a very flimsy costume . In picture it looks tan colored like it should be but it is actually bright peach ! There was a tear in the knee because fabric was coming apart . Do not buy this !!!
 This costume says it fits children size 4-6 . My son currently wears a size 5 , perfect right ? WRONG . I was really looking forward to giving this to my son as a dress up prop , and possible Halloween costume . When it arrived , it was made of very poor quality material , that I can accept for $ 30 . What I could n't do anything about was the size of the costume . It would fit about a 10-12 year old child . I could almost put it on , and I 'm 5 ' 6 ! I do n't know too many 5 year olds that are over 5 ' . I tried to make the costume down , but eventually gave up , and chalked it up to a bad experience . I would NOT advise anybody to purchase this for their young one .
 Costume came missing the connector that goes between the backpack and gun . The gun also came with a hole in the seam that could not be fixed even with the included repair kit . Really poor quality .
 We purchased this costume for our very tall 4 1/2 year old son , and while the costume -LRB- like most -RRB- is n't anything of much quality , the blow up `` proton pack '' is HUGE , and the belt/straps do n't fit him properly . I contacted Rubies the maker of the costume and they said it was n't a problem , and the licensor approved it . Well , I 'm approving this review of 1 star to let other parents know to not purchase this product . Rarely , do I go out of my way to give something 1 star , but we have to purchase a different costume , as he can not go trick or treating with this giant blow up back pack on .
 PRODUCT COMES TOO BIG . I GOT MY SON -LRB- WHICH IS 3 -RRB- A SMALL AND IT CAN FIT MY 7 YEAR OLD WITH NO PROBLEM . NOT MADE WELL . LOOKS LIKE IT WILL TEAR UP EASILY . NOT WORTH IT FOR THE MONEY I PAID , PLUS I HAVE TO ALTER THE COSTUME JUST FOR MY 3 YEAR OLD TO FIT IN IT . THE BEST THING ABOUT THE COSTUME IS THE BLOW UP PLASTIC PROTON PACK .
 My son is 4 and loves the Ghostbuster song so he wanted to be a Ghostbuster this year . I bought him the size SMALL 4-6 and is recommended for 3-4 year olds . He is very average on his size but this outfit looks like it would fit my 8 year old daughter better . I checked the tag and it said small . There is extra room on the arms , legs and waist . There is about 4-6 inches extra on the arms and about 6-8 inches extra on the legs and the crotch area hangs down to his knees ... needless to say , I 'm going to either have to roll it up for him , get it hemmed or just get a whole new costume all together . Also , it is made poorly ... there are strings hanging off everywhere ! I have n't even opened the backpack yet ... kind of scared to see what 's wrong with it . Do n't waste your money !
 Any ghost buster fan knows the jumpsuit is not yellow , well theirs is ! Its also cheap made-but what costume isnt ? I bought this for my 4 yr old son -LRB- in a small 4-6 -RRB- and I have to roll the pants up-prob gon na hem them so it is a bit long and my 4 yr old is tall . Overall though my son is having a blast in it and Im sure it will be a hit for halloween.Just be warned it IS yellow .
 My son loved this costume . It held up well . The pack was a wonderful addition . He was the only Ghostbuster in his school .
 If you are heavy busted ... such as the DD or larger range I would not suggest this bra ... the support is not adequate . It was fine the first few times worn , but after that the support is simply not there any longer .
 It was just not long enough for me . The bra kept working its way down and smashing my chest . The search for a good bodysuit continues .
 The material is weak . I tore them my second day on trail , and the waist button ripped out the third . They are about as usefull as a costume for a night .
 The zipper on the jeans I received was defective and would not zip up or down . They also seemed to fit smaller than the size they were labeled to be . I had to return them .
 Not made in USA ... Not measuring the same as a pair I own . Carhartt I am deeply ashamed !!!!!!!
 First I purchased these a few weeks ago . Nice looking heavy built jean . NOT SO ! These are tapered leg which makes them fitt like skinny jeans !!! Tight at the knee , calf , and butt . These have lasted I think about 3 weeks which would equal about 3 or 4 washings . I noticed today that they are already tearing at the pocket . I am a slender guy with no butt so there should be no reason that these are tearing at the corner of the pocket from stress . They do fit a size smaller after you wash them so order a size larger in the waist ! Especially since you ca n't return after you wash them ! I would not recommend these jeans . I have 2 pair of them and I am glad I purchased the 3 other pairs in relaxed fit . They still fit a little tight around the waist after washing so I would suggest you get a size larger in those too .
 Then buy these jeans . They did n't add that they were tapered in the description . Just traditional fit . Had to cut them to fit over my work boots . Ca n't send them back , cuz I 'm in Afghanistan .
 The title says traditional fit , but when I tried the jeans , the have bell bottom legs . I wanted the normal cut around the ankle , not bell bottoms .
 Bought -LRB- 3 -RRB- pair of carhartt jeans from Amazon and they will not stay zipped . I emailed Carhartt to let them know and got no reply from them . These jeans are unusable and I lost $ 80.00 dollars .
 Other Carhartt Jeans of same type and color were perfect . This pair had uneven coloring and a larage dark blue area in the zipper area were it really shows . I kept them , I should have sent them back .

 have worn Wranglers for decades but this is the first time that I purchased them online . I returned them because the seams were out of alignment and that results in the jeans legs being twisted ... and as a result , looking bad .
 I was so disappointed with these jeans I bought for my boyfriend . First of all they are so stiff they can stand up on their own . They have been washed several times and they are still very stiff and they come out of the dryer so wrinkled that they are embarrassing for him to wear .
 These are the most ridiculously stiff jeans I 've ever touched . They also shrunk around the thigh -LRB- not in length or around waist -RRB- . I guess if you are looking for durable jeans that wo n't tear easily - these would be ideal .
 To be honest , I really like the style and the design of the jeans . Fit quite well and nicely . However , after just TWO times of being washed , the material fell apart , and the jeans look old and over used . Not happy AT ALL !! I give it two stars because of the design .
 These were very tight . You 'd need to be of a very slim build in order to fit into these . I also did n't like the color -LRB- I realize it says indigo but it 's difficult to tell from the pictures - when the arrive in person they 're very indigo -RRB- . I wear this size in several other types of jeans and it has worked out fine .
 These jeans are very stiff and are so wrinkled after washing that it is even hard to steam iron them enough to wear . They don &#34; t look too bad after concentrated ironing but are still very stiff .
 jeans was wrong size order 32 x 32 got like 28 x 32 but jeans size said 32 x 32 jeans was cheap looking will not order any jeans from amazon again !!!!
 I am very disappointed that Wrangler did not pay the $ 15 rebate that was -LRB- I thought -RRB- included with this purchase and would not have purchased the jeans had I known the rebate would not apply . Since the rebate coupon was included right on the Amazon page that featured the jeans , who would have guessed that it did not apply to these jeans , but only to their `` Outdoor Brand '' of jeans , as I was informed by the call center that answered inquiries on the matter . To me this was a very misleading promotion on the part of Wrangler and it sours my attitude toward ever buying anything from them again !!
 Have not received latest 2 items mailed . The 1st was sent last month w/other 2 same items to be shipped later but still no pkg . Way too slow & where is latest pkg supposedly shipped ?
 The jeans fit well , but the seam on the right leg drifts to the front instead of the side . If I twist the right leg of the jean so that the seams are paralled to the right leg , I can fell that the fabric has a twist to and it will rotate back out of position by almost 90 degrees . It makes me think that these were rejects purchased from Wrangler , as I have not had this experience before with Wrangler jeans . I 'll purchase my next pair in a physical store as opposed to an on line retailer as there was no cost savings .
 None of the reviews mention that these jeans fit small , are made of very rough denim and have stitching that irritates bare skin . Maybe they get better with a wash or two , but I was n't willing to risk it . Going back to spending 20 bucks more for Levis , which are always a good bet .
 Most jeans are wash and wear , not these . I wear wranglers exclusvely but these will not be worn much as they MUST be ironed after wash and dry . So many deep set wrinkes and creases you have to steam iron before wearing . I wo n't order any more clothing online . I prefer to have a local merchant to accept my returns .
 They were stiff as a board . We decided to keep them and have washed them several times and they are still too stiff to wear . Wish we had returned them .
 Will buy soft jeans in the future , these jeans feel like they were triple starched at a Cinese laundry , and after repeated washings were still tough to get into.Wrangler Men 's Cowboy Cut Slim Fit Jean

 Very poorly constructed costume . The pattern looks pixelated when you get close . I would not recommend this to even be used as rags for cleaning up oil , totally garbage .
 I was hoping to complete my Halloween purchases with an inexpensive costume for my 3.5 year old . It turned out that the material was very flimsy and the dino 's tail does n't actually stand out from the rest of the body -LRB- as in the picture -RRB- . Believe me , that makes a lot of difference in the appearance . I ended up buying another dinosaur costume to appease my son .

 I bought this pair of jeans for working in . They are not very tough/strong . I already have one hole . And the weave is coming out fast . I will get it patched , but I wo n't be buying anymore carhartt jeans . Seeing that this was the first carhartt item I have ever bought I also doubt I will buy anything else carhartt 's .
 I do n't think that it is too much to expect one year 's service out of a set of work dungarees , but apparently I 'm wrong . I carry tools around all day at work in the tool pockets . And two out of the four pairs I bought in July have worn through the tool pockets already . Carhartt could do with a better quality denim for work dungarees .
 I ordered the exact same product a year ago and they fit great . This time they are too long and tight across the top 's of my legs . You wonder how a product could change ; did the sweat factory person have a bad day ; was she or he new at the job ; I mean how can you mis-cut or screw up a pair of Carhartt 's ... I am going to keep them and allow the local Vocational School -LRB- Tailoring Program -RRB- fix them to fit . My bad ! You really need to try stuff on before purchasing . It is just disappointing that crap changes for no reason .
 way to big ... i ordered ' 32x28 ' ... which is a hard to find size ... they fit bigger than most ' 32x30 ' jeans ! ... bummer ... gave them to salvation army , not even worth returninglame >
 I was n't at all expecting cargo jeans when I opened the package , which I strongly dislike as does my husband .

 The shirt was not inexpensive , but it was cheap . Even though we washed the shirt according to directions , the black letters bled onto the white part of the shirt rendering it useless . It was only able to be worn once because it even bled through the back of the shirt .
 The item is too short for me . I like my gowns longer . I am only 5ft .9 inches , so I am not overly tall . Also , it is rough on my skin and needs ironing , which I am not really happy with . In other words , for the cost of it and the quality of it , I am very disappointed ! Ruby Collins
 This was not what I expected . It is not soft material and the neck is too high . I feel like I 'm choking . I 'll never wear it . It does seem to be pretty sturdy however .
 PROS
 I find that while I love the front closure bras because of having fibro this one just is n't quite as comfortable as some of the others . The straps never have felt really comfortable and for this reason I wo n't buy another . I also feel that the posture support it claims is not really there .
 This bra is not the size it states , runs very small . It rides up and it is not comfortable . This would be better for someone who is not plus size .
 You get what you pay for . In this case it is a very uncomfortable bra . It reminds me of something my mom probably women wore in 1958 .
 I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR A DECENT T-BACK BRA SINCE THEY WENT OUT OF STYLE . I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ONE , UNLESS I WOULD WANT TO USE A BRA THAT DOES SEVERAL THINGS , LIKE SEVERAL KINDS OF POSITIONS . WELL , NO THANKS ! WHEN I SAW THIS BRA , MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS THAT IT LOOKED LIKE A BRA , LIKE THE KIND MY DECEASED MAMMAW WORE . I DID N'T STOP LOOKING FOR ME ANOTHER ONE EVERYWHERE I WENT . NO LUCK ! SO I THOUGHT , AS GOOD AS AMAZON HAS DONE FOR ME SO FAR , I CA N'T MISS OUT ON GETTING THE ACTUAL BRA , LIKE I WANT IT . WELL , IT ARRIVED AT MY HOUSE AND I OPENED IT UP . WHEN I FIRST OPENED IT , IT LOOKED LIKE MAMMAW WAS GOING TO BE UPSET , BECAUSE I HAD ONE OF HER BRAS SENT TO ME . THEN , I TOLD MYSELF TO SHUT UP AND TRY IT ON TO SEE IT BY SOME CHANCE IT FIT . WELL , I TRIED IT ON AND IF I HAD INSERTED TUBE SOCKS IN IT , IT WOULD HAVE FIT GOOD ENOUGH . WELL , THOSE DAYS ENDED WITH THE ` EIGHTIES ' AND ME GROWING UP . SO I HAVE YET TO FIND A WAY TO SEND IT BACK , BUT IT IS COMING . I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A REFUND . WHAT WOULD BE EVEN BETTER THAN THAT , WOULD BE FOR YOU GUYS TO FIND SOME COOL T-BACK BRAS FOR ME TO LOOK AT . I ENJOY MAIDENFORM , VASSERETTE , OR EVEN A GOOD SERVING HANES . MY BIGGEST PROBLEM IS THE FACT THAT I HAD A CAR ACCIDENT , ALMOST 12 YEARS AGO . I HAVE 18 PINS IN MY HIP , 2 IN MY KNEE AND 8 IN MY FOOT . SO THE WALKING I NEED TO BE DOING , DOES N'T GET DONE . THEREFORE , THE 40B SIZE BRA . IT DOES N'T SEEM TO BE A TYPICAL BRA SIZE .

 Nice enough shirt , however it is cut a little smaller than the Easy Care version from the same manufacturer.Double check the seller 's return policy before making the puchase .

 Ordered for my husband . He did not care for the fabric at all . It was also too short and tight . One of the few online purchases I made that I returned .

 Not the best ! Immediately putting this on it felt waay too small . I 've always had the problem with strapless bras that they squish my breasts in to the point of flatness , with bulge coming out of the top - and this bra is no different for that . No adjustment to fix this either , and it 's not cute or flattering * with * the straps either . I love Lily of France x-bras a lot so I was disappointed . I may order the strapless convertible x-bra , hopefully that one allows more * room * ... we 'll see !
 I too , had the same problem as another customer . After a month the seams in the pants ripped , in the front no less . The jacket is still holding up but the pants are useless . Very disapponited in my purchase . My best advice , read lots of reviews and shop around .
 This rain suit kept me dry , but the seams connecting the arms ripped after a month of wearing it during our rainy season . I was using it for yard work , but it should last longer than that ! I am very disappointed with this purchase .

 This rain suit kept me dry , but the seams connecting the arms ripped after a month of wearing it during our rainy season . I was using it for yard work , but it should last longer than that ! I am very disappointed with this purchase .
 I too , had the same problem as another customer . After a month the seams in the pants ripped , in the front no less . The jacket is still holding up but the pants are useless . Very disapponited in my purchase . My best advice , read lots of reviews and shop around .

 Most jeans are wash and wear , not these . I wear wranglers exclusvely but these will not be worn much as they MUST be ironed after wash and dry . So many deep set wrinkes and creases you have to steam iron before wearing . I wo n't order any more clothing online . I prefer to have a local merchant to accept my returns .
 They were stiff as a board . We decided to keep them and have washed them several times and they are still too stiff to wear . Wish we had returned them .
 None of the reviews mention that these jeans fit small , are made of very rough denim and have stitching that irritates bare skin . Maybe they get better with a wash or two , but I was n't willing to risk it . Going back to spending 20 bucks more for Levis , which are always a good bet .
 Will buy soft jeans in the future , these jeans feel like they were triple starched at a Cinese laundry , and after repeated washings were still tough to get into.Wrangler Men 's Cowboy Cut Slim Fit Jean
 The jeans fit well , but the seam on the right leg drifts to the front instead of the side . If I twist the right leg of the jean so that the seams are paralled to the right leg , I can fell that the fabric has a twist to and it will rotate back out of position by almost 90 degrees . It makes me think that these were rejects purchased from Wrangler , as I have not had this experience before with Wrangler jeans . I 'll purchase my next pair in a physical store as opposed to an on line retailer as there was no cost savings .
 I am very disappointed that Wrangler did not pay the $ 15 rebate that was -LRB- I thought -RRB- included with this purchase and would not have purchased the jeans had I known the rebate would not apply . Since the rebate coupon was included right on the Amazon page that featured the jeans , who would have guessed that it did not apply to these jeans , but only to their `` Outdoor Brand '' of jeans , as I was informed by the call center that answered inquiries on the matter . To me this was a very misleading promotion on the part of Wrangler and it sours my attitude toward ever buying anything from them again !!
 Have not received latest 2 items mailed . The 1st was sent last month w/other 2 same items to be shipped later but still no pkg . Way too slow & where is latest pkg supposedly shipped ?
 These jeans are very stiff and are so wrinkled after washing that it is even hard to steam iron them enough to wear . They don &#34; t look too bad after concentrated ironing but are still very stiff .
 jeans was wrong size order 32 x 32 got like 28 x 32 but jeans size said 32 x 32 jeans was cheap looking will not order any jeans from amazon again !!!!
 To be honest , I really like the style and the design of the jeans . Fit quite well and nicely . However , after just TWO times of being washed , the material fell apart , and the jeans look old and over used . Not happy AT ALL !! I give it two stars because of the design .
 These were very tight . You 'd need to be of a very slim build in order to fit into these . I also did n't like the color -LRB- I realize it says indigo but it 's difficult to tell from the pictures - when the arrive in person they 're very indigo -RRB- . I wear this size in several other types of jeans and it has worked out fine .
 have worn Wranglers for decades but this is the first time that I purchased them online . I returned them because the seams were out of alignment and that results in the jeans legs being twisted ... and as a result , looking bad .
 I was so disappointed with these jeans I bought for my boyfriend . First of all they are so stiff they can stand up on their own . They have been washed several times and they are still very stiff and they come out of the dryer so wrinkled that they are embarrassing for him to wear .
 These are the most ridiculously stiff jeans I 've ever touched . They also shrunk around the thigh -LRB- not in length or around waist -RRB- . I guess if you are looking for durable jeans that wo n't tear easily - these would be ideal .
 why is it that all mens items like bathrobes or pajamas must be of dull colors ? Navy , Burgundy , White plaid ... etc. . etc. . How about a Charcoal color bathrobe ? or a chocolate or espresso color ? or beter yet ... a Black one ? why mens garments must be square , plain , `` grandpa looking '' ? I look at any guy 's bathrobe and it seems I look sick in any of them . Like I have a cold or the flu ... How about deep green , forrest green , electric blueblack and white , `` rad '' monograms etc. . . spice it up a bit guys !!
 Not the best ! Immediately putting this on it felt waay too small . I 've always had the problem with strapless bras that they squish my breasts in to the point of flatness , with bulge coming out of the top - and this bra is no different for that . No adjustment to fix this either , and it 's not cute or flattering * with * the straps either . I love Lily of France x-bras a lot so I was disappointed . I may order the strapless convertible x-bra , hopefully that one allows more * room * ... we 'll see !
 There are no pockets on these stupid shorts ! I need pockets ... everyone does . What a waste . How hard would it be to sew in some pockets under armour ?
 I love the material of this short , its much bigger than normal S size to me but I can live with that , without any pockets drives me nuts . I have to carry my cell phone and keys all the time . When I go to the store , I got to carry my back pack for my keys and phones . I 'm 5.11 , not a short guy , but the short is as long as a skirt , I had no choice to buy a Small size still looking like wearing a skirt . I 'm not those basketball player slim giant .

 If you are a lone traveler , maybe it will hold your stuff.It does not have any zipper , so it worries me that my passport or my cards may fall off . The leather is artificial with synthetic texture . I do n't think it 's worth the money I spent to get this .
 I am not happy . After inserting my passport only a few times , the liner started to rip , thus making it increasing difficult to access necessary documents in a timely fashion at the airport . I bought it just before a trip , went out of the country , and am trying to exchange it only to find out the time has expired to do so . Not happy Amazon . This is the second time now in 3 months with a bad product .
 This case wallet is pretty small . it does n't have enough space for all my travel documents.I also noticed that the stitching are coming off and the leather is feels cheap.I would not recommend this to a friend .
 I 'm a size 18w , 5 7 '' , and the plus size would not fit at all , i could squeeze in but it was way short and just looked stretched out and ridiculous

 I like to wear a sports tank especially in the summer to eliminate multiple layers , but I was so disappointed with this tank , there was no support and I 'm an average build ! It also shrunk in the wash . I discourage the purchase of this product !!!
 This was part of an order of 3 items , 2 of which had to be returned for wrong size and damage . This top with built in bra arrived with a hole on its side . Customer Service seems ineffective . I had to place several calls before some action was taken in the form of mailing labels for the return of the product without me being charged . Not enought explanation or communication was given regarding this method and my shipped items were returned to me once again due to unclear instructions by Athletica as to which type of Fedex drop off box I could use for this return delivery . The original shipping cost was high too and unjustifiable for the type and quality of merchantise . I 'm still waiting for this issue to be resolved as I have to return the item , in addition to another one that came in the wrong size , once again ... Please avoid using this company to order products .
 I was a trendy young woman in the eighties , and I wore lots of slouch socks . My favorites came from The Limited , and I had a pair in every color . What made a slouch sock slouch is the fact that it did not have any elastic woven into the top of the sock . Slouch socks were made of cotten , and the tops slouched down because they did not have anything nylon , spandex , or stretchy to hold them up.These socks are NOT like the 80s socks . These socks are just like the athletic socks you would purchase at a sporting goods store , or even at Walmart -LRB- for about one-third the price . -RRB- They are thinly-knitted in the foot portion , knitted thicker at the tops , and they have elastic at the very top of the sock to hold it up . Therefore , THEY DO NOT SLOUCH LIKE A REAL EIGHTIES SLOUCH SOCK . If you try to snip the elastic to make them slouch naturally , the entire sock will unravel.If all you are looking for is a pricy casual athletic-type sock , then this is your pair . If you are looking for slouch socks like we loved in the eighties , look somewhere else . So far , I have been unable to find them.One other point -- if you do order socks from Barry 's , look closely at how much they are charging you for shipping . The one pair of socks I ordered from them cost two dollars more to ship than the stated price of the socks -- ridiculous .
 the stitching int he fingers is so slim that my boys can not get their fingers in them . And my boys have slender fingers . They seem like nice gloves but the fingers are a real problem . I put a pencil up inside both pairs -LRB- two different sizes -RRB- and the pencil had a tight fit on the small and only slightly better on the medium .

 I purchased this cashmere robe for my husband for his birthday , but the XL men 's size robe that arrived was woefully too small . It would maybe fit an x = large napolese man , but certainly not an American . To make it worse not only was my husband disappointed , but I had to hassle with shlepping to the post office to return it only to now have to argue with `` the boutique '' to have my money credited to my card . `` They are generously offering me a store credit '' -LRB- yeah , right -RRB- . so ... now they have their merchandise AND my money ! BEWARE , DO N'T BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE .

 I dont know how they make these belts look so nice in the pics but trust me , these belts are cheap pieces of garbage . SAVE YOUR MONEY!I wouldnt pay more then $ 5.00 for these ! The pocket is SMALL . I would like to see them fit 18-30 bills inside!No way ! Again SAVE YOUR MONEY !
 My husband asked me to return the money belt . He did not like having to roll the money . Company handled the return in a quick and expedient manner . Thanks .
 I ordered two in Cowboy Slim Cut 33x34 . I already had some Wranglers . The waist was way too small , the fly was off to my left in a really weird and very ugly and uncomfortable way . These were made in Mexico , just like the ones I bought at Target , but the badging was different , a rubber badge on the back right pocket , not the thin leather Wrangler badge at the rear right waist . Were these knock-offs ? Not sure . Returned them and went to Target where I got two pair for $ 15.99 each -LRB- they were Original and Legendary Gold , not Cowboy , but still , half the price , pard -RRB- !
 While the hat looked adorable on the site , in reality it is way to large and awkward to fit a newborn or small baby . The knot and extra material at the top of the hat is too much . In addition , the cotton fabric is certainly not the softest . I gave the hat to my two other girls to use for their baby dolls instead .
 I have worn these about 4-5 times and there is a hole in one seam already . I 'm not impressed .
 Ordered for my husband . He did not care for the fabric at all . It was also too short and tight . One of the few online purchases I made that I returned .

 Its adorable but its the size of a cloth diaper or a burp pad , not a blanket . It is cute though
 Not since man began to walk upright would a robe with arms as long as these fit anyone not under contract to the NBA.Jerry
 IM VERY DISSAPOINTED IN THIS PURCHASE . THIS BELT IS NOT REAL LEATHER AT ALL . IT IS A PLASTIC OF SOME TYPE -LRB- PVC OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT -RRB- . I EVEN CUT A SMALL PIECE OFF AND APPLIED THE FLAME TEST . LEATHER DOES NOT BURN BRIGHT GREEN AND GIVE OFF THICK BLACK SMOKE . DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM IF YOU ARE EXPECTING A QUALITY PRODUCT . IT RIPS AND TEARS EASILY FORM NORMAL WEAR , NOT WHAT HAPPENS WITH A QUALITY LEATHER BELT . NO MORE BUSINESS WITH THIS MERCHANT FOR ME .

 I bought this for my husband . The vallet does not close properly after putting things and started to rip from folding ppoints . It 's not very practical and the quality is also not great .

 As you can see from the photo of this item , the fabric at the end of the legs is different than the rest of the item . This fabric rolls up and creates a rubber band effect for me . I wore them the first time with not too much of an issue , but it has gotten worse each time , so I am out the money . Do n't buy !
 The material is so flimsy that on the second wearing my finger went completely through the material . This is a lousy product .
 I used to be a small , but I purchased this thigh slimmer in a medium . It pulled on easily just like reviews said , fits well , nice material , and legs and waist band did n't roll . But it also did n't hold me in like other slimmers I 've had before . I still jiggle in all the wrong places -LRB- tummy and butt -RRB- , did n't slim me down much . I think I 'm between sizes . Disappointed .

 I bought this for a disco costume , it looks more like a clown wig , it is white and did n't glow in the dark = -LRB-
 This wig looks extremely matted and ragged . When I tried to gentle fluff it up the plastic hairs were coming out a lot . I wanted this for a black light party and It does glow under a black light and in the dark so it serves its purpose but for the price and considering it says &#34; deluxe quality &#34; on the package I 'm pretty disappointed .
 This wallet is so slim that you have to wedge credit cards in it , The first tin I tried to get one out the wallet tore . I did n't even send in back . It was n't Amazon 's fault . I am just another victim of the corporate theft that goes on every day . Tommy Hilfiger RIGHT !
 The wallet itself is nice , comes in an awesome leather boxProblem is , and for me it KILLS it
 This was a complete waste of my money . I could not insert drivers license , credit cards , or other plastics . This item should have a negative star . Unfortunately Amazon reviews need at least one star to submit . If you already ordered , cancel immediately . Do n't make the same mistake as me and let it set around for over a month before trying to transfer your cards .
 The wallet is very small , I feel something sad and deceived , I imagined that tapeworm measured normal , seems a wallet for children
 Cabbage head because by the time one inserts credit cards , cash , etc. etc. the wallet becomes the size of a cabbage head . Not exactly `` slim '' as advertised . I could n't stand it , so the wallet was retired in favor of a bifold . This was purely a personal choice and had nothing to do with the craftsmanship of this Hilfiger product . Maybe I can get my wife to use it ...
 NOT what I ordered , lousy job.MUST remedy that . REALLY VERY DISAPPOINTEDI AM FROM ECUADOR wish I could return it , what a disappointment.SHOULD remedy thathttp : / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007OERXA/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title

 This wallet 's card slots are too small to easily fit any Credit Cards , Drivers License , Insurance Cards , etc. . The see through slot is useless for any ID card . Although , it is high quality .

 It 's comfortable and soft , but priced high compared to the duration of validityUsed only three times in the last time was outdated and very badI purchased from different brands cheaper and keep me at least two yearsDislikes
 Online this Bra looks Delicious ! I mean it holds the Babies in while looking Nice and Fashionable . The problem?I think my Babies were a little too Big ... a little too much for Poor Old &#34; Felina | Harlow-Unlined Demi-Bra . &#34; They , I , did n't feel comfortable , nor safe walking or playing around in it . I think this Bra is best designed for smaller Babies , cause HOLDING my Babies was a bit Little Shady with The FELINA-Lady ! YOu dig ?
 This bra is gorgeous . Unfortunately it does n't fit terribly well . It 's an odd size that 's neither a balconet or a demi and pinches in weird places . Also , the underwire digs in painfully after about two hours . The wide lace band is wonderful but for the less chesty , I 'd recommend passing on this one .
 I read the other reviews and based on those purchased this bra with high hopes.I am a 36 full cup D.This bra didnt cover anything !!!! Every time you move or particularly bend over everything is out.Yes it is very pretty but not practical , wish I could send it back but I wore it for a few hours . . what a waste of money !
 The fit was okay , it is pretty , but not very soft or comfortable . I like the balconette -LRB- balcony -RRB- style because it flatters a larger busted woman . The straps on a balconette bra set further apart than other bras -LRB- straps are more toward your underarm than in the middle of the cup -RRB- which I prefer , but with this bra the straps set way too far over nearly at my underarms . The underwire on the sides is one of the most uncomfortable I 've ever worn and keeps poking me . I ca n't wait to take it off when I get home ! I should just throw it away . For the price it should have much higher quality -LRB- aka softer -RRB- lace . Hope this helped !
 This was a great product for about 2 weeks . Looked great , fit great , but the underwire poked right through the material on both sides and it is now simply unwwearable . I have n't attempted to contact the manufacturer yet .
 The fit is terrible . The narrow straps cut into my shoulders , but if they are loosened , the cups do n't provide the proper amount of support . You must be the exact right size to wear this bra ... comfortably .
 Ok , it 's a pretty bra , the color is nice & it 's overall pretty . Here are my issues
 Quite flimsy . Doesnt give any support.The seam runs right up the front of the bra and creates bumps under your shirt .
 Very pretty and well made for sure , however , the bra is very wide so not good for narrow backs . Straps cut into tenter skin near under arm area .
 The underwire fit well , but the cups were insubstantial and were not supportive . I had to send them both back .
 I was hoping this was like a previous Felina Bra that I lucked out on picking up at a ross . This bra covered too much in my opinion as I was looking for something sexy for a date night . Also it fit kinda weird . For example that fabric directly below the strap was extra taught compared to the rest and made a slight ripple in my breast . -LRB- It was probably only noticable to me , but still , did not make me feel sexy .
 The bra cup does not fit my breast the way I had expect them to . They are a bit roomy , I 'm disappointed .
 unfortunately the lacey material and raised seam right down the middle of each breast makes it difficult to wear anything even slightly sheerer than a sweatshirt . : -LRB-
 I almost liked this bra , but the straps wo n't shorten up enough . Even when I adjust them to their shortest they 're much too long for me . This leaves me pretty much un-hoisted and very frumpy looking ! Maybe I 'm just built strangely , but I was n't able to wear this bra . It is pretty though .
 I really wanted to like this . I put it on and looked great . I walked by a mirror 5 min later and I was bulging out already . Maybe be good for smaller chest but did n't work for my 36DD bust .
 I wear a 38C Bra size , and this bra fits the bill !!! Love it ! I just ordered another one . I would highly recommend this bra . It is very sexy , and comfortable.Update : After wearing this bra for a day , it 's NOT comfortable . I would not recommend it all , and I have returned the other one that was ordered , and the one I kept goes in the `` Not form fitting , and comfortable '' draw . I got the Marielle Unlined bra instead , so far it is very comfortable , and fits nicely to the breasts . I will be ordering another pair !
 I rarely ever buy bras online especially if it is not from the manufacturer that I am familiar with . I did this because of the price and it was money wasted . The bras fit as if it had been worn . Towards the middle of the cups on both sides were pockets where the cup was not filled out or was not shaped right . So it looked as if I need to put something it other than my fist . Useless . Has been sitting on my dresser going to Goodwill . Bad purchase . Bad fit . Pretty but not practical . I do have many demi unlined bras that fit well , this was not made for D + women .
 I have to agree with a previous poster that said the straps were too long . I adjusted it to the shortest setting and it still was loose . I 've probably only had that problem with 1 % of all the bras I 've ever bought , and sadly this was one of them . The cups run generously sized -LRB- which for me , as a D/DD usually is a positive thing , but in this design was too much of a good thing & I would have to size down -RRB- . The overall design was cute , but the odd sizing made it a no-go .
 I write this review for the DDD 's , this bra is pretty but no support for big bust , I guess that 's what you get for the price !
 I did not like the seam placement in the cups ... it vastly took away from the style.The lace was very pretty though .
 Wallet is certainly thin - but if you 'll be using American currency vs. Macacan gleebers , look elsewhere . Money/receipts/checks all hang out . Money clip would work better .
 LAS 3 CARTERAS NUNCA LLEGARON A SU DESTINO Y FUE DESCONTADO EL PAGO EN MI TARJETA DE CREDITO ... FAVOR SOLUCIONAR ESTE PROBLEMA ... GRACIAS
 Do n't buy this item Amazon ships the wrong item over and over again and said this is coming off the website until they correct the problem . However , it is yet to come off website . Caused huge problems for me as this was a gift .
 I payed 19.00 for it , and it doesnt live up to what I thought would be a good wallet . The bills slightly stick out of it-which makes it incredibly annoying . It began to fall apart a week after I got it . When the description says slim-it means slim . It is just to small to fit in my back pocket-I am afraid of it falling out and me not noticing it until the end of the day . Do n't bother buying this if you plan on keeping receipts/money in it , it really is useless . Buy a Fossil wallet , their products are quality . Do n't waste your time with this thing .
 Apparently the `` slim '' description refers to the height of the wallet and not the thinness . Bills will stick out about a quarter of an inch . This wallet is poorly designed unless you live in a country that uses smaller currency than the US . For me , this is a deal breaker . I hope the return process is not that difficult .

 Ordered for my husband . He did not care for the fabric at all . It was also too short and tight . One of the few online purchases I made that I returned .
 Not the best ! Immediately putting this on it felt waay too small .

 So disappointed in this backpack . No where in it 's description did it say that this was a mini backpack . Ca n't use it when my son begins school which is what I bought it for . Fine , if you want something to carry a lunch in .
 I love Vanity Fair Full Slips but this one was just to small for me . I will be looking for a larger size .
 Style is ok , but fabric is so thin it tends to cling to outer garments , ribbon straps need to be a little wider .
 This could be a really great item . The length is perfect if you are a knee length skirt/dress wearer . The material is not bulky and stays static free . The fit is comfortable enough that I do n't notice I 'm wearing it under a dress . I gave it two stars though because of one detail that I find excessively annoying
 I am very unimpressed by this product . Sizing is very small and the product it flimzy and poorly made . After 2 washings it had shrunk to the point where I just threw it away . I would n't recommend this product to anyone .
 Same experience . I ordered item , then it was cancelled . No reason . Amazon should not list this company 's items .
 I ordered a product and the next thing I know , my order was cancelled by Wizards Chest , without any explanation . I kind of needed this for a Halloween Party I 'm hosting . Guess I 'll make sure I do n't order anything from the Wizards Chest again .
 This item was a little disapionting for me . I ordered it thinking it was a truer , more peacock blue that would go well with other items I had . But as it turns out it is much more of a sky blue . Also the sizeing was a bit off and so I was n't able to wear it when I had hoped . I accually have n't worn it at all because untill I get it altered it will just fall off !
 this product is absolute crap , do not waste your money . If it is actually leather , i have never seen such cheap leather , the holes tear out , the buckle falls off , and the studs come out . bad , bad product

 Ordered for my husband . He did not care for the fabric at all . It was also too short and tight . One of the few online purchases I made that I returned .

 Fabric is good . The neck and sleeves are OK , but the body is tooo wide . Totally can not wear out . Disappointed .

 Unfortunately , I used this product twice and it started to fall apart . I will try the wool model .
 I read the reviews and ignored them , thinking that the problem with the slip turning around would not affect me . Wrong . If this slip would stay put it would be PERFECT . I probably wo n't ever wear it again . It looks a little odd when people can see the armhole of the slip in the middle of your chest . No , you ca n't just give it a tug and get it back into place . You practically have to completely undress and turn it back around . Unless you want to velcro the thing in place save your money .
 Before purchasing this slip , I read the other reviews . They were all very good except for one . One purchaser complained that the slip twisted sideways on her body immediately after she put it on . She said there was no way to keep it from twisting . I bought the slip because she was the only person who complained of that problem . Well , she was right and now there are two people on whom the slip tries to turn sideways . When that happens , parts of the slip that are not supposed to show are visible at one 's neckline . It 's also uncomfortable . I ca n't recommend this product .
 I was extremely pleased with the quality , feel , craftsmanship and look of this slip . I planned to order more but then I wore it . Other reviewers said this garment twisted on you . It does , so much so that every 30 minutes to an hour , I had to reorient the slip so half of it would n't be showing out of the top of my dress . I would have returned , but the shipping to and from would add insult to injury . Another garment that will go in the back of the closet . : -LRB-
 This vanity fair slip slides so much that it created a bulk under my dress and i could n't fit it . I tried to fix it in various bathrooms from BK at work and it kept sliding up . how embarrassing I remember walking and people doing double takes and i knew it was time to try to bring it down . It was such a nightmare . .
 I did not receive the correct item I sent the item back for a return . The picture shows what I wanted but got something else.So I can say I was disappointed . I received some kind of chamisole instead .
 This is decently made but it is NOT &#34; full &#34; as described and the picture does NOT match the actual product . Gross misrepresentation by the seller in my opinion in both text and visual descriptions .
 The slip pictured here is a full slip , mid calf The slip I received is just a bit longer than a camiWhat happenedWhat is in this picture is not what I received
 The size is not exact on these . They probably run about 4 '' larger in the bust than the sizing indicates .
 Although this slip was silky to the touch and comfortable to wear , it was entirely too large for me . I bought the smallest size 34/18 -LRB- thinking the 34 correlated with bust measurement -RRB- , but when I tried it on it was so big I felt like a little girl wearing her mom 's clothing . If it had fit as well as the advertised photo shows , it would have been a keeper !

 Fabric is good . The neck and sleeves are OK , but the body is tooo wide . Totally can not wear out . Disappointed .
 These socks are very thin and have a wide wale rather than the narrow wale as shown in the product description . Fabric feels rough and the non-binding top does n't look like it will keep the sock up at all . I would not buy again from this vendor .
 THIS SOCK IS SO THIN IT LITERALLY MEANS WEAR ONCE AND THROW IN THE GARBAGE ... VERY THIN LIKE A WOMANS STOCKINGS . . NOT WORTH THE PRICE
 They are too thin and feel like nylon which make my feet sweat more ! I prefer 100 % cotton socks that can absorb sweat and odor .
 These were the worst quality of cotton China has ever produced !! I had bought beautiful thin cotton socks from this company in the past but the last shipment was horrible . They fell apart after a few washings . The cotton is sooo cheap & thin . Do n't waste your money !!
 i am a about a 2/3x and i always order a size up in tights . the crotch didnt even go past my knees : -LRB-
 These tights are NOT for tall people ! They reached my knees & I 'm 5 ' 10 '' ! I gave them to a friend of my 14 year old daughter & ended up wearing a pair of solid black tights . I do n't see how these would EVER fit a plus 3x/4x ... there 's just NO WAY
 No way are these 3/4x . Maybe a skinny person 's idea of what 3/4x might be . Aside from being small , they were really cute . Gave them to my size 10 friend , who is getting a lot of use out of them .
 I picked the appropriate size I 'm 5 ' 8 and not much seems to fit length wise this barely came to my thighs waste of money sent it back for a refund
 If you have a large chest , this swimsuit is not for you ! I 'm pettite and have a small frame , but my chest is large , especially with being 6 months pregnant . In the picture , this tankini looked like it would be roomy up top . The cups are extremely small and inside the top , there are these little pads which I 'm assuming are to hide your nipples . Well , you can see the outline of them once you have the top on . I would not recommend this tankini to anyone who has a cup size of C or more . When I went to return the swimsuit , I found out that Belly Basics does not accept returns on sale items , hoisery , or swimwear . I was not aware of this return policy when I ordered the suit , and I ca n't find anywhere on the web page where this policy is stated . I contacted Belly Basics through email , however , and they did allow me to return the suit .
 The product was poor quality . It looked cheap -LRB- NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE AT ALL -RRB- . It was missing pieces of the custume . EX . HAT .
 I ordered the large , I am a 10 and 5 ' 7 . Way too small . The front skirt bottom does not gather up as in photo either . Returning .
 The picture for this product is extremely misleading . It does n't look anything like what I actually got . The hair is in a different style , much longer and a different texture and with lots of very visible glue keeping it to the rest of the mask . The face is differently shaped/not as detailed/a different color -LRB- plain brown instead of brown/red/black -RRB- and the mouth/teeth are different and just look dumb . The hand print on his face is barely visible and you ca n't really tell what it is , and to top it off the mask arrived to me smushed in a box and misshapen . Basically you ca n't even tell that this is supposed to be an orc . I bought this as a gift and am extremely disappointed and will be returning it .
 This mask was ordered with expidited shipping -LRB- 1-2 days -RRB- which I paid extra for and the product did not come for 5 days . When the masked arrived it was old , and discolored . It had a large slit up the back beyond the original opening . Basically the mask was in awful shape . I made every attempt to have it exchanged or returned but was not able -LRB- to this date -RRB- to have that done . Very disappointed , my Halloween part was ruined !!

 I bought this bodysuit for my daughter . A few weeks after we bought it , she went to use it for an occasion and it was very sheer . She could n't wear it . I contacted the seller but the seller did not respond .

 I 've rated at 1 star for the company eHats . The product may be fine , but I wont order from this company again.I ordered the hat to be shipped to an APO address which they said they can ship to . 2 weeks after placing the order , I got a message saying the package was unclaimed , returned and I 'd been given a refund minus shipping and restocking fee.When I contacted the company to see what happened , they said my address looked wierd and there must be something wrong with it . I 've had dozens of packages from many suppliers deliver to me fine with the same address . This is the first time something has n't reached me . They refused to accept that and said there was a problem with the address.Not only do I not have the hat , they 've charged me shipping and restocking because they thought my address looked wierd !
 I orderd this for my daughter and she thought it was an offwhite color . When it came it was periwinkle and with a color called `` helio '' we didnt know ! I have returned it and continue to wait for a black one on backorder ...
 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .

 This shoe has a very beautiful design , especally the low graceful heel . The leather is top quality and the shoe is well constructed . However , the toe was far too pointed and was terribly uncomfortable . I was unable to wear the shoes and had to return them .
 Not something you want to wear unless you were caught in bad weather without anything else . Not an `` everyday '' wear type of coat . I keep it in the trunk of my car for emergencies .
 There really is n't much to this ` jacket ' . If you want to stay warm in a chilly rain , you will need to wear something heavy underneath it . As they say , ` You get what you pay for ' . I believe the ` low ' price was a bit high for what I actually got . I will not buy anything like this ever again !
 this should have been sold as disposable clothing for emergency use only.worn twice.felt stupid putting it on because of its appearance.second time it looked dowdy and fabric did not breathe at all.the fabric is used in enviro shopping bags and $ 2 labcoats.i purchased a nike on ebay for same money . it is real clothing not costume .

 Not the best ! Immediately putting this on it felt waay too small . I 've always had the problem with strapless bras that they squish my breasts in to the point of flatness , with bulge coming out of the top - and this bra is no different for that . No adjustment to fix this either , and it 's not cute or flattering * with * the straps either . I love Lily of France x-bras a lot so I was disappointed . I may order the strapless convertible x-bra , hopefully that one allows more * room * ... we 'll see !

 I did n't like the cut of this shirt , it 's too boxy . I looks like I 'm wearing a plastic bag or something . I know it 's for working out or playing basketball , but I just hate the way it made me look . It 's not as light as I hoped either . I prefer light weight clothing when I work out . I 'm trying to lose weight and this shirt gave me a complex . I only wore it once ! And now that the summer 's over , I doubt I 'll wear it again .

 I have not received this item but was charged for it . I contacted the supplier , they did not ship it -LRB- at the time it was not in stock but since then they have it -RRB- . Not sure what has happened . The supplier said to contact Amazon about the charge but I could not find a phone number to report this issue to Amazon . Seems I am caught in the middle of something . Would really like the product !!! Hope someone helps me soon !!!

 this is a sub par wig ... besides ill fitting , it has a petroleum smell . It gave me a rash when I tried it on .

 The coat does not live up to the picture . The collar does not lay correctly and the faux fur on the collar is not wearable . The material is not as nice as it sounded or looked and after wearing it twice , the coat looks older already . Wrikles and looks as if it is dirty and it is n't .
 The color is totally different from described on the website . The size is huge , I bought an extra-small , it is still too big .
 I am not happy with the purchase . The SX size is more like S - M. Although the fabric feels soft . If you can wear regular S size and above , this is still a nice jacket for the price if you need one . This is atleast one size larger than stated !
 I purchased this robe and was very disappointed wih the quality . i paid $ 69.00 for th robe which is more than i would ever spend but if it was what i wanted it would be worth it . bad stitching , it is falling apart . I do like the color . If i would have known then what i know now about the product i would have never purchased it . i should have returned it if i could have , but thats usually a hassel .
 Was so disapointed with this robe . First wash and threads just came undone everywhere on it . Do n't buy this unless you like to sew because you will have alot of problems with the poor stiching job , also had a run in it from missing threads .
 This is my first review online ever , but I thought I absolutely had to write it . The bathrobe is indeed comfortable and soft . It has good thickness and its design is rather nice as well . HOWEVER , it is so poorly made It 's mind boggling . After one month , the bottom seam came undone . The treads are everywhere . The stitching on the sleeve has come undone and the same on the belt . All the seems are barely holding the robe together . I did not even know it could be this bad , even after reading the above reviews . Do not buy this robe , unless you are interested in a disposable robe for a $ 40 plus price tag .
 Very poor quality seams are not sewn well to many lose threads . For the money should have had better Quality . I bought a pair only one was good .

 I have always wanted a pair of back seam pantyhose , when I found these I thought , why not.The seam runs down the back of the leg , around the calf to the front and top of the foot , like a corkscrew , these are the lamest pantyhose I have ever had , the seam running around the outside of my leg looks really stupid , and because the foot is molded into the pantyhose , the direction of the seam can not be changed.I 'll stick with the old reliable no nonsense pantyhose , at least I know what I 'm getting when I buy them , and they never have that rediculous seam problem , Hue I 'm really disappointed .
 I 'm so glad I ordered two because the first package I opened immediately as I carefully put my pantyhose on ... a snag appeared ... second pack went on with out a problem but unfortunately can only wear them one time and out the trash they go . I rather go to an actual store and purchase these as it 's a problem having to return them via amazon . I will definately not purchase this brand again . Not worth it .
 These looked fine out of the package , but pulling them on -LRB- gently -RRB- they already had snags and then ran at the toe after a few hours ' wear . I had to toss them .
 They fit perfect and are beautiful . They snagged 5 times in the course of 8 hours . I will not buy these again . I am going to shell out more money and hope for the best
 These would be exactly what I wanted except they came with two noticeable holes in them so that I ca n't wear them .
 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .
 I never recieved the item . the company said that i recieved it on a certain date and i did n't . when i wrote them emails , i got responses that led me to a blank page . i 'm not sure if theyre bogus or wut but im out $ 60 and have no dress .

 Its adorable but its the size of a cloth diaper or a burp pad , not a blanket . It is cute though
 Not what I had hoped at all . It bake smooshed in the package . Looked nothing like the picture . My daughter could n't even wear it
 I quickly received this from the seller , I was disappointed in how small the chain is . Around my little 13 year old brothers neck it nearly chokes him . Also wanted to say the chain itself is made of some weird kind of metal feels very flimsy and not very durable despite its weight.Other than that only Pro is that it looks cool . .
 I do n't like this top at all . From the reviews , I was expecting a nicer fabric , with more support . I 'm very disappointed .
 I EXPECTED this to be for the gym to sweat in . It is more like a chemise . It is a cotton blend -LRB- does not wick moisture away from you -RRB- the built in shelf has NO support at all -LRB- I would NEVER do a 5K in it -RRB- I 'm not gon na go through the hassle of returning it ; I 'm just going to keep it for summer as the pattern is nice and will match with anything .
 I thought this looked so nice in the picture -- but I was so horrified when it came that I never even tried it on . It is definitely more sweater than jacket , and the material is thin . It is also sparkly -- there are small glitter-like pieces in the fabric . Looks appropriate for an elderly woman .
 I usually love Cranium products . I ordered this for my 5 year old for Christmas . The shoes did not clip-clop at all . The batteries are those small watch batteries , so I did not bother to replace them to see if it would work . We returned it . It was a disappointment for that much money !
 I ordered these to wear for a fun rally at the school I run . They were so cheaply made they were breaking as they were being put on the first time . I had to duct tape my zipepr shut to hold in the air . We got 5 minutes of use out of them and thankfully that was all we needed . I would NOT buy these again . Buyer beware .
 I was planning on ordering this for a college event at my University and it was dreadful . The Material was not what i was expecting , the Fan had to be kept running , which i had to use duct tape to hold the button to keep continuous inflation . With the Fan running all the time it has this UNBEARABLE ANNOYING sound all the time ! I am 6 ' 2 and it came up to my knees , the buyer should have specified that it was n't adult size in height . The fan had to be kept running to keep it from deflating completely . Even then , you ca n't move without it deflating A LOT . I tried to make it funny to try and move my belly to see my feet , and i pushed with such little force , and it deflated the belly then had to wait about a minute for it to refill . You ca n't move fast in it , Cant wrestle in it , and you will be disappointed . Do not buy this product . I would never make this purchase again.If you want to blow 40 bucks for a product you 'll only use for about an hour tops , go ahead .
 The fan broke within 10 minutes . we rigged a fan of our own up to it and it worked fairly well . despite the poor construction , the costume was very fun .
 This costume broke before we left the house . The fan did n't inflate the costume . Overall cheaply made ! Very disappointed . Would n't buy
 The costume is fun ... hilarious on my 13 year old . But the zippers for the back and the fan both broke after maybe 2 times trying it on . Also the fan started making a high pitched noise when it first started . The fan finally stopped making the noise and we used duck tape to close up the back so it was usable for halloween night but really not worth the money .
 The zipper came broken , and it was like impossible to return it so I finally gave up . Not worth it . .
 Couldnt even use it , zipper broke while putting on the sumo costume . Tried using duct tape but that didnt work .
 This was the worst use of money ever . The suit does n't stay inflated , and the zipper on the backside will break off if/when you try to use it . There 's nothing good about this costume .
 I was disappointed in this costume . The matterial was not what expected . It did not expand like I expected . The fan was not strong enough to keep the suit expanded eought to look good . And the fan switch was to hard to turn on and off . It should also be on the back side of the fan so you could reach int better . Also you should put a height size on this and I bought one child sumo costume and adult size costume for my daughter but the child one was too short and the adult one was to loose around the arms and neck and ankles to keep the air in . Also should give more detail about the costume . Show where the fan goes . I was disappointed in the pocket for the fan because again it let to much air out so the costume would not expand as much as it should . Again very disappointed and I will be returning them .
 I bought this costume to use as our mascot THE SUMO BOY and it worked really well , but the fan which inflates the costume became too noisy and annoying after a few times I used it . If you 're going to use it only a few times it 'd be a great buy .
 Either my head is huge or this hat is made for children . It did not fit at all , and the product page did not specify how small the hat is .
 Ordered this for my husband for x-mas . Disappointed this hat was n't structured . Threw it in the back of the closet . I might wear it someday .
 This cap is small for me and I thinking about returning it.One star since the size is not specified .
 I really wish I could post a picture of the item I received but alas ... I guess I can &#8217; t for a third party seller !? Well , the product picture here looks like a ball cap with a tight bottom seem running around the cap itself and tight to the bill . The one I received looks like a &#8216; flat cap &#8217; where the cap and bill meet ; the bottom sides of the cap are &#8216; rolled &#8217; under making the part of the cap that transits the bill puffy -LRB- not a tight seem -RRB- . This &#8216; puffiness &#8217; continues around the hat . The bill is also very short -LRB- about the size of a baseball cap ; this is not evident from the product pictures -RRB- &#8230; so , do not confuse this to be a tight stitched ball cap . It &#8217; s more like a puffy cap with a baby bill . Also , I know this is a Washed Contrast cap but really ?! The one in the picture is way more vibrant ! I wanted the one in the picture , not the one I got!That said , I like the Velcro closure but that &#8217; s about it.And so my search continues for a low profile black , 100 % cotton ball cap !
 I had ordered this Burnt Orange / Light Sand Vintage Washed Contrast Baseball Cap , after i paid and waited for two weeks they had finally told me that they had discontinued making them and were out of stock , without giving me my money back , I just dislike how they did n't tell me and that they still advertised it .
 The hat came in a plastic bag and looked a bit dull . I ended up buying my dad another hat and sending this one back . Maybe for a younger guy ?
 I ordered a brown cap but the color looked more faded when I actually got the item in the mail .
 I like this look of this hat . The navy color is nice and the tan stitching prevents it from just looking like a blob of color on my head . However , after owning the hat for a month or so , the color is fading horribly and unevenly . There is a big blog of faded color on the font to where it almost looks like something spilled on it . I can guarantee you that I spilled nothing on it . Other parts of it are fading as well . For the price of this hat , the color should have held up longer than a month . It the color did n't fade in such a blotchy way , I would definitely rate this hat higher . But as it is now , I 'll probably only wear it while doing chores in the yard .
 Looked great when I got it.Sizing was XXXL for a women not a man , and unfortunately it barely closes.Washed once , cold water to remove excess dye and six -LSB- 6 -RSB- seams came apart and needed repair . The sleeves are long enough , just the middle or girth could have used a little bit extra material.Most of the stitching was loose and had to be gone over anyway , both belt loops were just hanging on by threads.I actually like the feel of the robe so I gave it one star .
 I typically use a more streamlined sock . This one came off as way too cushioned and did n't breathe well at all . My foot was wet and full of fuzzies . It would be a decent winter running sock .
 Although this top is okay , the matching skirt is awful . I ca n't use it and want to send it back . Thank you for your concern . How do I return this stuff ?
 This review may be the result of my choosing to go cheap to get the job done . The product is fairly well made for the price but is quite flimsy for my application . Namely hauling snorkel gear and assorted goodies around.Used for hauling clothes only I still feel the product is marginal at best . It is large , but when you make something that will barely do large is a bad thing . Spend your money wisely and avoid this one .
 Lost its shape so quickly . I took it on vacation and had to stash it in my luggage and it lost it 's shape now the brim is loose and flimsy . I still like he material and it looks pretty but have to maneuver it to get it to sit right on my head .
 I ordered the large 100 % Cashmere Shawl . Label says `` Pashmina Boutique '' 100 % Cashmere . After wearing it 2 or 3 times , it sheds terribly , pills and looks awful . Plus , about a week after I ordered from this company , I got a message that my credit card info had been compromised by this vendor 's lack of security.Avoid this company .
 The scarf is lovely and warm but my son ca n't wear it because it sheds white on his black jacket . I 've tried various treatments to prevent the shedding but none work . So the scarf stays in the closet .

 After taking these shirts out of the package I unfortunately discovered that Calvin Klein uses a cheap and damaging tape on these shirts . The sticky part of the tape is embedded into the fabric of the shirts and does not come out . So , now I have two shirts that are ruined by the tape used in the packaging . They are acceptable only as undershirts ... expensive , sticky undershirts .
 I got a Large timbuk2 and from the rides i 've taken it on , it is n't very comfortable . I got a strap pad , hoping this would fix the problem but it still persists . When i bought the bag it did n't come with the strap pad or a cross strap but from carrying a chrome citizen messenger bag and this , the chrome definitely beats it in at area of comfortability . The one plus is that it definitely is very roomy .
 The Timbuk 2 Classic Messenger Bag is a very roomy bag . The large can fit a ton of Stuff . Unfortunately the strap is very uncomfortable.The 2 '' wide strap cuts my shoulder when the bag is loaded . The strap is also sewn on to one end which prevented me from replacing it with something more comfortable . So it sits in the corner ; looks nice but not very functionable .
 This is not flattering . It is too short . I ordered this and a size 16 . They are both exactly the same length and width ! I want to send it back . How do I do that?Thank you , Marie Sunshine
 This was total junk . It didnt come in the pictured package , just a plastic baggie . Within the first 5 mintues of wearing , one of the chains completly broke off in two , then another link detatched from the glass grip . I will be asking for a refund so I can search for something better .
 Very poor quality product
 The item was advertised as one size fits all , but they were WAY too small when i received them . I am an average size women -LRB- 10-12 -RRB- but there was no way they were going to fit : -LRB-

 Be warned of Zaftique 's questionable practices . Their apparel is hit or miss on material quality . And if the quality is a miss , they wo n't give you a refund , only store credit . And they 'll charge you another fee for the `` privilege '' of returning items at your expense.My first experience was shopping for a formal event months from now . I ordered a few items to try . When they arrived , I reviewed them and returned the items I did n't like the very next day which they received within 5 days . The `` customer service '' representative and supervisor refuse to refund and use made-up policies -LRB- ones that are NOT listed on their website or correspondence -RRB- to justify giving me only a store credit and charging me a fee for returning products . They claimed I did n't return within 30 days , and when I showed proof I had returned within 6 days of receipt then they claimed their return policy was 14 days of when the product was ordered . An item I ordered was not in stock and I waited weeks for it to ship only to find it was made of cheap fabric so I returned it the very next day -LRB- Zaftique received it back in 4 days -RRB- and then `` customer service '' tells me I have to pay a restock fee and only get store credit when I had possession of the item for less than 24 hours !! It 's absolutely ridiculous for a company to penalize a customer for their product not being in stock . And an internet store should n't charge its customers a fee to return product when you already have to pay for shipping & handling anyway.If you order from Zaftique you better make sure you want the product because you 'll have to pay something for it even if you return it .
 I have bought white shirts for years . I was hoping to find a good quality shirt that is % 100 cotton yet less of a need to iron . This shirt after one wash needed extensive ironing , and even then looks poor . It is not a thick material and does not hold up well at all with wearing . I need to wear an undershirt because it is see through .
 The dress material is not good , polyester , and cheap even though it looks good online . In addition the vendor is in China . This means you have to be careful with your cost of returning the item because of custom . The process is a pain . I was very disappointed . I believe they should disclose that the item is being shipped from out of the United States and you might possibly encounter additional cost .
 Beautiful dress design but poor quality material . Dress is extremely see-thru . You would need to have a full linning sewn onto the dress in order to wear it without looking totatlly naked . Even if you wear undergarments , -LRB- bra , slip etc. -RRB- the white areas of the dress are so see-thru that everything you wear underneath will show through unless you have it properly sewn onto the dress.Black / White Sexy Long Formal Evening Gown Dress
 I previously purchased a pair of disc covers sold by this same company , however , this pair is not the same quality . I compared the two side by side and you can visibly see the difference in the material . It makes me wonder if the company switched manufacturers . The material is thinner and cracks easily . I have to return mine because one of the sections on one cover , broke off .
 The fabric itself is acceptable but not great as you could see for the price tag of ~ 100usd , so the price after discount is even still a bit high compared to its quality.The sizing is a big big problem , size S is way far bigger than same size of any other 's brand . Recommended to buy two size smaller than what you normally wear .
 After the first washing , the shirt had a hole in it . I was disappointed because it was soooo cute .
 The passport did not have the USA Symbol or word on it . In the advertisement it said it would have it on the passport . The one I received jyst said passport on it .
 Buyer beware . This passport wallet is described as having card slots in the product description and even on the paperwork that came with it . This is not true ! It does not have any card slots . The quality of the wallet is very nice . However , you will have to carry your cards in some other way . If an item is described as having features as a main selling point , it should have them .
 How did this item double in its price in the last month ? I was interested in buying it . . but now . .
 THIS IS NOT JOHN WAITE ... JOHN WAITE IS HOT HOT HOT !! AND THIS GUY IS DEFINATELY NOT NOT NOT !!! WHAT A BUNCH OF IDIOTS !!

 Quite pretty , but I wanted to use this handkerchief to blow my nose . It is reasonably soft after washing , but it is sheerer than the old ones I am trying to replace -LRB- they were made in Switzerland many years ago -RRB- . I will keep looking for soft thick small women 's handkerchiefs .

 This hat is on the thin side for a major name but most importantly it is very small in size even though it is marked LG/EX LG IMHO ...

 After a stay in our local hospital I was introduced to the comfort of this type of product so I purchased these for indoor use only on a mix of both carpeted and tiled floors.They began showing excessive signs of wear after the 5th wearing and developed holes in the heels after the 10th washing.I still have the pair I was given at the hospital and after over 2-years use they still are holding up much better then I would have expected.I decided to go back to my local hospital -LRB- Marshall Hospital in Placerville , CA -RRB- and begged the administrator if I might be able to buy another pair but could n't because of our hospitals &#34; no-profit & community based &#34; status which I completely understand.The administrator told me the brand name and I was later able to obtain a pair from my local medical supply store and the same brand through Amazon that were less expensive -LRB- of course -RRB- and all three pairs are doing very good after more then a dozen washings and daily use.So do yourself and your feet a favor and skip this product all together !
 my socks are warm and cozy . I like to wear them at night after I take my shower and put on my pajamas and settle in for the night . The bottoms are thick enough that I do n't feel the floor when I walk across the room.I purchased my slipper socks at Amazon .
 I purchased two uniforms in the same size one in white the other in black . The black uniform 's waste was was half the size of the white and way to small to wear on any child that age . They said that it was not defective after I sent them picture of the two pairs of pants showing the size difference . When I returned the items at my own expense they not only deducted the shipping I paid but they deducted an additional 3.00 for shipping expenses . Terrible customer service . It also took them weeks to refund my money after several calls .
 I do n't usually write reviews , and I like to stay as positive as possible . But I feel I must warn others about my experience with the store/co . that tried to do business with me through Amazon.In early Nov. . I requested a men 's size Large of the Turfer Unixex Metro Fleece and they sent me an XXL ! Somebody is either in too much of a hurry , or they do n't care , or they ca n't read , or ALL of the above . When I brought it to the company 's attention , they returned a very `` breezy , '' off-hand , reply , again reinforcing my opinion of their lack of attention to matters that count . I returned the size XXL and ordered a L . So far , I have n't heard a word from the co. that sells this item . Frankly , I 've just given up . But I NEVER want to do business with them EVER again .
 Wow ... the size was so far off you could fit 2 people in this v neck sweatshirt . . not happy ... no size chart on the site ... I want to return but they want me to pay the shipping ... do n't order unless you can get some kind of sizing information from them .
 This product was received on time and in very good condition but `` fit '' people beware ! First I should say that I 'm 6 ' 1 '' and 170 lbs . No beer belly here ... and that seems to be part of the problem with the way this product fits . -LRB- Or more accurately does n't fit -RRB- I 'm pretty sure I could curl up into a ball and fit my entire body into the torso of this `` sweater '' without stretching it out . Perhaps this was designed to fit a more `` husky '' body type . If you are short and stocky you have a better chance of being satisfied with this product .
 They do not tell you that all you get is ONE handkerchief ! That is you payf $ 4.00 + $ 6.99 shipping and handling . $ 10.99 for one handkerchief . Need I say more ? Yes , it is a lovely handkerchief though .
 Well , they do not send you `` handkerchiefS '' , they send you ONE handkerchief . Need I say more ?

 Maybe the review request is a little premature , as this item has not been received and I had made that known previously . As a repeat customer this is the first time I have had a bad experience with this seller ?
 These are for younger kids , not 6 year olds . My daughter just turned 6 and they do n't fit her -LRB- and she does not have big hands -RRB-
 If you were to buy these gloves in the store they would be a dollar for a pair . They are small for what the size claimed them to be and very thin when put on . My 5 year old 's hands are nearly too big . Paper thin is the key . There is no magic about these magic stretch gloves .
 They sent a light lavender -- not really a color I can put on either of my two boys . That 's a bother , because otherwise these seem pretty good .
 I ordered two pairs for my sons -LRB- 2 and 4 -RRB- in baby blue and received 2 pairs in a light purple -LRB- lilac color -RRB- . It 's not what I ordered : -LRB-
 I searched the internet for WHITE gloves . I found them on this site . When they were delivered , they were cream , definitely not white . I ca n't use them for the intended purpose . The product is fine but if you are looking for a specific color ... beware . I would not have ordered these if they were correctly advertised .
 They fit my son well when we first got them . We washed them when they got dirty , in cool water with like colors . They shrunk so much they no longer fit him . They do not stretch enough to fit his hands anymore .

 I recently purchased this shirt . The design is really great , but when I washed it -LRB- even in cold water -RRB- , the shirt shrank horribly . If you are a medium size , order the large .
 The handle is broken before I took it out of the box .
 I 'm going to have to return it . It is made of cheap vinyl and looks like it . The clasp and handle attachments are cheap-looking , too.It is also tiny.All in all , it would only be good to give to a child for dress-up , but you could get a bag for that at Goodwill and help handicapped people and save money at the same time . Heck , for the price they are charging for one of these , you could get 20 bags at Goodwill or Salvation Army if they are 50 cents each .
 Jacket came with horrible smell that no amount of washing could fix . I even tried dryer sheet in a bag with no luck . Smells like a crude oil refinery , and stank up my whole bedroom . PLEASE DO NOT BUY !!!
 my fault for not checking the reviews . i 'm a medium . i wear a size 40 jacket and that 's what i ordered based on the size chart . what i got was not even close to what i was expecting . the jacket is ill fitting -LRB- i 'd bet it still fits poorly in the right size -RRB- and oddly shaped . it does n't have the seams and lines of a traditional denim jacket . i could have got a better jacket for $ -LSB- ... -RSB- at Walgreen 's . since the cost of returning the jacket was half the cost of the jacket and more than the jacket is probably worth , it basically went from the shipping box to the trash bin . my advice ? spring for a trusted brand .
 the size runs really small , if ordering qne order 1-2 sizes bigger than you wear . Alos shipping is very very slow , so do n't get in no hurry . Would not recomend doing bisnuess with this company again ,

 I read all the reviews and it was like half bad and half good reviews so i took the chance and ordered it . I got it here before it was supposed to come like 5 days before which was cool but once i got it i was really disappointed . I own a levi trucker jacket ... this one was nothing like it . The size was bigger than a regular medium ... . and it was real baggy and it was really odd shaped like i read in one review . Im returned it the next day . Honestly even though levi 's are pricey , they are totally worth the money and they last forever . I don `` t recommend this jacket . Please trust the reviews .
 I do n't usually write reviews , and I like to stay as positive as possible . But I feel I must warn others about my experience with the store/co . that tried to do business with me through Amazon.In early Nov. . I requested a men 's size Large of the Turfer Unixex Metro Fleece and they sent me an XXL ! Somebody is either in too much of a hurry , or they do n't care , or they ca n't read , or ALL of the above . When I brought it to the company 's attention , they returned a very `` breezy , '' off-hand , reply , again reinforcing my opinion of their lack of attention to matters that count . I returned the size XXL and ordered a L . So far , I have n't heard a word from the co. that sells this item . Frankly , I 've just given up . But I NEVER want to do business with them EVER again .
 Wow ... the size was so far off you could fit 2 people in this v neck sweatshirt . . not happy ... no size chart on the site ... I want to return but they want me to pay the shipping ... do n't order unless you can get some kind of sizing information from them .
 This product was received on time and in very good condition but `` fit '' people beware ! First I should say that I 'm 6 ' 1 '' and 170 lbs . No beer belly here ... and that seems to be part of the problem with the way this product fits . -LRB- Or more accurately does n't fit -RRB- I 'm pretty sure I could curl up into a ball and fit my entire body into the torso of this `` sweater '' without stretching it out . Perhaps this was designed to fit a more `` husky '' body type . If you are short and stocky you have a better chance of being satisfied with this product .
 First time , were ok , but the material inside breaks down . I carried these in and out and only wore them at the stand . It a gimmick , but if you do n't believe me , then buy em .
 They do not tell you that all you get is ONE handkerchief ! That is you payf $ 4.00 + $ 6.99 shipping and handling . $ 10.99 for one handkerchief . Need I say more ? Yes , it is a lovely handkerchief though .
 Well , they do not send you `` handkerchiefS '' , they send you ONE handkerchief . Need I say more ?
 These are for younger kids , not 6 year olds . My daughter just turned 6 and they do n't fit her -LRB- and she does not have big hands -RRB-
 If you were to buy these gloves in the store they would be a dollar for a pair . They are small for what the size claimed them to be and very thin when put on . My 5 year old 's hands are nearly too big . Paper thin is the key . There is no magic about these magic stretch gloves .
 They sent a light lavender -- not really a color I can put on either of my two boys . That 's a bother , because otherwise these seem pretty good .
 I ordered two pairs for my sons -LRB- 2 and 4 -RRB- in baby blue and received 2 pairs in a light purple -LRB- lilac color -RRB- . It 's not what I ordered : -LRB-
 I searched the internet for WHITE gloves . I found them on this site . When they were delivered , they were cream , definitely not white . I ca n't use them for the intended purpose . The product is fine but if you are looking for a specific color ... beware . I would not have ordered these if they were correctly advertised .
 They fit my son well when we first got them . We washed them when they got dirty , in cool water with like colors . They shrunk so much they no longer fit him . They do not stretch enough to fit his hands anymore .
 I bought this cami for my mom but I had to return it . Was not as expected . The color was perfect though .

 I have previously bought a lot of these shirts . Over time , a peculiar problem surfaced . Shrinkage -LRB- natural in a cotton shirt -RRB- affected one side of the front of the shirt , in the up and down direction , more than the other . As a result , the button holes in the placket increasingly became farther apart than the buttons , causing the shirt to have extensive wrinkling on the button side . I am not a tailor , but what I suspect happened is that the Banks buyers failed to specify how the warp and woof of the fabric were to be matched -- an expensive mistake.A second problems arises from product sizing . When I moved from a 16.5-34 to a 17-34 , the shirt suddenly became a tent.I have not had these problems with other manufacturers , notably Eagle , Land 's End and Enro .
 Bad fit for an ordinary guy . I ca n't imagine who they design such shirts for!I had luck with one of their Traveler shirts - really nice , and attempted to get another twice - no more !
 L'artisana customer service rep `` who also claimed to be owner and President of the company '' verbally abused me on the telephone . Will NEVER do business with this firm again as well as tell everyone I know so they wo n't make the same mistake I did of ordering from this firm - and expecting good customer service .
 `` Vic '' in L'artisana customer serivce department identified himself as the owner and President of the company . He verbally abused me on the telephone , not only screaming at me but using foul language . NO product is worth being abused when a customer calls about an order being wrong - when I called about my latest order that was shorted on the number of items ordered as well as items that I did not order . Absolutely the WORST customer service .

 I bought these to replace an identical pair I broke . The polarization was so strong I could see the reflection of my eye staring back at me in the right lens . My broken pair didnt have the mirror `` feature '' , so I bought a second replacement pair after returning the first ... same defect ! Ray Ban needs to improve the quality on the right lens . At least the return process was easy .

 I have worn silk camisoles and tank tops for years , under sweatshirts at home and under shirts at work in the winter , for that extra and lightweight layer of warmth . Mine have usually lasted many years and through dozens of hand washings . I only purchased these because my favorite ones were suddenly not to be found anywhere online . They looked promising , but were ultimately disappointing . The blue tank was significantly smaller than the black in the same size , but still a good fit . The stitching on both tanks began to unravel after only one or two wearings and before I 'd even hand washed them , around the arms on the blue tank and along the hemline on the black one . Then , the black one began to shred -LRB- as silk is likely to do , eventually -RRB- almost immediately , as the hemline was no longer supported . I could n't believe it ! Worse , amazon.com does n't seem interested in standing behind its products , because I 'd passed some arbitrary 30-day mark and it was n't simply an exchange of an unworn item . I will definitely not be purchasing this brand of shirts again , and I will think twice before ordering any items again from amazon.com . It 's hard to believe that the largest online store in the world does n't have a better method for dealing with faulty products . I 'm speechless .

 1 - Defective design
 I bought this nautica t-shirts a month ago . . and they are damn cheap when compared to the price in the mall ... I was expecting them much later but I got them few days after I ordered them ... only problem I have is the tee 's are lil bit loose even though they are small size ...
 The Timbuk 2 Classic Messenger Bag is a very roomy bag . The large can fit a ton of Stuff . Unfortunately the strap is very uncomfortable.The 2 '' wide strap cuts my shoulder when the bag is loaded . The strap is also sewn on to one end which prevented me from replacing it with something more comfortable . So it sits in the corner ; looks nice but not very functionable .
 I got a Large timbuk2 and from the rides i 've taken it on , it is n't very comfortable . I got a strap pad , hoping this would fix the problem but it still persists . When i bought the bag it did n't come with the strap pad or a cross strap but from carrying a chrome citizen messenger bag and this , the chrome definitely beats it in at area of comfortability . The one plus is that it definitely is very roomy .

 I am very unimpressed by this product . Sizing is very small and the product it flimzy and poorly made . After 2 washings it had shrunk to the point where I just threw it away . I would n't recommend this product to anyone .
 I bought Uvex Shooter Sport sunglasses two months ago . Within one month the plasic frame broke but was still usable - just now , it broke for good . Save $ 40 , do n't make the same mistake .
 I read about the collar tips to wear off . Not only this but white shirts do tend change color to a dirty white . These issues and the price encouraged me to try other brands . Other brands of the same age do not tend to decolor but the wear in the collar tips is unavoidable .
 I wore this shirt for one day every other week and after five months the collar points have worn through and the white material underneath is showing through . It 's a blue shirt so I ca n't wear it to work now . Unacceptable in a shirt of this price !
 I bought this cami for my mom but I had to return it . Was not as expected . The color was perfect though .
 The pic that I ordered showed a knee length half slip . Instead I received 3 long half slips from Her Room . I can not use the long half slips and I sent them back.Also , I had bought them with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and could n't find where to apply that , so the cost was put on my visa.Thanks.Jeanne Allen

 I promptly received this business card holder . It looks great , but it 's not the same one pictured in the images ! I was dissapointed that it is not at all distressed , the stitching is not white -LRB- it is in fact , black -RRB- , and it 's a much , much darker brown.It 's a cool product , but it 's not the product I thought I was purchasing .5 Stars if they had not misrepresented themselves .
 The item is on back order ... they have promised me to send as and when available ... I am not sure when ... lets hope soon ...
 I am very unimpressed by this product . Sizing is very small and the product it flimzy and poorly made . After 2 washings it had shrunk to the point where I just threw it away . I would n't recommend this product to anyone .
 Not recommended . It 's too big particularly for people 5 ' 4 and under .
 Poor quality , the bottom tore after 1 month , I never had anything heavy in there .
 This backpack would work fine for gym clothes or storing extra sneakers in a school locker . Does not work as a book bag . Tears easily and strings break .
 I ordered product roughly a month ago and it has yet to arrive . To be honest , I would like my money back . By far the worst service I have experienced while ordering from Amazon .
 this item sucks ... it lasted 2weeks . . my son walked home from school and the bottom ripped apart ... his books fell to the ground . . he had to carry them home and i had to sew the backsack together again ... and of course it ripped again in another spot and i just had to go and buy him another one at a better store
 One of the bags is already tearing on the side . Oh well , what do you expect for $ 2.95 .
 I did not order any red drawstring backpack . There is obviously a mistake somewhere . I gave this One Star because there was no other way to send this to you . Someone is tinkering with my account.Ronald Kalicak
 well the size its not realy medium , it is bigger than common M sized polo . . the color is `` unique '' and perfect and the cotton is very nice ... the polo is fine but the size dont match with a medium polo . . i cant use it
 This bag , although at first appears to be a durable bag , will not hold up to the rigors of everyday use if you carry anything other than light clothing . It might be ok for usage to the gym , but for an everyday workbag to carry lunch items , newspapers , books , and water ... it wo n't last more than 6 months or so without showing signs of severe damage . I moved onto a Galls bag and it takes 10 times the abuse and does n't fall apart . Try a Galls bag instead .
 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .
 Being 175 centimeters tall -- or short , if you will -- I thought it to beclever to choose size L. I wanted to get a good fit by allowing for someshrinkage due to washing it , you know.As it turned out , this piece of garnment is incredibly wide at the hipwhile it barely reaches my ankles . And my proportions are such that mylegs are not overly long for sure . You must be obese to have a good fit.If you are a slim guy like me - forget it . This product is expensive toboot . It does keep my legs warm but around the hip it feels like alousy sack .
 I 'm up here in the oil fields of North Dakota , wearing the Smartwools as I type this on my iPad , it is currently 7 degrees f and my legs are freezing under a heavy pair of Carhartt fire resistant jeans . I drive a truck along with loading and unloading , which puts me out in the elements . It is getting cold , normal temp at night is roughly 7 to 20 degrees F . Some nights it will hit -40 f with the wind chill , a little cold . I was looking for an upgrade from my good old Carhartt heavyweight cotton thermals , read the reviews and shelled out the cash hoping these would be better than the old fashioned thermal gear I already own.These Smartwool bottoms are nicely constructed , but paper thin . I think wool , I think heavy or a bit thicker . Now , according to the product description these are the heaviest bottoms Smartwool makes , for forays into `` Alpine '' environments . They are nice , but if you are looking to use these in temps below 30f , I would look elsewhere unless you plan on using these as the base , or the first layer under a good set of thermal bottoms . If I put my Carhartt heavyweight thermals over these I am comfortable ... But ! I honestly get the same comfort and warmth with the Carhartts alone . In other words , for me personally , these were a waste of hard earned money.If you are looking for something to wear in the early fall to take the chill out on that walk to the mailbox , these should be fine . Not for real `` Alpine '' environments , much less extreme cold in real world conditions . Save your money and look at a good old fashioned set of thermals if you will be out in the weather when the temps are lower than say 40 degrees f. Put it this way , I would not wear these under my jeans to clear my driveway of snow.Just to add ... I own the Smartwool heavyweight socks , they are really nice , heavy enough to wick away the moisture , very warm and comfortable .
 I liked the style and size of the fanny pack . I like the comfort of a leather waist strap over the cloth straps on the other fanny packs I have used in the past . Compartments are of good size and number . The zipper on the main compartment broke after only a couple months of use . It is a shame that a good quality pack is ruined by a poor quality zipper
 The main zipper split open over and over again , so I bought a zipper at a fabric shop and had it replaced by a shoe repairman . Now the back pocket zipper has split . The bag could last for a good while but the zippers are totally cheap . I would give this bag no stars . It was a waste of money and a major source of irritation .
 I got a Large timbuk2 and from the rides i 've taken it on , it is n't very comfortable . I got a strap pad , hoping this would fix the problem but it still persists . When i bought the bag it did n't come with the strap pad or a cross strap but from carrying a chrome citizen messenger bag and this , the chrome definitely beats it in at area of comfortability .

 These bibs are a big waste of money!They are too difficult to get around my son 's neck , and he HATES it when i put them on him!Then , once it 's finally on , he is constantly getting his arms stuck under it and getting frustrated that he ca n't get his hands to his mouth.Also , the pocket part of the bib is always getting smooshed by the highchair tray so that no food can get into it , so it all ends up on his lap - what 's the point of a pocket bib then?They are easily cleanable and wipeable and do n't have to hang dry forever ... those are the only positive things I have to say about them.I recommend trying the Bumkins bibs instead , we love them!Grade

 I really was disappointment when I got this dress . It really made me look dowdy in it . I wear a size small and I felt fat it .
 The Timbuk 2 Classic Messenger Bag is a very roomy bag . The large can fit a ton of Stuff . Unfortunately the strap is very uncomfortable.The 2 '' wide strap cuts my shoulder when the bag is loaded . The strap is also sewn on to one end which prevented me from replacing it with something more comfortable . So it sits in the corner ; looks nice but not very functionable .
 I got a Large timbuk2 and from the rides i 've taken it on , it is n't very comfortable . I got a strap pad , hoping this would fix the problem but it still persists . When i bought the bag it did n't come with the strap pad or a cross strap but from carrying a chrome citizen messenger bag and this , the chrome definitely beats it in at area of comfortability . The one plus is that it definitely is very roomy .
 I bought the reversible cashmere cape recently and tried to return it because it left lint on my clothes . The black side left black lint and the white side left white lint . I called Cashmere Pashmina and they said their products do n't shed . I have been wearing cashmere for years and have never had this problem . But they said to send it back , which I did , but they then sent it back to me saying that they will not refund my money because it was worn and I had taken the little sticker off it and it had a perfume scent on it . Of course I had to try it on . Most people will try on clothes before they buy or before they decide to keep something they 've ordered . I do n't know if this cape is 100 percent cashmere as they claim because of the shedding . A Wall St. Journal article recently found that a lot of inexpensive cashmere from China , which this is , is mixed with other kinds of wool . Anyway , if it did n't shed , I would n't have minded it . Also , they have a 20 percent restocking fee for returned items so keep that in mind before you order something .
 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in .

 This is a very poorly made costume and you get WAY too overly overheated.Also that this is only in adult sizes and my son bought this product and this made him miss a very nice halloween party because this was in such bad condition and WAY too big . Think twice before you click that buy button and really think that is this worthless piece of junk really worth your time and 40 dollars ?!? Be wise , and do n't buy this product .

 I bought this nautica t-shirts a month ago . . and they are damn cheap when compared to the price in the mall ... I was expecting them much later but I got them few days after I ordered them ... only problem I have is the tee 's are lil bit loose even though they are small size ...

 I like these jeans , but they are short . I have the same jeans bought 1 year ago , and they are longer , If you are an `` almost tall '' these would not be the pair for you.The fit around the waist is good and the color is good .
 Ordered 2 pair and loved them . Great shape , great fit . After a short time both pair developed big tears at the reinforcement stitching on the fly , and holes at the corners of the back pockets . I 'm throwing both pairs away . The dark finish might be okay . Mine are the sanded finish that must weaken the fabric .

 Scratchy , not soft -- felt like a $ 3 Gildan shirt relabled at a higher price . Seems like a lot of higher - $ $ shirts are really just Gildan in disguise .
 Like the other reviewer indicates in his review , I bought these shorts expecting a 10 '' inseam , but they arrived with an 8 '' inseam . The description lists these shorts as having a 10 '' inseam . I wish I had read his review before ordering ! I called the store -LRB- 1-800-569-9038 -RRB- and in their system , this short DOES have an 8 '' inseam , so they think they sent me the appropriate item . They need to fix the info on this page ! Anyway , I was determined not to have to pay return shipping for their error . I explained the situation , and they are sending me a FedEx slip with postage paid and I can return the shorts in that . So in the end , I will have to eat the costs of shipping the shorts TO me -LRB- they wo n't refund that -RRB- and of course , I never got the shorts I wanted . At least I do n't have to pay to return them , thank goodness . Still -- it 's annoying .
 Although the item was listed as having a 10 '' inseam , it only had an 8 '' inseam . Had I known this , I would never have purchased the shorts . Because of the inaccurate listing , I had to pay shipping both ways - for delivery and to return the item . In sum , I would never do business with this seller again .
 These shorts come with a non-standard 8 '' inseams that will likely not fit anyone who is ordering their waist size if they wear a 10 '' inseam . In fact , I have a few Columbia shorts and the standard size for the inseam is 10 '' on all of them -LRB- mind you these were off the rack at Columbia stores , in their standard sizes -RRB- . 10 '' also happens to be the size that is advertized on the site , although now it says 8 '' and 10 '' inseams , without the option of choosing which one you will receive.I have asked Amazon to replace the items since they claim that the 10 '' size is available and will see how it goes . However , I would recommend that you stay clear from these shorts since they will likely not fit , unless you know an 8 '' inseam is the correct size .

 I was not especially happy with this `` Deluxe '' costume . The size that came was not the size that I ordered , it was a whole different sizing chart . The costume fit because I had ordered a size big , but it only just fit . Also the head piece did not fit like the one pictured and the seams came apart in some places after only wearing it one time . I had hoped to be able to use it a few times , as Scooby Doo is my four year olds favorite character , but I do n't think it will hold up . While my son looked cute in this outfit , I was disappointed with it .
 These costumes are ridiculously sized . My son wears a 4/5 . I ordered 4-6 , which NOW I see is supposed to fit a 3-4 yr old . That 's not smart sizer people !!! I 'm sure every mom expects to order this and get a 4-6 that fits a 4-6T ! You do n't know it either until you read the package that you are shipped .

 These are great caps and I have used them for years - work well for driving because no brim . HOWEVER , the caps I received in this last shipment -LRB- I seem to lose them regularly -RRB- have a VERY toxic smell . I have smelled this before and believe it is the black dye they are using in China - where there is very little consumer/environmental protection . I have returned an office chair because of this smell - no matter how long I left it outside to outgas , the toxic fumes would not go away - likewise a Grizzly sleeping bag more recently.I am letting these hats outgas in the mist for a few weeks and will probably wash them to see if I can make progress.Very disappointed.Greg
 My 13 '' MacBook could barely squeeze into the laptop compartment of this bag . I was sad to return it . Your computer must be tiny in order to use this bag .
 Wow , this is hands-down the pointiest bra I have tried on . Besides that , the front closure makes a weird crinkly sound . I will be returning it post haste .
 This is the third Playtex bra I 've purchased that has an overwhelming smell of rubber in the entire bra . This bra is very comfortable and fits exactly as it should . However , everytime I put it on , I smell the rubbery odor and ca n't get past that huge drawback . Washing only intensifies the smell . I do n't want to waste the purchase price and after owning the bra for 2 weeks , decided to spray cologne on my body -LRB- not the bra -RRB- to mask most of the smell . I hope nobody else can get a whiff of the offensive smell and think the weird odor is ME ! This will be the last Playtex bra I buy . Three strikes and they 're out of my life .
 I bought this bra several years ago . It has stood up to multiple machine washings and provides very good support . Unfortunately it is also very uncomfortable ; the front closure digs into my skin .
 Playtex should be ashamed ! Fabric is cheap and stiff , lace is cheap and scratchy , only 4 hooks , when there should be 6 or at the miniumum 5 . I am not returning , but have passed it on to a friend who &#34; does n't care &#34; . I have purchased Playtex forever , but if this is their quality now , then I will no longer purchase any Playtex bra .
 My chiropractor suggested that I get a bra with more back support and I saw a lot good reviews for this bra . When I received it and put it on , I definitely felt like I was gettin a lot of back support but the cups were so pointy that I looked like I was wearing cones for a bra ! The bottom of the fastening strip kept coming apart and because it 's made with a thick and stick material , it was rubbing my skin so hard that it was raw . If it was n't for the cup issue and my skin being rubbed raw , I would like this bra a lot !
 My wife said they were not even.close to.being the correct size . They were marked with her size but actually several to large . Very disappointing .
 I do not like this bra - it feels like I am wearing a horse harness , it is so big and bulky .
 I am finding that Platex bras no longer are comfortable or are their sizes exact . I had been so happy with them in the past and did not mind paying a higher price for comfort and style , but no more . This bra was the most uncomfortable I have ever worn and gave it away soon after it arrived . Like so many products made today I find Playtex disappointing . Wearing another brand and love them .
 This bra is not for the younger generation and was not attractive . It runs big and gives you the `` cone '' look . Had to return it .
 I do n't know , but I ordered a 40C , and when I tried to put this contraption on , it was as though I was trying to put on a 28B . I 'm not kidding . The straps were SHORT , even though I extended them all the way . And , there is NO WAY it is a 40 . MAYBE a 28 , BUT I doubt it . I could n't even get the thing on . The other 40C bras from a diff manuf fit fine ...
 The straps are so thick on this bra that I do n't own a single shirt that I can wear it under where the straps do n't show by my neck . It 's unwearable for this fact by itself . It 's also not true to fit . I bought a 38DD and it is very , very tight under my breasts . It also makes `` the girls '' look very pointy.I bought this bra for back support since I have been having middle back pain recently and it does n't seem to be any more supportive than a cheap bra from Target .
 I do n't live close to many stores that sell bras in size 40DDD so I took to purchasing them online . I had high hopes for this bra because of the flex back and that it was front close bra . First of all I could barely get past the chemical and rubber smell when it came out of the package . Secondly the band size must run small as I could barely get it closed in the front . Third because it has five hooks in the front it came up very high on my chest and very low under my bust resulting it a very constricting and uncomfortable fit . Fourth the cups give you that unnatural cone shape . I immediately put it in the box to be returned .
 I purchased this hoping ir would be easier to get on because of my arthritis . It actually is harder and th elastic does not give very much . I find I do n't wear it .
 I have enjoyed Playtex products in the past , but this product was a big disappointment . The bra was actually too tight and normally Playtex runs true to size . When removed the product by the end of the day , actually had cuts where the bra had dug into skin and broke the skin . DO NOT BUY .
 The quality of the bra is fine , but I ordered the same size in black as I ordered in the white . The black bra is too tight and the white bra is too loose . I had paid to return them once before to order a size larger and was not going to pay to return them again . I am now stuck with 2 bras and neither of them fit properly .
 I should 've known better , because I 've had issues with Playtex bras before -- I had to order one band size up for it it fit . It did fit -- good coverage , soft . I had it on 10 minutes and had to take it off . The arm pit area is too high up . I hate that . It feels like you 're stuffed . I ca n't honestly believe anyone likes that feeling . I have crossed Playtex off my list forever and will stick with Glamorize bras . I just wanted to try something different ... lol Not recommended . I 'm a large lady ... hard to find sizes that support and fit well -- that are COMFORTABLE . The girls were hoisted up enough , but I was not a happy camper . Off to the charity bag it goes .
 The item came on time , but the `` size small '' was way too big for anyone , it would be a Large at many other stores . I dont even wear them because they are way too big for me .
 When I saw , `` Children 's Construction Hard Hat -LRB- Designs may vary -RRB- '' , I thought that perhaps the sticker on the front of the `` Children 's Construction Hat '' may be different than what I was seeing on the website . Um . Wrong . Instead of a construction hat , I received a Firefighter 's Helmet ... ! While it is not worth returning , it forces me to go elsewhere to look for a construction hat . A firefighter 's helmet does n't quite go with the construction vest nor the tool workbench I intend on giving my nephew for his birthday . :-RRB- Just be warned . Had I read that `` design may vary '' meant you may not get a construction hat at all , I would have selected a different `` construction hat '' .
 I bought this for my son to go with a tool belt . I LOVES this hat . THe first words out of his mouth when he wakes up are `` HaNDY MANNY '' -LRB- TM -RRB- hat . Although this product is NOT trademarked with the Handy Manny series/logo nor is it advertised as such , it makes him feel like one of his heros . The inner band that sizes the hat tends to come undone , but it clips back in fairly easily . Overall , I am thrilled that my son is thrilled.Update
 The price is right but the hat has an annoying flaw . The plastic insert for adjusting the hat to head size slips in and out of the inner hat grooves too easily . So , we end up with a detached insert -LRB- think plastic shell -RRB- and the hard hat that , if worn without the insert , hurts like crazy because the grooves are little hard plastic pegs that stick out and poke your head . My son is constantly asking me to affix the insert that seems to come off every time he merely lifts the hat on or off his head , or if the hat slides to one side . Even though this one is inexpensive , I would recommend another hat because the hat actually does n't serve its purpose if it wo n't stay on a kid 's head or hurts him !
 The hat was ok , the strap was a little bent and was a bit uncomfortable . It made a cute addition to the tool chest I gave to my nephew though .
 cute hat , adjustable band is a good feature , however , the hat cracked within one hour of my 2 year old playing with it .
 Product was a flimsy material to begin with and lousy craftmanship . It makes people think and THEN buy more durable products which are sold in the U.S.A. Buy AMERICAN and you ca n't go wrong , more expensive but You pay for solid quality . Besides , it does n't fit !
 Its ok , it does n't really fit me very well . It comes in handy every once in a while , but i do n't use it much anymore .
 It 's so tied on my face even I have small head , and I bought another one was shipping from `` Horizon Industries '' , turned out they are exactly the same , came out from same manufacture , but the prices are big different ! I paid $ 19.38 VS $ 8.55 -LRB- include shipping -RRB- . What 's wrong with this picture ? I called & after discussed , they offered 20 % 0ff -LRB- refund $ 2.00 -RRB- , big deal ! Both of them are no good for me .
 The title kind of says it all . If you 're going to wear linen , it should be comfortable and these were not . If you are going to buy them , get them in white because the stone is hideous
 This costume is cute , but its a little cheap looking . The fabric looks a lot thinner than in the picture . The boots and mittens are wonderful .
 This review applies to all 2 -LRB- x -RRB- ist Men 's Jeans . While the color is great , the fabric is cheap and VERY thin . I bought 4 of these jeans and dont even wear them b/c the material is very thin . Im afraid if i move to fast i might rip the jeans right at the seams . I dont recommend these jeans .
 Crazy Color blue pretty uggly - and sizes are incorrect - buy big if you want them to fit - not worth the time or money
 I bought this nautica t-shirts a month ago . . and they are damn cheap when compared to the price in the mall ... I was expecting them much later but I got them few days after I ordered them ... only problem I have is the tee 's are lil bit loose even though they are small size ...
 It does not fit my Army M-65 field jacket . The buttons do not fit the openings . Very unconfortable dressing . I supposed that it would fit since I bought it from Amazon and because it is standard measurements . At least I thought it was . I was dead wrong .
 Poor quality , the button holes do not line up with the ones on the coat they make and I do n't know what they insulated it with but it must be fiberglass like what you use to insulate your home , very itchy and uncomfortable . The thing is made in China so there ya go .

 Like the other reviewer indicates in his review , I bought these shorts expecting a 10 '' inseam , but they arrived with an 8 '' inseam . The description lists these shorts as having a 10 '' inseam . I wish I had read his review before ordering ! I called the store -LRB- 1-800-569-9038 -RRB- and in their system , this short DOES have an 8 '' inseam , so they think they sent me the appropriate item . They need to fix the info on this page ! Anyway , I was determined not to have to pay return shipping for their error . I explained the situation , and they are sending me a FedEx slip with postage paid and I can return the shorts in that . So in the end , I will have to eat the costs of shipping the shorts TO me -LRB- they wo n't refund that -RRB- and of course , I never got the shorts I wanted . At least I do n't have to pay to return them , thank goodness . Still -- it 's annoying .
 Although the item was listed as having a 10 '' inseam , it only had an 8 '' inseam . Had I known this , I would never have purchased the shorts . Because of the inaccurate listing , I had to pay shipping both ways - for delivery and to return the item . In sum , I would never do business with this seller again .
 These shorts come with a non-standard 8 '' inseams that will likely not fit anyone who is ordering their waist size if they wear a 10 '' inseam . In fact , I have a few Columbia shorts and the standard size for the inseam is 10 '' on all of them -LRB- mind you these were off the rack at Columbia stores , in their standard sizes -RRB- . 10 '' also happens to be the size that is advertized on the site , although now it says 8 '' and 10 '' inseams , without the option of choosing which one you will receive.I have asked Amazon to replace the items since they claim that the 10 '' size is available and will see how it goes .

 I bought this nautica t-shirts a month ago . . and they are damn cheap when compared to the price in the mall ... I was expecting them much later but I got them few days after I ordered them ... only problem I have is the tee 's are lil bit loose even though they are small size ...

 I purchased this bra for wedding day . I wanted support and a firm fit . This item is not firm , too flexible and actually `` the girls '' flopped over when tried it on . The issue is that the low back provided no support for the front and ribbing is not stiff enough to give support . Needless to say , I have to return it .

 These stalkings are ADORABLE , but I am all about cute and efficient . These are not that . I bought them for my wedding and the elastic that held them up was super flaccid . It would not hold them up , I had one that was up because of my guarder and one that was at my ankle . Cute but they FAIL !
 These looked beautiful from the pictures and the price was fantastic ! As soon as I took them out of the package , I could feel that they were poor quality . They are n't silky , so they do n't hold form well . They easily tear and snag . It 's like a one-time-wear item . I 'm throwing them away .

 The Isotoner boots themselves were fine , but a hard box shoved inside a soft shipping envelope does not make for pretty gift giving . The packaage was crushed beyond belief and to believe I paid around $ 7-8 shipping . I will never use that seller again !
 I bought this nautica t-shirts a month ago . . and they are damn cheap when compared to the price in the mall ... I was expecting them much later but I got them few days after I ordered them ... only problem I have is the tee 's are lil bit loose even though they are small size ...
 Purchased several pairs in several colors to use as stocking stuffers . They were not at all what I expected . They are just a pair of fluffy socks with a no slip bottom . If your looking for something more substantial , this is not it . The quality was very poor and very disappointing . Needless to say , They were not given as gifts .
 these were ill fitting and very poorly made i guess thats why they were on sale ... get what you pay for ...
 Sure they are soft and warm , but after giving several as Christmas gifts I was mortified how they fell apart after three days of gentle wear . Cheaply made , soles seperate from bootie and a complete waste of money .
 I bought 2 pairs one for me and one for mom . I got them both in M/L size . I wear a 9 and these are super tight on me . Mom wears a 6 1/2 and they fit her ok , but a little loose . The soles are very cheeply made . You are better off investing in some great slippers from a department store or just some nice soft socks . These are n't very comfortable and garbage .
 I did not like these at all . Too hard to walk in . will not wear .
 These broke right out of the box , they fit horrible and they flop around and are useless , even though 2 pairs only cost me 4.98 , I returned these ! I read the iffy reviews and took a chance , oh well you win some and lose some !
 I read the reviews before I purchased the Muk luk 's . Even though there were quite a few big negative NO 's , I ordered them anyway . I must agree with the NO 's . The words , `` Too good to be true '' are my warning to others . For the price , I should have known . Great idea , but socks work much better.D.Lee
 Bought these before Christmas to wear in the car on our two day trip . They started falling apart the first day ! Very unsatisfied with the item ! Do n't waste your money .
 These are huge ! I wear a size 7 shoe and the small are huge . Not only that but I ordered 2 pair and the other one is even bigger . Sure they are cheap ... but they are not worth it . Do not waste your money .
 It is not a pair of slippers nor a pair of socks . The quality of the cloth is very thin for such a model ... When you wear it , you feel like slipping at any moment .
 What a rip off ! These cheap and cute slippers were thrown together to make a quick rip off buck . Any decent company would have took the time to make sure they were stitched to last at least a few months of winter ! I ordered 6 pair , and 2 pair have fallen apart in the 1st week , with only 2 days of wearing each pair . I will not buy from Amazon ever again , as they know what and who they sell for and are contributing to scam jumk .
 I weigh just about 100 lb. , and am 5 ' 1 &#34; . These hose are much too big for me . Since there are no smaller sizes , I ca n't get the help from them that I get from Legs Everyday support hose , three pair for around $ 6.00 . I checked them side by side and the stretch is just as strong on the cheapies , and they are half as big before you put them on , length and inches across . Very disappointed . If you are heavier or have more leg , they are silky feeling or appearing and you would probably think they are okay . I think they are way too expensive for what you get . I thought they would take me to the next level of more intense support , without resorting to compression hose . Barb H.
 What is the point of control top hose if the waistband rolls down constantly . It does n't control anything but my time because I have to keep pulling it up again . I would pass on these .
 Maybe I am too rough on my panty hose but these got a run in them the first day I wore them .

In fact , I have a few Columbia shorts and the standard size for the inseam is 10 '' on all of them -LRB- mind you these were off the rack at Columbia stores , in their standard sizes -RRB- . 10 '' also happens to be the size that is advertized on the site , although now it says 8 '' and 10 '' inseams , without the option of choosing which one you will receive.I have asked Amazon to replace the items since they claim that the 10 '' size is available and will see how it goes . However , I would recommend that you stay clear from these shorts since they will likely not fit , unless you know an 8 '' inseam is the correct size .
 Like the other reviewer indicates in his review , I bought these shorts expecting a 10 '' inseam , but they arrived with an 8 '' inseam . The description lists these shorts as having a 10 '' inseam . I wish I had read his review before ordering ! I called the store -LRB- 1-800-569-9038 -RRB- and in their system , this short DOES have an 8 '' inseam , so they think they sent me the appropriate item . They need to fix the info on this page ! Anyway , I was determined not to have to pay return shipping for their error . I explained the situation , and they are sending me a FedEx slip with postage paid and I can return the shorts in that . So in the end , I will have to eat the costs of shipping the shorts TO me -LRB- they wo n't refund that -RRB- and of course , I never got the shorts I wanted . At least I do n't have to pay to return them , thank goodness . Still -- it 's annoying .
 Although the item was listed as having a 10 '' inseam , it only had an 8 '' inseam . Had I known this , I would never have purchased the shorts . Because of the inaccurate listing , I had to pay shipping both ways - for delivery and to return the item . In sum , I would never do business with this seller again .

 I weigh just about 100 lb. , and am 5 ' 1 &#34; . These hose are much too big for me . Since there are no smaller sizes , I ca n't get the help from them that I get from Legs Everyday support hose , three pair for around $ 6.00 . I checked them side by side and the stretch is just as strong on the cheapies , and they are half as big before you put them on , length and inches across . Very disappointed . If you are heavier or have more leg , they are silky feeling or appearing and you would probably think they are okay . I think they are way too expensive for what you get . I thought they would take me to the next level of more intense support , without resorting to compression hose . Barb H.
 What is the point of control top hose if the waistband rolls down constantly . It does n't control anything but my time because I have to keep pulling it up again . I would pass on these .
 Maybe I am too rough on my panty hose but these got a run in them the first day I wore them .
 I usually like champion sports bras but this one is very large between the shoulders so when I put one on my shoulder blades rub a blister into my skin because the material is too wide in between my shoulders . Other than that I love the reversible feature and the actual feel of the material itself . .
 I ordered a Medium in this Sports Bra , I 'm 5 ' 4 '' weighing 124 lbs . with a 32B bra size . It was so small I could n't get it on . I sent it back for a refund because I do n't think even a large would have fit .
 I 'm puzzled reading the reviews for this product -- do they make two different bras under the same description ? I wear small/medium in clothes and am very small in the bust -LRB- A maximum -RRB- . I ordered this sports bra in medium for cycling -LRB- All my other sports bras are mediums and fit nicely -RRB- . It looks great/high quality -- 2 stars . When I put it on I could n't believe it . I have absolutely no idea how anyone who is not completely flat-chested can comfortably wear it . Even I with the small amount I have was mashed completely flat and felt like I was being suffocated . Now that 's a SUPPORT bra ! And , like one other reviewer stated , the armholes are very high and cut into my underarm . I wondered if ordering a size large might help and it might a little , but it 's hard to believe there would be enough give even then to accomodate me , small as I am , in the bust area.Anyway , for what it 's worth ...
 Based on other reviews , I bought the next larger size and STILL had a problem . To make the bra work for me , I took off the binding around the neckline and arm holes and removed a heavy strip of rubber from each . I then resewed the bindings and the bra is more comfortable , but still is not the size I ordered . I would recommend a different bra if possible .
 I ordered this item 11/23 for Christmas and it never arrived . I think it would have been a great gift for my brother-in-law , but I may never know .
 We just can not squeeze wider 750 ml bottles , such as Bogle Chardonnay , into the 2-bottle tote . The same wine bottle fits fine in the single bottle tote . A real shame .
 If you 're looking for a nice bra , this might be the one ... but order one cup size smaller . They run big.I purchased two of these bras based , sight unseen , on the reviews . Big mistake . I was deployed overseas and really did not have much of a choice.When I recieved the bras , I was pleased with the quality of the construction and the feel of the fabric . They are soft and pretty . Then I put one on . ICK . Not so pretty.I am definitely a full B , even a C cup in certain bras . This bra had all kinds of extra fabric sticking out around the nipple area . They stick out like a long boob-cone . The cups also separate the breasts too far and give entirely too much `` individual breast definition , '' if you will . I looked like I was wearing a 12 year old 's training bra when I put on a tee shirt . Ridiculous.Of course I could not exactly send these back from overseas , so I simply tossed them into the donation bin . I 'm glad that others were able to enjoy these , I certainly did not .
 Horrendously disappointing . This handbag is made of foam and cheap vinyl . The clasp is constructed of two Velcro stickers , which were peeling off . Save your money !
 the cap looks good however it really is made for a child - i gave the hat away as a gift .
 There was no drawstring to cinch the waistline as was stated in the description . Very unhappy with this purchase ! Boo !
 These items are selling for different prices -- It seems like whatever popular colors are they jack up the price -- what a cheat !
 I got this vest from my wife as a gift , so I should n't be looking a gift horse in the mouth . Maybe that 's OK , as my comments are not directed at her , but to possible future buyers.I 've had other vests , so I 've had time to develop a very strong opinion about features that I like and do n't . This vest does n't meet up with some of the basics that I am used to enjoying with my years old Gap vest.First of all , the fleece is quite thin and porous and thus not warm in a breeze , so I do n't wear it outside much . The large arm holes do n't help there either.The zipper is only one way , i.e. , it does n't open up from the bottom . To me that is a major inconvenience as I ca n't adjust the bottom when I am sitting or driving . With the slightly longer cut , the vest ends up bunching up around my waist . I also have to undo the zipper completely or yank the bottom of the vest halfway up my waist if I have to pull down the zipper in my pants to go to the bathroom.My major problem , however , is with the cut . The middle has a lot of fabric and wo n't lay flat over my chest and stomach . It finally occurred to me that it is actually perfect for someone with a medium pot belly , but that 's not me.My final complaint is with the pocket zipper , they go down to close . If you do n't zip it fully , small things like change or keys , will fall out.Overall , the design feels like there was a lack of thought throughout . Maybe they turned a junior designer loose on this item.Since I won ; t be returning the vest , it 'll get demoted to workshop duty .
 This is the sleeveless version of the Steen 's Mountain jacket . Runs a size big -LRB- 5 ' 7 '' 160 lbs , small was loose -RRB- . No drawcord in hem is less than stellar . Useless against wind . I 'm having to edit my review because the stitching is coming loose around the bottom of the zipper . It 's not only fraying , it 's also interfering with the zipper operation . I hope Amazon will take it back .
 got a medium and it 's more like an xl and the material is a little flimsy
 bought this vest to supplement a Patagonia fleece vest i have . To my surprise the vest is not very warm , does not feel like i have a fleece vest on ! Otherwise the fleece has a nice material and nice look to it but it is not doing what it is supposed to -LRB- keep me warm -RRB- & also as others have mentioned in the posts here it runs a size larger -LRB- i bought an L but should have gotten an M - for all my other stuff i have Ls -RRB- Hope this helps .
 The vest did not meet my expectations . The quality of the fleece was not what I expected . I expected a thicker fleece . It is very hard buying some things online without details of the construction of the item . Thanks Scott
 I have a columbia vest from a few years ago , and this one is a FRAUD ... paper thin , DO NOT get suckered into buying these cheap imitations !!!!!
 I am 5 '11 and 154 pound . Even I select M size , but it 's still too big for me . Seems it built for a guy has 6 ' 3 and 200 pound .
 collar is too big , the length is too long and fit is very loose , not what I was expecting . from the photo it looks different .
 I always bought the Columbia items and will continue , but this item is the worst I ever have seen . I saw the picture and never hesitated to get the item . Well , today I got it and when I opened my jaws dropped . This is thinner than a handkerchief I believe . Never rely on the picture you see . It was my fault that I never consaulted with some customers and when I sent mails to Columbia , they never replied . This is a no-good vest !!!!!
 I bought this item from Amazon at a good price , but when it arrived it was short and blousy ... too wide , yet too short . It 's a shame because the materials are typical Columbia excellence .
 I 've worn Columbia fleece for years , and their vests are a particular favorite because they are so versatile . I 've loved the quality and the details in the design . However , this Cathedral vest falls woefully short in both those categories . First of all , there is NO DRAWSTRING at the bottom , and that is an essential for the fit and warmth of a vest ... the bottom just hangs open and the drape of the garment just does n't work without that simple elastic drawstring . Further , the workmanship is n't any better than the no-name brands available for half the price , and the material is thin and insufficient . Not up to Columbia 's very high -LRB- and usual -RRB- standard . Wish I could get my money back . Try again , Amazon .
 `` What a lift ? '' Not exactly ! I can get away with wearing this without a bra only when I am looking for the `` tied down '' look , but maybe that 's because I normally wear a D cup . But I was n't really looking for a bra substitute . I bought this looking for -LRB- and expecting -RRB- a control garment to handle the bumps and rolls that ruin the look when I wear a fine gauge swaeter or twinset . Not too much to ask , and it would have done the job -- except it rides up something fierce . I immediately thought this was because the garment ran small , so I bought one a size larger -- no luck . The only way to stop this annoying feature of the undergarment is to tuck it into the waist of a snug fitting skirt or pair of pants , and then not to sit down . Not so much fun . Oh well , back to the drawing board !
 the design and quality of jeans were very good however the 10 petite size was unusually big and long . i had to return the item back . loved amazon 's free no hassle-return on the item .
 La calidad y la terminacion de esta prenda es indiscutiblemente muy buena . . en el ajuste creo que tambien esta muy bien aunque antes de hacer el pedido lei las sugerencias y tome 2 medida menor a la que soy , -LRB- pedi un 6 y soy 8 -RRB- aunque todo esto que he dicho es positivo doy mala puntacion por que la forma del jean no es ni parecido a la que se muestra aqui , es mas bien una forma de pantalon de hombre , es totalmente recto y cuadrado no me gusto la forma por eso no lo usare .

 The product did n't fit right and did not hold breast up at all.Would not recommend this product at all .
 The fabric of this bra is very thin and has a seam running through the center of the cups . The seam is very itchy and not comfortable at all ! I 'm returning mine .
 It looks wonderful on the model , but not on me . The lace and seems were itchy , and it created a retro bullet bra silhouette , which if I had been looking for such would be okay . Normally I wear mostly t-shirts , and the occasional sweater . I like a much smoother look than this bra provides .
 Seems like it would be comfy , but the cup did not have full coverage , as was indicated in the blurb . I had to send it back . Cup was not as large as others that say they are equal to this one .
 I 'm a 32DDD . This bra lift and seperates very well and the band has four rows of hooks . But the cup gives a very pointy shape to the breast . The material feels scratchy as well . If you want to look like Madonna in the cone bra getup , then this is the bra for you .
 first the real product different from what the picture showssecondly , when wearing it , it is very uncomfortable , I ca n't stand a secondso return it immediately
 The band fit true to size , but the bra was constructed HORRIBLY . When worn it gave me a `` squished '' version of torpedo boobs . HATED IT . Obviously not built for women who have larger bra sizes .
 Worst fit and feel ever !!! Would not recommend the purchase of this product unless you are desperate and need something in a crunch .
 I purchased this bra based solely on the picture and of course name ... very disappointed . It is made cheaply and arrived frayed at the seams . Just terrible quality for the price .
 I should have known better after reading some of the other reviews but I gave it a try anyway . I do n't like the pointy look of this bra or really anything about the look at all . It may give good support but I would n't want to wear it under anything even slightly see through because of the huge band . It is definitely not what I was looking for . The search continues ...
 I found the bra to be very supportive -LRB- I 'm a 32D -RRB- but I found that it gave my breasts a very pointed look which was very strange under clothes . It also made them seem much smaller . Great support but because of the shaping I returned it .
 The bra is pretty but I just cant wear underwires . They wo n't take product back as it is a undergarment ... wish I would have known that before I spent money on it !
 I hate this bra ! The material is itchy , even after several washings . The wires poke me all the time and the bra is just generally uncomfortable . I just went back to wearing my old bras and I 've given up on these . If you 're looking for a comfortable bra , this is not one . The only positive things are
 Every single Bali bra I tried has either been uncomfortable or the wrong fit . FYI , a 38DDD in Playtex is apparently a 38D or DD in Bali ... Spilled out in every direction in the 38DDD Bali bra .
 I was looking for a casual bra to wear when I worked in the yard and chose this one based on reviews and price . It 's going back.The bra is thin with old fashioned pointed nipples . The material fails to stretch to adapt to breast dimensions , causing some areas to be too tight and others too loose . It felt uncomfortable -LRB- not too tight - just too rough -RRB- as soon as I put it on.Because it 's a Bali , it 's probably durable and would hold up over time better than cheaper bras but I just ca n't get over the positive reviews so I 'm giving it only one star.For a better fitting and much more comfortable bra , try a Victoria 's Secrets wireless cotton bra . It gives you the smooth coverage you want , excellent support , and you wo n't even know you are wearing it .
 This bra is the epitome of you `` get what you pay for '' ! This bra is so cheaply made , I am disappointed because I did n't even think Bali would make a bra of this quality ! Break open a box of band aids because it is very abrasive ! It is also not smooth in front , it is POINTY ! Reminds me of the bras my mother used to wear !
 Since Bali discontinued the bra that was my favorite -LRB- one that had truly non-slip straps -RRB- , I thought I 'd once again try this old standby which has been available for decades . It 's a good product , but it is far from perfect.Good points
 I doubt anyone 's body is this shape , or that anyone would rate the fabric as comfortable , it 's scratchy!Nothing like the picture ...
 I have purchased Bali bras before and have always been satisfied . This bra pokes and is very poorly made . This will make me question the brand itself .
 This was one of the bras that you throw away the minute you try them on ! I was disappointed , the material is extremely rigid and extremely uncomfortable . .
 I chose this low rating because this bra is highly structured and not made for comfort . It 's not right for me , but others may like and choose this type of bra . It reminded me of the 1960 's .

It finally occurred to me that it is actually perfect for someone with a medium pot belly , but that 's not me.My final complaint is with the pocket zipper , they go down to close . If you do n't zip it fully , small things like change or keys , will fall out.Overall , the design feels like there was a lack of thought throughout . Maybe they turned a junior designer loose on this item.Since I won ; t be returning the vest , it 'll get demoted to workshop duty .
 This is the sleeveless version of the Steen 's Mountain jacket . Runs a size big -LRB- 5 ' 7 '' 160 lbs , small was loose -RRB- . No drawcord in hem is less than stellar . Useless against wind . I 'm having to edit my review because the stitching is coming loose around the bottom of the zipper . It 's not only fraying , it 's also interfering with the zipper operation . I hope Amazon will take it back .
 got a medium and it 's more like an xl and the material is a little flimsy
 bought this vest to supplement a Patagonia fleece vest i have . To my surprise the vest is not very warm , does not feel like i have a fleece vest on ! Otherwise the fleece has a nice material and nice look to it but it is not doing what it is supposed to -LRB- keep me warm -RRB- & also as others have mentioned in the posts here it runs a size larger -LRB- i bought an L but should have gotten an M - for all my other stuff i have Ls -RRB- Hope this helps .
 The vest did not meet my expectations . The quality of the fleece was not what I expected . I expected a thicker fleece . It is very hard buying some things online without details of the construction of the item . Thanks Scott
 These items are selling for different prices -- It seems like whatever popular colors are they jack up the price -- what a cheat !
 I have a columbia vest from a few years ago , and this one is a FRAUD ... paper thin , DO NOT get suckered into buying these cheap imitations !!!!!
 I always bought the Columbia items and will continue , but this item is the worst I ever have seen . I saw the picture and never hesitated to get the item . Well , today I got it and when I opened my jaws dropped . This is thinner than a handkerchief I believe . Never rely on the picture you see . It was my fault that I never consaulted with some customers and when I sent mails to Columbia , they never replied . This is a no-good vest !!!!!
 I bought this item from Amazon at a good price , but when it arrived it was short and blousy ... too wide , yet too short . It 's a shame because the materials are typical Columbia excellence .
 I 've worn Columbia fleece for years , and their vests are a particular favorite because they are so versatile . I 've loved the quality and the details in the design . However , this Cathedral vest falls woefully short in both those categories . First of all , there is NO DRAWSTRING at the bottom , and that is an essential for the fit and warmth of a vest ... the bottom just hangs open and the drape of the garment just does n't work without that simple elastic drawstring . Further , the workmanship is n't any better than the no-name brands available for half the price , and the material is thin and insufficient . Not up to Columbia 's very high -LRB- and usual -RRB- standard . Wish I could get my money back . Try again , Amazon .
 I am 5 '11 and 154 pound . Even I select M size , but it 's still too big for me . Seems it built for a guy has 6 ' 3 and 200 pound .
 collar is too big , the length is too long and fit is very loose , not what I was expecting . from the photo it looks different .
 What a disappointment ! The sizing chart was completely wrong . After carefully measuring we ordered according to the chart . The shorts we received would not fit a newborn . Shipping prices were exhorbitant -LRB- $ 7.00 for $ 15.00 shorts -RRB- and to add insult to injury , I now have to pay again to get the right size . Shipping will cost more than the shorts . I will never buy from east bay again .
 Although the shorts seem to be of good quality , the sizing chart is WRONG !! My petite daughter is 2 1/2 inches smaller than the XS and the XS we received are too small for her . If you can find a store , try the shorts on and decide what size you want . By the time I deal with returning and paying for more shipping the shorts will be very expensive .
 I bought this item for the color and assumed it had a cotton crotch . Not only did it not have a cotton crotch the supposed to be a large fit like a small . Chalk it up as an impulse buy , will not buy any more of these unless from Hanes or Fruit of the Loom and it 's cotton .
 Like other reviewers have said , these shorts are improperly sized . I normally wear size 00 or XXS . I ordered these shorts in a size Small -LRB- instead of XS -RRB- after reading other warnings about the sizing . To my amazement , the shorts were ridiculously tight -- unwearable . These shorts are either a crude hoax or the result of a manufacturing flaw . Either way , unless you 're a toddler in the market for briefs , do n't waste your time with this product !
 This product was purchased in hopes that it would be great for athleticpurposes . This product has a giant seam that runs right through the crotch and caused major chaffing and irritation . Maybe could be used for lounging in or as a cleaning rag .

 Different from what is pictured . The name `` Enhancer bra '' and the picture led me to believe the bra contained the actual enhancers . Very disappointed .
 The item arrived in a Flat envelope , with missing parts . I noticed right away that it was not to my liking , because i did n't order an item with missing parts . the silicon breasts are missing , and the packing was poorly packaged -LRB- in my opinion -RRB- The mailer invoice was n't even included . I would like to ship this item back ASAP . This has been a horrible experience for me . recovering as a 1 year survivor of cancer in south florida , i was finally going to treat myself to something . Is there anything that you can do to fix , and/or help my traumatic ordeal?Please contact me .
 This does look quite pretty on . However , the heavily textured embroidery is raised & ridged , & that is what is sitting next to your skin , as it is unlined . The cup runs a bit small -LRB- compared to say , the Whimsy -RRB- & also gives an odd , flattened shape due to the vertical seams .
 I got this vest from my wife as a gift , so I should n't be looking a gift horse in the mouth . Maybe that 's OK , as my comments are not directed at her , but to possible future buyers.I 've had other vests , so I 've had time to develop a very strong opinion about features that I like and do n't . This vest does n't meet up with some of the basics that I am used to enjoying with my years old Gap vest.First of all , the fleece is quite thin and porous and thus not warm in a breeze , so I do n't wear it outside much . The large arm holes do n't help there either.The zipper is only one way , i.e. , it does n't open up from the bottom . To me that is a major inconvenience as I ca n't adjust the bottom when I am sitting or driving . With the slightly longer cut , the vest ends up bunching up around my waist . I also have to undo the zipper completely or yank the bottom of the vest halfway up my waist if I have to pull down the zipper in my pants to go to the bathroom.My major problem , however , is with the cut . The middle has a lot of fabric and wo n't lay flat over my chest and stomach . It finally occurred to me that it is actually perfect for someone with a medium pot belly , but that 's not me.My final complaint is with the pocket zipper , they go down to close .

 There was no drawstring to cinch the waistline as was stated in the description . Very unhappy with this purchase ! Boo !

 I was n't expecting much , being that it was 23 dollars , but I sitll expected it to be somewhat useful to me , which it is n't . It 's basically stripes of colour haphazardly sewn together . The sleeve-holes are really just the space between two flaps that did n't get closed all the way , and there was no tacking or hemming of the edges of the cut fabric , so it 's easilly frayed . These are easy fixes , for one who knows how to sew , but all in all , it 's annoying and inconveniant . Also , they make it seem like the hood is risen , curved , nice and poppy , but no - you have to stuff it yourself . I have to hem it about eight inches before it becomes the right length for me -LSB- i 'm 5 ' 2 , though , so I expected it to be pretty low -RSB- and that kind of stinks . The tie aorund the neck is not helpful , and while it looks to be black , purple , red and gold , it 's really a dark green.I 'm not happy with this costume because I have to put work into making it my own with reinforcing of the fabric , sewing , hemming , tacking and shaping . Still , I can fix it , and even a novic can do so if they decide to sit and do it , so I can sort of overlook that.Also , in general , the USPS , lies about knocking on your door , but when I went to get it from the post-office , it was on time , so delivery was good .
 I 'm really disappointed in this . I bought this looking for something to wear under my strapless wedding dress , but unfortunately it 's really not going to work out . I guess buying the bra for such a specific -LRB- and special -RRB- occasion does raise standards , so I would consider my disappointment probably a lot greater than usual.Here are some of the things I liked about the bra : - the length , if you 're looking for something that wo n't cause muffin top , this is probably a good choice - the material and construction seemed to be of good quality , the fabric was smooth and comfortable and the bra felt sturdyDislikes : - Probably the biggest issue is the fit . I ordered my usual bra size and was a little worried that it would end up fitting too tight -LRB- a concern I have about Felina bras -RRB- . However , the Dominique bra is quite the opposite - it was loose and actually felt like it was shifting around . - Lumpy - I feel pretty misled by the term `` smooth '' in the description of the bra . It 's absolutely not that and shows up as lumpy even under a fairly thick shirt . - Length - Ok , I know I said the length was good for not causing muffin top - but if you have a shorter torso , even just an average length torso , you 'll feel the wires of the corset bumping against your hip bones . Not super comfortable.It looks like I 'm going to go with the Felina seamless bustier instead and try to figure out what to do about the muffin top ...
 I bought this for hopes of wearing it under my wedding gown . I needed something to hold in my lower `` pooch '' ... well , I read all the other reviews and went down a size in the waist . The cups were way to small , and the main dissapointment was it did n't help hold anything in . I 'm not that that huge by any means , 5 ' 6 , 120 lbs . It actually make it look bigger , it does n't come down long enough . Do n't waste your money !!!!!!!
 When I ordered this the picture shown was a lace bustier . The one I received was satin . Did n't like it all , returned it .
 This does look quite pretty on . However , the heavily textured embroidery is raised & ridged , & that is what is sitting next to your skin , as it is unlined . The cup runs a bit small -LRB- compared to say , the Whimsy -RRB- & also gives an odd , flattened shape due to the vertical seams .
 If you do n't care about the fit , buy it . It 's cheap and warm . If you care about quality and the fit , you might want to look for a higher priced columbia fleece . I 've tried this on and the fit was just awful . The large on this jacket is way too big ... It 's like a XXL ... I own two other Columbia jackets -LRB- more expensive -RRB- and the fit is great . This jacket just seems like Columbia made a mistake in the sizes ... It seems as if there should be a M and a half ... There is a major difference in size between a M and a L. . .
 I purchased this for my fiance at the end of Dec 2010 and gave it to him as a gift at the end of Jan 2011 . It is now April 2011 and the collar is already tearing . It wo n't be long before there is a huge hole . I believe Columbia products should last longer then this epecially since he only wears it casually he does not wear to work or anything . I contacted Moontree and they said there is nothing they can do because you only have 30 days to return something . I will not purchase products through that seller again .
 I got this really hoping it would fit . I got a large , since I 'm a pretty tall guy . I 'm 6 ' 3 and I put on the jacket and it did n't even go past my waste . I think they need to re-do their sizing chart . Very disappointing .

 The product was fine , but it took forever to receive my shipment , and did not come as promised even after talking with their customer service .
 I know the Columbia brand , and trust the products they manufacture . It could be , then , that my experience was a fluke . . BUT I bought this jacket for my father for Christmas . He started wearing it mid-January , and before the end of January , the zipper pull had broken off . So he could n't zip it shut at all . So he stopped wearing it . I contacted the seller , and got great customer service . I am in the middle of the exchange process , and trust that it will go smoothly . I 'm not sure if others have had the products break so soon after purchase , but mine did ... Good luck !
 I 'm from Russia . Some weeks ago i bought these Fleece Sweater on Amazon.com . It 's made in Vietnam . Thread sticking everywhere -LRB- -LRB- I can send you photos , write to greengel@yandex.ru . Sad , I just wanted buy good quality Columbia , but got &#34; bad Vietnam &#34; . Also , i bought/got bad Bugaboot Plus Snow Boot &#34; Columbia &#34; from China ! I wrote about this also.If you want to buy this firm , be careful - forgery is everywhere in this mad world ... Sad .
 These jackets are light and nice to look at . However , they have a serious lint problem . I wore this to work on a white shirt and I was horrified to see lint all over my white shirt ! I am returning it now .
 Columbia opted to save $ 0.003 and not use YKK zippers any longer . The zippers they use now are complete trash . Buy North Face , Patagonia , anything else . I can not defend or support a company that opts to save a fraction of a penny at the expense of quality.edit
 Bad fit , but I like the Tusk color . I thought this was going to be a sweater . It 's like a Hike Jacket . I 'm 6 ' 3 '' and normally do n't require a tall size in extra large , but here I do . Then , an inside pocket is needed , since this really is a jacket . The zipper is n't lined up properly . That makes the fit even worse , when it 's zipped up . I 'll keep this one because I like the color and that 's the only reason . I also ordered a grey , but it came with a broken zipper I could n't get to zip . I returned it . This was a bad choice for me , since I 'm taller , but I 'll wear it around the house . It does provide warmth and I like the fleece feel .
 I 'm very disappointed to receive the jacket with a `` Made In China '' label . It feels cheap , it looks cheap ... I wo n't be ordering anything more from your company.Sincerely , Damon
 My order came 3 weeks late . I took the advise of other buyers and bought a small size which is as big as my other medium size clothing . I was disappointed that I ordered a tusk color jacket which looks much whiter , fashion on the screen . In fact , it is a dirty silver grey color that I am embarrassed to wear it to my office , or anywhere . Even wearing it at home my wife asked me where I got it from a second hand store . Its warm though . The cuff has no elastic .
 I liked this jacket . It fit well . Was fairly warm and thin . Looked decent . But after 8 months , the zipper got stuck in the closed position for some unknown reason , forcing me to cut out my keys .
 I had purchased the same fleece at Academy Sports , and decided to get a second one , thinking this would be identical . The material in the one I received is actually much lighter , so think twice about purchasing something online that you ca n't inspect first .
 This is my second buy from Columbia ... But this one has fleece problem ... Because while skiving the stuff they made verev line ... So this is not FAIR ... I think while controlling quality was eye off . . I am sorry and I ca n't send you because I am living in Istanbul/TURKEY and will cost me ... Maybe you can compensate this situation to my credit card ... I hope and wait ... But I advised those sweaters everybody ...
 The pictures do not show the poor quality of the article.The pictures do not show the poor quality of the article
 This is not very warm enough . I bought so I can wear it inside office when they make AC too cool during summer , but I still do n't feel warm . Also not warm enough during fall or spring .
 I got this jacket for Christmas . It 's awesome and all , except the logo is stitched on the wrong side of the jacket and I noticed the multiple layers of white backing used to stitch the logo patch in was still in there and very difficult to get out . I would recommend spending the extra $ 5-10 buying this same thing from the real website instead of buying it here . Really embarrassing to go around and wear a noticeable fake .
 I purchased this Columbia Steens Mens Small Navy sweater to replace a blue one that I had recently lost.When I pulled it out of the package , I found that it was made of lightweight fleece material which in no way resembled my other Steens sweaters . It did not lie flat at the side seam and I found that the material of the pocket interior was missized but sewn in anyway causing it to pull . Also , not enough material was provided for the width . I can easily zip shut my other Mens Small sweaters but this one would have needed four more inches of material to allow the zipper to be closed.I checked this one against my other Steens and found that the country of manufacture had changed as had the collar tag . It is now a blue and white label , not the traditional black and white tag . It is marked `` China '' . The tags in my other Steens are marked `` Vietnam '' . I can only assume that when Columbia changed its manufacturer , it also changed its quality standards . I returned the Steens sweater the same day I received it and I will never buy another one if the quality is not returned to the product.By the way , the Amazon return process was quick and easy . It included free shipping on the product return .
 I liked this jacket when I first got it . It was warm and had a comfortable fit . Within a month , however , the sleeve started to rip off the body of the jacket . As it was past 30 days and I did n't have the original tags , packaging , etc. , the jacket could n't be returned . I understand that it was n't an expensive jacket but it 's Columbia , you would think that it would last more than 30 days before falling apart .
 The fleece was not densely woven enough to provide much warmth and the wind goes right through it . The fabric is kind of shaggy unlike any fleece I 've ever had or seen . Last Columbia product that I 'll try .
 Nice sweatshirt . Terrible zipper . Bought 4 of them , and 2 of them had zippers fall off within a couple months .
 This showed up with holes . Very poor quality . Not what I expected from a Columbia product , as usually they have pretty high quality products . Very disappointed and sent it back .
 Having had one of these fleece jackets that had served me well for many years , I bought a second one recently . After one hard use fishing in Montana , the zipper casting broke and made the jacket useless . Comparing the two I noticed that they have changed the zipper manufacturer . The new design is not suitable for its intended use . Do n't buy until they strengthen the zipper design .
 It 's my 2nd fleece from Columbia . I bought previous one couple of years ago , and I liked it , so decided buy second one as first is too old . This time I received damaged item - zipper is not working . Unfortunately for me , but I 'll give 2 stars for Columbia , so they can work on their QA ...
 This item literally collects all the dirt around . It gets dirty easily . The material also shrinks when washed . Order another brand or texture . It also fades
 Very disappointed in the quality of the zipper . After 2 1/2 months of light use , mostly around the house , the zipper broke such that it would separate -LRB- unzip -RRB- from the bottom . I sent it back to Columbia for warranty service , but had to pay over one-third of the cost of the jacket to ship it to them after owning it for only 10 weeks . I think this is pathetic quality for a jacket that cost what this one did . I ca n't remember the last time I owned anything , including cheap stuff from places like Old Navy , where the zipper did this , particularly on a new jacket
 This does look quite pretty on . However , the heavily textured embroidery is raised & ridged , & that is what is sitting next to your skin , as it is unlined . The cup runs a bit small -LRB- compared to say , the Whimsy -RRB- & also gives an odd , flattened shape due to the vertical seams .

 This seller is a good one , but this shirt quality is terrible.I have only had mine since january , worn in it about 5 times , washed it 5 times , and the back shirt is infested with long tear 's and holes.I kept this shirt in best condition and as stated above , only worn about 5 times , and it still puzzels me how their are so many holes.It seems as if every time it goes in the washing machine , more and more holes and tears appear.Maybe i just got a defected shirt -LRB- if their is such thing as a defected shirt -RRB-
 The pattern stretches out upon wearing and the graphic becomes unclear . Very high waisted . Not the product I was expecting .
 This is my third order of this item . The second time I ordered it , it worked well for a while then one of the plastic ribs in the bra began to stick out under my fitted garmets . It looked like a knot or a bubble under my fitted clothes . Thinking that maybe I had done something wrong , I ordered another one and the same thing happened after the second wearing . Now I am out of a lot of money with two bras that have failed me . Shame on me . Other than that I could have loved the bra . Did not bother to send them back because the attachment said that if I took the tag off I had to keep it . I bought the first one for my daughter to wear in her wedding and that one worked well for her . I thought about writing you all a couple of times to share my experience but did not think that it would make much difference . Thanks for the opportunity.Dr . Davis

 These are NOT Merino socks - they are HALF -LRB- 55 % -RRB- Merino wool ; the rest is man-made materials . The front of the label makes no mention of the fact that these are only partially wool - nor does this ad . This is n't the first time I 've found Faux River falsely representing their products , they have another pair that with a label that says `` Merino Wool '' in a large font on the front , and `` 17 % Merino / Wool blend '' in a small font on the back.Nor am I impressed with the build of the sock itself . Most hiker socks have more padding on the heel , and toe seams that are better hidden.They 're comfortable enough for use around the house , and I 'd give more stars if they had more honesty and a lower cost .

 Bought these and a pair of Ray Ban 4115 ... both glasses for small-medium faces . The Bolles were cheap and made in China ... maybe a coincidence . Ray Bans were made in Italy by Luxottica . The Bolles were eceived defective with the logo on the side of the glasses disconnected and lying in the case . Bolles were shiny plastic while the RBs were matte black strong nylon type plastic fram . Bolles were `` polarized '' but I could n't tell . The RB 's were n't polarized but clearly had higher quality lenses . RBs were $ 63 and the Bolles were $ 56 ... keeping the RBs returning the Bolles .
 Do n't purchase these sunglasses unless you are a tiny headed person . Or , perhaps in the alternative , you have an average sized head and you want your cranium to look impossibly gigantic .
 THESE LOOK AND FIT GREAT , BUT DO NOT BLOCK SUN AT ALL . WORE THEM A FEW MINUTES . . HAD TO SQUINT THE ENTIRE TIME .

 Rick Steves mask does n't do much to keep light out from below.The curved bit around the nose is uncomfortable.The adjustable velcro strap is way too short , like it was made for children .
 Good overnight airlines are diligent about keeping the window screens closed to allow passengers to adjust to the local time , but these eye covers are still important for most domestic flights . I liked the raised area over the eylid for REM sleep , but the nose area leaked light .
 I did n't like the cut of this shirt , it 's too boxy . I looks like I 'm wearing a plastic bag or something . I know it 's for working out or playing basketball , but I just hate the way it made me look . It 's not as light as I hoped either . I prefer light weight clothing when I work out . I 'm trying to lose weight and this shirt gave me a complex . I only wore it once ! And now that the summer 's over , I doubt I 'll wear it again .
 Ordered a 48 ... it 's smaller than my all my 46s ... sizing chart is not accurate on these ... fabric is very stiff and copper color buttons look very cheap .
 JEANS WAS SO OVER SIZE I COULD NOT WEAR IT ONCE . NORMALLY 46 SIZE I ORDERED BUT IT TURNED OUT TO BE TOOOOOO BIG . WASTE OF MONEY . I DID NOT EVEN CANCEL SAME .
 get the 559 levi instead , the wrangler is hard liek sandpaper denim and fits horrbly , I am looking up return process now . .
 The sweatpants got very small after first washing . But the real problem was that one leg became almost two inches shorter than the other ! Never had such a weird issue before . It looks funny . I can not use it anymore . . It was hot summer and did not use it after purchasing in the spring . Now it is too late to return . . So , it is now a piece of junk.Advice
 This order was placed with Deal Rack for a pair of sweat pants Cost ; about $ 23.00 . The cost to ship this pair of sweat pants to me was approximately $ 7.00 . The pants labeled as Medium actually were for a man weighing about 200 pounds and probably over 6 feet tall . The seller was willing to accept a return . BUT I HAVE TO PAY THE RETURN POSTAGE because of his sizing mistake.When you add together all the shipping costs they will probably equal 50 % of the purchase price.No bargain . Stay away .
 These pants felt nice and thick . I always wash things before I wear them and that is when I found my washtub wall lined with fuzzies!I thought , okay , this is just the loose stuff , the rest will come off in the dryer.I dried them and got a tennis ball size ball of fluff off them , so kept tumble drying on air only and five drying session later I am still getting huge amounts of lint.I will not be wearing them as I can foresee that the will be dropping lint all over the house.Unfortunately , I bought 3 pairs because I thought the reviews sounded good , and washed all three pairs , or I would be returning them.VERY disappointing .
 From the product description page
 I bought these Jan 10 2011 . Its now Dec 10 2012 and I 'm sitting here writing this review wearing whats left of them . I only bought them to wear around the house during the winter months . I dont crawl around on the floor on my knees , but both knees on these pants are destroyed and I think its the low quality of the material . I 'm not biased against the Champion brand , in fact , I just ordered a different type pair -LRB- reverse weave -RRB- from them that I hope will hold up better . I just want something warm and comfortable to wear around the house during the winter and not have to re-purchase every year .
 This wig was such a disappointment . The netted part of the wig only covered the top part of my daughter 's head making it impossible to cover up her brown hair and to simply just keep it from falling off her head . I tried getting a wig cap to put under it and a ton of bobby pins , but still no luck . Do not buy this wig unless your child has a very , very small head . Although her Hannah Montana wig looks like a rat 's nest , it looks a million times better than this one ... and it stays on !
 I ordered a Small Petite scarlet garter belt and received a M/L . Thinking that it was a mistake , I returned it and ordered another one Small Petite I ended up getting another M/L . I have a feeling that they 're probably just all M/L .
 Like the other two reviewers , I did not receive the size I ordered . This does n't stretch much , so size matters . The pain is , because it is n't directly from Amazon , you can return for a refund , not get a replacement size . The item itself is very nice .
 I bought this as an ` around the house ' bra , so I was n't concerned with looks or whether it could stand up to exercise . Unfortunately , the cup size is much too small and the band too loose . I can understand why this bra is so cheap .
 this bra does n't hold anything . it will cover you they still bounce everywhere and needs consistent readjusting . Not very helpful in any capacity
 Ripped as my daughter tried it on . Skirt not the same length around . Very poorly made . Will never be seen outside her room .
 Dress was very cute but the light colors do not match what is displayed on screen . One color lights not multi . The lights only worked a few times and then stopped working all together . Had used for 2 hours , long enough to trick-or-treat .
 Looks adorable online , but its complete crap . Poorly assembled and can barley differentiate between the colors on the tutu . . dont waste your money . I spent $ 40 on it and put another $ 20 buy things from michaels to make it look presentable . The only cool thing was the lights !
 My daughter fell in love with this dress when she saw it online . We were very dissappointed in the quality of the costume . The lights in the skirt do not stay on and you have to keep turning it on all the time . I would not waste your money on this product .
 fabric on the outfit was cheap and very itchy . I did not want any child to wear it for fear of skin irritations the lights did not work either
 I ordered a small and I wear a size 3 dress . I could hardly get this to stretch past my ribs up to my chest . Could n't even wear it for Halloween .
 So I bought these shorts and I thought they would make me look buff like the guy in the photo . Turns out that you need to have image issues , take steroids , and have the personality of a hardboiled egg to be as buff as that guy . Oh well .
 Whatever it says is the material , this is made of hard stuff that is not comfortable . These pants look odd and they are odd . Also , this is certainly not relaxed fit as advertised . The one I received was way too small , not the stated size . I returned them . Be forewarned .
 These ones have no pockets ! A small gripe in comparison to the following . . I purchased five different colors of these shorts at the same time and they were all delivered together . The problem is that they are all different sizes of the same size , if you get my meaning . When I order LG , I want them all to be LG , regarless of what the label says . I have some that go down the my knees , others that are 4-6 inches above the knee . . No consistancy at all . They were made in a couple different countries -LRB- El Salvador , Haiti and the Dominican Republic to be exact -RRB- , but measurements should be the same everywhere -LRB- I thought -RRB- .

 Pants too small . Tag inside said 43 - 47 . When measured they were 44 's . Must have been made in China .
 First , as others have already said so well , the sizing of these pants is , at best , unreliable . Probably the best bet is to assume they run drastically big and order a size smaller than you might think you need . Or , at the very least , if you are some where on the edge of the totally arbitrary sizing info , err on the lower end rather than the higher . Unless you prefer your pants extremely loose . The waist and legs of these were like parachutes on me . While I could draw in the waist a little , it still was too loose . The legs were also longer than I anticipated and , tie or no tie on the ends of the legs , they were just too long.On the flip side , and also as at least one other reviewer pointed out , theRothco Camouflage Vintage Paratrooper Cargo Pantsare considerably more form-fitting than are these . So , if you prefer a more form-fitting fatigue -LRB- but also do not mind dealing with yet more inconsistent sizing -RRB- , than that will probably be a better option for you . That said , I make that suggestion only in terms of achieving a smaller/tighter fit . Those paratrooper cargo pants , as I indicated in my review of them , are of terrible quality and also suffer from unreliable sizing - they just happen to run consistently smaller . I purchased those as well and ended up returning both of them.Lastly , fitting/sizing issues aside , I just was not impressed with the quality of these . Thin , the fabric already pilling in spots , it just did not seem at all durable nor well made , particularly for the price . If these were around $ 19.99 or so , then perhaps it would be worth it . At this price point , not at all . But , they are of slightly better quality than the paratrooper cargo pants and that was enough for me to raise the rating to two stars rather than one . Nonetheless , I returned mine .
 I ORDERED ONE SIZE OF PANT AND THE LABEL ON THE PAIR THEY SENT ME SAID IT WAS THE NEXT SIZE UP FROM WHAT I ORDERED . WHEN I TRIED THEM ON IT SEEMS BOTH WERE WRONG THEY WERE ABOUT TWO SIZES TO SMALL . THE COMPANY HAS AGREED TO REFUND MY MONEY AS SOON AS I CAN REMEMBER TO TAKE THEM TO THE MAILBOX . IF I HAD TO RATE THIS ITEM IT WOULD GET ONE STAR ONLY BECAUSE THEY AGREE TO REFUND .

 I have not worn the crinoline yet . I does not match the poodle skirt on amazon in length or fullness . I have to get a new crinoline for the poodle skirt . I think it would be nice for the right dress .
 I like the crinoline , but it is cheap quality . I would have paid $ 15.00 at the most for it . It is a costume quality and even sayscostume on the bag . It is not a hand made item . I expected more .
 I bought this crinoline to go under a tea length 50 's style dress . I was hoping it would provide enough fullness - to make it look like a poodle skirt . It did not even come close . It is super cheap and has absolutely no fullness . There literally is no noticable difference from when I have teh crinoline underneath and when i do n't . The other review said he would not pay more than $ 15 - I would not pay more than $ 7 . I am back to looking for another crinoline .
 I am not happy at all with the crinoline . In the discription it says it 's 26-27 inches . It is NOT , it is only 23 inches . It also claims to be lined . It is not . I could 've made this myself for under $ 10 and I paid $ 30 . Very unsatisfied .
 Whatever it says is the material , this is made of hard stuff that is not comfortable . These pants look odd and they are odd . Also , this is certainly not relaxed fit as advertised . The one I received was way too small , not the stated size . I returned them . Be forewarned .
 It is a bit big to be one size . I know I have a small head , but this hat is big enough for a man .
 I should have took the other reviews to heart . This costume is cheap , cheap , cheap and WAY smaller than the stated size . Although not expensive , it was a waste of money !

 AS SOON AS I PUT THESE ON I BEGAN DEVISING A PLAN TO RETURN THEM TO OUR LOCAL KMART FOR AN EXCHANGE ... TOOK TWO TRIES BUT I GOT THEM SWITCHED FOR A KMART BRAND THAT WAS MUCH BETTER ... AND YOU COULD SIT DOWN IN THEM .
 Im not sure if this review will link to the seller at all , but this seller is ridiculous . For one pair of pants , it took them 12 days to ship it and THEN another 12 days to arrive once they were marked as shipped , and I paid over 8 $ in shipping costs . bogus . The specific seller that i suggest avoiding is Silberman 's .
 I just purchased these double knee along with 2 regular pair of Dickie workpants . All three pair were 32 x 30 , but the pair of double knee were more like a 34 '' waist . So I am returning that pair and will try again . After reading all reviews , it seems as though the problem with fit isnt new to this company .
 Not even kidding ... brand new they are stiff as cardboard and extremely uncomfortable , especially when you walk or sit/crouch . Washing them a dozen times may help slightly , otherwise wear them everyday for a couple years without washing them.Unbelievable .
 Got my work pants and found they sent the completely wrong size . The slip with the correct size was sitting in the bag . Laziness is what I call it . Unacceptable .
 I recently purchased my first pair of these work PANTS . Size 30 x 32 . I have been happy with OTHER Dickies pants ... namely the workhorse jean with double knee . But if you are on your knees at all with these work PANTS , the lower seam of the double panel falls directly under your kneecap , making it almost impossible to kneel down on a hard surface without pain . Note that on their double knee JEANS , the reinforcement panel starts 10 inches above the bottom of the pant leg and works like it should . On these work PANTS , the panel starts 13 inches above the bottom of the pant leg . Why would they change it up like that ? I assumed when I bought them , the positioning of the knee reinforcement panel , within the same manufacturer , would be the same . When kneeling down , they ride up just enough to be too high for knee reinforcement . More like thigh reinforcement.When Dickies Customer Service was contacted for explanation , and refund , I got just the standard , non-personal form letter , not signed by anyone -LRB- but still saying to `` just call me '' if you have questions -RRB- They want me to pay shipping , handling , and insurance to send them back , and all they can do is send me another pair of the same style , size etc. . Very disappointed in this product and their customer service .

 I got two of these panties after reading other reviews . Yes , they are indeed nice and comfortable . However , the trims on the panties came off in several places after the first wash . It is ridiculous to pay $ 16 for THIS kind of quality . I am very disappointed !
 It was great quality and oh so soft ... BUT the XL is more like a M
 I purchased one of this bikinis a couple of years ago and it lasted about 4 years before it turned into a transparent suit.I ordered 2 suits through amazon.com , but to my surprise the size 34 that I ordered in reallity is a size 28 , which makes it very unconfortable to wear . So becareful when ordering . Look at the manufacturer 's sizing list -LRB- VERY SMALL LETTERS -RRB- to find the right size . By the way , I had to pay to return these items because I did not read the manufaturer 's sizing chart . Not a happy camper .

 I have worn Gold Toe Fluffies for years , but must agree with several of the reviews about changes
 I have bought gold toe fluffies for 30 years , but I am afraid I have to agree with some of the earlier reviewers . Quality has declined . I am especially concerned with the size of the sock . Compared to my previous pairs these are about 30 % smaller all the way around and much thinner than previous `` fluffies '' Apparently corners are being cut . I may have to find a new favorite sock . - additional note a month later . These socks have started to fray and come apart around the top edge . Will soon go in the trash , as will gold toe 's reputation as far as I am concerned .
 Not enough cushion.I have many foot problems.I was looking for a thicker sock . The sock it self is OK .
 I read the reviews before order and got a few anyway . They were right
 The socks were great for one wear , then fell apart . I threw them away after the second or third wear .
 3 pair had holes in the sock . I 'm not kidding . And 1 other pair had bad run . I should have sent them back .
 I use them two times put them in the washer and they came apart
 I 've used Gold Toe Fluffies for many years . Over time the quality has declined . Either they come or they quickly become `` non-fluffy . '' Quality decline is apparent as stray yarns arise from the top of the sock before the first wearing or washing .
 The socks wear out quite fast and become covered in acrylic balls very easily . They look pretty unsightly after just a few wearing . Stick to the other gold toe lines such as the metropolitan or Canterbury as they are much better made and better fabrics . I am surprised they still make this remnant socks from the 60s with this horrible acrylic .
 Yes , they are soft and fluffy and quite comfortable . Unfortunately , they developed holes about five times faster than other socks I bought
 I 've been purchasing Gold Toe cotton fluffies for years ; they 've always been all cotton or cotton w / nylon . This latest version ; though the old ones are still available , I 'll read the fine print next time ; is an acrylic/nylon blend , still at the same price point of 16.00 , though far thinner and since not a natural fiber is in them , I feel they should be priced lower than the `` cotton fluffies '' . These are getting tossed into the donation pile , tags intact . I 'll be back for the real deal at a later time , as I see they 're readily available on this site . Please take a hint Gold Toe and change the product 's name , it 's confusing . Kind Regards , M.H.
 The color of the socks is great - a nice , deep heathery grey . They are also very soft and long enough.BUT
 I always trusted in this brand ... but the last pack I purchased had holes in the heels in about 6 months ... and I have a number of socks ... so they were not worn much . Also ... anytime you take them off you will be picking up black lint ... and that amazingly goes on for some time . I am very saddened by the loss of quality here ... and wo n't venture out to purchase any type of Gold Toe sock anymore .
 Packaged like Gold Toe but sure seem like seconds or knock offs . Doubt I will purshase again . Not very happy .
 I thought I would splurge on nice socks . These are not that comfortable and on the first wear a hole developed . I never had this problem with my hanes socks or other cheap white socks .
 I have been buying fluffies for years . Previously they had no elastic , and were perfect . The new design is a very sad , and unfortunate innovation . Go back to the original -- or at least make some for people like me who do n't want to stop or impede circulation by tight elastic .
 Gold Toe fluffies use to the be only sock that would last a decent time for my husband ; not anymore . We got in on a deal from Amazon , that offered 12 pairs for a wonderful price . He now wonders if they were selling seconds because they wear out in no time.Just like everything else , a company gets you to like something and then sends the quality all the way down the sewer . We are on the hunt for a better brand of sock .

Note that on their double knee JEANS , the reinforcement panel starts 10 inches above the bottom of the pant leg and works like it should . On these work PANTS , the panel starts 13 inches above the bottom of the pant leg . Why would they change it up like that ? I assumed when I bought them , the positioning of the knee reinforcement panel , within the same manufacturer , would be the same . When kneeling down , they ride up just enough to be too high for knee reinforcement . More like thigh reinforcement.When Dickies Customer Service was contacted for explanation , and refund , I got just the standard , non-personal form letter , not signed by anyone -LRB- but still saying to `` just call me '' if you have questions -RRB- They want me to pay shipping , handling , and insurance to send them back , and all they can do is send me another pair of the same style , size etc. . Very disappointed in this product and their customer service .
 Sizing is all wrong with this one . I usually purchase all kinds of items made by this brand always in size `` S '' but this time I can barely put this shirt on even though the fabric is very elastic . The size `` S '' is too small , it seems to be made for a small kid . Otherwise is not bad I guess .
 I purchased this item for my daughter , for her upcoming baby shower , which was three weeks away . Unfortunately , the item did not fit her , she did not like the material -LRB- nor did I. . very cheap feeling , like polyester -RRB- and when I went to return the item , the seller had a one week return policy ! So I am stuck with something I 'll never use , and out over $ 50 . to boot .
 I purchased one of this bikinis a couple of years ago and it lasted about 4 years before it turned into a transparent suit.I ordered 2 suits through amazon.com , but to my surprise the size 34 that I ordered in reallity is a size 28 , which makes it very unconfortable to wear . So becareful when ordering . Look at the manufacturer 's sizing list -LRB- VERY SMALL LETTERS -RRB- to find the right size . By the way , I had to pay to return these items because I did not read the manufaturer 's sizing chart . Not a happy camper .
 These ones have no pockets ! A small gripe in comparison to the following . . I purchased five different colors of these shorts at the same time and they were all delivered together . The problem is that they are all different sizes of the same size , if you get my meaning . When I order LG , I want them all to be LG , regarless of what the label says . I have some that go down the my knees , others that are 4-6 inches above the knee . . No consistancy at all . They were made in a couple different countries -LRB- El Salvador , Haiti and the Dominican Republic to be exact -RRB- , but measurements should be the same everywhere -LRB- I thought -RRB- .

 I bought 3 sets of this . My son destroyed two in a month - the pants tore while he was trying to put them on . It is inexpensive - but still a waste of money !
 The material is polyester but it is the stiffest polyester ever made . You ca n't really tie this scarf appropriately because it is so stiff and awkward that does n't sit well . It 's basically useless and does n't look good at all . I would certainly not recommend this product .
 Although they look very nice when brand new , the color -LRB- blue -RRB- fades dramatically after a fewuses of playing tennis .

 I bought this for my 6 year old & it 's way too small for her . Probably better for the 2/3 year old set .

 Customer service is worse than awful , especially a gal called Kim . I did n't get a 2nd chance to give purchaser 's name & she refused to talk to me further , no matter how much purchase information I gave to show I 'm the actual purchaser . The irony is that it was they who got my records wrong ! So , do n't sigh , nor cough , nor say `` what ? '' . She 'll count these as buyer 's name misquoted too . The consolation is that the product is of good quality for the discounted price .
 These gloves are OK , but not as luxurious as the vendor name would imply.Not as supple as we had hoped . Return policy essentially makes returning them a waste of time .

 I am of average build 5 ' 5 '' / 130 lbs , and I got these b/c I wanted socks that would stay up , yet not suffocate my legs . All I can say is they simply DO NOT STAY UP . No matter how or where I wear them . They also bunch up under my foot constantly regardless of what type of shoe I wear . The softness is okay , but I avoid wearing them for the above reasons .
 Belly straps do n't secure the load and constantly need to be tightened ... especially when wet . Not recomended for hikes over a few miles or any hike with rugged terrain . When loose -LRB- often -RRB- unit falls forward over dog 's head when heading down hill . If serious about this I suggest spending a few dollars more . Will keep mine and modify to accomodate weakness .
 Just back from Backpacking in Sierras . This dog pack performed terribly . I have a 115 pound dog and used the large size pack . It kept falling off , slipping over his head and shoulders when he bent down or when descending steep switchbacks , which you do a lot of in the Sierras . Luckily I had some bungie cords and could tighten it enough to keep from coming off , but that caused my dogs skin to get rubbed raw . Thought Kelty was a top of line outfit , but this dogpack is designed for short walks in a city park . Very amateurish and I was very disappointed . Kind of makes all their products suspect if this is an example . Do n't think I 'll be running out to buy any Kelty equipment in the future .

 I bought 5 shirts and ordered all XL size . Two looked about the size of medium and the other three were the size of large -LRB- none fit -RRB- and yet all 5 had the XL tag in the back . I ordered 5 more shirts from another manufacturer and the xl sizes fit perfectly . Buyer beware of the sizes when you order , they are not common sizes and you will have to pay shipping costs to return them .
 I am totally agreeing with another poster about the size problem . I ordered a XL and it is more like a Medium . Very unhappy . Do n't go by the sizing chart , it does n't hold true . I doubt I will order a Reebok item again . A customer should n't have to pay shipping an item back that is not as descibed ...
 I ordered 2 XL Tshirts , one black and one gray . I got 1 gray and 1 pink , both said XL on them , but one was 2 sizes smaller .

 umm , i ordered this because i thought i would be a perfect hat to stuff my hair under ... turns out it wo n't fit on the head of anyone ! Trust me , I was upset it would not fit over even half my head so I made a point to have almost every one I know try it on ... conclusion
 For me , the fit is poor - I am short , wear a 38C bra . No ` shaping ' , just another layer . Went back to my Naomi & Nicole which has nice compression and stays put .

 Wonderful fit but the second time I wore it the underwire came through the side . Total waste of money
 This bra was awful . I do n't know if the 40D was supposed to be in kids sizes or what . This thing would n't fit around my arm it was so small ! I sent it back .
 Broke the first week I had them . I use a leather soft side case with some hard cardboard reinforment in my purse and have n't had a problem with other sunglasses .
 I got them in the mail and there appeared to be some kind of cement or something on the arm of one . I scrubbed it off and ended up with scratches on the arm of the shades . Then of the two sets , i purchased , the other set lost a screw within the first 2-3 hrs and that was just taking them out of the box and looking at them . I know you get what you pay for but damn ... The product doesnt get a 1 star rating because other than the cement stain and the lost screw they are reasonably priced shades and somewhat stylish .

 Actually , one star is still too high , but that 's the lowest rating to choose from . I ordered this rainsuit as a Christmas gift for my husband on 12/10/03 through Amazon.com . It 's already 01/02/04 , and I still have n't seen the rain suit !! Shipping was supposed to occur within 2 -3 business days , per the information provided . However , the next shipping date has moved to 01/06/04 !! Every day when I check on the status , the shipping date gets moved further and further out . Also , there is no notification from the vendor about the delay . I 'm beginning to wonder if I 'm ever going to get to give this to my husband . Mybe next Christmas - this is , if I 'm really lucky.This is assinine !

 I have n't used it yet . Nice size . Going to Europe for couple of weeks and hopefully it holds up to baggage handling .
 It 's much more like a fake breast , than an enhancer that I was expecting . Seeing as I did n't need something as large as an actual boob , I returned them . I also do n't understand why they 're so exspensive after seeing them in person . I personally do n't feel they 're worth the money and I think they 'd work better for someone who 's looking for fake breast , rather than just an enhancer .

 Good guality tie but it does not look as purple as shown under natural light . If you want plum , it will fti the bill . Returned .
 Did n't fit me very well . The back of the neck bunches up and the collar should be tighter . Otherwise it 's not a bad value for the low price though the stitching should be better too . So if my main complaint is the fit I should give more detail.I bought a size Medium and have a 15 1/2 '' neck . Normally medium sized shirts , sweaters , mocks and jackets work really well for me . Occasionally the chest is too tight but I do n't like that Large sized items are so wide in the waist . I 've gotten many other medium-sized mocks that fit better , especially in the back of the neck .
 The list price for this product is 9.99 but they will charge you 3.50 shpping per shirt even when they ball them up and send them all in the same package that cost less than 3.50 to ship . With the shipping added in to the price of the shirt , you could go to Land 's End and get a far superior shirt , for the same price . Do n't waste your money - Keep shopping .

It 's already 01/02/04 , and I still have n't seen the rain suit !! Shipping was supposed to occur within 2 -3 business days , per the information provided . However , the next shipping date has moved to 01/06/04 !! Every day when I check on the status , the shipping date gets moved further and further out . Also , there is no notification from the vendor about the delay . I 'm beginning to wonder if I 'm ever going to get to give this to my husband . Mybe next Christmas - this is , if I 'm really lucky.This is assinine !

 Although they look very nice when brand new , the color -LRB- blue -RRB- fades dramatically after a fewuses of playing tennis .

 We never got the right size boots out of this company - we tried for a month before Halloween . BOOOOOOOO
 The gun was OK , but we wanted a cap gun , and ordered roll caps along with it - and it DOES NOT fire caps as advertised .
 I recieved this along with other items I purchased , all of the items were boxed together , this pittol was just laying in the box , not packaged , not even in any form of box or container , the &#34; wood &#34; part of the pistol was marred , it actually looked as if it had been played with already , I am sending it back and NO I would not reccommend this item .
 This gun doen not fire roll caps but the other kind . Ordered roll caps and I dont need them . other wise its all good .
 While the padding , spacing etc hints at a good design and the materials seem of good quality , the `` assembly '' leaves much to be desired.For example the left front clip is seamed to the flap about half an inch higher than the right clip , and closer to the side edge of the flap . It is hard to describe it , but it very obvious if you look at it that the clips are not at the right place
 these glasses start with the paint peeling off with in a month.then if you fold them they will break and fall apart with in the same month . i purchased theses glasses before from another source and this all happened this year.i thought this purchase would of been a different manufacturer .
 Whatever it says is the material , this is made of hard stuff that is not comfortable . These pants look odd and they are odd . Also , this is certainly not relaxed fit as advertised . The one I received was way too small , not the stated size . I returned them . Be forewarned .
 My son is 3 and can pass for a 4 year old , so we bought the toddler size and it is VERY Snug on the shoulders but he loves it , that being said we have another week or so before halloween and I can not let him wear it until then because the seems at the sleeves were unrolling -LRB- very bad -RRB- so after halloween he will be aloud to play in it for as long as it lasts -LRB- which will not be long -RRB- I love the style and is just what I was looking for just wish I would have gotten a bigger size being as he likes to dress up as heroes and also wish it was not so cheaply made so he could have more fun with it - but for what we need it for -LRB- simply going trick or treating -RRB- it was a very great find ... as long as he does not grow any for another two weeks .
 My 6 year old son wanted to be Robin for Halloween because his cousin was going as Batman . When we received the costume , I took it out of the package for my son to try on to see if there were any problems . We had a couple of problems . The mask was too small . There was also a problem with the cape . I called and called CostumeHub no one answered the phone . It was during the Halloween season so I left messages on 2 different occasions . No one ever returned my call . I had to go and buy a new mask for the costume . I had to safety pin the cape . I did receive an email from CostumeHub wanting me to give them a good review on Amazon . I told them that I was not happy with my CostumeHub experience . They wanted to know what my issues were . I sent them an email detailing my problems and I have yet to hear back . . that was 2 weeks ago . If you are going to buy a costume , I would NOT buy one from CostumeHub !!
 The scarf picture looks good and it seems like a great buy!However , upon opening the package the yellow is a darker shade than in the picture and then I notice a dusty smell to the scarf , So I 'm trying to air it and out thought about washing it , but the scarf says , `` Dry clean only '' so Now I have to pay for dry cleaning for I can wear it because dust and Myself do n't mix . It would have been nice if the scarf was in storage that the scarf was washed before hand.Other wise it 's nice and I do enjoy it .
 This mask is impossible to breath in . There are no air holes around the nose or mouth.Also , unless you have a very very large , round head , the mask will not fit properly and lose its form . What you end up with is a cat who looks like his face is melting . Not too great for a children 's event . We used it recently and it was a monumental failure - the mask scared the kids and the girl we had hired to wear it fainted .
 Whatever it says is the material , this is made of hard stuff that is not comfortable . These pants look odd and they are odd . Also , this is certainly not relaxed fit as advertised . The one I received was way too small , not the stated size . I returned them . Be forewarned .

 Sure they are soft and warm , but after giving several as Christmas gifts I was mortified how they fell apart after three days of gentle wear . Cheaply made , soles seperate from bootie and a complete waste of money .
 I bought 2 pairs one for me and one for mom . I got them both in M/L size . I wear a 9 and these are super tight on me . Mom wears a 6 1/2 and they fit her ok , but a little loose . The soles are very cheeply made . You are better off investing in some great slippers from a department store or just some nice soft socks . These are n't very comfortable and garbage .
 I did not like these at all . Too hard to walk in . will not wear .
 These broke right out of the box , they fit horrible and they flop around and are useless , even though 2 pairs only cost me 4.98 , I returned these ! I read the iffy reviews and took a chance , oh well you win some and lose some !
 Purchased several pairs in several colors to use as stocking stuffers . They were not at all what I expected . They are just a pair of fluffy socks with a no slip bottom . If your looking for something more substantial , this is not it . The quality was very poor and very disappointing . Needless to say , They were not given as gifts .
 these were ill fitting and very poorly made i guess thats why they were on sale ... get what you pay for ...
 I read the reviews before I purchased the Muk luk 's . Even though there were quite a few big negative NO 's , I ordered them anyway . I must agree with the NO 's . The words , `` Too good to be true '' are my warning to others . For the price , I should have known . Great idea , but socks work much better.D.Lee
 Bought these before Christmas to wear in the car on our two day trip . They started falling apart the first day ! Very unsatisfied with the item ! Do n't waste your money .
 These are huge ! I wear a size 7 shoe and the small are huge . Not only that but I ordered 2 pair and the other one is even bigger . Sure they are cheap ... but they are not worth it . Do not waste your money .
 It is not a pair of slippers nor a pair of socks . The quality of the cloth is very thin for such a model ... When you wear it , you feel like slipping at any moment .
 What a rip off ! These cheap and cute slippers were thrown together to make a quick rip off buck . Any decent company would have took the time to make sure they were stitched to last at least a few months of winter ! I ordered 6 pair , and 2 pair have fallen apart in the 1st week , with only 2 days of wearing each pair . I will not buy from Amazon ever again , as they know what and who they sell for and are contributing to scam jumk .
 I agree with NO STAR reviews . What a shame that anyone thinks this shirt should be sold . I am an long-time buyer from Amazon - how sad that I wo n't be able to use their services any longer . I am a proud 15 year employee of the Postal Service - and am concerned that this shirt is considered in good taste .
 I also agree with Brenda . This T-Shirt is in very poor taste to say the least . Show some RESPECT and COMPASION for the victims family and most of all children . How would you feel if someone was advertising your family member being murdered ??????? I also will never by from amazon and will share this with all my Fellow employes and family.BELOW ZERO STARS FOR AMAZON -LRB- IF THERE IS SUCH A THING -RRB- P.S YOUR RATING STARS SHOULD HAVE THE OPTION OF 0
 To all those who think this is funny . HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF YOUR LOVED ONE , FRIEND , OR CO-WORKER WAS MURDERED AND A COMPANY WANTED TO PROFIT BY MAKING A MOCKERY OF IT ?
 As a PROUD POSTAL employee of almost 18 years , I find this product in POOR TASTE , to say the very least.I understand the public views `` Going Postal '' as commonplace , but if you truly do the research , you will find PERCENTAGE wise , it is a rarity.Each and EVERY incident of violence to Postal employees or ANYONE is abhorrent and should not be glorified and profits borne from it . Fortunately and unfortunately sometimes , that is the American way . Decency and compassion do not seem to come into play when money is to be made.One would think a company of your size and reputation would not stoop so low.I , for one , will NOT be shopping AMAZON and will encourage MANY POSTAL WORKERS not to shop as well.ZERO STARS FOR AMAZON !!!!
 How would people react to a `` funny '' 9/11 shirt ? How about a `` funny '' Rodney King shirt ? Maybe a `` sarcastic '' Martin Luther King shirt ? For sure , a `` funny '' Natalie Holloway shirt!This is America and people have the right to say what they want , but sometimes they should keep their ideas to themselves . The designers , manufacturers , suppliers , sellers -LRB- yes , you Amazon -RRB- and purchasers should be ashamed of themselves.To make a joke -LRB- and a profit -RRB- of a tragic situation is deplorable .
 My Wife is a Postal Service employee and I understand her work stress and the Departments grief . As a US Veteran , I also understand the horror of violence ! This is a dispictable mockery of a very imperative and needed service . One that is heavily relied upon by our Citizens and Corporations ... Yes , especially you Amazon ! This is a knife to the back and the equilavent of an Pony Express rider shooting his own horse . You should remove it immediately , before a coalition does !
 Violence continues to be a great product of capitalism ; an ever present perverse demand and a never ending product supply.We condemn foreign terrorists but fail to acknowledge our domestic terrorists and our deteriorating quality of life due to the violence that permeates throughout American systems and individual behavior.I find this item depicting violence displayed as a badge of honor indicative of our self destructive American society .
 Customer service is worse than awful , especially a gal called Kim . I did n't get a 2nd chance to give purchaser 's name & she refused to talk to me further , no matter how much purchase information I gave to show I 'm the actual purchaser . The irony is that it was they who got my records wrong ! So , do n't sigh , nor cough , nor say `` what ? '' . She 'll count these as buyer 's name misquoted too . The consolation is that the product is of good quality for the discounted price .
 Whatever it says is the material , this is made of hard stuff that is not comfortable . These pants look odd and they are odd . Also , this is certainly not relaxed fit as advertised . The one I received was way too small , not the stated size . I returned them . Be forewarned .
 The item was posted as being in stock but I learned after I ordered it that it was out of stock . When I tried to contact the seller , he never replied .
 These are stupid shirts that are scaring witnesses to tell the truth in murders .
 I love this bag for its storage , lightness and look . The straps sit well on my shoulder and it is very comfortable to carry . I have been using it for LESS THAN a month -LRB- got it for Christmas -RRB- and today when I went to pick it up - the metal buckle that holds the handle to the bag snapped . I do n't carry anything but a laptop and my ipad in it so I know i did not over load the bag . Seriously disappointed .
 Both of my children wanted to dress up as Clifford this year ; and with few options available , we chose this costume as it seemed to be a better match for our warm climate . Bad mistake ! One of the first costumes we received had an issue with the red fabric dye bleeding into the white eyes and white bone , so my better half returned it for another several weeks before Halloween . The replacement suffered from the same issue , so we had to exchange it as well . In the end , we went though 5 costumes before ending up with 2 that did n't have the dye issue.So , we 're now just a couple of days away from Halloween ; and my better half has been working diligently to gently work out the deep creases and wrinkles in the costume and on Clifford 's face so it 'll sit up flat and straight . But alas , after trying off and on for several hours , Clifford 's face is just a crunched up , crinkled mess that looks very little like the picture for this product . Further , the felt on the head piece is separating from the backing material and my better half has had to use fabric glue to fix it.Bottom line
 Whatever it says is the material , this is made of hard stuff that is not comfortable . These pants look odd and they are odd . Also , this is certainly not relaxed fit as advertised . The one I received was way too small , not the stated size . I returned them . Be forewarned .
 Article , which I have purchased at stores , came in with loose threading all overinferior manufacturing . Amazon , gratefully granted me a credit .
 Well I am bummed to say the least . I bought two pair of these panties 2 months ago and thought great my quest for underwear that does n't ride up has ended . Well here I am now having worn these several times and had them go through several washings and yes they are now riding up ... . I will not buy these again . I guess my quest continues ... Darn I wish the Victoria 's Secret people would bring back there older versions ... I loved those !!!
 The socks came and they were pink and white , not green and white and the size was small petite , and I thought they were size 9-11 so I can not wear or use these socks . I suppose I could return them , but the socks did n't cost that much for the work of returning them .
 I order the pants express they were late and not the right size . I needed a large and got a small ,
 You advertised and sold to me 6 pr boxer briefs . I recieved 2 pr . That is a rip off .
 I have yet to reccived tham so I can not review tham till I reccive them.Thank you , Robert Butz
 This seller , `` In the Mood Intimates , '' is highly disreputable . I bought a matched bra and panty set , same color , as a gift . The bra was at a great sale price , the matching panty was at full price . The total , in excess of $ 100 , qualified me for a $ 10 discount and free shipping.Twelve -LRB- 12 -RRB- days after receiving my credit card remittance , they shipped me the panty only , with no explanation as to the missing bra . Over the next three days , I left eleven -LRB- 11 -RRB- detailed voice mail messages with In the Mood Intimates , receiving no response . Finally , another nine -LRB- 9 -RRB- days later , I received an e-Mail asserting that they no longer had the bra in stock , and indicating their refusal to accept a return of the panty -LRB- even though its packaging is unopened -RRB- owing to the nature of the item.Meanwhile , they have charged me for shipping and taken away the $ 10 discount.These people are dishonest .

 this jacket admittedly is made of some of the finest leather you could imagine . it is unbelievable soft and just looks nice . HOWEVER , it is truly unlikely to fit you . I normally wear a small or a medium , and i ordered the small jacket -- the sizing chart at Jos Banks says their smalls are made for a 34-36 chest . i am normally a 38 so if anything the jacket should be snug . unfortunately , I could fit two of me in the jacket . Unless you are going for an extremely baggy look , you must order a size down , leaving us smaller folk out of luck .

 `` medium '' and `` large '' are relative terms ... how about giving some actual measurements on these bags so a consumer can decide if they meet the right criteria !!??

 Reviewed this product once but someone must not have liked my comment . Yes , the socks are adorable . I bought them for my son and daughter-in-law 's baby shower . My son is a true sports nut and coaches high school soccer . However , when I received the box , it contained 2 pair of tennis socks and NO soccer socks -LRB- the main reason I purchased them -RRB- . I made the suggestion that it be noted that the picture of the product may not be the same as the actual contents . Do n't know whether this disclaimer is included in the description or not .
 I think the concept of this woodworkers respirator is great but unless your a very small person or a child these will not work . I am 5 '11 and have an average size head . When these are properly installed the bottom part of my mouth is exposed and does not fit properly . When it is fitted around my mouth , it does not fit right around my nose . The rubber mask needs to be a little larger to conform around the areas it needs to cover .
 the mask is fairly small , appears to be cheaply made especially the rubber strap - this strap will not stand the test of time . had i actually seen it in the hardware store i never would have bought , particularly at the near to $ 15 price . To me , the price/value would be more apt in the $ 8 range . It certainly does not look like the pic on amazon - the pic makes it appear larger than it is , the surface area of the filter hence will be limited in it 's ability to handle larger volumnes of air over time - but then they want you to buy replacement filters faster .
 I have ordered a fair amount of stuff from Amazon over the past week , and have noticed some major changes in the MO of how Amazon seems to be treating customers , prompting me to do these reviews , the first I have ever done . At the time of doing these reviews , I have n't even received some these products , but I feel I must share my experience and opinions with other all of you who spend money with Amazon and make its executives very rich ! Please check out some of my other reviews relating to Amazon changing the vendor , price and shipping rates on the same web page/product several times within a 24hrs period . What I now call Amazon roulette shopping.This review is related to choosing I `` FREE Super Saver Shipping '' . It seems to me that if one opts for `` FREE Super Saver Shipping '' , Amazon will intentionally hold up some of your orders at their distribution warehouses . The evidence for this with this product is that at the time of writing this review , on the product page they make the following statement . `` Want it delivered Monday , October 27 ? Order it in the next 14 hours and 8 minutes , and choose One-Day Shipping at checkout . '' I ordered this and other products ` Order Date
 The main complaint I have about the mask is it 's fit . Initially - it felt a little uncomfortable - but I got used to it where it did n't bother me to wear the mask.I was really excited to find an economical dust mask that I could replace filters and not spend too much money on the filters . I still have 2 packages of replacement filters that I 'll probably never use - after replacing the filter once - the mask no longer seals around my face.I think they could fix the problem if they had a dual point attachment connecting the strap to the mask . But it attaches at one point like a pair of swimming goggles so there 's not alot of flexibility to adjust the fit.My conclusion is you get what you pay for - and I 'm currently looking for another alternative to replace this respirator . It worked well initially - when I could get a good seal around my face.Jake

 This shirt arrived with a big hole in one of the side seams . Because I have n't had time to repair it , my daughter has n't gotten to wear it . I would have sent it back , but that costs more than to just keep it and repair it myself , however I am not happy about spending money on damaged merchandise .

 this jacket admittedly is made of some of the finest leather you could imagine . it is unbelievable soft and just looks nice . HOWEVER , it is truly unlikely to fit you . I normally wear a small or a medium , and i ordered the small jacket -- the sizing chart at Jos Banks says their smalls are made for a 34-36 chest . i am normally a 38 so if anything the jacket should be snug . unfortunately , I could fit two of me in the jacket . Unless you are going for an extremely baggy look , you must order a size down , leaving us smaller folk out of luck .
 I really havent got the order i placed for the luggage , hence i can not say on the quality of luggage set . However I just received an email from amazon that this order has been cancelled . When i called amazon help desk , they asked me to contact the actual vendor . I called them up , but it seems they are not 24x7 . I need to to go out for shopping luggage again . It 's really not been a pleasant experience .
 Well , The picture shows the gaiter looking comfortable , and roomy and long.but in actuality someone must have used a child 's sized mannequin head . because the gaiter i received is not that roomy nor is it that long , its a very tight fit to the face , almost too tight . and when covering the nose and ears the gaiter rises an inch or 2 above the neck . Too Tight Too Short.My face and head features are probably different from yours . but the above aforementioned was my experience .
 Due to lack of long flannel nightgowns available in thelocal business community , I ordered this nightgown on-linethrough Amazon.com . I knew most flannel nightgowns are n'twhat you call sexy , but expect them to be cozy , warm and durable . The ordering process was great , received theitem within 10 days . The gown was plain , but true to thepicture . The problem I found was the item began to frayat a shoulder seam within 3 washings . Durable it is not.I am required to send the item back for a refund . Because of the experience , I will think twice before ordering clothing over the internet.Long Striped Flannel Gown by Carole
 The striped flannel nightgown was cut way too small for the size I ordered , and the fabric looked different than the sample on line . Overall , it was not worth the price I paid . Very Disappointing !
 I wanted a long flannel nightgown , and I liked this style . I was disappointed after the first washing , however . It shrank so much , I could not wear it . It does run small , anyway , but the length became too short to keep me warm . More like a ballerina length after washing . It was pretty , just shrunk too badly .
 Whatever it says is the material , this is made of hard stuff that is not comfortable . These pants look odd and they are odd . Also , this is certainly not relaxed fit as advertised . The one I received was way too small , not the stated size . I returned them . Be forewarned .

 I felt vaguely cheated ... Pros : - Only $ 10 -LRB- shipping was free -RRB- - It is a neat `` idea '' - The short song is clear if not loud . - The `` beating heart '' is well done , but its actually only a `` heart beat '' sound timed with a blinking light within the heart.Cons : - Overkill on the packaging . This thing was taped and twist-tied down within its own box . It took me 10 minutes to unpack it using a knife and needlenose pliers -LRB- for the twist-ties -RRB- . - Battery compartment screw is inferior . It already looked stripped before I tried opening it . I finally used a straight-edge screwdriver . Another 5 minutes gone . - The arm for opening/closing the lid is partially busted ; it only opens the lid . - The special effects -LRB- lip open , song , beating heart , etc. . . -RRB- activate when you insert a coin . But the coin sensor is cheap , so merely flicking the sensor door with your finger tip kicks off the special effects . - The chest interior looks cheap -LRB- i.e. poorly painted -RRB- . - I think I got a returned/repackaged item .
 It is a cheap material that is for sure and it is standard design , good color though . We should keep in mind you will get what you will pay for .
 It was too small . I sent it back , still waiting the return of our money . Displeased .

 First Amazon review I have ever written . I.team arrived and the only leasson I learned was to moe closley read irem description , because if I had , I might have seen that it was only 1 pair of socks , not the 3 or 6 pair that other socks have been . The price of $ 7.50 per sock will teach me . A lesson well learned .
 Do not buy this hat . By gazing at the picture , you would think the quality could be decent and that it would make a nice outdoors hat . Wrong . The quality is that of plastic and probably cost about 1 dollar in Overhead to create . Go to Target , spend 12.00 , get a decent hat .
 Very flimsy and certainly not an XL which I ordered . I would pass on this product . Very disappointed in it .
 Simply , these pants are heavily overpriced . They 're made out of chip synthetic material -LRB- and not from natural materials as this company promotes on their official web page -RRB- . I bought XL size pants and after first delicate washing and drying , they shrunk to a medium size , so I gave them away . 60 dollars for nothing ... Especially , if you 're 6 feet tall -LRB- or above -RRB- .
 I recently purchased my first pair of these work PANTS . Size 30 x 32 . I have been happy with OTHER Dickies pants ... namely the workhorse jean with double knee . But if you are on your knees at all with these work PANTS , the lower seam of the double panel falls directly under your kneecap , making it almost impossible to kneel down on a hard surface without pain . Note that on their double knee JEANS , the reinforcement panel starts 10 inches above the bottom of the pant leg and works like it should . On these work PANTS , the panel starts 13 inches above the bottom of the pant leg . Why would they change it up like that ? I assumed when I bought them , the positioning of the knee reinforcement panel , within the same manufacturer , would be the same . When kneeling down , they ride up just enough to be too high for knee reinforcement . More like thigh reinforcement.When Dickies Customer Service was contacted for explanation , and refund , I got just the standard , non-personal form letter , not signed by anyone -LRB- but still saying to `` just call me '' if you have questions -RRB- They want me to pay shipping , handling , and insurance to send them back , and all they can do is send me another pair of the same style , size etc. . Very disappointed in this product and their customer service .
 AS SOON AS I PUT THESE ON I BEGAN DEVISING A PLAN TO RETURN THEM TO OUR LOCAL KMART FOR AN EXCHANGE ... TOOK TWO TRIES BUT I GOT THEM SWITCHED FOR A KMART BRAND THAT WAS MUCH BETTER ... AND YOU COULD SIT DOWN IN THEM .
 Im not sure if this review will link to the seller at all , but this seller is ridiculous . For one pair of pants , it took them 12 days to ship it and THEN another 12 days to arrive once they were marked as shipped , and I paid over 8 $ in shipping costs . bogus . The specific seller that i suggest avoiding is Silberman 's .
 I just purchased these double knee along with 2 regular pair of Dickie workpants . All three pair were 32 x 30 , but the pair of double knee were more like a 34 '' waist . So I am returning that pair and will try again . After reading all reviews , it seems as though the problem with fit isnt new to this company .
 Not even kidding ... brand new they are stiff as cardboard and extremely uncomfortable , especially when you walk or sit/crouch . Washing them a dozen times may help slightly , otherwise wear them everyday for a couple years without washing them.Unbelievable .
 Got my work pants and found they sent the completely wrong size . The slip with the correct size was sitting in the bag . Laziness is what I call it . Unacceptable .
 I doubt the authenticity of this denim jean . Not only are they way too small -LRB- I always wear a size 2 Abercrombie pant and these wo n't even button closed -RRB- , but the size on the tag looks as though it was modified somewhat . The measurements given in the description are inaccurate - I recommend ordering a size up or purchasing directly through Abercrombie to guarantee authentic items .
 This T-Shirt was supposedly `` licensed '' by DC and Warner Brothers but it 's really just the regular design printed on a standard T-Shirt Brand , Delta Heavy Weight to be exact ... kind of like false advertising since the picture they display is a completely different T-shirt than the one you receive . The one in the picture is of much higher quality than the one they supply , I know because I owned the one in the picture with the official tag , which , the one I ordered did not have .
 My husband said they do not stay on his feet at all . He wears a size 11 shoe .
 Since most of the gold toe socks come in packages of three , I assumed I was paying about $ 7.00 for several pairs . After all it says `` Anklets '' , not anklet ! There is one LARGE pair . They will work for someone who wears are larger shoe size , but I am going to have to return them or give them away .
 I usually do not write reviews maybe because I 'm usually pleased with the product since I rely on product reviews before I buy anything . However , despite the high reviews , this dress , for the high price I paid of $ 29 , is of HORRIBLE quality ! I bought this costume for my daughter 's 5th birthday and within 2 hours -LRB- no rough playing at all -RRB- the ribbon around the waist was unraveling . Also , as my daughter was dressing in and out of it throughout the day , large holes ripped in the outer netting in a few places . The feel of this dress is also very bad . I would n't have minded so much if I paid $ 10 for it , but definitely not worth $ 30 !!!!! I am very dissatisfied .
 This is not the standard dump pouch that you would expect to get . It is very small and requires Molle space avalible . Do n't buy unless you want a smaller pouch .
 I bought this a size smaller than I thought I needed , but maybe I would be happier with it if I had bought it 2 sizes smaller . I really do n't see how the material this is made out of can have any kind of `` firm control '' . Sure , it 's comfortable , but I was expecting some kind of control . It does smooth out some , but not at all what I was expecting ...
 Purchased for my mother-in-law but it was not at all what I was expecting and I hated the material . I returned it
 I liked this robe when I opened the package , but the first time I unsnapped it , two of the snaps ripped out . It was really poor quality ; however , I 've ordered other items from National and was really pleased . I ordered a different robe from them and plan to order a second because I like it so much .
 I got this bra when I was pregnant and wore it confortable until my delivery . After my delivery the bra was too small . With the engorged breast after delivery and just carrying mature milk afterwards it is just too small . I was n't told that my breast would get even larger after delivery . I thought they were big just before delivery.I decided to go w / bravado bra . It has worked out much better . It is comfortable to wear day and night . And as the milk comes in and out it is comfortable either way . The sizes are more flexable then medela . The strap support is better then medela.I have packed up the medela bras and will just use them during pregnancy if i have another . No use for them when i am not pregnant or for breastfeeding . And breastfeeding is their main purpose .
 When I hear `` full coverage '' I think of bras that wo n't reveal nipples . This is not the case with this bra . I do NOT want anyone to see my nipples showing through a blouse . Ever . I returned it immediately . I 'll go with something else . If you do n't care about having a bra give you full NIPPLE coverage , then by all means ... consider this one .
 I bought this bra from Macy 's online and had to return to the store because the under wire dug into my ribs causing discomfort and pain especially when sitting . Someone taller and built differently than I might find it comfortable and have no problem with it . I guess due to how my ribs are this bra was n't for me . I own other Wacoal under wire bras that I love and have no problem with . I 'm petite , 5 ' 3 tall and 34DD bust if this helps you decide if this bra could be for you.Other than the discomfort I really liked this bra and wish I could have kept it , I like that it has no seams .
 This is a comfy bra and I would love to get more , but the wire started coming out pretty quickly and I ended up having to throw it away . But , it is the best bra I 've ever owned up to the point of the exposed wire .
 I have exclusively ordered Wocaol minimizer bras for years now . I am least satisfied with this one for 2 primary reasons
 The manuf boast that this is a bra for full figured women . I bought several of these bras and spent a great deal of money , and they simply do n't work.Straps : They boast that these are comfort staps , but the comfort part is very short and does not extend to the area where most women experience discomfort . In order to get the comfort straps in place you have to tighten the strap and then the bra is way too high on the rib cage which causes other issues . So you have to choose between shoulder pain or rib pain.Cups : The cups have underwires that do not stay in place after more than 2 washes . The seamless sides do not support the DD cup and you spill over the top because you have to wear it on the last set of hooks . The cups do not provide any support for the DD cup size . It flattens and makes you look older and hanging.The cups are lined , but do not mistake this for light padding that hides the nipple . You will need a t-shirt bra for that . You can see all of your nipple in this bra.Elastic Sides : The elastic sides gave way and began to stretch out of shape after just a few wears . The elastic began to poke through the fabric in little white bands . The fabric looks worn on the sides while the rest of the bra looks brand new.Material : The material does not feel comfortable in the summer . The side panels are thick and they leave a lumpy impression you can see through your clothing . I hand washed and line dried these bras because I spent so much money on them . I bought special laundry detergent for these bras . I spent over $ 360 for these bras , chocolate , nude , black , white , & pink.This was a very bad investment because they did n't last 1/2 the year.I eventually switched to a better bra which is also made by Wacoal 835170 .
 I bought this bra almost a year ago . At first , it felt great to wear . It was comfortable , provided a good amount of support -LRB- I wear a 34DDD , so good support is a must -RRB- , and it was good for wearing under everyday clothing -LRB- though not for anything too low cut . -RRB- It seemed like I 'd made a good purchase overall.HOWEVER.About 2 months after I bought the bra , I noticed that the foam sling on one of the cups had detached at the top of the cup . I take good care of my bras , so I 'm not sure how it happened . At any rate , it has gotten to the point where I 'll only wear this bra if every single other bra I have is dirty and I 'm not going to be out in public because it only supports properly on one side -LRB- and it 's the side that needs support the least . -RRB- You can clearly see the sling 's detached on the one cup underneath clothing , too . There 's no way to fix it without ripping open the bra , and I 'm not a good enough seamstress to try to fix it myself.It 's a shame this happened , because I think the bra would 've been a decent one otherwise . I wo n't buy this kind of bra again , out of fear of the same thing happening a second time after spending another $ 60 .
 As of November 2 this is only one star as it was said to ship on October 3 with estimated delivery of 14 October . As of now I have n't received it , nor is the USPS showing anything more than notification that it is due to be delivered to them .
 The first time the belt was worn ... it fell apart.How could you trust a simple product like that to hold up your pants at a funeral ... while others struggle to keep a straight-face ?
 The year is now 2009 . Why is anyone making or selling hardside luggage without TSA approved locks ? Hello ? Hello ?
 I followed the advice of previous reviews and purchased the slip a little larger . The slip runs very small ! I had no problems with it at all .
 Classic 100 % cotton fitted Tee ran very small , I normally wear a medium in a Tee . I ordered a Large in this Tee as it was `` fitted '' and it was uncomfortably snug . The return procedure was more complicated than most . I am a frequent mail order/on-line shopper and rarely come across a seller who charges a restocking fee on apparel and sets a time restriction on accepting returns as this vendor does . Please remember I ordered only the one item , it is very possible that what happened to me was a rare occurrence .

 this costume did not include the gloves , which is why i bought it . very dissapointing !
 Great service BUTI am a size 16w and got a 1x . It fit like a Large . Exchanged it for the 2x and it fit like a Large as well . I do n't know what to tell you except order accordingly or use another vendor for your leather skirts .
 I was very excited when I saw all the internal bags this bag had . It 's spacy enough even if you have a 17 '' laptop . It 's comfortable and looks good . I can put all my stuff in the different places , which are very comfortable . Most people would n't think that it contains a laptop . HOWEVER , the pieces -LRB- zipper , `` arma '' -RRB- started falling apart after 2 months of use . I asked for help from ebags but they never returned my questions . If i were you , I would buy a LLBean bag . THOSE one really last and have guarantee .
 Have worn the same size Maidenform bra for years . They discontinue styles constantly , so I have to keep switching . Figured I 'd try this one - but the fit is TOTALLY different . Way , way too snug around the chest , very uncomfortable . Order UP in the `` number '' if you must order ... cup size seemed OK .
 I ordered a 36dd which is my true size , only to be disappointed with a strange fitting bra , that is VERY uncomfortable . The bra appears to have the appropriate cup size , but the fit is bizarre and I am very squished . The underwire leaves huge red marks on my sternum and I feel like it is meant to spread and smash your chest . It definitely didnt do miracles for me !
 Amazon will add additional shipping charges that will not appear during the checkout process ! By the time you find out - it will be too late to cancel your order . Take your business elswhere , unless you like costly surprises .
 In the picture it shows of this bra it looked as if it was low cut and comfortable , but it shows it in a smaller size than the one I wear , so once I opened the box I was very suprised that it was so huge and cumbersome . It could not possibly be worn with a low cut top , which is why I bought it . If you were a size 34d or above , beware !
 This specific Bra is not true to size , been wearing it for a few years . The band is narrow in comparison the the original and it does not have the white tag as all maiden fom bra 's do .
 I have purchased this brand and model bra many times before from retail stores . I jumped at the chance to get it at a lower price and bought two on -LSB- ... -RSB- . After one wearing each , the tab where the strap hooks onto came apart making both useless . I am very disappointed with the workmanship . I am wondering if they were defects or seconds . I wo n't order this product again .
 I liked the way it looked BUT it ripped apart in less than a month . I tried to contact the company about it but they never cared . I would consider something else instead .
 To his credit , the person in charge of shipping maybe the owner ? was on point and called when the package was returned from the post office . He made sure to let me know if there was a problem I should let him know.My problem is with the product . It runs small , a medium size did not fit my size 6 figure , and it is n't nicely tailored , I expected a finer quality for the price .
 My feet slip around in my shoes with these socks and they do n't absorb the moisture as well as more traditional fuzzy socks . Wo n't buy them again .
 I bought this to help me lose weight after having a hysterectomy . What I found out is that I 'll never be able to wear it outside of my home . While it makes my stomach look slimmer , it pushes everything up . You end up with back buldge . If you are short , it probably works great . If you are tall and a little over weight , you need a much taller one . Also , I ca n't eat when I wear it . Because it compresses everything and puts pressure on my insides , I vomit when I eat . I probably wo n't wear this long . I also do n't see how you could wear this as a maternity wrap . I just do n't think it would work .
 I tried to wear this in different sizes but it still makes me look like im back to being pregnant again ! This was a waste of money for me . Others says it works great for them but not for me . This must be good only to those skinny ones just like its showing in the picture .
 Being in the military , I have a limited amount of time to get back in shape after having a baby . Along with daily exercise and a super healthy diet , I bought this item to help out . Sure it helped me look alright under clothing -LRB- assuming I did n't move far or sit down -RRB- but that was the only benefit . Every time I sat down , it would scrunch up . After I left the hospital , I had a 34in waist . This product was FAR too tight . My husband had to help me and even he struggled . I would n't recommend this product to my worst enemy . If you 're looking for something that actually works , buy the `` lytess new mom wasp waist panty '' from blissworld.com I 'm almost back to my pre-pregnancy size !
 Please dont waste your money for this product . It is waste ... I never recommend for any one i know.After a week of buying this , it lost its elasticity . . Never buy
 slips down and is n't tight enough wish I would have paid more money for a good one .
 I got this product before I had my baby for after the baby to help slim my waist line . I wore it at bed and during the day for several weeks . I was very uncomfortable , where the velcro attached at the top and bottom it rubbed into my skin , it did NOT look good under cloths or even pajamas ' . It did not work .
 I bought this when I was 4 months pregnant . I just had my baby 11 days ago and used this everyday until about the 7th day and the velcro was n't sticky anymore and would not stay . I am going to look for one that ties or hooks .
 I had my first baby via c-section . Like most new moms I was looking for a way to `` hide '' or get a jump start on losing my post baby belly . I read reviews of this product and for the price thought it was worth a shot . I wore it for about a week -LRB- for an hour at a time -RRB- . It was pretty uncomfortable and was not to worn out of the house . It flattened my stomach but just pushed the excess fat -LRB- in the front and back -RRB- up above the girdle . Not the look I was going for ! This girdle was not for me . I suggest saving your money and just give your body time to get back to pre-baby . It did just go through war after all !
 This belt does not fit the way it is advertised in the photo , because it is not tapered for the difference in size between waist and hip . As a result , it tends to ride up while you walk !!! It also is quite difficult to put on without assistance . Strong material and super handy velcro are a plus , but everything is a minus !!!
 this product was huge didnt fit sizes are crazy big the tell you not to use these at doctors office anyways talk to your doctor first
 This item is very scratchy and uncomfortable . It rides up or down while wearing it and can easily be seen under clothing . I do n't recommend it .
 I did n't like it . Maybe it was just me but it did roll up like someone said . You can still see it under your shirt to : - /
 It 's rigid , as it should be to hold the belly in , but the bottom of the fabric itches my upper legs - no wonder the woman on the picture wears shorts with it : -RRB-
 So I had 2 kids back to back and the muffin top of course . I figure this product would help me to fit into my shirts better . What a painful waste . This thing is clumpy at best . The velcro seam does n't even lay flat . It 's painful to wear and total waste of money .
 This would be a great idea for a post c-section operation ... however , you need to check with your Dr. first . I was advised not to use it b/c it could affect the way my scar would heal . Stick with a pillow if you 're worried about sneezing or laughing !
 I purchased the correct size -LRB- my waist was a 32 '' about 3 weeks postpartum -RRB- but the product barely fit around me . It seems from other reviews that the bigger sizes run much to big , and I found the small size runs much to small . Eventually , as my stomach began to shrink on its own - without wearing the wrap , I was able to fit it around me . Problem is , it never stayed in place and bunched EVERYWHERE so that it looked extremely bulky under clothes.Don ' t waste your money on this product . For only $ 55 on -LSB- ... -RSB- you can buy the Flats Belly Wrap . They have 6 or 7 different size options and it 's a true girdle , not a girdle belt . It works wonders and is much more comfortable!Happy Slimming !
 This item was purchased and I returned it because it was visible under clothing . The item was returned a month ago and I have yet to receive a refund . I have spoke with the same person several times from Underworks and no one will return my phone call even though they have on file the item was returned . Be careful when ordering from this company ... you will not get a refund in a timely manner or not at all if you are n't satisfied !
 The belt does n't stick any more after a few days unless you change the place to stick it , but then your belly wo n't change the size in a few days . .
 I wish I had listened to the other reviews that stated this ran large . However since I 'm a plus size , and I measured myself at a 50 I thought for sure the large is what I needed to buy . I was wrong . I sent it back and did not end up exchanging it . Also it was not comfortable for a curvy woman . Would NOT recommend .
 The sizing on this was way off , I had to return it . My neighbor actually gave me one that she had from her pregnancy and I used it for a couple days before it drove me crazy . It really dose n't flatter anything when using under clothes but I still do use it when I am doing a lot of lifting or walking with the baby ... it certainly provides support .
 I was looking forward to using this item after I had my baby this past January -LRB- c section -RRB- but was somewhat dissapointed when I received it . It creases in the middle just after the first use . It is somewhat uncomfortable and bulky , but for $ 15 dollars what do you expect ? I have a long torso and would have perferred something with more coverage and control . If you are looking for something of higher quality and comfort I would n't buy this product .
 The origianl costume arrived with the crown broken . Customer service was wonderful and sent another one out to me but that also arrived broken .
 Do n't waste your money on this product . There are sharp prongs on either end of the band to push into the hat . Poor quality cotton fabric , the hems are merely ironed over and come loose very easily .
 Beware ! Photo used shows long legged `` athletic style '' brief , Shipped product legs are about half that long .
 It was too small . I sent it back , still waiting the return of our money . Displeased .
 Unless you still have young , super-firm breasts , this bra will not work for you . It distorts the shape and creates a strange , flatten silhouette . I tried this on and looked 2 cup sizes smaller and I 'm a 34DD . Ick ...
 I was very excited upon finding this hot pink luggage , but when it arrived , that excitement vanished . The set arrived broken , stained , and defective . I immediately asked for a replacement which turned out to be worse than first shipment . The second set arrived broken once again , had a broken zipper , a blood stain as well as other stains , and a defective wheel . I would NOT suggest ordering this set . It is not up to quality as should be expected .

 This wig is of the poorest quality . It does not hold it 's shape and looks more like an ill-fitted swim cap than a cute Beebop wig .
 I agree totally with the previous one-star reviewer on the idiotic `` gapless '' design . After I received the product Hanes emailed me with this message
 I had to return the last batch of this product , which I had always loved . Apparently the design was changed by some female virgin who does n't know male physiology and moved the gap so high that you have to lower them in order to do your number 1 while standing up . i really hate that , and returned my last batch the moment I realized what had happened to make them claim them to be `` Gapless '' . Actually that name is correct for this design -- there is no gap where you have to have it . Since that change to a `` panties '' design as I see it , I have been unable to find the original design any further , making me very frustrated.What can we real males do to get them to offer their original so-successful design . Lacking that , does anyone know of another equally good brand that does n't suffer from this fatal flaw ?
 I could n't give this product a single star rating because , for me , they are the most comfortable boxers I have found . If not for that I would give them as low a score as possible . Why ? The no-gap fly is truly virtually no-gap . I have to pull the boxers halfway off in order to use the fly . If I am in a hurry I am better off pulling the boxers all the way down and sitting on the toilet because getting the fly in the correct place is way too time consuming.Last year I sent Hanes a suggestion to offer a `` classic fly '' that would accommodate my anatomy , and presumably many other men 's anatomies . I received a nice answer , but I do n't think they will ever use the suggestion . Meanwhile I wear Hanes for comfort , but curse them every time I use the restroom.If you are interested , this is the reply I received from Hanes : `` Thank you for contacting Hanes Boxers .

 I 'm used to manufacturers/retailers constantly cutting corners and cheapening the product . Never mind the inferior cotton/poly blend , the lack of elastic in the waistband , the limited of choice in sizing , I expected all that at this price . What is truly astounding and unforgivable is an opening that is does not come down far enough to function for its intended purpose . Another reviewer flagged this , but I did n't quite believe it . Here you have a major brand name in underwear that can not design a simple product . These shorts are an insult to the customer . Amazon would be better advised not to traffic in such garbage or use its clout to make Hanes get it right .
 When you telescope it out , the mechanism is so flimsy that it ca n't stay extended and keeps collapsing back into it miniature state .

 Does not look anything like the pictures . Sold by street side hawkers in India . Very bulky , ugly and poor quality .
 The stockings had a hard time staying up even with suspenders . There was already a rip on one stocking in the back .
 If you are smaller than most women this will not work . If you are bigger than 5 ' 8 '' 120 lbs this will not work . Since it was not expensive I did not return it , but it was put on once and that is it .
 I ordered these socks for a gag gift , principal had to kiss a pig for a reading challenge at school . Long story short I ordered theses socks thinking she has a small foot ... They were TODDLER socks ! On the Internet Amazon ad , it just said small . Since I own a pair of these , it did n't even cross my mind that they would be kids socks . No where on the ad does it say &#34; toddlers ! &#34;
 The waist band of the pants ripped away from the material the first time I put them on .
 I was disappointed with the ability of this fabric to keep me warm . The fabric would cool right down when exposed to the cold . My wife had a good response to these . Although , she too discovered that the fabric needed an outer layer to keep the warmth in .
 I guess you get what you pay for . These glasses provide a viscous glare on the inside of the lens that makes you worse off when you are wearing them . They are also made out of a super cheap plastic that feels like something you would get with a Halloween costume.Do not buy these glasses ! They look cool but they will make you feel and look cheap .
 I bought both the black and tortoise colors . They both look great on after a bit of adjusting , but the black pair split the rim at the lens after 2 days of wear . The tortoise color pair loose at the arm hinges but are still ok.Wasn ' t expecting much b/c of the price anyway ...
 I purchased this outfit for my daughter to wear at her 5th birthday party . We were having an Ariel Princess coming to the house . The outfit smelled horrific and she still has n't worn it . If it was n't such a pain to return I would as it was useless as even after leaving it outside in the fresh air it still had a terrible odor . She wore her Jasmine instead .
 I bought this for my daughter for Christmas . She loves it and it is really pretty . The Only thing is that the first time I put it on her and opened the velcro in the back , the netting tore . Each time she wears it , it tears even more . A little high for poor quality .
 I ordered my size and when I put it on , it was like putting on something 2 sizes too small . Maybe if I ordered 2 sizes larger I might have liked it but who knew their sizing was so completely off .
 SPEND YOUR MONEY on a NON-REVERSIBLE ! I will NEVER buy another reversible . I thought that Tommy may produce a better belt ... no different then the Walmart versions .
 This purse is super cute . That 's where it ends though . I used the bag once , did n't over fill it , just a few evening essentials and came away with pink hands -LRB- the dye from the sequins rubbed off on my hands -RRB- and seams -LRB- where the handles are attached -RRB- coming undone . Find a cuter bag some place else !
 I purchased this bag for our daughter . It was a little pricey for dress-up play , but if it did n't fall apart so easily I 'd say it is worth it -LRB- she loves it -RRB- . It was falling apart when it arrived , but I could n't get a replacement from Amazon so I had it repaired . It has since broken again twice , due to a flaw in its design . The bag is attached to the handle with thread -LRB- it is sewn into holes in the metal handle/frame -RRB- and when the metal rubs against the thread it cuts it just like a knife . It 's a poor design , plain and simple . If you buy it , expect to repair it .
 these capsules taste pretty awful , blood looks realistic thoughI would n't buy them again since they taste HORRIBLE , and at 25 cents per capsule they 're not a bargain .
 I paid for shipping along with the product and it came to me crushed and broken . Out of the 4 capsules in the pack , only one was sealed , but could not trust if it would work . I had to find a quick alternative to these capsules ordered ... red velvet cake mix and water . The company knows that blood capsules are fragile . They should have been packaged ten times better than what they were
 Blood is red , not pink . Do n't waste your money !!!!!!!
 First of all , I wear a men 's size 12 shoe which puts me at the upper size range for these socks . They were a little snug and not what I expected from a diabetic sock and certainly not like other diabetic socks I have purchased in the past.Otherwise , the socks were very comfortable and I had high hopes for them . Alas , after only a few wearings , holes appeared in the toe area . So I trimmed and buffed my toenails and tried again with another pair ... this pair lasted a little longer but holes still appeared pretty quickly.Perhaps they will work better for someone with smaller feet , but I wo n't be reordering this product .
 It was too small . I sent it back , still waiting the return of our money . Displeased .
 Well , I must say that I 'm quite disappointed about the service provided here.First , instead of a pair of hands I received only one single glove . After I wrote a mail to the seller I 've been assured that I will get the second glove as soon as possible . However , after waiting for some weeks now there 's still no sight of the promised glove ... I just hope it will get here sometime soon ... The only positive things I can say about this product , is that it is really well made -LRB- color , material , ... -RRB- . But I would n't recommend it to anyone with small hands , as it is just too big -LRB- like a real workers-glove -RRB- . All in all , I wish I could write a positiver review for this product , as I really like the idea behind it and intend to use it more often for horror-LARP , but without the second glove it would be quite difficult.Natalia
 These gloves are so tight , even my daughters thin hands could not fit in them . It is ridiculous that the company Grandoe only gives you thirty days to make the return . If you travel with your gifts like I do ... you wo n't be able to send them back within the short timeframe . So I 'm stuck with gloves I ca n't wear . If you purchase these ... do n't trust your hand width ... go up a size beyond that to make sure they fit . Or better yet , do n't buy them at all .
 The spec on amazon said 80 % cotton , but the mix was totally different on the label of what I received .
 I bought the size indicated by the sizing guide but still had the &#34; control top &#34; rolling up like a window blind the whole time I was wearing them . I wo n't buy this brand again .
 Did n't like the feel of these shirts at all . The fabris is stiff and not breathable . This also makes the shirt look boxy .

 The shirt is bright and colorful . However , the design was the old fashion heat applied graphic which requires special care and cracks very easily . I was very disappointed in this product . I was surprised that Amazon would put such a poor product in their line up .
 Awful customer service . The customer is NOT always right at this store . I will never buy from them again !
 disappointed with fit for me . sleeves , body , shoulders not seem to match in size . it a sloppy shirt . i like the material though . i would not recommend this shirt .
 I purchased this for my wife who is medium sized . It will only fit her head barely with only about 1/4 '' of velcro . This visor was obviously designed for a person with a larger head in mind but still , it can get about 5 '' bigger to they could have made the velcro path a little longer for womens sized heads .
 We also bought this to use in a David Bowie from Labyrinth costume . But , it was so ugly and cheap looking that the only reason we ended up using it is because we did n't have time to find an alternative . This wig ruined what was otherwise a competent Goblin King costume and it was a real shame . The top was messy looking and kind of fuzzy , did not spike well even with hair products added , and there were NO bangs -- everything stuck up , no part of this wig would stay down over the forehead . It was also a uniform light yellow and extremely shiny , not brown/blonde highlighted like the picture shows -LRB- the name even says `` mixed blonde '' but it is a totally uniform color -RRB- . It is really too bad that this wig is so cheap looking ; if it had just looked like the picture , the costume would have been something to be proud of , but as it is we ended up untagging all pics from this Halloween out of embarrassment .
 I did not like to product . This product does not give the breasts a natural smooth shape . I felt like I was wearing my grandmother 's bra .

 Due to lack of long flannel nightgowns available in thelocal business community , I ordered this nightgown on-linethrough Amazon.com . I knew most flannel nightgowns are n'twhat you call sexy , but expect them to be cozy , warm and durable . The ordering process was great , received theitem within 10 days . The gown was plain , but true to thepicture . The problem I found was the item began to frayat a shoulder seam within 3 washings . Durable it is not.I am required to send the item back for a refund . Because of the experience , I will think twice before ordering clothing over the internet.Long Striped Flannel Gown by Carole
 The striped flannel nightgown was cut way too small for the size I ordered , and the fabric looked different than the sample on line . Overall , it was not worth the price I paid . Very Disappointing !
 I wanted a long flannel nightgown , and I liked this style . I was disappointed after the first washing , however . It shrank so much , I could not wear it . It does run small , anyway , but the length became too short to keep me warm . More like a ballerina length after washing . It was pretty , just shrunk too badly .
 Hanes Women 's Classic Cotton Brief , Three Pack #CW 40I purchased 5 packages of this product -LRB- fifteen pair -RRB- without hesitation because I 've always been able to trust that any Hanes product would be good . Not this time . Of the fifteen pair , six pair had the leg bands separating from the body of the panty - this was straight from the package . They had n't been worn , laundered or folded . Since I had removed all of them from their packaging and had thrown all paperwork in the trash I chose not to return them . This is , however , the last time I 'll purchase any Hanes product .
 i 've buying hanes cotton panties for many years . i was looking forward to some new underwear , threw these in the wash as soon as they came in the mail , am very disappointed - very scratchy , not soft like all the previous hanes cotton undies i 've purchased . would return if i could and it was worth the time and expense . also i saw these in a local drugstore after i had placed my order for less than i paid online . will not buy again from hanes .
 It 's okay . It 's a lot more skimpy than the descriptive picture indicates.I kept it because I needed it and was n't willing to run from store to store to find a better constructed garment . Greatly overpriced .
 This camisole did not fit my purpose . The idea is great , but it did n't fit me correctly
 I did not like to product . This product does not give the breasts a natural smooth shape . I felt like I was wearing my grandmother 's bra .
 These stockings say they have 14 % lycra , which should provide mild support . In fact , they provide almost none , even at the ankle area . Guess you get what you pay for !
 These , at least for me , did not fit correctly and felt very cheaply made . I would not recommend this I would look else where at another pair of goggles .
 seems warm but it already has a hole where the stitching came apart . very dissapointed in that as i was hoping for a quality piece of clothing . i am a busy developer that wants to keep warm and dont have time to send items back or complain . it also fits very tight even though it is 2XL . i am 6 ' 2 '' , 220 lbs .
 I found this product to be less than desired . I am an avid hunter who hunts staying all night hidden -LRB- without moving for no less than six hours -RRB- waiting for my preys -LRB- mostly boars , hunted at night , with no more lights than the moon 's -RRB- . I was expecting some product that might keep my body 's heat , something critical when you are completely still for hours , at 10F ... perhaps this product will be OK for reigning temperatures no lower than 40/45F and keeping yourself in continuous activity , but for my intended use , it was quite disappointing ... Besides I found they do n't last for long , since mine is already tearing after some mere five time I wore it ! Under Armour is a much better option !
 I broke through the toe on the second wearing . Lousy product .
 These socks do n't stay up and that 's simply unacceptable , especially in a work situation . I 'm very disappointed and will be less inclined to buy Hue footwear in the future .
 Over price for what you get . Got a bag which really cant be used . Two broken straps and a tear on the bottom . I saw better priced ones , but I 'm the type that &#34; you get what you pay for &#34; so I went with the higher price ... I guess it always does n't work .
 I DID NOT WEAR THIS COSTUME . I ENDED UP MAKING MY OWN , YOU COULD SEE RIGHT THROUGH THIS AND IT WAS WAY TOO SHORT . . DID NOT LIKE AND I COULD NOT RETURN . .
 The Price of this item is Extremely High which it should not be . It should not be more than a range of $ 10 - $ 15 . No Zipper at all for extra protection or security . Without zipper any thing can be fallen easily that the case may be loosing important document . No section or space for putting pen or ballpoint pen . No front or back side pocket or separate section with zipper . Zipper means the extra security is very important and is missingtoo . I am not satisfied with this item at all . Not recommended to any body . I paid too much money to buy this product.Surendra Surana
 I just bought this bag from amazon . I am very unhappy with it . The bag had airlift 1.1 instead of 2.1 . The product description with the bag says it can hold laptop upto 14.1 inch . But the product description on this page says 15.1 . I checked it with my 15.1 inch laptop . It does not fit . I am planning to return this item . I wonder they supplied incorrect product information .
 One month after the purchase of the wallet it started to suffer damages on the duct tape material , like pinchings ! I thought that the material was resistant , but not at all ...
 I bought these boxers in extra large to wear in leiu of adult small/medium . While these boxers are as comfortable as advertised , they unfortunately run very long for children sized boxers . From the elastic to the bottom of each leg , I measure about 11 '' -LRB- or just above the top of the knee -RRB- . Just not my style .
 My mom bought this dress for my daughter , who like most little girls wants to play dress up all the time . However , the sparkles on the dress shed EVERYWHERE -LRB- her face/hands/our furniture -RRB- . We had to pronounce the dress `` broken '' and throw it out . The care tag says `` do not wash '' so we could n't even try to wash the sparkles away . The pink princess barbie dress has no sparkles and has been successfully worn almost each day for over 2 months now - however , it is also not washable so will have to be retired soon as well .
 This is one of those you get what you see costumes . It looks like the picture so no surprises , except for one important disappointment - size . We purchased a x-large which states 46-48 . Fits my husband in the legs but the minute he pulled up and tried to put over his shoulders it yanked it up - high up - not a pretty sight ! We are cutting it and sewing a piece to a tshirt , sad to have to do that when it states it is an x - large ! My husband is 5 ' 9 - he is not unusually tall ... So be very careful of size - and if you are a teen or a short man this would be your perfect costume .
 The neck is on the small side , so those with alrger babies probably would find the neck too tight.These are super cute , and the lining does slow wetness from getting to the clothes , but not as much as I had hoped . My main beef though is that when velcro sticks to the terry in the wash -LRB- which is inevitable -RRB- , the terry tears , so all of them have ripped up areas with the threads hanging out . They 're very thin terry . Do not recommend unless you pop them on for pictures when you absolutely need a bib -LRB- these are definitely picture-worthy -RRB- , taking them off right after - and you are willing to wash them by hand so that the fabric does n't get ripped up by velcro .
 I bought these in hopes that it would be a bib that my 10 month old daughter would n't rip off the second they were put on.In theory , this bib is nice.The velcro is strong , but she did manage to pull hard enough to get it apart and then a horrifying thing happened.We were right there with her , THANK GOD ! , when she started taking the bib off and while holding one end of the elastic neck piece , and the other end at the bib and somehow in a flash in front of our eyes , wrapped it around her own neck and pulled it tight.She had a terrified look on her sweet face and made this horrible sound -LRB- I 've never heard anyone being strangled , but I assume this is the sound and it haunts me now ! -RRB- Of course , we jumped up and took it away from her immediately.She has never done this with any other regular bib so maybe the elastic neck piece seems like a fun toy to her . Or maybe just as simple as she was trying to get it off and could n't quite figure it out with the new elastic part and just pulled the wrong way.It was absolutely horrifying for us and I am returning them . If I could give it a negative rating , I would.Please do n't leave your babies unattended in these bibs ! -LRB- All bibs can pose a potential hazard , but I find these to be especially dangerous . -RRB- Be careful ! We were right there with her and this happened so quickly !
 I bought these bibs hoping they would be good for up to 12 months . My baby is an average size 5 months and the neckline of the bib is too narrow and makes it very uncomfortable to wear . Do n't waste your money on these .
 I realize the bag was inexpensive but this was really cheaply made , I was a bit disappointed . I bought it to replace an old bag and I thought my old bag was cheap but this was even cheaper feeling.ThanksCustomer
 I ordered the wizard of OZ costume thinking it would look like the picture . As I was going to wear it to work . I work with special needs children and thought this would be a good costume , as it does not look too revealing . What I received was completely different . It was a short revealing costume and not at all appropriate . I am very disappointed with the costume and this company .
 The material is a little thin for hard work . Good think I ware them around the house and not on the farm
 I bought one jeans jacket , and was looking for a colour match pant . The colour did not match , and I was highly displeased . I would have returned it .
 Tried these in a 66 waist . Their characterization of these as &#34; Relaxed Fit &#34; is ridiculous . The waist was a 66 -LRB- I ordered larger to get a loose fit -- my waist is really a 64 -RRB- but the seat and thighs were nowhere near proper proportions for a person this large . It was as though I was trying to fit into a funnel that was overly wide at the waist and impossibly small at the knee . I 'd recommend skipping this brand in larger sizes .
 No era lo que se mostraba en las fotos , los sujetadores de la correa vino con 5 y en la foto salen con 7 . .
 I bought three pairs of these jeans for my husband and they have all ripped in only three months . All the rips start in the back pocket . Save your money and buy a brand that will last longer -- if you can find one .
 I purchased 3 of these jeans -LRB- 34x32 -RRB- and they are not 34 at all . I have other jeans and they fit perfectly , these one are too small . Very disappointed .
 nice jeans however the belt loops were to small , it would be nice if wrangler made the loops the same size .
 I usually never order jeans online and against my better judgement did so . If you dont really care about how your jeans sits on your body then you will find it fine , but the cut and fit was simply too relaxed for me . At the end of the day , leaves you looking sloppy .
 I ordered Men 's Wrangler Relaxed Fit Jean size 40x34 . When we received the package the shipping receipt AND the label attached to the outside of the pants said the pants were size 40x34 . However , when he tried the jeans on the jeans did not fit right . We then checked the inside tag and found that they were really 36x32 . We will be returning the jeans . I am usually pleased with Amazon.com however this particular item was a birthday present -LRB- he received the jeans one day before his birthday so there is no way to get a replacement pair here by tomorrow , his birthday -RRB- . Hopefully the return process will be smooth and they will send us the right size .
 They look nice but they do n't fit . Not even close . They were so unbelievably tight that I measured them . The tag inside the jeans is marked with the size that I ordered , but they actually measure at about 4-5 inches smaller in the waist . The price was pretty low , so I 'm wondering if they were rejects from a third world country manufacturing plant . Better to buy jeans in person than online .
 I love Amazon.com , but these Wrangler jeans look similar to Wrangler jeans sold in America ; but they are NOT the same as Wranglers sold in America . My husband says the cut is different and they do n't fit him as well . We noticed that the Wrangler label on the jeans is the older style than what is used on their jeans now . I 'm not sure if they 're just really old old Wranglers that were found in some warehouse or if they are impostors made in another country with the older Wrangler label on the back . Also , these jeans have stitching on the rear pockets and I guess the current -LRB- official -RRB- Wranglers do n't have back pocket stitching anymore . My husband says , `` no more internet jeans for him ! '' He wants to try on clothes in person .
 I received my jeans in reasonable time and the label on the jeans indicated they were a 28 inch inseam . However , when I wore them , they were dragging on the floor . I then measured them with a tailor 's tape and the jeans inseam measured 30 inches . My wife will now have to correctly size them .
 These have to be counterfeit , as the seams are sub-standard . No where near the quality of Wrangler jeans bought at a brick & morter store.Stay away , these are FAKE Wranglers !!
 If you are a long time Wrangler wearer , as I am , do n't be fooled by these . I made the mistake of keeping the three pair I ordered even though it is obvious that they are NOT the same as the original 31MWZWK jeans . They felt pretty good , so I decided to give them a try . These jeans are thinner material , have a different label , and shrank in size right after I washed them . They do n't have the rivet on the pockets and are generally cheaper in feel . Since these are the jeans that came up when I typed in 31MWZWK , I believed that that was what I was getting . I actually think that they might be a `` knock-off '' rather than the real thing . By the time I realized I no longer wanted them , it was too late to return them for a refund . I feel really ripped off .
 Ordered up a pair , reviews look good , got them fairly quickly , tried them on , they fit good . The right hand from pocket felt like there was something in it , like an `` Inspected by # 277 '' note , but it was just the wrinkled and crispy pocket itself . I inspected it closer , and it was full of holes ! The front left pocket had the same problem . Bummer . Sending back for refund . . not taking another chance , I 'll just go to the store and get jeans .
 Ped&iacute; unos pantalones 34x36 y me llegaron unos 36x32 . Afuera en la etiqueta dice 34x36 sin embargo dentro del pantal&oacute;n en la etiqueta dice 36x32 . Por tanto no me sirvieron y me quedaron super grandes .
 Smaller than they should be -- I 've ordered these exact brand , model and size at several other retailers in the past , with no issues . But even though the Amazon product showed the same information , including the same product numbers on the actual tags , their size is definitely not the same . I ordered the 40x38 , but when I compare these to supposedly identical jeans purchased in the past , these Amazon ones are about 2-3 inches smaller at the waist.Other than that they are good jeans , but for online clothing sales it 's imperative to carry accurate sizes since people ca n't try them on in advance ...
 I needed a new pair of Wranglers because all of my jeans were 4-5 years old - and looked it . I was shocked and disappointed to find that these Wranglers did n't have that new-blue look . They look like the 5 year old Wranglers that they were supposed to replace ! Amazon 's description did n't mention that these pants had a used look ; I 'll be returning them . I learned an important lesson
 Their the smallest 35 's I have ever seen . They would n't fit my son at all and were very tight on my grandson that wears a 33 .
 The jeans fit well and looked nice when they first arrived . However , they have already fallen apart . I am very disappointed with this purchase . I picked up a pair of Levis and a pair of Kirkland -LRB- Costco -RRB- jeans all around the same time . I am not very happy with the expensive Levi jeans either but at least they are n't falling apart . The most comfortable of the 3 pairs is acutally the Kirkland brand which I got for under $ 10 . I have worn them many more times than the Wrangler jeans and they are holding up just fine . I will NEVER buy another pair of Wrangler jeans .
 On me , they fit poorly when compared to the &#34; other &#34; big brand who makes lots of denim jeans . Tight in the wrong places where the others are looser fitting . No problems with the quality , just not a good fit for a mid sized round guy with short thick legs , lol .
 When I got it and tried it on , I discovered zipper sticks all the time ~ 1/2 way down , 3/4 way down , etc. . That 's the cheap part . Now , having worn it several times , I 've discovered that the white pocket bulges out as a matter of course - but just on the right side . That 's the poorly made part . Headed for the Salvation Army .
 I do n't know where they are making these jeans now a days , but be prepared to have them altered , The measurements are all off . I had to have mine altered by a taylor .
 I ordered 1 pair of Wrangler 's and they could n't seem to get them shipped out for whatever reason . When I order something simple , I do n't expect to wait weeks to receive it and if there 's a problem that holds the order up , I expect an e-mail to let me know , which never happened ! I finally canceled the order because my son started school and they were still telling me it would be a couple more weeks before they even shipped ? Unless you plan on waiting forever for your order , I do not recommend this company !
 I had ordered the Wrangler loose fit jeans of the same size last week , and LOVED them . I was looking for a replacement for Levi 550s and 569s , as they had turned to junk recently -LRB- easily ripped , shrank up in both directions -RRB- . The loose fit Wranglers were a PERFECT fit . Not so with these . The exact same size in the relaxed fit was OK for length , but instead of a 38x32 -LRB- as on the sticker -RRB- , I think it was about a 32x30 . Never have I seen such a difference in sizing amongst the same manufacturer . Poor quality control ; I 'd lose my job immediately if I let product like this ship !
 Wranglers have always been sized perfectly for me for years -- buy them at Target , do n't even bother to try them on , wash them , wear them . But the first time they were ordered from Amazon , the `` relaxed fit '' is so tight I have to do the old 80 's trick of lying down on the bed to get them to button . The waist might stretch , but the hip pocket is so tight I ca n't get my wallet in/out without making a scene . I asked the gift giver for the Amazon return label , and she looked so offended I dropped the subject.I think Wranglers are great jeans -- if these were factory seconds I wish they had been marked -- and priced -- accordingly .
 I 've been wearing Wrangler relaxed fit jeans for many years now , always ordering from Amazon because they always have my size . I may have to reconsider after the last few pair . As previous astute reviewers have mentioned , these jeans are not only missing the rivets , but they shrink A LOT . I have my own washer and dryer . I wash cold and tumble dry with cold air and still these jeans shrink WAY too much , going from comfortable to ballcrushers in one wash and dry cycle . Some reviews have mentioned defects and I have now joined that crowd . I bought a pair back in April . Do I wear my new jeans right away ? No , but I like to have a backup pair or two because I wear them to work and having a new clean pair on hand is important . I tore open the packing on the new pair this morning and was wondering if I had brain damage as I sipped coffee and tried unsuccessfully to get my belt in the belt loops , wondering what was going on ... until I realized the jeans HAD NO BELT LOOPS . What in the holy hell use is a pair of Wranglers without belt loops ? And what has happened to the quality control of these jeans that a defect like that could go unnoticed ? Since it is now near the end of June it is too late for me to return the jeans without going through all kinds of bull ____ , so I am EXTREMELY disappointed with Wrangler AND Amazon . Now some of you might say , `` Jack , why did n't you just open the goddamned package when you got them and give them a look see ? '' My response ? `` They are Wranglers from Amazon . I checked that I got the right size and color , why should I have to check for belt loops ? '' Please note I 'm a long-time Amazon shopper who has rarely had to return anything . So ... anyone want a free pair of jean with no ____ ing belt loops ? For Christ 's sake . I guess I 'll see what Levi 's has to offer in relaxed fit and hope I do n't get shafted again with missing belt loops or one giant pantleg or some other insanity.-Update 2011 07 18 - Two weeks ago I unwrapped the last pair of Wranglers I had tucked away from my last purchase . For two weeks they were great - a good fit , with a bit of room in the butt and crotch -LRB- I have to bend and squat and sometimes get right down on the floor under desks at work , so a bit of room helps avoid the dreaded testicular crush -RRB- . On the weekend I washed these jeans . NO detergent , just water . COLD water only , for a 20 minute wash and rinse cycle . They went in the dryer , COLD AIR DRY only , for about twenty minutes . Then I let them hang and finish drying at room temperature . When I put them on this morning they had shrunk at least 1 full size . I felt like my gonads were being crushed by an angry Sumo wrestler . That CA N'T be normal . Should I just buy jeans 2 or 3 sizes bigger from now on and assume they will shrink ? This is crazy .
 Disappointed . Size I ordered from Amazon is the size I always buy/wear from stores . The pair received , while marked as correct size ordered , were almost too small for me to even get on and zipped-up right out of the bag . I ca n't imagine how I would have gotten them on after a few washings/shrinking . They were made in Mexico , for whatever that is worth . I do n't see the point in buying clothes online anymore if you cant trust accuracy of sizing , and if that is n't trustworthy , what can one conclude about quality of materials , workmanship , etc. . ?
 I ordered a pair of these for my husband in November 2011 and he loved them . Great fit , super comfy and looked good . So I ordered him two more pair for Christmas in the same size . Well , they fit nothing like the exact same item we 'd ordered in November . They were easily a size too small and he could barely get them buttoned . I agree with the earlier reviewer ; these jeans bore no resemblance to the pair we bought from Amazon only a month before . I returned them and I 'm reluctant to order anymore -- even in a larger size -- because now I really do n't know what we 're going to get . Both orders of the Wrangler Men 's Rugged Wear Relaxed Fit Jean were made in Mexico and had tags indicating size 33x30 , but the first pair were easily an inch larger in the waist and you can tell by the numbers on the tags they must have been made in different factories . It 's disappointing to say the least . If Wrangler is going to have other countries make their jeans , they need to apply consistent patterns and standards . It 's called `` quality control '' !
 These pants are nothing more than long , baggy shorts , perfect for the `` sagging '' look and a drive by .
 Price is cheap , but the bibs are quite thin . Not good for juices or water since there are no plastic backings . Since it is terry cloth quality , it is hard to wipe away food spilled on them . But good for the light droolers . Good size ... not too small .
 I can not use any of the bibs because they scratch the back of my babies neck . These bibs would be great if the velcro was n't so sharp . They are the perfect size and do n't shrink in the dryer , like everything else . There are bibs made with softer velcro closures , I wish these bibs had those .
 I had read the previous reviews and decided to buy these bibs . I have a 5 month old who drools like CRAZY !! The bibs are VERY thin and I have to change them constantly.If youre looking for a cheap bib to go with outfits , this is your product . However if youre looking for drool bibs , this is NOT it!I am still in search of plastic lined cotton bibs ... Sigh
 bEAUTIFUL COLORS BUT THEY ARE THIN , THE SIZE WAS FINE . IF YOU HAVE SERIOUS DROOLER , YOU COULD USE ALL 10 IN A MATTER 3/4 HOURS .
 These bibs are a good size width and length and they have a large neck opening , so they fit a toddler pretty well . But they are VERY thin , two-ply very thin terry . My 10 month old drools constantly and he will soak through these bibs in less than an hour . The shape of the velcro rough and soft sides do not match , so you have to be careful how you fasten it to make sure the rough side does n't touch baby 's neck . And be sure to fasten it before the wash so they do n't eat your other clothes . They are bright pretty colors and they do n't fade or shrink in the wash.Bottom line
 Although these bibs are large in size , they are way too thin . When my 3-1/2 month old drools or spits up the moisture goes straight through to his clothes and they end up wet anyway . Also the neck size is large and is too big for him . I ordered the green sprouts waterproof pack of 10 bibs and they are well worth the extra $ . They are waterproof , fit his neck perfectly and are also large enough to catch his drool and spit ups .
 These bibs started falling apart after ONE wash ! Pathetic . The velcro on all of them unraveled and now the tabs are falling off . Plus the velcro tab is really small so they do n't adjust much , making a gap between my baby 's neck and the bib so her clothing gets dirty anyway . Seriously , if you want throw away bibs , these are for you . If you want something that is going to last , look elsewhere .
 This jacket is worst outerwear that I have ever seen , although the image might look good in here . My size is usually between medium and large , I ordered size medium . However , when I received and tried it on , I end up look like wearing XXX-large jacket . Also , the craftmanship is very poor , the jacket feel uncomfortable and not smooth due to its uneven cut and badly sewing . I hate to return anything that I had order online because I have to waist my time to go to post office and I have pay the shipping and handling fee . Nevertheless , I returned it yesterday . Please do n't waist your money on this order , it 's not worth it at all .
 I really wanted to love this backpack and have continued to use it . The form and size were perfect for my needs.However , within 6 months of purchasing it , BOTH of the zipper pulls on the main compartment broke off . Very poor performance for a premium priced backpack.I put some twist ties in as replacement pulls - but for > $ 70 I expect more than disposable hardware .
 I purchased this tie for my son . He wears a tie to work daily . This Navy blue tie was not dark enough to match his navy blue uniform . After a few days the zipper broke . I offered to order another one for him he told me not to waste my money .
 My daughter wanted this soooo bad , so I finally gave in for Christmas . It arrived today and I am so disappointed ! First of all , the box does not have the castle top like the pictures show . Second , the clothes are really tiny and flimsy ... very bad quality . I just opened the box and some of the tops are already coming apart at their seams and around the edges . Third , the description should tell you that you do n't get all the different skirts really ; each skirt is half one color on the front , and half one color on the back ... rip off ! Lastly , for this cardboard trunk of junk , it was way too overpriced ! Now I 'm going to have to spend even more money buying her something better to make up for this tacky gift .
 The main reason this item recieved any stars from me is that my girls love to dress up , so I can not deny that it has a fun factor and that there is educational value since it gives a huge boost to the imagination . However , I have two girls both of whom are average height -- my oldest at 9 has outgrown this since she was 3 , but still LOVES to dress up . My youngest at 6 has grown out of this as well at age 3 . It is just not worth the money for the little time that they can use it . The quality is also horrible . The outfits do not stay together , the shoes break and the jewelry does as well . My recommendation is to go to a local consignment shop or clearance sales and buy some `` fancy '' dresses , buy some cheap jewels at the dollar stores and create your own princess box . My girls have gotten many more YEARS of use from the items I have purchased this way . Happy dress up Hunting !
 This would be great for small girls , however I got this for my daughter who is almost four and the clothes barley fit her . If your child is over 3 1/2 years old I would not recommend this .
 I ordered two for birthday presents . I got plain boxes that are already falling apart ... no castle , no castle-like attachment , nothing that resembles the photos posted with this product . Bummer , I could have bought the same clothes for much less , but thought the idea of a castle as packaging was great ! I guess some things you just should go to the store for .
 This toy is not worth the price , especially when you can get a Fairytale Wonderland Dress Up Chest at CostCo for around $ 30 with much better quality clothing that washes nicely in the gentle cycle and fits girls up to age 6 .
 My kids were so excited to have this this toy , but it was a huge disappointment . After about 2 hours the clothing was already starting to rip along the seams . By the second day even more clothing was ripped and glitter was peeling off the microphone in large chunks . We have had it three days now and I have resewn along the seams of all the clothes . The fabric is also very cheap and began to unravel on the pieces that were coming apart . As other reviewers stated it seems sized much too small maybe would fit 2 year olds best . I could write even more reasons why you should n't buy this but I think I 've said enough . I would not recommend this to anyone . My advice would be to buy `` dress-up '' clothes , at Goodwill or garage sales to find more durable , quality clothing your kids can dress up in .

 I love Amazon.com , but these Wrangler jeans look similar to Wrangler jeans sold in America ; but they are NOT the same as Wranglers sold in America . My husband says the cut is different and they do n't fit him as well . We noticed that the Wrangler label on the jeans is the older style than what is used on their jeans now . I 'm not sure if they 're just really old old Wranglers that were found in some warehouse or if they are impostors made in another country with the older Wrangler label on the back . Also , these jeans have stitching on the rear pockets and I guess the current -LRB- official -RRB- Wranglers do n't have back pocket stitching anymore . My husband says , `` no more internet jeans for him ! '' He wants to try on clothes in person .
 I received my jeans in reasonable time and the label on the jeans indicated they were a 28 inch inseam . However , when I wore them , they were dragging on the floor . I then measured them with a tailor 's tape and the jeans inseam measured 30 inches . My wife will now have to correctly size them .
 These have to be counterfeit , as the seams are sub-standard . No where near the quality of Wrangler jeans bought at a brick & morter store.Stay away , these are FAKE Wranglers !!
 I usually never order jeans online and against my better judgement did so . If you dont really care about how your jeans sits on your body then you will find it fine , but the cut and fit was simply too relaxed for me . At the end of the day , leaves you looking sloppy .
 Ordered up a pair , reviews look good , got them fairly quickly , tried them on , they fit good . The right hand from pocket felt like there was something in it , like an `` Inspected by # 277 '' note , but it was just the wrinkled and crispy pocket itself . I inspected it closer , and it was full of holes ! The front left pocket had the same problem . Bummer . Sending back for refund . . not taking another chance , I 'll just go to the store and get jeans .
 I ordered Men 's Wrangler Relaxed Fit Jean size 40x34 . When we received the package the shipping receipt AND the label attached to the outside of the pants said the pants were size 40x34 . However , when he tried the jeans on the jeans did not fit right . We then checked the inside tag and found that they were really 36x32 . We will be returning the jeans . I am usually pleased with Amazon.com however this particular item was a birthday present -LRB- he received the jeans one day before his birthday so there is no way to get a replacement pair here by tomorrow , his birthday -RRB- . Hopefully the return process will be smooth and they will send us the right size .
 Ped&iacute; unos pantalones 34x36 y me llegaron unos 36x32 . Afuera en la etiqueta dice 34x36 sin embargo dentro del pantal&oacute;n en la etiqueta dice 36x32 . Por tanto no me sirvieron y me quedaron super grandes .
 The material is a little thin for hard work . Good think I ware them around the house and not on the farm
 I bought one jeans jacket , and was looking for a colour match pant . The colour did not match , and I was highly displeased . I would have returned it .
 Tried these in a 66 waist . Their characterization of these as &#34; Relaxed Fit &#34; is ridiculous . The waist was a 66 -LRB- I ordered larger to get a loose fit -- my waist is really a 64 -RRB- but the seat and thighs were nowhere near proper proportions for a person this large . It was as though I was trying to fit into a funnel that was overly wide at the waist and impossibly small at the knee . I 'd recommend skipping this brand in larger sizes .
 No era lo que se mostraba en las fotos , los sujetadores de la correa vino con 5 y en la foto salen con 7 . .
 I bought three pairs of these jeans for my husband and they have all ripped in only three months . All the rips start in the back pocket . Save your money and buy a brand that will last longer -- if you can find one .
 I purchased 3 of these jeans -LRB- 34x32 -RRB- and they are not 34 at all . I have other jeans and they fit perfectly , these one are too small . Very disappointed .
 nice jeans however the belt loops were to small , it would be nice if wrangler made the loops the same size .
 If you are a long time Wrangler wearer , as I am , do n't be fooled by these . I made the mistake of keeping the three pair I ordered even though it is obvious that they are NOT the same as the original 31MWZWK jeans . They felt pretty good , so I decided to give them a try . These jeans are thinner material , have a different label , and shrank in size right after I washed them . They do n't have the rivet on the pockets and are generally cheaper in feel . Since these are the jeans that came up when I typed in 31MWZWK , I believed that that was what I was getting . I actually think that they might be a `` knock-off '' rather than the real thing . By the time I realized I no longer wanted them , it was too late to return them for a refund . I feel really ripped off .
 They look nice but they do n't fit . Not even close . They were so unbelievably tight that I measured them . The tag inside the jeans is marked with the size that I ordered , but they actually measure at about 4-5 inches smaller in the waist . The price was pretty low , so I 'm wondering if they were rejects from a third world country manufacturing plant . Better to buy jeans in person than online .
 It 's great other than the fact that the top of it is cut too high . It comes up over my daughter 's face covering her mouth and nose . An obvious bad thing . The material is too hot and heavy too . It would be great if we were sleeping outdoors and it was very cold . However , we have heat in our house and it 's too hot for our 71 degree house .
 I have been looking for a purple fleece vest in the stores and did n't have any luck . Was very happy when I found one on the net.The vest is cut a little long , I am not a short person , 5 ' 5 '' , but on the whole I am very happy with it.I originally ordered a X large and returned it for a large.I was very happy with the companies attitude on returning the X large .
 i ordered a ladies large and it was like a men 's extra large . Other than that , it was nice and fluffy . I loved the purple color .

 The old adage applies ... `` You get what you pay for '' . The price was good , but the picture of inside -LRB- open -RRB- of the item did not match the actual wallet I redceived . Inside was not leather as it showed . . I was replacing what I `` thought '' was exactly like another I had . Upon side by side comparison the quality and material of this item failed . However , The seller was very prompt in sending and the item was received undamaged . This bargain was NOT a bargain .
 It 's so big , it 's just like the one I bought a the discount store , It 's living in a drawer now .
 My wife complained she needs a new wallet , I research on the internet and purchase this Big Fat Wallet . She says its too big . But before too long it will be full of crap . She likes the smaller wallet but overstuffs it with papers , cards and stuff . Personally as a tool I think this thing has a lot of utility and would rate it 5 stars , but what do I know I 'm just a stupid man .
 I DID NOT LIKE the wallet i received . I ordered a BLACK and there was RED STITCHING at the corner of the back compartment where the smaller zipped pocket is located . This is not my first Mundi wallet and so I expecetd BETTER ... THIS IS A FAULTY PRODUCT and should not have been passed on to paying consumer .
 I had high expectations for this wallet . It appeared to be spacious , and well-made . When I received my package today , I was disappointed . The threading is falling apart at the seams , and you can see jagged edges around the sections that hold pictures . It 's as if someone took a scissor and inserted pieces of plastic to make the frames . There 's also a black stain inside of the wallet . This wallet is worth $ 5 , and since there 's a BIG sign that reads Made In China in the wallet , you would be better off buying a wallet on Canal Street in NYC . I DO NOT recommend purchasing this wallet at all .
 MUNDI Big Fat Walletthis was a rip off mine fell apart with-in 2 weeks it has a lot of pockets but made poorly i just wasted 35 dollars colleen
 The chemical smell on this wallet 's material is awful . I aired it for several days but the odor would not fade . Terrible .
 This wallet looks great -- and in some ways it is -- lots of room , and many slots , pockets for stuff . HOWEVER , it immediately picks up anything on your hands , so within days of purchase it was grimy and stained ! For the price , it was a HUGE disappointment . Do n't fall for the picture --
 I purchased this item based on the website description that it is leather . When it arrived , it was abundantly clear that it is plastic . It had a horrible odor and a tag on the inside indicated that it was made of PVC in China . I believe that this description will soon be corrected by Amazon so that other customers are not similarly misled . It should be noted that this item is sold and shipped by a marketplace seller and not by Amazon .
 I ordered the Mundi Big Fat Flap Wallet and got the Mundi Big Fat Wallet . The difference is the Mundi Big Fat Flap Wallet has a place for bills in the top zipper compartment , the Big Fat Wallet does not . I have had a couple of the Big Fat Flap Wallets and have really liked them , but did n't like this one . I really think someone in shipping picked up the wrong wallet or they do n't know the difference .

 I believe the tee was tagged 2X because it stretches . I could compare it to the stretch in pantyhose . Not what I expected ! If you want the tee to fit skin tight , this is the tee for you . I gave the T-shirt to my granddaughter who is a child size 10 . It fit her perfect .

 As soon as I opened them I was disappointed . I thought they looked and felt cheap . The color was also blue instead of black and the edges were almost rough , as if unpolished . The only good thing about these are that they are light . You can find MUCH better sunglasses on Amazon for the money .

 I had been seeking to replace my Teva `` Maui Cowboy '' raffia hat with this . This hat arrived and is too small on my head , and did not have the thin band as shown in the picture . The raffia is supple , but the hat 's shap is too vertical and not enough brim .
 I like the way it looks , and provides relief fromt the sun . However , the wire around the edge of the brim broke and is poking through the straw . Only got to wear it 4-5 times .
 The Raffia cowboy hat was not an adult hat it was a kid size hat . The desciption did not say it was for kids . The type of hat was correct but my granddaughter now has a new hat , she is six years old and it fits her.Not happy !!!!

 These stockings say they have 14 % lycra , which should provide mild support . In fact , they provide almost none , even at the ankle area . Guess you get what you pay for !

 I recently purchased my first pair of these work PANTS . Size 30 x 32 . I have been happy with OTHER Dickies pants ... namely the workhorse jean with double knee . But if you are on your knees at all with these work PANTS , the lower seam of the double panel falls directly under your kneecap , making it almost impossible to kneel down on a hard surface without pain . Note that on their double knee JEANS , the reinforcement panel starts 10 inches above the bottom of the pant leg and works like it should . On these work PANTS , the panel starts 13 inches above the bottom of the pant leg . Why would they change it up like that ? I assumed when I bought them , the positioning of the knee reinforcement panel , within the same manufacturer , would be the same . When kneeling down , they ride up just enough to be too high for knee reinforcement . More like thigh reinforcement.When Dickies Customer Service was contacted for explanation , and refund , I got just the standard , non-personal form letter , not signed by anyone -LRB- but still saying to `` just call me '' if you have questions -RRB- They want me to pay shipping , handling , and insurance to send them back , and all they can do is send me another pair of the same style , size etc. . Very disappointed in this product and their customer service .
 Im not sure if this review will link to the seller at all , but this seller is ridiculous . For one pair of pants , it took them 12 days to ship it and THEN another 12 days to arrive once they were marked as shipped , and I paid over 8 $ in shipping costs . bogus . The specific seller that i suggest avoiding is Silberman 's .
 I just purchased these double knee along with 2 regular pair of Dickie workpants . All three pair were 32 x 30 , but the pair of double knee were more like a 34 '' waist . So I am returning that pair and will try again . After reading all reviews , it seems as though the problem with fit isnt new to this company .
 Not even kidding ... brand new they are stiff as cardboard and extremely uncomfortable , especially when you walk or sit/crouch . Washing them a dozen times may help slightly , otherwise wear them everyday for a couple years without washing them.Unbelievable .
 Got my work pants and found they sent the completely wrong size . The slip with the correct size was sitting in the bag . Laziness is what I call it . Unacceptable .
 I bought these in khaki for work . Problem is I ca n't use them for work , because in florescent light they are green . They are perfectly khaki in natural light , but in a big box retail store they are green . Yep , definitely green .
 AS SOON AS I PUT THESE ON I BEGAN DEVISING A PLAN TO RETURN THEM TO OUR LOCAL KMART FOR AN EXCHANGE ... TOOK TWO TRIES BUT I GOT THEM SWITCHED FOR A KMART BRAND THAT WAS MUCH BETTER ... AND YOU COULD SIT DOWN IN THEM .

 Not even kidding ... brand new they are stiff as cardboard and extremely uncomfortable , especially when you walk or sit/crouch . Washing them a dozen times may help slightly , otherwise wear them everyday for a couple years without washing them.Unbelievable .
 Got my work pants and found they sent the completely wrong size . The slip with the correct size was sitting in the bag . Laziness is what I call it . Unacceptable .
 I recently purchased my first pair of these work PANTS . Size 30 x 32 . I have been happy with OTHER Dickies pants ... namely the workhorse jean with double knee . But if you are on your knees at all with these work PANTS , the lower seam of the double panel falls directly under your kneecap , making it almost impossible to kneel down on a hard surface without pain . Note that on their double knee JEANS , the reinforcement panel starts 10 inches above the bottom of the pant leg and works like it should . On these work PANTS , the panel starts 13 inches above the bottom of the pant leg . Why would they change it up like that ? I assumed when I bought them , the positioning of the knee reinforcement panel , within the same manufacturer , would be the same . When kneeling down , they ride up just enough to be too high for knee reinforcement . More like thigh reinforcement.When Dickies Customer Service was contacted for explanation , and refund , I got just the standard , non-personal form letter , not signed by anyone -LRB- but still saying to `` just call me '' if you have questions -RRB- They want me to pay shipping , handling , and insurance to send them back , and all they can do is send me another pair of the same style , size etc. . Very disappointed in this product and their customer service .
 I tried ordering a wallet from this company through Amazon , and they did n't send it ! It was supposed to arrive by the 24th of Dec. for Christmas . When the date was approaching and I could n't find any shipping information , I emailed them . I had to e-mail twice to get a response.They apologized that they did n't make the deadline . And they offered to include a `` put-the-blame-on-us card . '' I can not understand how this would make my gift arrive on time for Christmas -- or that it would even matter.For a company that is supposed to be somewhat reputable , they are completely unprofessional . Why pay $ 10 for regular ground shipping for a product that wo n't even arrive!I even had to contact them BEFORE they would tell me about the problem ! What would 've happened if I did n't contact them ? They were so blase about the whole order !!!! Is that customer service ??? I recommend choosing a different company !!!
 First of all , this is NOT heavyweight . It looks like a man 's underwear shirt . It comes out of the dryer like a washed and dried Kleenex . I will use these for rags .
 I 'd say it looks like a typical men 's tee - very loose . It changed it 's shape and became shorter and squarish after a couple of washes .
 The cotton is tough/rough not very comfy for a woman . Feels very abrasive-maybe it will get better after several washings ?
 The shirt shipped promptly . The color , design , and size met my expectations . But the fabric is rough , too rough and scratchy to wear comfortably . Also the hem began to unravel in the first wash . The only value of the shirt to me will be to polish candlesticks . I ca n't recommend it as clothing .
 AMAZON DID NOT DELIVER IN TWO DAYS AS PROMISED BY PRIME , SHIRT MIS-MARKED LOOKED LIKE A SAIL - SEE THROUGH CHEAP &#34; COTTON &#34; TOO LONG OF A TAIL FOR LADIES LOOK ELSEWHERE .
 I normally wear a Women 's L or XL in t-shirts or a Men 's M . These t-shirts fit my husband who wears an XL . I was very unhappy .

 Im not sure if this review will link to the seller at all , but this seller is ridiculous . For one pair of pants , it took them 12 days to ship it and THEN another 12 days to arrive once they were marked as shipped , and I paid over 8 $ in shipping costs . bogus . The specific seller that i suggest avoiding is Silberman 's .

 I bought these in khaki for work . Problem is I ca n't use them for work , because in florescent light they are green . They are perfectly khaki in natural light , but in a big box retail store they are green . Yep , definitely green .
 AS SOON AS I PUT THESE ON I BEGAN DEVISING A PLAN TO RETURN THEM TO OUR LOCAL KMART FOR AN EXCHANGE ... TOOK TWO TRIES BUT I GOT THEM SWITCHED FOR A KMART BRAND THAT WAS MUCH BETTER ... AND YOU COULD SIT DOWN IN THEM .

 I purchased last minute when my son said he needed to be dressed as a pilgrim for school 3 days later ... the costume ` worked ' , but son said it was cheesy.Mysteriously , the hat did not make it back from school !
 I have been looking for a purple fleece vest in the stores and did n't have any luck . Was very happy when I found one on the net.The vest is cut a little long , I am not a short person , 5 ' 5 '' , but on the whole I am very happy with it.I originally ordered a X large and returned it for a large.I was very happy with the companies attitude on returning the X large .
 i ordered a ladies large and it was like a men 's extra large . Other than that , it was nice and fluffy . I loved the purple color .

 Great shirt , but DO N'T buy it from Rock-Rebel Clothing . They have the absolute WORST customer service.I have ordered from them twice before and all seemed good . That is until I needed to send an item back for exchange . 2 MONTHS later and I still do not have my exchange item.It 's a miracle if you get a reply to e-mail and even when they do , they do not follow up with you - or - you just get a standard form reply . NO phone number either for service on existing orders.I now have my credit card company involved in an effort to get this resolved.BOTTOM LINE -- DO NOT DEAL with this vendor .

 T-Shirt did not appear at all as advertised.I was looking forward to a Superman T-shirt with the trademark light blue T-shirt and red Superman logo.My T-shirt was dark navy blue - almost black , with a Superman logo that was - orange-red and yellow , which did not resemble the original at all . They have `` SSSSS '' scattered throughout the Superman logo which is quite cheezy and again , completely different than advertised.The T-shirt does not appear at all as it was advertised and it is very deceiving advertising . I feel I have been had.Anyways , for a return from Canada to the States , I have to pay the shipping and it is not worth it for me.Very disappointed
 The shirt is made of cheap cotton , and the logo looks cheap too . I do n't like it .
 th T-Shirt is Diferent Color from the Picture in the Web Page.bad shoping .

 I really wanted this bra to work , but I just tried it on , and I am promptly returning it . It was very uncomfortable and just did n't fit me right . Too big in some places , too small in others . The fabric seems like it would keep you dry , but it feels funny on my skin . I am a 40DD and I was hoping I could use this for running , but I put it to the up and down the stairs test and did not feel at all supported . Maybe there 's no such thing for big girls like me ! As someone else mentioned , it does come up really high in the front too . My biggest complaint though is the way it made me look ! Seriously pointed cone boobs going on . My search for the perfect sports bra continues ...
 I ca n't believe this is marketed as a sports bra . It does nothing to prevent bounce . It 's being returned right away ! Really disappointed .
 ordered a 34DD like i usually wear and it was too tight . replaced it with a 36DD and the cups were too big . returned it for credit .
 I have this bra in nude ... LOVE it !! Comfy , cool , etc. , etc. . I ordered it in black for a special weekend occasion ... when I went to wear it , the sizing was at least 3 inches off & I had no choice but to wear an extender ... it worked , but not well . The following day -LRB- Sunday -RRB- , I sent an email explaining the situation to HerRoom ... 3 days later I finally get a response saying that I wore the bra , so I 'm stuck with it & sometimes bras just come in different sizes . Really ?!!? We 're talking 3 INCHES -LRB- at least !! -RRB- !! This is n't the first time I 've gotten a raw deal with this company -LRB- prior I bought undies ... took them out of bag to find a hole & never wore them ... they would n't accept them back , since they were out of the bag !? -RRB- . So again , I love the bra , but would NEVER buy from HerRoom again .
 I wear a 34DD and always wear minimizers . I need an athletic bra for the summer to wear with tank tops as i am running around with my 4 year old constantly . I ordered two different bras as they had similar reviews . This one makes your boobs very pointy ... like I said ... like torpedo boobs ... it also did not squeeze them in like I would have hoped . The other bra I bought is the Natori medium control underwire sportsbra . It was a bit more expensive , however it gives you the support and the comfort you need ... as well as a very flattering back line which is hard to come by when you have a larger chest weighing them down . I would pass on this one and buy the Natori !!!
 This `` Lunaire Coolmax Sports bra '' is actually a good bra as far as support and a nice smooth fit , and is also pretty effective at keeping the moisture -LRB- sweat -RRB- under control.Hence my two star rating instead of one . But I will never get to use it again as the underwires are torturous ! At 57 I am not new to underwires , I 've been making use of them for a few decades now , and I have never been so uncomfortable unless the bra was getting really old and thin from so many washings to the point where the underwire started poking through the seam.This bra 's underwire started digging into me right from the start . I know the size was okay , as I mentioned the fit was perfect -LRB- in both cup and width -RRB- . It was already washed and worn , so I did n't return it and because of the price I did n't want to throw it away . So I put it away and tried it again on one of those days where everything else was in the laundry . Same thing - although it did get me to do my laundry immediately , as I could n't stand being in the darn thing for more then an hour.I see mixed reactions to this bra from the reviews - but for me it was just a torture chamber and it 's not something I would recommend.The best sport bras I have found that have the same features are by Champion -LRB- with or without underwire -RRB- . Even the ones that do n't have underwires are quite supportive even in larger sizes and absorb sweat nicely as well . And they are very comfortable too.Have a great workout and Happy Shopping ...

 This was an awful compnay to work with - we received a broken item and it is essentially a loss to us .

 My son loves everything batman . He even calls himself batman , so when his 3rd birthday came , we thought the perfect gift would be this utility belt . How wrong we were ! The belt wo n't fit around his waist . We stuck a folded hand towel in the back to keep it up . The pellet foam gun , which turned out to be his favorite part , broke within 1 hour of play . He now wo n't wear the belt . He does however still play with the flashlight that came with it . Thankfully , I was more disappointed than he was .

 nice jeans however the belt loops were to small , it would be nice if wrangler made the loops the same size .
 I bought three pairs of these jeans for my husband and they have all ripped in only three months . All the rips start in the back pocket . Save your money and buy a brand that will last longer -- if you can find one .
 I purchased 3 of these jeans -LRB- 34x32 -RRB- and they are not 34 at all . I have other jeans and they fit perfectly , these one are too small . Very disappointed .
 I 've been wearing Wrangler relaxed fit jeans for many years now , always ordering from Amazon because they always have my size . I may have to reconsider after the last few pair . As previous astute reviewers have mentioned , these jeans are not only missing the rivets , but they shrink A LOT . I have my own washer and dryer . I wash cold and tumble dry with cold air and still these jeans shrink WAY too much , going from comfortable to ballcrushers in one wash and dry cycle . Some reviews have mentioned defects and I have now joined that crowd . I bought a pair back in April . Do I wear my new jeans right away ? No , but I like to have a backup pair or two because I wear them to work and having a new clean pair on hand is important . I tore open the packing on the new pair this morning and was wondering if I had brain damage as I sipped coffee and tried unsuccessfully to get my belt in the belt loops , wondering what was going on ... until I realized the jeans HAD NO BELT LOOPS . What in the holy hell use is a pair of Wranglers without belt loops ? And what has happened to the quality control of these jeans that a defect like that could go unnoticed ? Since it is now near the end of June it is too late for me to return the jeans without going through all kinds of bull ____ , so I am EXTREMELY disappointed with Wrangler AND Amazon . Now some of you might say , `` Jack , why did n't you just open the goddamned package when you got them and give them a look see ? '' My response ? `` They are Wranglers from Amazon . I checked that I got the right size and color , why should I have to check for belt loops ? '' Please note I 'm a long-time Amazon shopper who has rarely had to return anything . So ... anyone want a free pair of jean with no ____ ing belt loops ? For Christ 's sake . I guess I 'll see what Levi 's has to offer in relaxed fit and hope I do n't get shafted again with missing belt loops or one giant pantleg or some other insanity.-Update 2011 07 18 - Two weeks ago I unwrapped the last pair of Wranglers I had tucked away from my last purchase . For two weeks they were great - a good fit , with a bit of room in the butt and crotch -LRB- I have to bend and squat and sometimes get right down on the floor under desks at work , so a bit of room helps avoid the dreaded testicular crush -RRB- . On the weekend I washed these jeans . NO detergent , just water . COLD water only , for a 20 minute wash and rinse cycle . They went in the dryer , COLD AIR DRY only , for about twenty minutes . Then I let them hang and finish drying at room temperature . When I put them on this morning they had shrunk at least 1 full size . I felt like my gonads were being crushed by an angry Sumo wrestler . That CA N'T be normal . Should I just buy jeans 2 or 3 sizes bigger from now on and assume they will shrink ? This is crazy .
 Disappointed . Size I ordered from Amazon is the size I always buy/wear from stores . The pair received , while marked as correct size ordered , were almost too small for me to even get on and zipped-up right out of the bag . I ca n't imagine how I would have gotten them on after a few washings/shrinking . They were made in Mexico , for whatever that is worth . I do n't see the point in buying clothes online anymore if you cant trust accuracy of sizing , and if that is n't trustworthy , what can one conclude about quality of materials , workmanship , etc. . ?
 I ordered a pair of these for my husband in November 2011 and he loved them . Great fit , super comfy and looked good . So I ordered him two more pair for Christmas in the same size . Well , they fit nothing like the exact same item we 'd ordered in November . They were easily a size too small and he could barely get them buttoned . I agree with the earlier reviewer ; these jeans bore no resemblance to the pair we bought from Amazon only a month before . I returned them and I 'm reluctant to order anymore -- even in a larger size -- because now I really do n't know what we 're going to get . Both orders of the Wrangler Men 's Rugged Wear Relaxed Fit Jean were made in Mexico and had tags indicating size 33x30 , but the first pair were easily an inch larger in the waist and you can tell by the numbers on the tags they must have been made in different factories . It 's disappointing to say the least . If Wrangler is going to have other countries make their jeans , they need to apply consistent patterns and standards . It 's called `` quality control '' !
 The material is a little thin for hard work . Good think I ware them around the house and not on the farm
 I bought one jeans jacket , and was looking for a colour match pant . The colour did not match , and I was highly displeased . I would have returned it .
 Tried these in a 66 waist . Their characterization of these as &#34; Relaxed Fit &#34; is ridiculous . The waist was a 66 -LRB- I ordered larger to get a loose fit -- my waist is really a 64 -RRB- but the seat and thighs were nowhere near proper proportions for a person this large . It was as though I was trying to fit into a funnel that was overly wide at the waist and impossibly small at the knee . I 'd recommend skipping this brand in larger sizes .
 No era lo que se mostraba en las fotos , los sujetadores de la correa vino con 5 y en la foto salen con 7 . .
 On me , they fit poorly when compared to the &#34; other &#34; big brand who makes lots of denim jeans . Tight in the wrong places where the others are looser fitting . No problems with the quality , just not a good fit for a mid sized round guy with short thick legs , lol .
 When I got it and tried it on , I discovered zipper sticks all the time ~ 1/2 way down , 3/4 way down , etc. . That 's the cheap part . Now , having worn it several times , I 've discovered that the white pocket bulges out as a matter of course - but just on the right side . That 's the poorly made part . Headed for the Salvation Army .
 Ped&iacute; unos pantalones 34x36 y me llegaron unos 36x32 . Afuera en la etiqueta dice 34x36 sin embargo dentro del pantal&oacute;n en la etiqueta dice 36x32 . Por tanto no me sirvieron y me quedaron super grandes .
 These have to be counterfeit , as the seams are sub-standard . No where near the quality of Wrangler jeans bought at a brick & morter store.Stay away , these are FAKE Wranglers !!
 I love Amazon.com , but these Wrangler jeans look similar to Wrangler jeans sold in America ; but they are NOT the same as Wranglers sold in America . My husband says the cut is different and they do n't fit him as well . We noticed that the Wrangler label on the jeans is the older style than what is used on their jeans now . I 'm not sure if they 're just really old old Wranglers that were found in some warehouse or if they are impostors made in another country with the older Wrangler label on the back . Also , these jeans have stitching on the rear pockets and I guess the current -LRB- official -RRB- Wranglers do n't have back pocket stitching anymore . My husband says , `` no more internet jeans for him ! '' He wants to try on clothes in person .
 I received my jeans in reasonable time and the label on the jeans indicated they were a 28 inch inseam . However , when I wore them , they were dragging on the floor . I then measured them with a tailor 's tape and the jeans inseam measured 30 inches . My wife will now have to correctly size them .
 I do n't know where they are making these jeans now a days , but be prepared to have them altered , The measurements are all off . I had to have mine altered by a taylor .
 I ordered 1 pair of Wrangler 's and they could n't seem to get them shipped out for whatever reason . When I order something simple , I do n't expect to wait weeks to receive it and if there 's a problem that holds the order up , I expect an e-mail to let me know , which never happened ! I finally canceled the order because my son started school and they were still telling me it would be a couple more weeks before they even shipped ? Unless you plan on waiting forever for your order , I do not recommend this company !
 If you are a long time Wrangler wearer , as I am , do n't be fooled by these . I made the mistake of keeping the three pair I ordered even though it is obvious that they are NOT the same as the original 31MWZWK jeans . They felt pretty good , so I decided to give them a try . These jeans are thinner material , have a different label , and shrank in size right after I washed them . They do n't have the rivet on the pockets and are generally cheaper in feel . Since these are the jeans that came up when I typed in 31MWZWK , I believed that that was what I was getting . I actually think that they might be a `` knock-off '' rather than the real thing . By the time I realized I no longer wanted them , it was too late to return them for a refund . I feel really ripped off .
 They look nice but they do n't fit . Not even close . They were so unbelievably tight that I measured them . The tag inside the jeans is marked with the size that I ordered , but they actually measure at about 4-5 inches smaller in the waist . The price was pretty low , so I 'm wondering if they were rejects from a third world country manufacturing plant . Better to buy jeans in person than online .
 Their the smallest 35 's I have ever seen . They would n't fit my son at all and were very tight on my grandson that wears a 33 .
 Smaller than they should be -- I 've ordered these exact brand , model and size at several other retailers in the past , with no issues . But even though the Amazon product showed the same information , including the same product numbers on the actual tags , their size is definitely not the same . I ordered the 40x38 , but when I compare these to supposedly identical jeans purchased in the past , these Amazon ones are about 2-3 inches smaller at the waist.Other than that they are good jeans , but for online clothing sales it 's imperative to carry accurate sizes since people ca n't try them on in advance ...
 I needed a new pair of Wranglers because all of my jeans were 4-5 years old - and looked it . I was shocked and disappointed to find that these Wranglers did n't have that new-blue look . They look like the 5 year old Wranglers that they were supposed to replace ! Amazon 's description did n't mention that these pants had a used look ; I 'll be returning them . I learned an important lesson
 The jeans fit well and looked nice when they first arrived . However , they have already fallen apart . I am very disappointed with this purchase . I picked up a pair of Levis and a pair of Kirkland -LRB- Costco -RRB- jeans all around the same time . I am not very happy with the expensive Levi jeans either but at least they are n't falling apart . The most comfortable of the 3 pairs is acutally the Kirkland brand which I got for under $ 10 . I have worn them many more times than the Wrangler jeans and they are holding up just fine . I will NEVER buy another pair of Wrangler jeans .
 I had ordered the Wrangler loose fit jeans of the same size last week , and LOVED them . I was looking for a replacement for Levi 550s and 569s , as they had turned to junk recently -LRB- easily ripped , shrank up in both directions -RRB- . The loose fit Wranglers were a PERFECT fit . Not so with these . The exact same size in the relaxed fit was OK for length , but instead of a 38x32 -LRB- as on the sticker -RRB- , I think it was about a 32x30 . Never have I seen such a difference in sizing amongst the same manufacturer . Poor quality control ; I 'd lose my job immediately if I let product like this ship !
 Wranglers have always been sized perfectly for me for years -- buy them at Target , do n't even bother to try them on , wash them , wear them . But the first time they were ordered from Amazon , the `` relaxed fit '' is so tight I have to do the old 80 's trick of lying down on the bed to get them to button . The waist might stretch , but the hip pocket is so tight I ca n't get my wallet in/out without making a scene . I asked the gift giver for the Amazon return label , and she looked so offended I dropped the subject.I think Wranglers are great jeans -- if these were factory seconds I wish they had been marked -- and priced -- accordingly .
 Ordered up a pair , reviews look good , got them fairly quickly , tried them on , they fit good . The right hand from pocket felt like there was something in it , like an `` Inspected by # 277 '' note , but it was just the wrinkled and crispy pocket itself . I inspected it closer , and it was full of holes ! The front left pocket had the same problem . Bummer . Sending back for refund . . not taking another chance , I 'll just go to the store and get jeans .
 I ordered Men 's Wrangler Relaxed Fit Jean size 40x34 . When we received the package the shipping receipt AND the label attached to the outside of the pants said the pants were size 40x34 . However , when he tried the jeans on the jeans did not fit right . We then checked the inside tag and found that they were really 36x32 . We will be returning the jeans . I am usually pleased with Amazon.com however this particular item was a birthday present -LRB- he received the jeans one day before his birthday so there is no way to get a replacement pair here by tomorrow , his birthday -RRB- . Hopefully the return process will be smooth and they will send us the right size .
 I usually never order jeans online and against my better judgement did so . If you dont really care about how your jeans sits on your body then you will find it fine , but the cut and fit was simply too relaxed for me . At the end of the day , leaves you looking sloppy .
 Watch band is just junk . the strap that secures a watch was sewn in crooked and the hole that would determine the watch size was so close to the first hole only a watch .5 inches long would fit :-LRB- just poor POOR quality .
 Good idea , bad quality . It 's like someone cut a seatbelt out of a car , slapped some velcro on it and poked two holes in it .
 I have been looking for a purple fleece vest in the stores and did n't have any luck . Was very happy when I found one on the net.The vest is cut a little long , I am not a short person , 5 ' 5 '' , but on the whole I am very happy with it.I originally ordered a X large and returned it for a large.I was very happy with the companies attitude on returning the X large .
 i ordered a ladies large and it was like a men 's extra large . Other than that , it was nice and fluffy . I loved the purple color .

 Wanted something I could carry on the motorcycle and cover my ears , still lookin ' . Does n't look at all like the pic , the brim flops right in front of your face so you ca n't see where you are going . Looks like a girls hat .
 Another made in China rip-off , could have gotten the same thing for less than $ 5.00 at the local flea market

 I have ordered it and received it on time . It seemed to be of an alright quality until i wore it for few times and found out its of a bad quality and not worth the money at all . It got de-shaped after wearing it 4 times!The bottom line is i dont recommend it.Yazen
 Poor seams , & iexcl ; & iexcl ; they started to fell apart in the second day of use !! Wouldnt buy it again , and would love to have my money back .

 this product shrinks with washing . can buy the same quality at discount store . would not recommend
 There is a lot of inflexible plastic on the arms and shoulders of this jacket which makes it difficult to move around in . Both my kids -LRB- 9 & 12 -RRB- gave this jacket a thumbs down .

 I got these for my husband for a ren fair . The first time he put them on his shoes , the elastic band that goes around the bottom of the shoe ripped right off . After fixing this and wearing them to the fair we had a hard time getting them to stay up around his calves . With alot of adjustments they are fine now , but I would advise just spending the extra bucks to get real boots .
 I purchase the deluxe adult vinyl boot tops to complete my halloween costume . The boot tops were constructed well but apparently made to fit a large man . The boot tops will not stay up on my legs and I 'm a tall girl with med-large calves . I 'm going to try a circle of elastic to hold them up . I would stitch them up , but from past experience trying to sew on vinyl , it will only cut the vinyl.My suggestion to the vendor would be to offer the boot tops in sizes - small , med , & lg .
 I 'm a fairly big man with thick calves and despite trying to get the laces as tight as possible I could n't keeps these up on my legs . They looked good , but I finally had to do what many others did and pin them to my pants .
 While putting on with dress shoes the stitching on the elastic band gave out literally 5 minutes out of the box ! These are VERY low quality and not worth the price of shipping let alone the price of the item .
 The boot tops look great in the pictures , and the idea is a good one , but they simply never stop falling down . The effect is ruined when your flimsy &#34; boots &#34; are always dragging down to your ankles .
 Bought these for a LARP . They worked well for about 1 hour . All of the elastic straps under the shoe broke and they kept falling . Ya get what you pay for , I guess .
 They looked great but they were too big at the top and kept falling down . Definitely not meant for women . Also , the foot straps broke at the first sign of stretch . They did the job but only so ~ so .
 These do n't really look like what is shown in the pictures . They are very wide so unless you have gigantic legs they tend to just fall down around the ankles , 3/4 buttons fell of within seconds making me wonder if they were even attached to begin with , shipping took 3 weeks , quality is generally bad . NOT recommended .
 These look great in the picture , and they also look great when you receive them . The problem with them is they will not stay up . I tried using rubber bands , tying them tight with the string from the boot , basically everything I could think of , but they just would not stay up , and thus they looked terrible . I would just save your money and invest in an inexpensive , actual boot for your costume . I was very disappointed in this product .
 Stay away from these if you 're a larger guy . I 'm about 300lbs and 6ft and these would not over my calves . Just too tight .
 These boot covers are supposed to be for adults . But I would be surprised if they fit an 11 year old boy . The boot straps would not fit over his shoe .
 Unless your feet are tiny and you do n't have to wear them for very long , then by all means get them . These are cheap vinyl -LRB- little -RRB- boot covers that pull apart or rip at the slightest touch . There is nothing adult about these . Total waste of money .
 Wanted something I could carry on the motorcycle and cover my ears , still lookin ' . Does n't look at all like the pic , the brim flops right in front of your face so you ca n't see where you are going . Looks like a girls hat .

 I never got a chance to send back so now I am stuck with two hats that dont fit . Im tring to find someone with a small head to give them too .
 Okay for a kid . Nice pattern but the camoflague pattern sells at the dollar store . It 's ok looking , just cheap quality.Not horrible , but not great .
 This hat is of very poor quality . Bad crafting and materials . Look elsewhere , as this is not worth the cost .
 I have an regular camo hat that I bought from a surplus store in the late 90s . There is no way that the one I just bought will last that long .
 The elf ears were realistic , but there was no way to keep them on , I ended up putting earring thru them to help hold them on . Even then sometimes the tops would start to slip off . They were n't that big but nothing to hold them . If you have suggestions for that I would like to hear about them . Did get lots of comments about them , but it made the ears sore from pulling on the earrings .
 These ears are not as pointy as those in the picture . They would need some work to get them to stay on , especially on small ears , and make them look realistic . In order to keep the hat from covering them the hat tucked behind the ears pushes the ears out and they do n't look real . Waste of a little bit of money .
 The item came promptly and was packaged typically.Once opened I tried them on and they would not stay on.Since I am a grown man I figured maybe they would fit a kid/tween and so I tried them out on my niece and nephew , ages 12 and 15 . The same problem occurred with them ; the ears are not ergonomically designed to fit on a human ear.Looking at it , it MIGHT fit on a small child 's ear , perhaps 8 or younger could fit inside the opening.This `` one size '' does not fit all.I gave it two stars because the shipping was prompt and the Amazon return process was easy.Purchase price
 Very good purchase , not expensive , they are a good size and stay on your ears . Worked great for a Christmas Elf , just a few weeks ago !

 I bought the 38B and it just does n't work for me . Though I love the color -LRB- Toffee -RRB- , the fabric , the comfort of the cups -LRB- which are molded -RRB- , and the flattering cut of the cups , the straps on this have a terrible design . The adjustable feature stops right at the top of the shoulders , and there the fabric is sewn together so that underneath the straps , directly against your skin , are scratchy bumps where the fabric is stitched together . These leave my skin red and irritated . I 'm not sure why the straps on this bra are designed this way because it is very uncomfortable . Very disappointing because the reviews on many sites made this bra sound like an excellent choice for everyday comfort .

 The pants do keep you warm , but the material is thin and they are too long . Even when pulled up , they fall back down and hang off the bottom of the feet , making it difficult to walk and keep the pants on the body .
 These pants are waaaaaaaaaaay too long and the bottom elastic is made to be loose ; too loose for me . I like for my elastic to be more fitted at the ankles and these are not . They are made more like a straight legged pant that bunches at the bottom .
 garbage . shrinks in wash . tightens in allt he wrong places . a completets tep down for champion . do not buy . stay away from these pants .
 The pants are too long . The pants bottoms are practically open in spite of the elastic closure which are way too loose , so the pants being too long get caught under the shoes
 NOT true to size . Measured against another pair of Champion Fleece pants and waist band is the same but the seat is a GOOD 6-8 inches smaller . Quality control messed up on these .
 Thought I was helping my dad with this order but the pants were such a disappointment ! The elastic around the ankle was useless , and therefore created a wide leg pant that hung over the shoe . Not what the picture shows , and not what we wanted . Material is thin , and not what I would expect from a Champion product !
 The description of the pants includes elastic cuffs . I expected the pants to be too long for me , but with elastic cuffs it does n't matter . However these cuffs were much too weak to hold the cuffs up and I would have to cut them off to make them fit properly . Good quality product , just the cuff elastic was the problem . Easy to return with Amazon .
 I have been a long term purchaser of many Champion products , so it was without hesitation that I madethe purchase of the Men 's Double dry fleece pant which I use several times a week for my workouts.Unfortunately I was greatly dismayed when the stitching around the waist began to unravel afterabout 10 machine washings . I anticipate that they will be useless to me soon . This productdoes not seem to be up to `` Champion standards '' in my opinion . Too bad . I can not recommend .
 As others have said , they are much too long , and because there is almost no elastic in ankle cuffs , they slip down and hang off the bottom of the feet . I have to put some heavy-duty safety pins in the cuffs just to make them wearable .

 Pants indicated in the paper labels and bag which is size 36 x 32 , but in reality is size 38 x 32 , as says the label on fabric attached to it . Very nice pants but I can not use .
 Izod fits me well and ordered these pants to replace one that I was very happy with . However , these were cut way too skimpy and did n't fit . Additionally , the color is pumice , which I thought would be an off white like the pants they were replacing , but there very white .
 The Izod American Chino is not worth the cost . While they are comfortable -LRB- the minimum requirement of any pant -RRB- , they are more comparable to Lee Stain-Resistant pants which sell for about $ 18 at Kohls and that is what these pants should sell for . I ordered 3 but returned 2 . I kept the Pumice ones only because I liked the color a lot . If you want Izod casual Chinos I recommend the Madison series instead . More comfort , better material , better made .
 They are stiff , crinkly , and much too big . I ordered the right size but I am swimming in them . The waistband goes up over my navel or else the pants cuffs drag under my shoes . Oh well , pay cheap , get cheap .
 It is really sad to get a different color degree than you saw and except from the photo . I was really disappointed and I had to get another one from different place .
 I had a pair of these IZOD Chino pants that I bought in a department store about a year ago that were well made , using good , thick cotton material . I wanted another pair just like them and I could n't find them in the store , so I found them on Amazon and ordered them . They are not making the pants with the same material , they are cheaply made out of some thin cotton material . I usually do pretty good ordering through Amazon , but this time I did n't .
 Chinos are made from a much lighter fabric than these pants . The Sizing was horrible . I wear a 36 waist . My Levi 501s are a 36 and fit like a glove . I wanted a more comfortable fit for work , so i ordered a 38 . First , the waist is WAY too small . It feels like a 34 . Second , the rest of the pants are VERY baggy and loose . They look and feel horrible . My waist is being choked and the rest just hangs off . I bought Gap original khakis as a replacement , and they are an improvement in every way including cost -LRB- they were $ 15 on clearance -RRB- .
 I bought these for work , and while they 're OK for very casual days , they do n't hold a crease sharply , and they do n't drape well . They just look thick and clumsy .
 These pants looked , felt and wore beautifully but after 2 weeks the seams started to loosen and tear.Aweful .
 It gives nice separation . Good fabric . Be careful about sizing . I felt it was a size bigger than other brands . The under wire digs in a lot in the middle . Very uncomfortable .
 This used to be a great bra until they changed it and they no longer make it with a molded cup . It 's a nice bra if you 're looking for that style but I 'm an older woman who need help in the support dept with a molded cup !
 Unfortunately I ordered the wrong size and had to return this product . However , had I ordered the right size , I still would have returned it . The description states `` smooth cup '' which I took to mean that it would be discreet , even in cold weather . This was not the case , the cup has thin material and would not hide anything . Although it is a pretty bra , it 's not good to wear under form fitting clothes . : -LRB-
 My wife got these for me and I said never again . When ordering , she thought they came two pair per box but they did n't . These are a nice product , but you can find them cheaper at retail shops .
 These briefs were not usable since there is no open fly on the front of the brief . The front of the brief is completely sewn together . I had to get rid of these . My money was wasted on these .

 This is an average shirt . I definitely would not call it &#34; Stonewash Green &#34; . It is more like light &#34; sort of dingy green &#34; .
 I purchased these from Hanes direct in 5 different colors . The stitching is solid . Thickness of the `` Beefy '' brand seems warm and durable . I like the fit and how these wrap around my body.The negatives outweigh anything good I found about these shirts . First , These Beefy t-shirts SHRINK an extraordinary length of 2-3 inches on the arms and body length . To allow air drying takes an exceptionally long time . Placing in the dryer on a cool setting also takes too long and uses up too much expensive electricity . After pulling them out of the dryer , I tried one on . I was shocked at how much shrinkage occurred !!! The cuffs rescinded back from my wrists to 1/4 of the way up my forearm ! The length also shortened to above my pants waist line ! This is UNACCEPTABLE , Hanes ! All five of my shirts are worthless . I am 5 '11 and have average arms and waste lengths.The other negative thing about these shirts is the amount of color washout . I use the basic blue cap Tide liquid laundry detergent . The colors fade quite quickly after one wash.Overall these shirts are NOT a recommended buy . If Hanes created a `` TALL '' version -LRB- like Old Navy sells -RRB- and fixed their coloring process , maybe these Beefy t-shirts would have some value . Do NOT buy these shirts .
 Upon the first where it is excellent . Once you start washing it though , expect trouble . It does not stand up well to washing it all . In my wash on gentle cycle , with gentle detergent , in the most gentle fashion . I would say find a different product .
 I got a large -LRB- I wear a medium -RRB- just because it 's cotton and I figure it might shrink . Well , it did shrink -- much more than I expected . Probably next time I would get an ex-large , just because I like them roomy , expecially for exercise .
 I purchased these from Hanes direct in 5 different colors . The stitching is solid . Thickness of the `` Beefy '' brand seems warm and durable . I like the fit and how these wrap around my body.The negatives outweigh anything good I found about these shirts . First , These Beefy t-shirts SHRINK an extraordinary length of 2-3 inches on the arms and body length . To allow air drying takes an exceptionally long time . Placing in the dryer on a cool setting also takes too long and uses up too much expensive electricity . After pulling them out of the dryer , I tried one on .

 I ordered 3 sets of these : Chinese embroidered snap / zipper pouch set of 3 - assorted colors -LRB- # 97 -RRB- -LRB- 3 per set , total of 9 , in 5 different colors -RRB- , although I only needed one pouch , just to make sure I got at least one of the gold , which was the color I needed . Among the 9 sent , I got not a single gold ! Very disappointing . If the manufacturer is out of a particular color , better to notify the buyer and let them wait , if they choose ; OR , better yet , offer the option of 3 of the same color , even if at a slightly higher price .
 First of all , the wig was too small . Secondly , the material for the `` boots '' was different for each foot . Thirdly , the ring inside the dress was broken .
 I ordered mine in black , tore the ribbon from sock a bit just trying to fit it to my foot , I have large feet , but all be it , the sock is square ! . . lol . . and the laces are not made for larger calves either . .
 This used to be a great bra until they changed it and they no longer make it with a molded cup . It 's a nice bra if you 're looking for that style but I 'm an older woman who need help in the support dept with a molded cup !
 Unfortunately I ordered the wrong size and had to return this product . However , had I ordered the right size , I still would have returned it . The description states `` smooth cup '' which I took to mean that it would be discreet , even in cold weather . This was not the case , the cup has thin material and would not hide anything . Although it is a pretty bra , it 's not good to wear under form fitting clothes . : -LRB-
 It gives nice separation . Good fabric . Be careful about sizing . I felt it was a size bigger than other brands . The under wire digs in a lot in the middle . Very uncomfortable .
 this product was constructed from cheap material ! did n't survive one ! trip . do not waste your money . It use to be a great product in the past .
 I bought this bra based on the positive reviews that I read from various sites . The material , style and color are quite lovely . I was excited to try it on . Then my self-esteem fell through the floor
 Ordering and Return was fine ! For the money this was total garbage ! It is small for normal size . I paid 28.00 for costume then 7.00 for shipping and 10.00 to return . I was out the money for that . I wish I never order it in the first place .

 This was too flimsy and tight . So I &#34; d say the sizing is small and the material is not what represented in advert .
 I do n't know if you were supposed to get pads or not , because I never received any . The helmet is great though , and the jersey ifits perfectly , but i will grow out of it in a month . Overall its great but again where 's the pads ??????????????????

 I have been looking for a purple fleece vest in the stores and did n't have any luck . Was very happy when I found one on the net.The vest is cut a little long , I am not a short person , 5 ' 5 '' , but on the whole I am very happy with it.I originally ordered a X large and returned it for a large.I was very happy with the companies attitude on returning the X large .
 i ordered a ladies large and it was like a men 's extra large . Other than that , it was nice and fluffy . I loved the purple color .
 I ordered this great Item and what I got was a Item that was a bright `` PINK '' . This does not work for me as I am a guy going on vacation from Iraq . I was going to were this to go see a girlfriend that is into Butterflies ... she is not into men dressed in bright pink little girl looking things . I advise everyone not to buy anything from this seller .

 First Amazon review I have ever written . I.team arrived and the only leasson I learned was to moe closley read irem description , because if I had , I might have seen that it was only 1 pair of socks , not the 3 or 6 pair that other socks have been . The price of $ 7.50 per sock will teach me . A lesson well learned .
 I 've been using this clip for less than two weeks and the clip part with the magnet is already coming apart at the seams .
 Wallet arrived with stitching undone and easily pulled completely apart when I opened the side slot to investigate further . Parts of it were held together by glue , no stitching .
 see title . I found when I looked back that if I would have scrolled a page I would n't have made the mistake .
 Unfortunately , the seller failed to specify that the money clip is magnetic . Magnetism and credit cards - a recipe for disaster !
 You can not put credit cards in a wallet that contains magnets . I do n't know what they were thinking when they designed this .
 Honestly , paying this much , do you really expect it to be good ? If carrying your money around in a cheap piece of crap is for you , then buy this . If not , save your money . Give it to some hobo instead . This thing is so poorly made , the leather is so cheap and already torn in multiple places . The magnetic strip is misaligned and the stitching is already lifting . Seriously , is it just mine or are all of them this quality ? Regardless , I 'm not too upset , it was cheap . The first thing I did when I got this was throw it in my desk drawer , and went on Amazon to buy something else to hold my cash . Too crappy to use , not worth the trouble to return .
 I have had several wallets of this type , and generally think they are great because they are so thin and light . However , I ca n't recommend this one . I 've had the wallet for less than five months , and it is already coming apart at the seams . The `` side '' pocket has the external leather tucked into it and glued down , and the glue has released , leaving loose ends to flap around and get caught on things . Already time to replace it , and obviously I wo n't be ordering another of this type .
 This item NEVER said in the discription that it was a MAGNETIC money clip . It was not at all what I wanted . Waste of money and false advertising .
 The money clip would only hold one or two credit cards . It needs to be pre-stretched so you can carry identification with a few credit cards . Could n't use it so threw it away . I f you want to carry money and a drivers licence it will be OK .
 I was looking for an ID Holder that you can wear on your belt . It looks very stylish and it 's handy because of the extra pockets for a credit card on the back side . The `` leather '' is very stiff at the beginning but gets soft very soon . However that does n't prevent the snap from opening by itsself every time I bend over or sit down . That makes it pretty much useless , because now I have to worry about losing my ID all the time .
 the wrong color frames and lenses showed up . otherwise these are great sunglasses .
 I have several of these type belts . This one is worse than poor . The edges on the buckle are very sharp . Leading to scratching of everything
 Belt is heavy duty as represented , and you can probably tow a car with it . After saying that , you probably do n't want it to hold up your pants . The material for the part that goes thru the buckle is so inflexible that the buckle will not hold unless you pull it too tight for the wearer to breathe and nobody wears a belt that tight . Save your money !!
 Had to have amazon lite a fire to get them to respond to my request to return the wrong sized belt which by the way looks nothing like the picture . I thought it was a leather belt which it was n't some sort of web nylon deal , very poor description and not very functional belt . Loser of a belt really .
 I did not like this bag . Still have it in a closet somewhere . It 's too big and bulky.On the crumpler site they have this advertised as a photography bag . It 's NOT.Buy another bag . There 's better ones in the same line !
 This bra was purchased with the idea it would be uplifting . Instead I found my 38C hitting my midriff bulge . Not a happy experience . I have put this item away for emergencies only . If you are flat and lean , I am sure you will like it .
 I got this mask for halloween , but I never got a chance to wear it . Also it does n't really look like Darth Maul . And very hard to see out of it .
 I ordered 2 bras at the same time , one from another brand and this one - both the same size . The other one fit perfectly , this one was about 3 cup sizes too small . I ordered an F cup and probably got a D or maybe DD .
 I was really hopeful that this bra would fit well and be supportive . I wear a 30F so comfort and support are important to me and also hard to find . The original one that I ordered was tiny . It looked more like a DD , so I went up two cup sizes . The second one I received fit , I suppose . There was no side support and only two clasps in the back . It did not provide a very natural or flattering shape at all . More like a kinda pointy shape with some extra shoved under my arms . Just disappointing . I 've had two children and nursed them both , and besides unless they 're fake a 30F ai n't standing at attention without some help . This bra just did not live up to the hype the other reviewers gave it and i really wanted it to because it is really pretty : -LRB-
 This bra was great except the underwire is not covered enough so it stabs you ALL day . Was very disappointed ... sent 2 back . Also the bra was itchy in cups .
 Remember Madonna 's early 90 's look ? Not very flattering . I felt like I had ice cream cones on ! I will be returning this product .
 While this bra offers support it 's seems cause so much irritation and the top of the under wire on both sides rubs against the skin a lot causing tons of soreness and redness . I was fitted by a bra boutique as well so improper size is n't the issue .
 I 'd love the bra if only it had fit . I bought an 38F , which should be my size . This lovely bra fit in the back . The lift is great . I was disappointed to find it way too small in the cup .
 ok I bought this bra hoping that it would be comfortable and fit perfectly . I 'm a 44f and I was falling out of this bra my breasts are heaving and they just weighed the bra down . When I bent over the wires would jab into my armpits . Also the middle of the bra between my breasts would rub me and it was very uncomfortable .
 I have a love and hate relationship with Panache bras . I wear 40hh and there are not alot of bras in my size . I usually wear the Panache Tango plunge but I thought it was the balconette . This bra is cut way too high to be considered a balconette . The bra fit was horrible . It gave my breasts a horrible shape . I would love to describe it for you but it is not normal . The wires under the arm are high but not as high as alot of the Panache bras . The wire between the breasts is as high as a full cup bra and they spread the breasts unnaturally far apart . The cups are awful if you are heavier on the bottom part of your breasts . I have never really seen an extremely large breasted woman who has top fullness . The cups pucker at the top . They do not lay flush with breast . I would definitely not reccomend this bra . If you are looking for something a little sexier and low cut go for the Tango plunge . It is a much better fit .
 This bra is not recommended for those with a a small frame and large chest . I ordered a 28G and it stabbed , did not hold , and hurt my shoulders . After 20 minutes I was in pain and set it back ! Cheap material , scratchy , and overall not able to support a heavy weight !
 I ordered this bra based on the many people who seemed to like it . I was prepared to be shocked if it worked out . Sadly , it was not to be.In fairness , I ordered a bra that was too big , simply because I really did n't know what was going to work . After trying all of the several bras I ordered in some different sizes , I can say that I am probably a 42J -LRB- US measurement -RRB- . Which means I probably needed a 42H in this particular bra.Unlike some of the other underwires I ordered , this one hits my ribcage in a strange way that is not especially comfortable . The wires are also not as protected by a band or very much cushioning.The straps are useless . This bra is made as though it 's for a linebacker . Whatever frame they modeled it on had huge very wide shoulders . I predict on many women the straps will slide off constantly . I 'm a medium to large frame , my shoulders from point to point across my back are about 18 inches , and this bra 's straps want to be out there off my shoulders by another inch or two at least.I suspect this bra may run a little bit large , compared to others . The cups are outrageously large , and they are large in places that naturally large women are typically not . The pretty lacy material at the top was flapping around and folding over there was so much of it . Obviously the bra is made for women that have much of the breast tissue on top , rather than underneath . It might be a good bra for any woman who has had an enlargement , since the breast is usually fuller on top afterwards.This bra seems a little more cheaply designed than the other bras I purchased . The material seems a bit more flimsy.Overall it is not a bra I would order again . I wo n't return it , but it wo n't be a bra I wear often . It will probably be my laundry day bra .
 Out of all the bras I ordered size 32F , this is the only one that actually fit . Unfortunately , the look was totally unflattering . It made my chest look like two squished cones . Had to return .
 Have bought this size bra before from other bra makers -LRB- 34 G -RRB- , but this one was way too small . Extra disappointment on returning it unworn and within one day of receipt and being charged close to $ 20.00 from Amazon for the privilege of ordering this on a special offer plan .
 This is a pretty and well made bra but definately not true to sizing . Many bra makers make `` fashion '' bras it seems and they have some kind of formula for anything over a C cup . Well , they do n't work . I 'm average-to-small build but with natural large cup . Did n't even begin to come close to the right cup size . My sister who is 3 cups sizes smaller than me -- fit perfectly ! She looked great in this bra . Bras will say that they are for the larger sizes -LRB- C and up -RRB- but are not . Bali is true to sizing for me , but everyone is different . This one is being returned .

 Out of all the bras I ordered size 32F , this is the only one that actually fit . Unfortunately , the look was totally unflattering . It made my chest look like two squished cones . Had to return .
 This is a pretty and well made bra but definately not true to sizing . Many bra makers make `` fashion '' bras it seems and they have some kind of formula for anything over a C cup . Well , they do n't work . I 'm average-to-small build but with natural large cup . Did n't even begin to come close to the right cup size . My sister who is 3 cups sizes smaller than me -- fit perfectly ! She looked great in this bra . Bras will say that they are for the larger sizes -LRB- C and up -RRB- but are not . Bali is true to sizing for me , but everyone is different . This one is being returned .
 I ordered 2 bras at the same time , one from another brand and this one - both the same size . The other one fit perfectly , this one was about 3 cup sizes too small . I ordered an F cup and probably got a D or maybe DD .
 I was really hopeful that this bra would fit well and be supportive . I wear a 30F so comfort and support are important to me and also hard to find . The original one that I ordered was tiny . It looked more like a DD , so I went up two cup sizes . The second one I received fit , I suppose . There was no side support and only two clasps in the back . It did not provide a very natural or flattering shape at all . More like a kinda pointy shape with some extra shoved under my arms . Just disappointing . I 've had two children and nursed them both , and besides unless they 're fake a 30F ai n't standing at attention without some help . This bra just did not live up to the hype the other reviewers gave it and i really wanted it to because it is really pretty : -LRB-
 This bra was great except the underwire is not covered enough so it stabs you ALL day . Was very disappointed ... sent 2 back . Also the bra was itchy in cups .
 Remember Madonna 's early 90 's look ? Not very flattering . I felt like I had ice cream cones on ! I will be returning this product .
 While this bra offers support it 's seems cause so much irritation and the top of the under wire on both sides rubs against the skin a lot causing tons of soreness and redness . I was fitted by a bra boutique as well so improper size is n't the issue .
 I 'd love the bra if only it had fit . I bought an 38F , which should be my size . This lovely bra fit in the back . The lift is great . I was disappointed to find it way too small in the cup .
 $ 85 freaking dollars !!! What the hell is wrong with Ecko !!! I mean of course the clock is rare and it is a great stroll down memory lane , but there is no way in hell that I am paying $ 85 dollars for some cheap plastic with a cheap speaker inside that is muffling Yo G ! Yeah boy!Come ` on , lets be honest after mass production this clock probaly cost them $ 5 dollars to manufacture , the licensing fees etc. . . we have $ 10-20 dollars tops !! For a clock that once I am done with my bachellor life I need to either give to my kids or store in the closet.I will wait until they do not know what to do with all those overpriced clock and finally lower down the price to a level that doesnt leave your posterior aching everytime you are going to sit down.Yeah boy !
 This product is a cute onesie , but the snap broke the second time my son wore it .
 I had to return the glasses because the frames were bent . I did not receive all of my money back because I had to pay for shipping even though the glasses were defective . I will never buy sunglasses online again . Plus the glasses were dated 1996 on the paper in the box !!!!
 The material is polyester but it is the stiffest polyester ever made . You ca n't really tie this scarf appropriately because it is so stiff and awkward that does n't sit well . It 's basically useless and does n't look good at all . I would certainly not recommend this product .
 this product shrinks with washing . can buy the same quality at discount store . would not recommend
 This bag looks royal blue to me , does n't it ? Well no , the bag is the size of my head and it 's PURPLE.Luckily my roommate loves purple and does n't mind using a mini jansport so I gave it to her . They should put a better picture up and remind us of the size and how small it really is . They should n't forget to put the word MINI !
 The description says it 's good for small framed people . I 'm short and only require 1 or 2 books at a time in school . This thing is MINI . I can not fit a regular textbook in here let alone wear it . Returned !
 Not at all what I was expecting , would like my money back . The product descriptiong is way of the mark and quite misleading . This is a TINY , good for nothing backpack - will NOT fit a sweater like everyong claims , if by some slim chance they did get one in there , nothing else went in I garentee ! might as well just carry the damn sweater . Product is SEVERAL inches smaller than described - BEWARE
 This backpack is incredibly small . Unless you 're buying it for agirl , age 3-5 yr old , then it will be great . Otherwise , do notorder this . It is quite tiny and not worth it for anyone over 5 yrs . old!I returned it .
 So I bought this item , not knowing the actual size of the backpack . So before i bought the backack i called amazon and asked about it . The man clearly explained that it was a NORMAL sized backpack . So i get the package , late . But no big deal . . I open it up . If you dont know what size it is either , let me tell you . Its about 9.5 inches tall , 6 inches wide . This is smaller than the backpack you 'd see a toddler carrying around . Keep in mind that it was 24 dollars . I called amazon asked for a redund , Sent the package . No refund adter 6 weeks.Happy shopping .
 Just too small for wat i needed it for had to went and get something else bigger to use . .
 I clicked on a picture of an all black bag and all it said was `` black '' . When I received it , it had skulls and roses on it and the description on the invoice said that this was what I ordered . I went back in to see if I had made an error . I went up to the point of checkout and it automatically switches it from solid black to the bag with skulls ! Be careful when you order , double-check the description before clicking checkout . The picture shows a solid black bag .
 It was not as large as it appeared or the measurements indicated online . The fabric was n't a firm or heavy as larger bags . Overall look was a cheap bag , not the same quality as Jansport larger bags .
 the size is perfect but the straps are sooo uncomfortable ... really stiff not padded at all like the pic says ... wish i returned it .
 A lot smaller than I imagined . Was looking for a simple light weight backpack without a million compartment and that was perfect , but way too small . Just did n't work .
 This costume is almost 100 % see-through . Also , the neckline was torn and the baby-bump was folded in half during shipping so a huge indent was visible through the dress . It would have torn completely down the dress if I wore it all night . I returned it shortly after receiving it .
 For Christmas I bought one of these hats for my son in a local store . It was expensive -LRB- $ 75 -RRB- but looked as if it might be something that would last for decades . It was also incredibly warm and comfortable . I was so inspired that , after Christmas , I decided to get one for me too . I went back to the store and the hats in my size were gone . So , I ordered this . Buying through Amazon cost about $ 20 more than the one in the store , but this hat was so awesome -LRB- and it was so cold at the time -RRB- that I decided $ 96 for the last winter hat I 'll ever own is OK . When it arrived , it seemed smaller , less ` bushy ' than my son 's hat of the exact same size . We weighed each of them . Mine was 4 ounces lighter . The difference was in fur . I was as if one hat was made using a very large rabbit while mine was made from a much smaller creature . It is still warm . It is comfortable . But it is not the inspiration that my son 's hat was . And my family -LRB- especially son w good hat -RRB- laughed at me for a week whenever I put the thing on . The hats were both identical ` models ' and were both tagged XL .
 This hat keeps you very warm , but their is no liner inside to protect you from the itchiness of the lambswool . Also there is no elasticity around the cap to keep it from flapping up and letting wind in when it blows . I no longer wear the hat .
 The material is polyester but it is the stiffest polyester ever made . You ca n't really tie this scarf appropriately because it is so stiff and awkward that does n't sit well . It 's basically useless and does n't look good at all . I would certainly not recommend this product .
 I was very disappointed when this tee finally arrived . The lettering was cheap looking and the tee itself is very thin and oddly shaped -LRB- wide and short -RRB- . Definitely not worth the money it will cost to return , but not worth keeping it either .
 I purchased these from Hanes direct in 5 different colors . The stitching is solid . Thickness of the `` Beefy '' brand seems warm and durable . I like the fit and how these wrap around my body.The negatives outweigh anything good I found about these shirts . First , These Beefy t-shirts SHRINK an extraordinary length of 2-3 inches on the arms and body length . To allow air drying takes an exceptionally long time . Placing in the dryer on a cool setting also takes too long and uses up too much expensive electricity . After pulling them out of the dryer , I tried one on . I was shocked at how much shrinkage occurred !!! The cuffs rescinded back from my wrists to 1/4 of the way up my forearm ! The length also shortened to above my pants waist line ! This is UNACCEPTABLE , Hanes ! All five of my shirts are worthless . I am 5 '11 and have average arms and waste lengths.The other negative thing about these shirts is the amount of color washout . I use the basic blue cap Tide liquid laundry detergent . The colors fade quite quickly after one wash.Overall these shirts are NOT a recommended buy . If Hanes created a `` TALL '' version -LRB- like Old Navy sells -RRB- and fixed their coloring process , maybe these Beefy t-shirts would have some value . Do NOT buy these shirts .
 Upon the first where it is excellent . Once you start washing it though , expect trouble . It does not stand up well to washing it all . In my wash on gentle cycle , with gentle detergent , in the most gentle fashion . I would say find a different product .
 I got a large -LRB- I wear a medium -RRB- just because it 's cotton and I figure it might shrink . Well , it did shrink -- much more than I expected . Probably next time I would get an ex-large , just because I like them roomy , expecially for exercise .

 This is an average shirt . I definitely would not call it &#34; Stonewash Green &#34; . It is more like light &#34; sort of dingy green &#34; .
 I bought this bra based on the positive reviews that I read from various sites . The material , style and color are quite lovely . I was excited to try it on . Then my self-esteem fell through the floor
 I did not like to product . This product does not give the breasts a natural smooth shape . I felt like I was wearing my grandmother 's bra .
 Received the product as expected . Had the glasses less than 30 days and they literally fell apart . I have had SPY glasses before for years and never had a problem . The metal hinge where the glasses fold , literally came out of the plastic and they would not exchange for a new pair . I would strongly recommend you not buy from this company as the quality was not like other SPY glasses I have had before .
 The material is polyester but it is the stiffest polyester ever made . You ca n't really tie this scarf appropriately because it is so stiff and awkward that does n't sit well . It 's basically useless and does n't look good at all . I would certainly not recommend this product .
 i wo n't use the bag afterall as it has an odor and is ` weighty ' . Hope some of the price is helping charity .
 i was glad to purchase the bag and even happier when i recieved it . but why did it start to tear about 3 weeks after i got it . im really dissapointed because i mean i payed 60 bucks and not even all the money went to the cause and then i feel like i got ripped off because i cant wear the bag .
 I was bragging about this bag to my friends but when I showed them the logo , it was WFP and not WFM . It looks so similar to the ones that WFM sells , does n't it ?? If they HAD to use `` WFP '' as their logo , they could have made the bag look totally different from WFM 's . I think this is sort of copying and using someone else 's idea . Just slightly escaped from the legal issues ... Also , if you see the logo on the side pocket , WFP , it is not properly printed . It 's not in the middle , and it 's even tilted !! How unprofessional ... And the burlap dust gets on all over my coat and other clothes !!! They kind of burrow into the fabrics that it is really hard to get rid of . Do n't buy it ...
 yup thats right , Laura Bush came out with these bags . At whole foods market they are $ 30 - $ 10 goes to feeding children of Rwanda -LRB- not even our own kids -RRB- $ 20 to the Bush family for `` administrative reasons '' yeah like to gas a plane from china .
 Please know that THIS is the LAUREN BUSH -LRB- NOT Laura Bush , former 1st lady -RRB- , -LSB- ... -RSB- , who is sponsoring the FEED Program WITH the UN!Buy this bag with reservations if you are doing so for feeding the hungry !
 It was for a good cause but next time I 'll just send the money . The bag is rough , scratchy burlap and the handles do n't fit comfortably over my shoulder . It is strong and very big though , so it holds lots of groceries . I would n't buy it again .
 Great idea , poor use of money.Go to direct sites like the Red Cross or Catholic Charities or ... . there are many well-known and established charitable sites that well put MORE of your money DIRECTLY to good use.I suppose something is better than nothing , but why do we need to GET something in order to give ? To show off our pride in what we are giving ? Give it all , and smile inside knowing without the bag you are feeding x amount more kids .
 When I heard about this bag I was so excited that I came straight to Amazon to buy one . It 's my style . I love the look of the bag and not to mention not only am I buying a nice bag but also donating money for a worthy cause ... to only find out the bag is $ 60 and only $ 20 goes to WFP . Not to mention that it 's made in China . I 'm so upset and disappointed in these people , I mean come on . That 's sneaky , shame on you , tell the truth . They should have just said `` listen , if you buy this bag , $ 20 goes to the fund , we get $ 37 and the Chinese get $ 3 per bag . '' Whose profiting here ?
 Why spend $ 60 for something when only $ 20 is going to the charity ? Hey , if it 's a good bag and worth $ 60 then buy it , but do n't fool yourself that you 're doing some great deed by giving $ 40 to a company who is making a cheap burlap bag . There are so many charities out there where you can donate the $ 60 to and that would really be making a difference . It 's always a good idea to check out the actual amount from the purchase the company is donating to a cause.They advertise this bag as `` $ 20 a year can transform a child 's life and provide the tools for a lifetime of self-reliance . '' so why not just help out THREE kids and send the $ 60 directly to the organization ? The company should be doing the right thing and donating 100 % to the charity but it 's often more about the hype than anything else .
 I nearly purchased this bag thinking the cause was good , but upon reading further reviews I started to question the ridiculously high price.This bag is sold at Whole Foods Markets for 1/2 the price . They cover some of the mark-up so your money is spent helping supply 100 meals . Go there to purchase it !
 I loved this bag when i saw it , loved the idea . . told everyone about it . . Then it fell apart . I used to back and forth to work to hold my purse and laptop . the burlap started falling apart and leaving burlap pieces on all my clothes ... i tried sewing it to make it last longer , didnt work ... better to get a 10 $ bag and give the other $ 50 directly to WFP , with the bag only $ 20 goes and you end up looking a mess due to the burlap falling apart . I think mine started falling apart in three months and i wasnt very tough on it ... used it for flying a few times but that and work , and i drive to work so it 's not like it was doing much more than being toted from the house to the car and from the car to the office.Also , depending on what you are wearing the burlap can make pulls or wear your clothes in spots ... thats why i always used the cotton on the outside ... plus the cotton print with the 1 is really great looking .
 I was very disappointed in this product ... not the product itself but the hype about the feeding program . I assumed 100 % of the dollars spent which was $ 60 , went to the children . When I received the product there was a tag on it that indicated only $ 20.00 went to the children ... where is the rest of the $ $ $ !!! AND the bag was made in CHINA -- which was insult to injury . Knowing all that , I would have sent $ 60 to the org and fed three children vs one and forgot the bag.I sent the bag back over three weeks ago and still have not been contacted or credited the money ... Amazon and World Food . . shame on you !
 I was very disappointed that only $ 20.00 goes to feed the kids!I was very disappointed that the bags smelled terrible!I was very disappointed that when I emailed Customer Service to ask if they knew anything that would help with the odor , they sent me more stinky bags ! And then they told me I would have to return the first ones or I would be charged for all of them ! Guess it takes too long to actually read customers questions !
 Why are people attached to the idea that buying something is an efficient way to help a cause ? Think about it this way , this organization claims that `` Each bag purchased feeds a hungry child for an entire year in school , and each t-shirt feeds 100 hungry kids for a day '' . How many more children would be fed if you simply gave your money to them and did n't receive a t-shirt or bag in return ? Say 100 % of the money goes to feeding the children instead of manufacturing the bag or tshirt , not to mention the rest of the mess created by the shipping , etc. . Do n't buy , give .
 I purchased a FEED Nature Bag today for $ 50 , hoping it will go for a good cause , and since it 's also endorsed on the WFP website . On the bag 's label , I realized that out of the $ 50 , only $ 6.25 goes to the World Food Programme - and this translates to the 25 meals mentioned as part of the program.I 'm disappointed , as only 12.5 % of my donation went for the cause for which I bought the product .
 Really short in the leg . It 's not like they 're capris , either.I received mine just recently and they were both too large and too short . This is not indicated in the sizing form - and Amazon says it 's my fault ! Sending them back .
 We ordered 12 bandanas for our gift baskets business and would have ordered more if not for the terrible transaction . Let me say this was not the fault of Amazon , but it was the 3rd party business `` Galaxy Army Navy '' that we are unhappy with.We were overchrged on our shipping -LRB- they charged us the shipping rate to Alaska / Hawaii ... we are in Georgia -RRB- . We e-mailed them twice to notify them of the error . They finally e-mailed us back and contradicted themselves by first denying any mistake , yet in the next sentence they say they will correct the error as soon as we leave positive feedback for them !! I left negative feedback and they e-mailed me -LRB- very fast this time -RRB- saying we were still wrong , but AGAIN contradicted themselves by saying they would `` correct the mistake '' if we took down the negative comment.I refuse to kiss anyones $ # @ ! in order to get back the money that they owe me . They made a mistake , they should make good on it without hesitation . We run a business and feel that making our customers happy is our first priority . They obviously do n't care about anyone but themselves.We could have done hundreds if not thousands of dollars worth of business with them , but they dug their heels in the ground and stood firm by claiming we were wrong about shipping rates . I copied and pasted the following directly from their website . Our order total was $ 23.88 .

 I ordered this dress 3 weeks ago and have yet to receive it . Called the Hot Flash customer service line twice now . The first ime I call I was told the idea was on backorder and when they received it that it would be shipped out 2nd day fed ex since I had to wait so long.They lied of course and when i called again claimed the item has been sent out , but standard shipping . I 'm not holding my breath , and will file a dispute on the charges if I do not see this product by Wednesday , like the company is now claiming , then I will file a dispute for the chrages.Stay away from this company . You can not take them at their word .
 I am sorry but I did not like it nor will I wear it as it is too big & looks funny on me . I wish I had not have gotten it .
 A red star !?!? I bet this wo n't sell well in eastern Europe . Communist governments use the red star symbol . More than 100,000 million people have been killed in the `` rise of the proletariat '' ... so let 's celebrate this with a HAT !?
 I think this hat was sized by elves . I have a fairly large head , 24 inches circumference , so I ordered an extra large . It was tiny , it fit my very small-headed wife perfectly . I thought they sent me the wrong size but the factory tag does say XL . It makes me think these are meant to be kid hats or something .
 when pulled down , it could cover your head all the way from back of your skull to front of your eyes .
 I have written 8 product reviews for this one hat just so I can let people know the truth . However my review keeps getting blocked . I am just trying to tell the truth so people do not get taken . 7 1/4 is listed twice as large and medium . I went with large . It is to big . Company said if I purchase three more caps/hats they would replace the first one for free . Other than that they said it was my fault for ordering the wrong size . I did not order wrong size ! Please let people know the truth .

 These braces are more for style than function since they attach to your belt ... the aesthetics are good but that 's about it
 I was looking for the clips that attach to your pants not the belt.xxxxx xxxx xxx xxx xx x
 These suspenders require you to wear a belt . There should be no reason to wear both . Although they 're satisfactory when worn , you 'll look like a clown wearing suspenders and a belt .
 THE SUBJECT SAIDS IT ALL.UGLY , DID N'T LOOK LIKE PICTURE , UGLY , DID N'T LOOK LIKE PICTURE . UGLY , DID N'T LOOK LIKE PICTURE
 I thought I was getting clip on to the pants suspenders . Not clip to a belt . The problem with these is that the clip rubs against my back and left a very nasty bruise . That and the fact that I wanted to wear suspenders not a belt . If I have to wear a belt to use the suspenders that sort of defeats the purpose of the suspenders . I want one or the other . Not both .
 These have to be hooked to a belt and that was not clear in the description . Otherwise they were just what they said they were .
 Why oh why would I be buying suspenders if I have a belt ? One of my biggest pet peeves is when douchebags wear belts and suspenders at the same time ; now I know those douchebags wear Perrys . I 'm tall so my options were very limited , but had I known or had the description been clearer in saying &#34; these suspenders can only be worn by douchebags also wearing belts &#34; , I 'd have moved right along .
 Do n't bother . Tried to retun them but had to pay for the shipping back , lots of bother about paper work blah blah.Trying to think of a way to re-purpose the elastic since I ca n't use these stupid things.Would be nice if the listing was more explicit.Belt AND suspenders ? JeezaLou , how insecure do you have to be to purchase TWO items to do ONE job .
 These suspenders have u plastic clips.They fly off when putting your pants on . Look nice but , watch your eyes . would not have bought them if I knew .

 The sweater was ultra light-weight and basically useless for warmth value . It is well-made , but not of much value to me .
 The material is polyester but it is the stiffest polyester ever made . You ca n't really tie this scarf appropriately because it is so stiff and awkward that does n't sit well . It 's basically useless and does n't look good at all . I would certainly not recommend this product .
 Okay for a kid . Nice pattern but the camoflague pattern sells at the dollar store . It 's ok looking , just cheap quality.Not horrible , but not great .
 This hat is of very poor quality . Bad crafting and materials . Look elsewhere , as this is not worth the cost .
 I have an regular camo hat that I bought from a surplus store in the late 90s . There is no way that the one I just bought will last that long .
 I bought this for the lure for Gucci . . I did not realise that it was a bit oversize for me . . however I liked it.Wear and check it .
 The sweater was ultra light-weight and basically useless for warmth value . It is well-made , but not of much value to me .
 this product shrinks with washing . can buy the same quality at discount store . would not recommend

 I tried to order this item twice during the 2006 holiday season and was assured by Amazon that it would be shipped in 1-2 days , only to be told later that it was out of stock and would not ship at all . Amazon , you need to police your vendors more !!!
 It gives nice separation . Good fabric . Be careful about sizing . I felt it was a size bigger than other brands . The under wire digs in a lot in the middle . Very uncomfortable .
 This used to be a great bra until they changed it and they no longer make it with a molded cup . It 's a nice bra if you 're looking for that style but I 'm an older woman who need help in the support dept with a molded cup !
 Unfortunately I ordered the wrong size and had to return this product . However , had I ordered the right size , I still would have returned it . The description states `` smooth cup '' which I took to mean that it would be discreet , even in cold weather . This was not the case , the cup has thin material and would not hide anything . Although it is a pretty bra , it 's not good to wear under form fitting clothes . : -LRB-

 Okay for a kid . Nice pattern but the camoflague pattern sells at the dollar store . It 's ok looking , just cheap quality.Not horrible , but not great .

 I ordered a 45 inch Mens scarf . It arrived in a plain envelope . It may or may not be one hundred percent silk , but is quite thin in any event . The seams are the usual mass produced Asian import seams
 I bought this scarf as a gift for a friend but had to return it . The photograph does not show how bad and uneven the stitching is . In addition to that the scarf had creases all over , most likely from already having been returned and repackaged . I contacted the seller but received no reply in over a week .
 Way too small for a scarf , can not be used neither as a scarf nor as an ascot . The material is okay .
 I thought it was made in the U.S.A. . Material manufactured in the U.S. but `` assembled in Mexico '' . This is NOT made in the United States of America .
 I ordered these one size larger than I take in Levi 's or Wranglers , but they still did not fit .
 Guess my gut is bigger than a size 40 Levi or Wrangler jeans because I have to wear these with the buttons open on the sides even though I wear size 40 Levi 's and Wranglers . I also do n't like that fact that the straps connect to a piece that is sown on the front at a place lower that the edge of the material . So the material tends to roll inward and is uncomfortable . Bummer .
 I purchased these from Hanes direct in 5 different colors . The stitching is solid . Thickness of the `` Beefy '' brand seems warm and durable . I like the fit and how these wrap around my body.The negatives outweigh anything good I found about these shirts . First , These Beefy t-shirts SHRINK an extraordinary length of 2-3 inches on the arms and body length . To allow air drying takes an exceptionally long time . Placing in the dryer on a cool setting also takes too long and uses up too much expensive electricity . After pulling them out of the dryer , I tried one on . I was shocked at how much shrinkage occurred !!! The cuffs rescinded back from my wrists to 1/4 of the way up my forearm ! The length also shortened to above my pants waist line ! This is UNACCEPTABLE , Hanes ! All five of my shirts are worthless . I am 5 '11 and have average arms and waste lengths.The other negative thing about these shirts is the amount of color washout . I use the basic blue cap Tide liquid laundry detergent . The colors fade quite quickly after one wash.Overall these shirts are NOT a recommended buy . If Hanes created a `` TALL '' version -LRB- like Old Navy sells -RRB- and fixed their coloring process , maybe these Beefy t-shirts would have some value . Do NOT buy these shirts .
 Upon the first where it is excellent . Once you start washing it though , expect trouble . It does not stand up well to washing it all . In my wash on gentle cycle , with gentle detergent , in the most gentle fashion . I would say find a different product .
 I got a large -LRB- I wear a medium -RRB- just because it 's cotton and I figure it might shrink . Well , it did shrink -- much more than I expected . Probably next time I would get an ex-large , just because I like them roomy , expecially for exercise .

 This is an average shirt . I definitely would not call it &#34; Stonewash Green &#34; . It is more like light &#34; sort of dingy green &#34; .
 I purchased two of these sports bras based on brand , price , and product description . This is a very uncomfortable bra for runners . The seams chafe and it does not `` wick away moisture . '' The slow shipping did n't help my opinion either . It is a nice bra for less active endeavors .

 I ca n't review this product . I returned it for a larger size and never received the replacement . No explanation either !
 Do n't be fooled by Doc Martens ' claim of a `` lifetime warranty . '' They have a policy of giving only a year to repalce boots , even in cases of clear manufacturer defects . It 's shameful how they says `` docs are for life '' ... it really means you are STUCK with them for life.Docs used to be really good but they are made cheap now and are sure to fall apart long before they should !
 Not sure if merchandise Amazon gets is seconds or rejects , but my husband purchased his second pair of this style boots because the first was so good . We bought the first pair through his uniform company for $ 135 . When he 'd worn them out -LRB- 1.5 years -RRB- I looked online and found them for $ 90 here and we ordered them.Out of the box they were fine , but after 2-3 months of wear the stitching was coming undone . Now , after only 7 months of wear , the soles have cracked at the ball of the foot on both boots.We checked the Doc Martin website and they say that you have to contact your retailer for a return . There is no information on the Amazon website for arranging such a return . We 're outside the return window , and if we return them anyway , according to the return policy , we pay shipping PLUS lose 15-50 % of the purchase price as a restocking fee . Hardly worth the trouble . Very disappointed in this sale .
 I ordered this shoe and wore them to work for a weekk I had to sens them back . I think there was an inherent design flaw . They were cutting into my ankles and causing sever pain . I could not wear them
 The size seemed correct and once worn , the costume made quite an impression -LRB- from far away it looked great -RRB- . My son was very excited about the muscles . The quality however was n't very good . The mask was made with cheep foam as was much of the rest of it . After one wear it showed major signs of wear . The costume is so spectacular in the movie , what we got as an actual costume was a real let-down , typical made in China product .
 When I first saw it I thought it was going to be a good one , but once I tried it on my son , it was too big , too stiff that he didnt want to use it . . It is back to the package and i guess he wont use it again .

 Measure your kid 's head before you buy this product ! I bought this for a 16 mo. old , but I could n't get it over his head and it did n't have much `` stretch . '' If your kid has a big head , consider rash guards that zip up or use velcro .
 Very high-quality pants , and I love the feel of them when wearing . However , be warned of two things :1 -RRB- When you wash the pants , plan to spend some time ironing them . They come out of the dryer looking like crumbled up tissue paper . Also plan on steam ironing them after a day of wearing . They start to wrinkle in the crotch and thigh area after just a few hours of wearing .2 -RRB- The crease on the pant leg is extremely hard to find after they 've been washed . I thought I had found it initially and ironed the pants accordingly , only to find out the next morning that I 'd missed the crease by about half an inch , and now had two creases running down the pant leg . My recommendation is not to iron them immediately after they come out of the dryer , but let them hang for a couple of hours . The crease becomes more apparent the longer they set out.Also , if you need the length adjusted , take to a good tailor . The one I went to adjusted the cuff , but I guess he did n't make his seam at the bottom of the pants as permanent as the original one . After they were washed , the cuff reverted back to the original seam , even though the top off the cuff was sewn to the seam of each leg . This resulted in an uneven and horrible looking cuff , which I had to spend a lot of time straightening and pressing out with an iron.I love linen , but not enough to spend this much time taking care of `` casual '' trousers . I 'll be taking these pants back . This is far from the norm for Jos. A. Banks .
 These pants were very cheap and were not worth the cost . I do not recommend . I would recommend Calvin Klein linen pants , as they are ideal for wearing during the summer .

 The pant tore after one month . Heavy Duty my ___ ! It was n't worth the price . I had to end up buying another suit from someone else .
 I am very disappointed in this robe . It had a bad packaging smell , so I washed it right away . It still smelled and frayed . I re-washed it again and it still has a smell to it .
 This robe is cozy and fits nicely . However , it snags very easily . I have very old towels and wash cloths that do n't fray this easily . I had an old terry cloth robe that did not snag much and lasted until it became threadbare . I will wear this new robe until it looks ugly but would not buy a `` plush '' terry robe again ... the loops tear too easily in very normal/light use .
 I ordered this shirt and then got and e-mail that it was out of stock but here it is still for sale that day and the next day . Make sure they have some before you order this .

 nice item , but arrived with a `` security tag '' inside that needed to be peeled off before giving it as a gift . Upon SLOWLY peeling the security tag , it damaged the leather inside the coin holder . I still gave it as a gift , because I bought something else to replace it but the damage to the leather wasnt bad enough to send it back -LRB- they did n't have any more on Amazon at the time -RRB- .
 i bought 2 sets of these -LRB- blue and black -RRB- because of the price and to really stock up . they look nice and just as pictured but the fit on these is less than desirable . if you -LRB- or your man -RRB- like to just wear their boxers when lounging around the house they may find these have an awkward feel and constraint . because of this constraint as far as movement i DO NOT recommend anyone wearing these if they plan on being even remotely active during their day . played a couple hours of basketball and these boxers were not comfortable at all.for everyday lounging while wearing shorts/pants then they feel fine.for someone who likes to run , jog , or play sports , i highly recommend finding a different set .
 The fabric is a little stiff at first , bust softens to a acceptable level after a few washes . The elastic band around the waist of these boxers contracts to the point where it wrinkles up the fabric . After a few hours of wear you have the indents of the crinkled up band on your skin and it feels quite uncomfortable . While cheap and nicely packaged , these things suck . Spend some money on decent underwear .
 I have ordered Intimo silk boxers in the past and have been happy with that purchase . So far the fabric in these cotton boxers is extremely stiff and they have not gotten any softer even after 4 washings . I will continue to wash these in hopes that the fabric will soften enough to be comfortable enough to be worn . I now know why I pay $ 15.00 for two pair ofJockey 's .

 I bought this shirt about 2 wks ago and got a shirt yesterday , but it was not this shirt . Instead , I received a red shirt with a black star on it , saying `` The Clash '' . Usually I do n't like returning shirts , but this shirt was an obnoxious candy red . So , I returned the shirt only to be put off another 3 wks for the real shirt ; which , in fact , came 4 wks after my son 's birthday . In conclusion , be aware that this company is substandard in service .

 Jansport has really gone downhill in the past 10 years . It used to be that the top 3 brands were Jansport , Eastpak , and High Sierra . Now Eastpak only deals with the european market . High Sierra has gone into uber industrial -LRB- non casual -RRB- backpacks that are a cross between urban and hiking . And Jansport still produces casual school/day treker backpacks but unfortunately the quality has gone down a lot . They do n't produce the leather/suede bottoms anymore . Now , the bottoms rip and wear out more easily and the entire fabric is a lot thinner and cheaper . I compared one I purchased last week at Staples to one that I had 10 years ago and the one purchased recently will probably wear out faster than the one 10 years back . That 's a little ridiculous . You can really feel how thing the fabric has become , it 's sad . I do n't think they 're even produced in the US anymore , probably China . They 've made no changes to it besides putting some padding in the back . But it 's really lost the appeal that it once had . I ca n't believe you could walk into a Walmart , Kmart or Target and find wall to wall of quality Jansports with leather bottoms and now the closest thing you can get is this piece of crap . Thanks Jansport , maybe in 10 more years you 'll reduce down to a burlap sack or a coffee bean bag . BTW , the jansport I just purchased has been returned .
 I purchased this product for my 1st grader . He liked the design ; I liked the Jansport brand -LRB- I have had several Jansport backpacks and always was very happy -RRB- . Well , the backpack was so thin I could read this review online through the material . The backpack was so lightweight that my son 's water bottle could put a hole through its side . The bottom had such little support that a wet paper grocery bag would provide superior results . In summary -- I returned the product the day after it arrived at my home . I actually contacted the seller and asked him/her if this was a knock-off , and he reassured me that it was a genuine product . Although I could n't believe him completely , the vendor was very nice and professional about returning the backpack .
 The color of the real thing is dark gray which is very ugly . And I have tried to return this item , but I failed because UPS did come to pick the package in three days . And I am leaving in two weeks so I am afraid I can not get the refund at that time so I gave up to return this item . This is an awful experience !
 This product is cheap and the stitching was all over the place . It was made overseas and it shows . I will never buy from this company again . It 's doubtful this thing will last 3 weeks as it 's so thin and flimsy . I would like to warn anyone who is considering buying one of the Jansport bags online . Go to a store and look at it first and buy it there . I would have never EVER bought this bag if I was able to check it out first . Either way , it made my 7 year old happy , and i 'm sure she will be upset that it has torn up within a month . Buyers BEWARE .
 I got excited when i came across this bag because of the colour and when i received it i was very disappionted the colour is nothing like the one in the picture and i am so not happy with this bag .
 I purchased this , thinking that it was hot pink , but to my surprise the backpack was a unexpected salmon color &#34; pink . &#34; Do n't be fooled by the description -LRB- Pink Prep -RRB- .
 From the description '' ... giving it enough space to store two to three textbooks , a large binder , two to three spiral notebooks ... `` Not sure what textbooks and notebooks these guys used to measure it , but my daughter had to pack 2 middle-school textbooks , 1 binder and 1 spiral notebook and they would not fit . We had to go and buy her a different backpack .
 I bought this backpack for my son for his freshman year of high school . He came to me two days later and told me he had too many things from his classes and they would n't all fit in this pack . Together we tried to make room for everything and were able to squeeze it all in . However , the backpack started coming apart at the seams a week later .
 This bag was going to be for me to use at college , and quite frankly it was WAY too small for that . It is more made for elementry to middle school kids . So luckily I have a little sister to give it to , but otherwise , I 'm pretty disappointed .
 It is really low quality and the straps are uncomfortable.I bought it for my daughter If I had seen it before I would not buy it . I think it is not good for a child . Because comfort is more important for them than adults.I will not return it but will not use for school.I am very disappointed.It is like a joke !!!
 I really like the color and it is aesthetically pleasing in my opinion . I 'm not sure if they sent me the wrong size or something but it is really small . It looks like a first graders back pack , not one for a college student .
 So i bought this backpack because I needed to keep my books somewhere so I could carry things in my hands . I am 17 and a senior in High School . I ordered on the 21st or 22nd of December -LSB- I know I got the rest of my items before Christmas -RSB- and got the bag on the 6th of January . which was a drag.I got the bag at the material is pretty lousy , the straps are stiff and worst of all ... its really small . I am 5 ' 7 '' and this bag looks like a little kid 's backpack . I just got ta say that if you are older than 10 or 11 , find a new backpack or you will just look like a grown person who stole some little helpless kid 's backpack .
 I bought 3 of these to replace worn out back packs . I thought they would be great quality , but from the appearance they look no better than the ones they already had that fell apart after 3 months . I was really disappointed by how thin they are .
 the straps would loosen by itself when carring the bag on your back ... . i dont like it . Also the material is flimsy . but we all know that jansport lasts long ...
 I could n't believe it was a jansport . It is the sorriest excuse for a backpack I have seen in awhile . More like something from the K-mart bargain basement . Would definitely not suggest buying it .
 This was supposed to be large enough for an adult . It 's really meant for a Jr. . High school student . A waste !
 the shoulder strap is already broken and it has only been 6 weeks . its a weak backpack , considering that i put it to gentle use
 I saw this bag well displayed with multi-divisions -LRB- sections -RRB- and got attracked to it because that was what I wanted but to my surprise , is far from what it was displayed . I am very much disappointed , it will not serve my purpose and I hate it that I do not even know what to do with it . it was totally wrong product display .
 The shipping time is ok , but the color is totally wronge . It is impossible to carry the kind of color to outside .
 It is REALLY FRUSTRATING ... I ASKED FOR WHITE/SILVER STARS , it seems to be a problem with the product , they sent me the WHITE/SILVER TWINKLE STARS one ... I purchased it in amazon ONLY because I needed SPECIFICALLY the WHITE/SILVER STARS in the RIGHT DAY ... This order was time sensitive , anyhow everybody can make mistakes , so I called to let them know that It was wrong and they told me that they will fix it , they will not make the same mistake they will resend the backpack ... . they ask me to send it back and they sent me `` THE RIGHT ONE '' but today -LRB- 24 days after -RRB- I got in the mail AGAIN THE WRONG BACKPACK ! ... Not to mention the other hydration pack that I bought in the same order that got lost in the mail ... I just want to place the complaint , I feel really frustrated and do n't want to hear again a customer service representative telling me that `` he assure me this will not happen again `` My recommendation
 This is n't really worth the price . Based on strength and utility alone , I 've seen cheaper backpacks at Wal-Mart , etc. that far outshine this little thing . This is really quite small , do n't let the big numbers fool you.I guess I could suggest this for elementary schoolers , but as a college student this really does n't work for me . I remember carrying even more books in high school , so yeah , that 's out too . When you get this , you 're really just paying for the name brand . They pocket the difference by sacrificing quality .1 . Smaller than it looks .2 . Very thin fabric .3 . The joke they call ` padding ' does n't keep the sharp edges of any book from sticking into your back .4 . The straps feel very weak , and I do n't feel comfortable carrying all my books in it .5 . The backpack has a tendency to ` slide ' down ; the buckle does n't hold the straps well , so the nylon slides past it and causes the straps to loosen against your will .
 I bought this backpack for college and after 9 months it tore in three places . Terrible quality . I paid 5 Bucks to mail it in for repair under warranty and after two months with no responce I called and found out that they wo n't fix anything because the damage happened , `` as a result of normal use , '' ... well is n't that exactly why companies have a warranty ? So that if the product you buy from them shows manufacturing defects that become evident through normal use the product is replaced ? This company is a joke and only profits on the fact that they have huge name recognition , but this product was of very low quality and the warranty is a fraud .
 For the quality and size of this backpack , it is way overpriced . I can buy a large size gym bag for the price of this backpack .
 My kids have used JanSport backpacks in the past and we have n't had a problem with them . However , I ordered this one in the beginning of September . My daughter has used it for about 2 weeks and it has already ripped . I am very disappointed in JanSport .
 I bought this backpack for my 12-year old Goddaughter who was visiting from Brazil . She wanted this particular brand because it happens to be in fashion down there . However , I fail to understand why it costs so much considering the poor quality of the material and the overall product . I can buy a much much better backpack , padded , strongly made and with lots of compartments making it much more useful , for a lot less money . I think the product is way overrated and unless your kid wants it for the `` fashion '' aspect of it , I 'd look for something else of better quality .
 I got my first JanSport backpack when I was in elementary school , and it lasted until my senior year of high school . A while later in college , I decided to buy a backpack , and naturally went for another JanSport.My first disappointment was that the backpack was n't a true navy color -- it 's dark blue , not navy . That I could live with , however . The drastic decrease in quality was the biggest disappointment . Within months , the backpack had small holes in it . I bought this size because I 'm an English major who rarely has textbooks to carry around , so I was n't even carrying anything heavy or sharp . After roughly a year of use , the backpack had several good-sized holes in it.The straps also began to come unattached from the top of the backpack ; the fabric started to fray terribly , and by the week , the straps came off more and more . I was perplexed , since I 'd carried much heavier things in my older backpack for much longer . Before I 'd even had the backpack two years , one of the straps had almost completely come off . I sewed it back on using heavy duty thread , but within a couple of weeks the stitches no longer held because the fabric had frayed even further . I did n't have much choice but to replace it.The last thing is , JanSport backpacks are no longer machine washable . I threw my first backpack in the washer dozens of times . With this one , I had to try to hand wash it if it got a stain on it . Backpacks get enough use that they should really be machine washable . And they should be much more durable than this one was .
 The backpack shown in the picture is not the same as the one delivered . My daughter was quite disappointed . The one delivered is a cute backpack , but not what I thought I was ordering . The one pictured has bright purple ; the one delivered has very dark purple that is n't noticible . The one pictured has purple straps at the top and on the bottom of the shoulder straps . The one delivered has all black ... So , the only things purple on the one we got are the zipper pulls . By the time we got it we were afraid if we sent it back , my daughter would not have a new one by the first day of school . So , we added our own purple to it . I 'll think twice about ordering from here again .
 The material for the body of the bag is very thin and I 'm worried it wo n't last me through the school year . It 's not a comfortable fit with the weight of my texts no matter where the straps are adjusted . I admit it looks really cute and you ca n't beat the price , but if i were to see that bag in a store where i could touch it and feel the material , i would not have purchased it - even despite how inexpensive it was .
 Very disappointed in this backpack . My daughter was happy with it , but myself as a mother knows that it will last no longer than a couple of months . There is absolutely no lining within the back . Fits all her books though she says ...
 I received my bag and it looks exactly like i wanted it . Problem is it 's cut like someone has used a knife or razor to cut it a whole 5cm cut on the top of the bag . This is not what i really imagined to get .
 Purchased it for junier high school student . it 's not big enough and also you can not image how large it actually will be . Overall , it 's low cost and low quality bag and you can buy it at local sports authority cheaper and easy to return or change it if you do n't like it after receiving . Will not buy those bag anyway .
 I used to love these jeans and have purchased many pairs . But they 've shortened the depth of the front pockets -- they 're now so small that anything you put in there will fall out . I carry my cell phone and wallet in my front pocket , so now I have to find a new brand of go-to pants . -LRB- I work in an ER and wore these instead of scrubs . -RRB- Furthermore , I have n't been able to find a way to complain . GVJ has been bought out by Jones . The saleslady at Penney 's has heard about this from other customers , and knew exactly what I was doing when I shook out a pair to check the pocket , but she did n't have any contact info . Actually , I was on Google looking for a way to contact and protest when I was directed here , so thought I 'd leave a review . If you 're a fan , be wary . If they fix this problem , I 'll revise my star rating . Love the fit , the price , and the variety of colors .
 Pockets are way too shallow -LRB- small -RRB- . I do not use a purse and my wallet keeps falling out of the pocket . Jeans fit great , but pockets are horrible . Are they trying to save money on material ?
 Bought 2 pair , same size , different colors -LRB- one classic one rinse -RRB- . The classic fit just as they should , the rinse felt at least 2 sizes smaller ... made in India . GV needs better standardization of their sizes from country to country . This is not the first time I have had this problem with them , but the first time on Amazon !
 Twice I ordered this product . Both times I requested straight leg and received tapered leg . Thought I had picked the wrong one the first time so tried a second time . Same result .
 Seller office was polite and courteous . I hope to receive a return shipping label , as the pants were of inferior quality . One of the two pairs ordered was so flimsy it fit inside the bottom of an envelope . Stitching and seams would come apart likely after a short period of time . No rollover seaming . Cloth used was very very very thin . How does one know what jeans ordered online will be like > Are these knockoffs of brand name jeans or are all G Vanderbilt jeans this poorly made these days ?
 I hate trying on jeans at the store and was happy to find GV Amanda jeans , size 8 , seemed to fit very well . Experience now shows the fit is very inconsistent from pair to pair . My most recent purchase is extremely baggy around the waist , although they seem ok through the hips . They are also longer than other Amanda jeans I ownIt 's unfortunate GV does n't have better quality control to assure consistent fit so shoppers could shop online without worry about fit .
 The pant tore after one month . Heavy Duty my ___ ! It was n't worth the price . I had to end up buying another suit from someone else .
 I own a pair of sunglasses -LRB- Wiley X XL-1 Sunglasses Flame Frame Smoke Green/Clear 2 lens set -RRB- and after less than three weeks of wear , the rubber cushions peeled off from the frames.I was very careful handling the expensive eyewear and did not soak the glasses even in ordinary water so I do n't understand how such expensives glasses can be so low quality .
 I use different Thermal shirts at work I have about ten different ones the Morgan Men 's Lite Thermal Shirt the large size have a small problem , the sleeves are to short for me I use a large size and the sleeves are about three inches to short I still use them but if the sleeves were I little longer I most likely was going to buy some more .
 The waist band is way too high . It literally comes up to just 1/2 inch bellow your belly button . I 'm avg 5 ' 9 '' . Do n't get his unless you are on the Genius record for having the longest torso in the world . I did n't expect this from a well known brand .
 I purchased one of this bikinis a couple of years ago and it lasted about 4 years before it turned into a transparent suit.I ordered 2 suits through amazon.com , but to my surprise the size 34 that I ordered in reallity is a size 28 , which makes it very unconfortable to wear . So becareful when ordering . Look at the manufacturer 's sizing list -LRB- VERY SMALL LETTERS -RRB- to find the right size . By the way , I had to pay to return these items because I did not read the manufaturer 's sizing chart . Not a happy camper .
 This used to be a great bra until they changed it and they no longer make it with a molded cup . It 's a nice bra if you 're looking for that style but I 'm an older woman who need help in the support dept with a molded cup !
 Unfortunately I ordered the wrong size and had to return this product . However , had I ordered the right size , I still would have returned it . The description states `` smooth cup '' which I took to mean that it would be discreet , even in cold weather . This was not the case , the cup has thin material and would not hide anything . Although it is a pretty bra , it 's not good to wear under form fitting clothes . : -LRB-
 It gives nice separation . Good fabric . Be careful about sizing . I felt it was a size bigger than other brands . The under wire digs in a lot in the middle . Very uncomfortable .
 The jeans were labeled as a 32-inch waist , but were nowhere nearthat large . Also , there was a defect in the stitching of the insulatedlining around the cuff of the left leg .
 Good guality tie but it does not look as purple as shown under natural light . If you want plum , it will fti the bill . Returned .

 when i got it , i was pleased thst it was soft . I opened it up and as soon as i put it on . i pulled just a little and it immidiately started to run!so all in all , you get what you pay for . i guess
 this bodystocking is definitely not sheer , more semi-opaqueit also runs easily and does n't feel smooth to the touchi 'm still looking for a quality sheer bodystocking
 I bought the Alexander sweatshirt . The quality is substandard . The shoulders are off and the product is basically irregular ! Although the company 's statement shows that they accept returns and exchanges , after I received the item , I discovered that they do not either exchange or return because the item is considered a personal item -LRB- despite the fact that they have these items in stock -RRB- .
 For the cost , an extremely flimsy proposition . I have worn three of these panty hoses and each has unfailingly developed a run on the first day of wear .
 These stockings ran almost immediately upon putting on . I pull then up and they fit well . I took a few steps and felt the run . It was really disappointing since I live overseas and getting the right color is difficult . I think they may have been dry rot .
 I recently purchased these at a department store . They were cheaper than another type of Hanes pantyhose . I can see why that is . They are incredibly rough and feel like sandpaper on my legs.I would have given them no stars if I could .
 I just received these hosiery and they suck . i bought them becauseof the reviwes , they were good , but what kind of people would ever wearsuch a thing and say that 's great ??? -LRB- i guess ur all fake -RRB- very dissapointed !

 Do not waste your money on this one . Champion Men 's Cap Sleeve Raglan T-Shirt , Oxford Gray/Navy , X-Large .
 Since I had my say about Champion 's Cotton workout pant ... tell you my thoughts on these . I love them , BUT ... if you work out alot -LRB- and not just when you 're sweaty -RRB- you will leave a damp spot that takes 20-30 seconds to evaporate ... in the exact dimensions of your bottom equipment . Guess because they do n't absorb dampness , just transfer it . As a shirt...Dri-Power ca n't be beat .
 The fabric is great but the pants are too long -LRB- ca n't hem length since zippers on leg -RRB- and the waist tie rope is too short -LRB- or maybe I 'm too fat -RRB- .

 size of the pants is very different from levis ' 1 . i am wearing levis oringnal , w32l32 , but this one , i also chose w32l32 , woo , it ; s too long , and maybe i should wear lee w33 or w34 , the waist is very narrow .2 . relaxed means fat ass , and relaxed legs ` very relaxed ' 3 . after i try it ' i ggave it to my friends ~ ~ PS ` made in mexico ` very thick
 Do n't know why it 's so baggy . It seems slim on the image ' Disappointed because the jeans feels great and durable . Just too baggy on the leg ' Lee 's jeans always feel great , that 's why I choose them . P.S. I choose the right size .
 I ordered the Pepperstone , and they developed two holes at the top of the back pockets . I got good , prompt return service from Amazon , but the replacement jeans developed the same holes after one wearing . Rather than go through Amazon again , I am working with the manufacturer -LRB- Lee Jeans -RRB- to investigate this flaw , as it is obviously not just a one time issue .
 I was surprised by the bad quality of the jeans . But Unfortuntaly I did not discover that until you try it on and you can it return it . I did not recommended even for free .
 I ordered 1 pair - they came and were tapered - I liked them so I ordered another pair . Well the 2nd pair came but were not tapered - baggy type . It 's better to order Levi 521 jeans . Whick I did from Dillards .
 Do not waste your money on this one . Champion Men 's Cap Sleeve Raglan T-Shirt , Oxford Gray/Navy , X-Large .
 I returned this for an exchange on December 8th and I have not received the item or my money back as of yet . I have emailed the Seller , which was TV Store Online , twice and they never responded . Very poor customer service .
 My husband was initially so thrilled to have this baby bodysuit , but after a couple of washes it really looked dingy -- it had started to pill and the brightness was not there.I also found it hard to see the print when we took photos of our son in this . I would n't buy this again .
 Just going to list the issues
 I generally wear a 38x30 , and that 's what I bought in these , they are sized quite a bit smaller in the waste . I 'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in , but you may want to get a waste size up . I 'll be wearing them in a dress office setting , and I 'm surprised how good these look , hopefully they last a long time too .
 for no apparent reason these are humongous . my bf currently wears 32x32 which are a bit short and a bit tight on him so we tried to go a size up - but for some reason these were ginormous !
 my boyfriend currently wears 32x32s that were getting a bit tight and a bit long on him . for some reason these in 34x34 were ridiculously huge ! Returned
 These pants are fake no tags fake packaging.the zipper was broke.I work in 874s for over 25 years an I know how they look an feel an these look an feel &#34; FAKE &#34;
 i ordered gray and they sent green . GREEN , come on guys really ? at least they were the right size . well done
 I remember when I was a teenager Dickies would last forever ; nowadays they fall apart pretty quickly . I think they must be cutting costs on quality control ...
 I had a pair of Dickies fall apart after a month . Then they would n't honor the warranty . Shady company and now making crap products .
 Be aware that these run small - At least by a size or more . And they 're straight leg , not boot cut , so there 's a bit of a taper at the ankle .
 I 've been buying Dickies , particularly the 874 's for over 20 years and I was n't impressed with these ones at all . . While the item was clearly marked as a Dickies product , it did n't look or feel like any pair of Dickies I 've ever bought before.The material seemed very thin , and the pants had no factory crease . . Live and learn . .
 Waist is not true to size just like many dickies products , its better if you just go to a store and try them on first
 These pants , for me , where a bit tighter than I thought it would be , also stiffer and smaller than I had hoped .
 The pants have so much wrong with them , plus they look awful . It is my guess that dickies enjoys making money at the expense of the customer , both by making them pay too much for them and making them look stupid wearing them .1 . -RRB- CARDBOARD PANTS . They are STIFF . Wash them 100 times and I guarantee you they will still feel like cardboard .2 . -RRB- They are so tapered they barely fit over any boots you wear . Your feet look enormous next to these skinny pants . NO ROOM !! 3 . -RRB- They ride so high on your waist it is uncomfortable4 . -RRB- They are n't sized properly , a 36 is a 34 , 34 is 32 etc. ... STAY AWAY .
 My husband always wears 36 30 . He has several Dickie pants ... I got 874 which were the wrong ones . They were stiff and small . I had to return and now pay postage beause they were part of another order making over $ 25 . Also had to go to UPS and post and will have return postage taken out of refund ... My mistake and I paid for it
 $ 649 is a little expensive for a T-Shirt !? How about $ 5
 this product shrinks with washing . can buy the same quality at discount store . would not recommend
 Not that I expected much because I did not pay much but lets just say the images looked better than the actual item . everything about the item was cheap materials etc. .
 This is a cute costum but do not purchase if you are bigger than a small size for males . I was very disappointed that my brother could n't wear this for my Christmas party so I 'm sending it back . Need to make it fits at least a size large if it is suppose to be one size fits most .
 i defiantly got what i paid for -LRB- & it was not much -RRB- . The belt i received is big enough to rap around 3 of me and i 'm not that small of a guy . shipping was quick , but do n't plan on wearing this suite more then once our twice . .

 Wow , do I disagree with them being easy to clean !!! A great size for the overall bib , but gigantic neck hole for little babies . they sure look cool though .
 This bib is WAY rougher than it looks ... almost feels like someone went over the fabric with a knife and made it shabby ... in the picture it looks like it is a sort of spandex or wetsuit fabric which is what i was expecting . for the price , i wouldnt recommend to anyone . im returning this on monday
 After the first wash , these bibs smelled like gasoline . Furthermore , they pilled up with fuzz and looked terrible . They are stiff and will not lay flat at feeding time .
 I purchased this bib for my 5 month old daughter because I wanted a solid neutral colored bib that would go with some of her outfits that have black and green in them . However , I was very disappointed with my purchase . It is very uncomfortable on my baby to wear . The material is so thick and it is not very flexible at all . I would not purchase this item or recommend it .
 Not great and did not wash well ... I wo n't use it again . Bumpkins bibs are MUCH better . Not for me .

 The pants have so much wrong with them , plus they look awful . It is my guess that dickies enjoys making money at the expense of the customer , both by making them pay too much for them and making them look stupid wearing them .1 . -RRB- CARDBOARD PANTS . They are STIFF . Wash them 100 times and I guarantee you they will still feel like cardboard .2 . -RRB- They are so tapered they barely fit over any boots you wear . Your feet look enormous next to these skinny pants . NO ROOM !! 3 . -RRB- They ride so high on your waist it is uncomfortable4 . -RRB- They are n't sized properly , a 36 is a 34 , 34 is 32 etc. ... STAY AWAY .
 for no apparent reason these are humongous . my bf currently wears 32x32 which are a bit short and a bit tight on him so we tried to go a size up - but for some reason these were ginormous !
 my boyfriend currently wears 32x32s that were getting a bit tight and a bit long on him . for some reason these in 34x34 were ridiculously huge ! Returned
 These pants are fake no tags fake packaging.the zipper was broke.I work in 874s for over 25 years an I know how they look an feel an these look an feel &#34; FAKE &#34;
 This product came extremely over packed for an item like this -- huge box for one small item . I guess I am not a ` hipster ' -- I do not like the fit at all .
 I contacted this seller to ask why shipping cost was so high with no answer . I was charged $ 30.00 shipping for a $ 4.80 bag that the item came in . I will never purchase from this seller again and I recommend to all buyers on Amazon to stay away from this seller . Customer service is horrible !!!
 I am typing this on January 18 , 2007 ... and I still do not have either of the baseball caps in my possession . But of course the money has been deducted from my account ! How lovely !
 Pros : - The wallet and chain looks pretty cool and a number of my friends have complimented on it . - The pocket chain is really good.Cons : - Really small . If you have a lot of cards - hell even a lot of cash , it 'd bulge and be a tight fit . - No coin purse . - I 've been using the wallet between April and October . From that short period of use , threads have come out and the hole surrounded with a metal ring -LRB- which is used to attach the pocket chain -RRB- has torn out from the wallet -LRB- not completely , but it will with extended use -RRB- . Conclusion
 I was very disappointed when I received this item . It looked very cheap , also like someone made it at home . It also was not long enough . I needed it for an event and ended up having to buy something else . I ended up giving it away to the Goodwill .
 I was very dissappointed by this item . It arrived folded into a 6X6 square bag and was very creased when opened . It will take considerable pressing to try and get it out . The fabric is too stiff and does n't drap well . The length is n't long enough to drape over your shoulders and wear as a wrap . The return policy makes this purchase not worth the risk .
 Very stiff . Not easy to drape . Looks cheap and like I could have made one better . Does not cover the shoulders -- I am a small lady . Would not recommend . Poor quality .
 Samsonite usually puts out great travel items . Not so with these bags . They do n't work at all because the plastic sealers fall off - they fell off of all 10 bags for me . I 'm too lazy to get a refund , but buyer beware with these - they are a disappointment . One might as well use freezer bags ; the result would probably be better !
 This is a pretty expensive mask . Including shipping , I spent almost $ 70 on it , mine came from CostumeZone . When it got here , a dab of paint was missing from the latex mask and there was a very small crack in the plastic mask ... no big deal . But no care was taken to pack it right so it retained the correct shape , so it did not look like how it was supposed to . Also , the mask is really big and even though it comes with some foam glued inside it , you 'll probably have to put more in so your eyes will line up with the holes . I just got it yesterday and already things are falling apart . The plastic screen that is glued behind the hole for the eyes in the plastic mask already had to be reattached , and a piece of one of the dreadlocks has fallen off and I 'm having to glue that on as well.I 'm kinda stuck with it now , but if I could go back , I definitely would have gotten something else . It is not put together well , mine was n't packed properly , and it is huge . It would definitely look and fit better if they scaled it down . I 'm hoping I can get it in decent shape before tonight . I would recommend putting your money somewhere else .
 2nd time in a row I have been ripped off by an Amazon purchase !!! I bought this for my son for Christmas . I should have read the prior reviews . This DOES NOT come with the removeable faceplate and they will not send you one if you complain to them . They do n't have faceplates ... even though that is what is in THE TITLE !!! What a rip-off . Staying away from Amazon purchses .
 I purchased this for my son two weeks ago for his birthday . The Mask was very poorly made and had a crack in it when it arrived . They did not even send me the removable face plate . I am sending it back . I have purchased many things from amazon but this is by far the worst purchase I have made .
 The box had the cheap face plate but no mask , right before Chrx . With these poor reviews , time for amazon to pull . They send me a slip for a full return .
 If I had any idea how cheaply made this mask was , I never would have paid so much for it . Do n't be fooled by the word `` deluxe '' - this is not anything near collector quality . This is a cheap Halloween mask at best . Maybe worth twenty dollars ...
 it 's cheap piece of chinese crap . My nephew hates it ! bad design , my fart is louder than this crap . DO NOT BUY THIS !!!!
 The description says it will shoot roll caps , but there is no spindle to hold them and no track to guide them . It was really designed to shoot strip caps - one cap inserted at a time , but the seat for the cap is mis-designed such that it can not sit deep enough for the hammer to sufficiently impact the cap . I tried dremmeling the neck down a bit so the cap would sit deeper , but it turns out the center post is still too short . The metal parts of the gun feel decently substantial and grip is plastic / fake wood which is OK . In any case , my son still likes to run around with a pirate hat and this gun .
 This is a beautiful jacket and it looks good on . It has one drawback and that is the bulk that is created around the neck area . If you are n't zipped up all the way , all of that extra soft padding bulks up .
 I purchased this vest on November 30 . Said it was in stock with delivery estimate Dec 9 . Received email from Jos. A. Bank on Dec 1 saying it was `` being processed . '' Next email from Jos. A. Banks came , two weeks later , on Dec 14 saying merchandise is `` no longer available . '' So much for a Christmas vest .

 It 's a waste of money . They look so cheap and very bad quality . This must be worth like a dollar or less mass produced .

 This bra was very disappointing . I was hoping that it would be comfortable but it was n't . It is well-made , pretty and of good quality but that 's about it.It did distort the way I looked .
 too padded and make the breast look like they 're pointing somewhere lol , did n't like it at all ... . i wo n't even be using them ...
 Through my own fault I selected the wrong size so the fit is n't as perfect as the other one I bought which was the same brand and the perfect size .
 I received my sunglasses last week , they are increibles but they arrived in deficient conditions . they have three lines on them , and simply I feel that I lost my money . I think that you should pay attention to the way eyeglasses are packed for transportation
 I bought this Speedo because I like its new strechy fabric and the handsome design . The biggest problem is that the 1-inch wide elastic band can not stay flat on my waist after a few uses . I own several Speedo swimming trunks , this one is the worst . If the band can be improved , I will rank it at least 3 stars .
 Paid for expedited delivery , and it showed up four days later then anticipated .

 Not only was this poorly made and missing half of what it was supposed to have . It smelled strongly of smoke , returned it !
 This is a cute little burpie , but not very absorbent . For the price , I expected it to be a little bigger and more absorbent . Recommend the baby jar burpies instead .
 I was rather excited to find someone still carrying these , and now I see why many people do not . Although it is listed as a Hiking `` Kilt '' , it has no pleats . It has the open end of the apron on the left -LRB- a kilt is on the right -RRB- . Ok , that I knew before I ordered it , but putting it on its obviously not originally designed for men , just modified and relabled.BEWARE , these run VERY small . I got an XL and I normally comfortably wear an L in any hiking shorts or pants . The XL was so small I needed to fit in a different belt . Also , articulation is very poor compared to hiking shorts or any kind of real kilt , if I try to step higher than two feet at a time it binds up pretty badly.On the plus sides it was cheap , and it is very light fabric . It keeps down well in the wind . It would be nice if it was n't so low at the hem though , even with the lightweight fabric its still warmer than my kilts because the hem is so low .
 Probably a great product , so if your a child , woman or man under 5 ' 7 and/or weigh less than 200lbs . . these probably work for you.I 've got quite normal legs , but for some bizarro reason , the XL size of these things is about 1.5-2 '' too small to close around my calf . Its not like I have Schwarzeneggeresque calf muscles . Seems to me OR is targeting the small folks for its products.I guess the rest of us do n't get to snowshoe . I 'd look for another make or try on a local product in person if you are over 5 ' 7 '' and/or over 200lbs . Crazy but true .

 I bought this bra and its way too thin . You can see the nipples as though you are not wearing anything ! Now I am looking for an sew-in or insert pads because I certainly can not wear it the way it is .
 The description states that it fits B or C cups , which is incorrect.I am a 34 B and this bra is so tiny that it might as well be classified as a training bra.No one larger than a A cup is going to be comfortable in this bra unless they like to have their breasts flattened!I am in the process of returning this item right now !
 The fit on this robe was comfortable , and it is very warm . The color is an attractive pink . -LRB- Just trying not to be completely negative here ! -RRB- HOWEVER , this robe sheds worse than any product I have ever owned , with the possible exception of a dog . There are little pink balls all over the house , in the carpet , countertops , my hairbrush - there is just no end to it . I have washed it several times and it has not stopped shedding . I am now waiting for another robe I ordered to arrive so I can ditch this one . The problem is , I ca n't use it for anything else , even my husband wo n't take it for garage rags . I absolutely lost my money on this thing !
 Vendor , National , should pull this item immediately due to unbelievable amount of shedding -- not just bits of chenille that fall off on floor/carpet -LRB- as if you are Gretel leaving a path :--RRB- , but also a huge amount of finer fuzz that coats your bed , and upholstery , etc. . Worst of all however is the incredible amount of air-born particulate matter -- I have developed chest congestion/bronchitis after wearing for 1 week in spite of 3 washings -- never suffered from any lung/chest condition before , even though I am a `` senior . '' More details to come -LRB- have photos -RRB- after I contact manufacturer , but in the meantime wanted to warn my fellow Amazon customers of the serious danger to health from inhalation -- not to mention the clean-up of my previously immaculate house -LRB- hours of vacuuming , dusting , upholstery brushing as it went `` viral '' -RRB- .

 This belt buckle is cheap , but also nearly worthless . The `` C '' portion is single-sided thin metal that bends and cuts , tearing clothing and skin that it rubs against . Get something better than this !
 I ordered belt buckles form other stores on amazon for $ 3 and they were real metal . This belt buckle was far from metal , I can bend it with my hands . This buckle is extremely flimsy .
 I should have read the reviews more carefully , I usually do . This buckle is stamped sheet metal , NOT solid . I would not even use this as a costume belt . There is no way you could use this buckle on a belt to actually hold up your pants . What a waste . Buy something else.UPDATE
 I 'm not complaining too much because the hat was relatively inexpensive . However , the rim is way too big for the hat .
 While the Flightable V1600 is made using good , sturdy materials that will hold up for a long time , it wo n't need it because you wo n't use it more than once or twice . First , the handle is of a good length , but does n't lock well so you ca n't push the bag , and if going down a decline the bag has a tendency to roll forward because the handle does n't hold . Second , the inside of the bag is just like any suitcase . The laptop holding area are a couple of straps on the bottom , but there is no protection for the computer . You will need a case to protect your computer , and then if you want to pack anything else , it will all fit on top of your computer . Third , the wheels are small and recessed a little behind the table . This means that it will not be pulled up stairs easily . Fourth , the table folds out well , but if you need to work on anything you 've packed you 'll need to open the bag , unpack the bag , pull out what you want to work on -LRB- you 're computer is underneath everything -RRB- , put your stuff on the floor , repack what you do n't need , close the bag , put the bag upright , unfold the table , pick your stuff up from off the floor , work , put your stuff back on the floor , fold up the table , open the bag , take all your stuff out , repack all your stuff , close the bag . Fifth , the table is made of sturdy plastic , but with it 's location near the ground and with the other rolling plastic wheels it builds up a lot of static electricity and picks up everything off the ground from pet hair on carpeting to leaves and seeds on sidewalks so when you unfold your table you get a bunch of junk sitting on it and need to clean it before use . Sixth - it does have a nice feature of having a second zipper to give you an extra 2 inches of packing room which is good when you take a stuffed bag somewhere and then want to bring home a souvenir . Seventh there is a hook to hang a second bag over the front , but the hook extends too far so any bag longer than a standard briefcase will drag and any bag , even small ones , throw off the weight and pull back on the bag while you are pulling it making it more difficult to move.There are just too many design flaws to make it worthwhile . I ca n't see recommending a bag where the manufacturers not only forgot to employ basic physics principles but also threw out using common sense .
 T-shirt quality was not very nice . When I washed it , it looked like it had been used . Pricey for the quality .
 I was looking for something supportive , this is NOT it . Should have known from the one size fits all . The Capezio body tight is the way to go .
 Used this when mowing the lawn really soaks up the heat even with a lighter color.I was drenched way to much under this hat and it was n't really a hot day either.I mowed early AM , did n't make a bit of difference would n't buy again or recommend .
 I have two Affliction shirts that I bought from an MMA website . Affliction is a great product . The reason this gets only one star is that Rock Rebel Clothing does not tell you it is unavailable when you order it . They say it takes 4 to 6 weeks from this seller . I ordered it in June . Come the beginning of Oct. it had not arrived . They took over three weeks to respond to my e-mail about how late it was , and have no phone number that takes customer service calls . When I posted this on a Rock Rebel review on Amazon , they lied in the response and said they shipped it on July 25 . Liars . Amazon gave me a full refund for this and a Dragon Affliction shirt . Thank you Amazon .
 I 'm a fan of the `` Sightings '' TV show from the 1990 's , so I wanted to hang this up on my wall . The description of the product is somewhat misleading . It describes it as a fabric tapestry which makes me think of something thick and non-drooping . It is actually a thin silk cloth -LRB- with the image spray-painted on it -RRB- that droops when you try to pin it to your wall . This drooping affects how the image looks -LRB- especially , the logo -RRB- . If you stretch it enough , you can make it appear somewhat straight , but it never looks perfect.It is very thin and can tear . It comes folded several times in a very small `` box '' and you have to iron the wrinkles out of it . Also , even though the image does look basicly good , some of the details have been lost in the screen-printing from the original image on the cover of the VHS tape and book . This would have worked much better as a paper poster .
 Print on the umbrella is very cute , but it is difficult to open and very difficult to re-fold so that it fits into its carrying case .
 I find that while I love the front closure bras because of having fibro this one just is n't quite as comfortable as some of the others . The straps never have felt really comfortable and for this reason I wo n't buy another . I also feel that the posture support it claims is not really there .
 This bra is not the size it states , runs very small . It rides up and it is not comfortable . This would be better for someone who is not plus size .
 You get what you pay for . In this case it is a very uncomfortable bra . It reminds me of something my mom probably women wore in 1958 .
 I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR A DECENT T-BACK BRA SINCE THEY WENT OUT OF STYLE . I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ONE , UNLESS I WOULD WANT TO USE A BRA THAT DOES SEVERAL THINGS , LIKE SEVERAL KINDS OF POSITIONS . WELL , NO THANKS ! WHEN I SAW THIS BRA , MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS THAT IT LOOKED LIKE A BRA , LIKE THE KIND MY DECEASED MAMMAW WORE . I DID N'T STOP LOOKING FOR ME ANOTHER ONE EVERYWHERE I WENT . NO LUCK ! SO I THOUGHT , AS GOOD AS AMAZON HAS DONE FOR ME SO FAR , I CA N'T MISS OUT ON GETTING THE ACTUAL BRA , LIKE I WANT IT . WELL , IT ARRIVED AT MY HOUSE AND I OPENED IT UP . WHEN I FIRST OPENED IT , IT LOOKED LIKE MAMMAW WAS GOING TO BE UPSET , BECAUSE I HAD ONE OF HER BRAS SENT TO ME . THEN , I TOLD MYSELF TO SHUT UP AND TRY IT ON TO SEE IT BY SOME CHANCE IT FIT . WELL , I TRIED IT ON AND IF I HAD INSERTED TUBE SOCKS IN IT , IT WOULD HAVE FIT GOOD ENOUGH . WELL , THOSE DAYS ENDED WITH THE ` EIGHTIES ' AND ME GROWING UP . SO I HAVE YET TO FIND A WAY TO SEND IT BACK , BUT IT IS COMING . I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A REFUND . WHAT WOULD BE EVEN BETTER THAN THAT , WOULD BE FOR YOU GUYS TO FIND SOME COOL T-BACK BRAS FOR ME TO LOOK AT . I ENJOY MAIDENFORM , VASSERETTE , OR EVEN A GOOD SERVING HANES . MY BIGGEST PROBLEM IS THE FACT THAT I HAD A CAR ACCIDENT , ALMOST 12 YEARS AGO . I HAVE 18 PINS IN MY HIP , 2 IN MY KNEE AND 8 IN MY FOOT . SO THE WALKING I NEED TO BE DOING , DOES N'T GET DONE . THEREFORE , THE 40B SIZE BRA . IT DOES N'T SEEM TO BE A TYPICAL BRA SIZE .
 I was so excited when I saw these stockings and they were going to be the perfect little extra item for My Halloween costume . I am 5 ' 4 '' and even pulling these stockings all the way up , they are baggy and the holes look uneven . The top is super tight and uncomfortable . I will be returning these .
 I ordered these shorts - 3 pairs various colors . 24 days later the items arrived . -LRB- please note their explicit 3-5 day shipping policy @ $ 7.00 -RRB- I sent 3 e-mails . 1 to change the fabric type and I was told order was already processed and would be shipping soon . 2nd was re
 Absolute crap . I am only a small size , but the paint on the stockings stretches and looks cheap . The elastic at the top of the stockings is way too tight -LRB- Im only a small size -RRB- and makes your thigh bulge and look fat . And it still falls down despite the elastic . Dont buy this , they are not even worth the few dollars I spent .
 I selected this passport holder to replace a holder that held only passports . My intent was to carry both my passport and my daughter 's along with a driver 's license and credit cards . My primary complaint with this holder is that the tri-fold design turned out to be difficult to work with . Traveling with a child , a needed to be able to access the passports with only one hand and it was impossible to do . The wallet does n't unfold completely when opened and I had to brace the holder open with one hand while removing the passports with the other . My second complaint arose when I realized that fully opening the wallet to remove the passports revealed everything else inside . My final complaint is that the holder is too thick to be worn comfortably under a jacket let alone clothes . Even had I been carrying only one passport , this holder is still too thick to use as a concealed passport holder . On the positive side , the holder is well constructed and durable . It would carry a passport and International driver 's license -LRB- 2 passports did n't fit well -RRB- . It has 4 credit card slots and a long money slot . However , if you are looking for a concealed passport carrier , this is definitely too big . I went back to using my Eagle Creek passport only holder .
 for no apparent reason these are humongous . my bf currently wears 32x32 which are a bit short and a bit tight on him so we tried to go a size up - but for some reason these were ginormous !
 my boyfriend currently wears 32x32s that were getting a bit tight and a bit long on him . for some reason these in 34x34 were ridiculously huge ! Returned
 These pants are fake no tags fake packaging.the zipper was broke.I work in 874s for over 25 years an I know how they look an feel an these look an feel &#34; FAKE &#34;
 The pants have so much wrong with them , plus they look awful . It is my guess that dickies enjoys making money at the expense of the customer , both by making them pay too much for them and making them look stupid wearing them .1 . -RRB- CARDBOARD PANTS . They are STIFF . Wash them 100 times and I guarantee you they will still feel like cardboard .2 . -RRB- They are so tapered they barely fit over any boots you wear . Your feet look enormous next to these skinny pants . NO ROOM !! 3 . -RRB- They ride so high on your waist it is uncomfortable4 . -RRB- They are n't sized properly , a 36 is a 34 , 34 is 32 etc. ... STAY AWAY .
 Waist is not true to size just like many dickies products , its better if you just go to a store and try them on first
 These pants , for me , where a bit tighter than I thought it would be , also stiffer and smaller than I had hoped .
 Just going to list the issues
 i ordered gray and they sent green . GREEN , come on guys really ? at least they were the right size . well done
 I remember when I was a teenager Dickies would last forever ; nowadays they fall apart pretty quickly . I think they must be cutting costs on quality control ...
 I had a pair of Dickies fall apart after a month . Then they would n't honor the warranty . Shady company and now making crap products .
 I generally wear a 38x30 , and that 's what I bought in these , they are sized quite a bit smaller in the waste . I 'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in , but you may want to get a waste size up . I 'll be wearing them in a dress office setting , and I 'm surprised how good these look , hopefully they last a long time too .
 My husband always wears 36 30 . He has several Dickie pants ... I got 874 which were the wrong ones . They were stiff and small . I had to return and now pay postage beause they were part of another order making over $ 25 . Also had to go to UPS and post and will have return postage taken out of refund ... My mistake and I paid for it
 Be aware that these run small - At least by a size or more . And they 're straight leg , not boot cut , so there 's a bit of a taper at the ankle .
 I 've been buying Dickies , particularly the 874 's for over 20 years and I was n't impressed with these ones at all . . While the item was clearly marked as a Dickies product , it did n't look or feel like any pair of Dickies I 've ever bought before.The material seemed very thin , and the pants had no factory crease . .

I 'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in , but you may want to get a waste size up . I 'll be wearing them in a dress office setting , and I 'm surprised how good these look , hopefully they last a long time too .
 for no apparent reason these are humongous . my bf currently wears 32x32 which are a bit short and a bit tight on him so we tried to go a size up - but for some reason these were ginormous !
 my boyfriend currently wears 32x32s that were getting a bit tight and a bit long on him . for some reason these in 34x34 were ridiculously huge ! Returned
 These pants are fake no tags fake packaging.the zipper was broke.I work in 874s for over 25 years an I know how they look an feel an these look an feel &#34; FAKE &#34;

 Waist is not true to size just like many dickies products , its better if you just go to a store and try them on first
 These pants , for me , where a bit tighter than I thought it would be , also stiffer and smaller than I had hoped .
 My husband always wears 36 30 . He has several Dickie pants ... I got 874 which were the wrong ones . They were stiff and small . I had to return and now pay postage beause they were part of another order making over $ 25 . Also had to go to UPS and post and will have return postage taken out of refund ... My mistake and I paid for it
 i ordered gray and they sent green . GREEN , come on guys really ? at least they were the right size . well done
 I remember when I was a teenager Dickies would last forever ; nowadays they fall apart pretty quickly . I think they must be cutting costs on quality control ...
 I had a pair of Dickies fall apart after a month . Then they would n't honor the warranty . Shady company and now making crap products .
 The pants have so much wrong with them , plus they look awful . It is my guess that dickies enjoys making money at the expense of the customer , both by making them pay too much for them and making them look stupid wearing them .1 . -RRB- CARDBOARD PANTS . They are STIFF . Wash them 100 times and I guarantee you they will still feel like cardboard .2 . -RRB- They are so tapered they barely fit over any boots you wear . Your feet look enormous next to these skinny pants . NO ROOM !! 3 . -RRB- They ride so high on your waist it is uncomfortable4 . -RRB- They are n't sized properly , a 36 is a 34 , 34 is 32 etc. ... STAY AWAY .
 Be aware that these run small - At least by a size or more . And they 're straight leg , not boot cut , so there 's a bit of a taper at the ankle .
 I 've been buying Dickies , particularly the 874 's for over 20 years and I was n't impressed with these ones at all . . While the item was clearly marked as a Dickies product , it did n't look or feel like any pair of Dickies I 've ever bought before.The material seemed very thin , and the pants had no factory crease . . Live and learn . .
 it is listed as queen 2 which is fine til you get to the lace top with is too tight and does not give . Tried cutting into but still did n't help . . only help would be to reduce yourself or buy from another company . . which i have .
 As with the other Berkshire knee-high hosery I ordered , I was not the least bit happy with these . They were easily `` damaged . '' They did not hug the leg , but sagged . They were not nice at all . I 'm surprized a company like Berkshire would put out such an inferior product . They were not exactly `` cheap '' in price either .
 I 'm definitely returning these . I love thigh highs and wear them 3-4 times a week -- never , ever going back to pantyhose . Since Hanes stopped making the ones I loved -LRB- why , WHY did n't I stock up more ? If it 's actually good they 're guaranteed to discontinue it -RRB- , I 've been on the hunt for a replacement . I 've tried lots of brands and lots of styles and these are truly among the worst . I ordered the Shimmers in the color Candlelight . Bad choice . They feel cheap and scratchy , and they have a pretty hideous-looking greenish gold tint to them . Maybe other colors or varieties would look and feel better , but I seriously ca n't imagine anyone liking these . The one positive is that the lace band at the top is both pretty and wide , and for me it was the perfect fit -- seems like they 'd stay up nicely without causing any muffin top on your thighs . Honestly , if I were only reviewing the band at the top , I might even give these 5 stars ; but the horrible , horrible stocking attached to the band deserves a 0 . Do n't waste your money .
 The first time trying to put them on , my love ran them horribly , all the way up the leg , when trying to put them on . Not worth a penny , if you ask me ! If I could give them a ZERO , I would .

 Got this pouch for paintball in the Bay Area . Attached it to my molle vest the night before . Started play at 12:30 PM the following day . By 2:30 ish PM , latch needed for grommet had detached . I guess it was n't meant for repeated openings and closings before and after games . The pouch , received the night before , was rendered useless as a result . Since it is a metal latch , it is definitely not worth it to have it repaired . Stay away from this POS ... Stay far away .
 Got this Black 2-Pocket Ammo Pouch Black in October 12 , 2010for cell phone , 2 keys and wallet , not a overload.The cover clip broke off Jan 6,2011 -LRB- 87 days -RRB- and it cant be returned : -LRB-

 I did quite a bit of research before purchasing this bag for a 6 week trip through Asia . The first day I really used this bag was during a 12-hour layover in London , where I walked around the city much of the day.I carried a Canon 40D with two relatively lightweight lenses , spare batteries , filters , and a small notebook . At the end of the day , while waiting at Heathrow for the next flight , I was shocked to notice that the bag was already beginning to fall apart ! The outer fabric covering the shoulder straps had already begun to tear . So had the fabric above the zipper on the top pocket . The tear was large enough for someone to stick a hand into the pocket . I inspected the bag closely to see if something had caused these tears , but I concluded that the bag was just a piece of junk . It had begun to unravel itself under the weight of a bag that was not even half-filled ! Not having any emergency repair items on hand , the unraveling continued to get worse over the next day . Finally , I had the bag stitched up in Kerala , India , thinking that would be it . Nope ! Bye the next day , the bag had unraveled in other spots as well . I had it stitched up again in Mysore , and then again in Bangalore . Thankfully , these minor fixes cost very little in India . By the time I was almost done with Bangkok , I had bought a small roll of duct tape to keep my items from falling out of the bag . I had also had countless thoughts about the negative review I would write on Amazon when I 'd returned home.I considered writing about the design and functionality of the bag , but there 's really no point in doing so.This bag is a worthless piece of junk . It 's amazing that they get away with charging almost $ 80 for this . Naneu Pro should be ashamed for manufacturing such an inferior product , while marketing itself to be an innovative company that produces high quality goods . I 'm truly shocked that Amazon and B&H ; Photo carry this bag . A $ 10 bag from the local discount store would have been more durable . What a total ripoff !

 I order 2 extra long shirts to try . I ordered 1 red 1 grey . When the package came the first thing noticed was the red shirt was in a smaller bag size than the grey shirt . Upon opening , the grey shirt had cardboard that the sirt was wrapped around . The red shirt had no cardboard that the shirt was wrapped around . The grey shirt had no size tag on the back of the neck for the size just a stamp and made in Pakistan . The red shirt had tag with the size Russel brand and made in Pakistan . I put the grey shirt on , it on and it was very good in size and length . Loose fitting all around and nice and log . I then tried the red shirt , it was tight fitting , almost choking me around the neck and clearly shorter in length than the grey shirt that came in the same package . I placed both out on the bed and the red shirt was around 2 inches shorter in width 3 inches shorter in length and the neckline was an inch shorter and the sleeves were not as wide.Maybe they shipped me a returned shirt that was washed and shrunk ? Who knows but a 2XT with 2 different packaging , tags and sizes is not acceptable quality imho . I will be returning both shirts .
 Quality not very good . My expectations for a Russell Athletic product were not met . To me , the material was of a very low grade .
 this shirt started out at 34 '' length after wash and dried on low heat it was 32 '' inches long so cant where it which is bad new because it cost a lot more than the others i bought of other brands , i would recommend no one over 6.0 to 6.2 buy this i am 6.7 and it is way to short unless you like showing you back off and if that 's the case save the money and do n't wear a shirt
 For years I have loved Russell Athletic products -LRB- I have one shirt that I have worn at least 500 times and it still looks new -RRB- , but then my local Academy stopped carrying them . Although I prefer to buy locally , I had no choice and so ordered from Amazon . One of the shirts I bought came out of its third laundry cycle with the sleeve seams split in several places . Not what I had expected !
 The first time my son wore this shirt the length was great , as soon as I washed and dried -LRB- on low -RRB- the shirt shrunk . Do not wash , this shirt will shrink drastically . At least 3 inches .
 I ordered 3 of these and they were not only on the small side , they also had significant size differences between supposedly equal sized shirts ... Someone slip some irregulars into this batch ?
 The packaging had dead insects in it , and in one of the 3 shirts there was a hole in it , near the collar . Whether it was a sewing mistake or insect munching , I do n't know .
 At first I was thrilled that I finally found a 2XT Tee Shirt that was actually cut for a tall person and not a fatty.The material also had a nice thickness to it , which has become a problem with many garments of late.After some inspection , I realized that the construction of one of the shirts was so far off that I had to go back to see if I ordered a blemish or factory second.If you pay $ 30.00 -LRB- with shipping -RRB- for a Tee Shirt , you should n't expect such an awful job . One of the side seams is fine , but the other starts at the armpit and then takes a sharp turn , ending close to the middle of the back . Not only does this look ridiculous , but I feel the pulling from this terribly made shirt.The packaging said that this shirt was made in Pakistan , which might be the reason for this reject of a shirt.Shirt companies were having shirts made in Mexico and Honduras , which was a slight decline from what is made in the US , but this is just unacceptable.What is next , $ 40.00 for a Tee Shirt made in Madagascar ?????
 I am very disappointed in the T-Shirt that I received . Not only does it have small flaws but it is NOT the T-Shirt that is pictured on the web site . I will NOT be ordering anything else from this vendor .
 We have purchased Russell Athletic tshirts in the past and they were very true to size . My husband is 6 ' 6 '' and this `` tall '' size is at least 4 '' -6 '' short in the length compared to Reebok , Nautica and Cutter & Buck . Such a disappointment . I even washed them in cold water . I will say that the quality of the material of the shirt is good but does me no good if he wo n't wear them . Will NEVER buy these again !
 I bought these shirts because i have a hard time finding good shirts for tall people -LRB- 6 ' 3 '' 270lbs -RRB- . These shirts all shrank up in just a couple of washed the carhartt tall shirts have been far superior to these and so I will not be buying any more of these shirts .
 Disappointing ! This t-shirt shrank about five -LRB- ! -RRB- inches in the length even though I followed laundering directions on the label .
 I generally wear a 38x30 , and that 's what I bought in these , they are sized quite a bit smaller in the waste . I 'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in , but you may want to get a waste size up . I 'll be wearing them in a dress office setting , and I 'm surprised how good these look , hopefully they last a long time too .

 Between September and December , 2005 , I ordered this belt three times from Amazon in the black color . Each time I received a light brown belt -LRB- although the box in came in was labeled `` Black '' -RRB- . Each time I returned the belt and explained that the boxes were mislabeled . Amazon 's response to my third return was from Preeti G. who emailed me `` I 've researched your account ; it appears that one of my colleagues has already resolved this issue . '' Well , they might have resolved this issue but after months of frustration I still do n't have a black belt . Amazon should just stick to books .
 the belt , while nice , was the wrong color . the package said black , the pic showed black ; the belt was maroon . try to get it taken care of ... hah ... amazon now fobs off it 's customer sevice to india !!! try talking with them , try to understand them ... amazon has my last dollar .
 I had an identical experience to the previous reviewer - I wore these on my wedding day and got rings of blisters around the top of my legs . The company was very very helpful in dealing with it -LRB- replaced the hose with another kind , refunded my money , and offered to cover any medical expenses -RRB- . Mr Mayer called me multiple times to follow up and make sure I was doing ok . They insisted that it was an allergic reaction to the silicone , which I can assure you it was not - it felt and looked like friction . Overall , I recommend the company but not this product .
 I would not reccomend wearing these hose for very long at all . The silicone bands which hold them up were burning my legs by halfway through my wedding day and left me with blisters on my wedding night .
 I wore these two days ago and my thigh still has a red ring of blister on it ! It 's due to the friction of the inner silicone on the lace . It hurt so bad when I took off the thigh high at the end of the day , and I realized why , I had a red line around the front of my leg that had blistered . I hope it goes away , soon . It 's too bad because they do look very pretyy on .
 I am still dealing with the sores/burns on my legs after 2 weeks of not wearing them the Berkshire thigh highs . The rubber behind the lace top that adheres to your skin is , in my opinion , toxic . I have been wearing thigh highs for a very long time and when I went to re-order , the brand I usually get - Jockey was discontinued or out of stock . So I know that the sores from the Berkshire thigh highs were not caused because I was new to wearing thigh-highs . Stay away from this brand .
 If you 're the kind of person who has trouble with slippage these are great . They stay up really well , but they are definitely for people with thinner thighs , and they are shorter in length than some other brands . I prefer thigh highs that come up a little higher on the leg - and I 'm only 5 ' 4 '' so they wo n't be very high on people with longer legs , but if you 're the sort of girl who likes a little lace to show , then by all means go for it !

 My husband always wears 36 30 . He has several Dickie pants ... I got 874 which were the wrong ones . They were stiff and small . I had to return and now pay postage beause they were part of another order making over $ 25 . Also had to go to UPS and post and will have return postage taken out of refund ... My mistake and I paid for it
 I 've been buying Dickies , particularly the 874 's for over 20 years and I was n't impressed with these ones at all . . While the item was clearly marked as a Dickies product , it did n't look or feel like any pair of Dickies I 've ever bought before.The material seemed very thin , and the pants had no factory crease . . Live and learn . .
 Be aware that these run small - At least by a size or more . And they 're straight leg , not boot cut , so there 's a bit of a taper at the ankle .
 Waist is not true to size just like many dickies products , its better if you just go to a store and try them on first
 These pants , for me , where a bit tighter than I thought it would be , also stiffer and smaller than I had hoped .
 The pants have so much wrong with them , plus they look awful . It is my guess that dickies enjoys making money at the expense of the customer , both by making them pay too much for them and making them look stupid wearing them .1 . -RRB- CARDBOARD PANTS . They are STIFF . Wash them 100 times and I guarantee you they will still feel like cardboard .2 . -RRB- They are so tapered they barely fit over any boots you wear . Your feet look enormous next to these skinny pants . NO ROOM !! 3 . -RRB- They ride so high on your waist it is uncomfortable4 . -RRB- They are n't sized properly , a 36 is a 34 , 34 is 32 etc. ... STAY AWAY .
 Pay attention to the size of this product . I assumed from the age group I was getting normal size stuff since my daughter is six . I could cover the pons up with my hands . The baton is also short but not as dissapointing . It is plastic that will bend and not return to shape , but is heavy enough . The megaphone is rediculous . About the size of a 7-11 big gulp . I did n't bother returning it because I would have paid about the same for shipping as I would have gotten back . If you are going to use it as a cute display for decorating , it might be sufficient , but the color on the display is not necessarily the color you will receive .

 Just going to list the issues
 for no apparent reason these are humongous . my bf currently wears 32x32 which are a bit short and a bit tight on him so we tried to go a size up - but for some reason these were ginormous !
 my boyfriend currently wears 32x32s that were getting a bit tight and a bit long on him . for some reason these in 34x34 were ridiculously huge ! Returned
 These pants are fake no tags fake packaging.the zipper was broke.I work in 874s for over 25 years an I know how they look an feel an these look an feel &#34; FAKE &#34;
 I generally wear a 38x30 , and that 's what I bought in these , they are sized quite a bit smaller in the waste . I 'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in , but you may want to get a waste size up . I 'll be wearing them in a dress office setting , and I 'm surprised how good these look , hopefully they last a long time too .

 These are a very thin and shiny microfiber -- in the 70 's we called them polyester . Not at all what I expected .

 along with the pillow , a disappointment . nothing special and not worth buying . didnt even take this blanket with me on the plane once i received and saw it .
 it says it is 6 months , it it closer to premie size . i do not recommend getting something from this place unless you go SEVERAL sizes larger !

 I just received these and it was a waste of money . They are not adjustable and do not work with high top maternity pants.This would be a great product however , they are Not Adjustable and Belly Ups needs to know that not everybody 's torsois the same length and they should be adjustable for any kind of pants you might wear high top or low rise and they arenot . Extremely disappointed : -LRB-
 My torso is too short for this product . The bands are loose when I fasten them , so they do n't really keep my pants up . Plus they 're a pain to fasten and unfasten every time I use the bathroom - which is a lot !
 I wanted so much to love these but no dice . The suspenders are not adjustable so you are stuck with the prescribed length and the clasp broke after 4 wearings . Do n't bother and buy some full suspenders .
 I thought they were great at first , by about the seventh use they just did n't seem to clamp as well and always popping off . I still use them because an occational mishap is better than constantly pulling up my maternity pants !! I 'm still looking for something better , if anyone has any suggestions ?!
 After wearing this for 2 hours , yes 2 hours , the clasp broke and fell apart . I am trying to contact the company to get a refund . It 's a great idea , but I must have gotten a defective product . Also , they are not adjustable , I think they would have been better if they could be adjusted .
 I have used it only twice and it is already distorted and does not hold anymore . It is very poor quality and also it is not adjustable . I was using Y-back suspenders , but it can be seen when I wear wide-collar shirts and also hurts my shoulders . So I thought belly ups is a great idea when I bought it . It should have been adjustable and durable .
 all zippers on back pack have broken - not impressed . should be made with better , heavy duty zippers that will not break . have repaired it ... . Great back pack otherwise .

 The seller sent me the wrong size . The jeans look very comfortable and warm , but when I tried to get the right size they did not have it anymore .
 when clicking on link it did not say they did not have them it sent what it did have
 I bought this pair of jeans for working in . They are not very tough/strong . I already have one hole . And the weave is coming out fast . I will get it patched , but I wo n't be buying anymore carhartt jeans . Seeing that this was the first carhartt item I have ever bought I also doubt I will buy anything else carhartt 's .
 I do n't think that it is too much to expect one year 's service out of a set of work dungarees , but apparently I 'm wrong . I carry tools around all day at work in the tool pockets . And two out of the four pairs I bought in July have worn through the tool pockets already . Carhartt could do with a better quality denim for work dungarees .
 I ordered the exact same product a year ago and they fit great . This time they are too long and tight across the top 's of my legs . You wonder how a product could change ; did the sweat factory person have a bad day ; was she or he new at the job ; I mean how can you mis-cut or screw up a pair of Carhartt 's ... I am going to keep them and allow the local Vocational School -LRB- Tailoring Program -RRB- fix them to fit . My bad ! You really need to try stuff on before purchasing . It is just disappointing that crap changes for no reason .
 way to big ... i ordered ' 32x28 ' ... which is a hard to find size ... they fit bigger than most ' 32x30 ' jeans ! ... bummer ... gave them to salvation army , not even worth returninglame >
 I was n't at all expecting cargo jeans when I opened the package , which I strongly dislike as does my husband .
 This bag is durable as promised -LRB- or at least seems fairly durable -RRB- , but is only ~ 9 `` x12 `` x3 '' , and some of the zippers were broken when I received it . Would not recommend .
 I guess I should have opened the package sooner , but when I opened the package of tights to put them on , I discovered a large run in the tights . Since I 'd purchased them over 30 days ago , I guess I 'm S.O.L. ...
 I wore these once , for less than 1/2 day , to my office for work , I sat down in my chair and got a run in them !!!! I thought the Danskin product would be much stronger than that!I am very disappointed with this product .
 Croch got holes in it first time . Poor quality I have a pair that is 3 years old that still have no holes .
 I used Danskin tights for 20 years & couldnt believe when they went out of business in Las Vegas , NV ! I purchased a few pair online for my GF & I. . . both of ours -LRB- different sizes -RRB- were ripped out of the box ! I still have a pair that I havent opened bcuz I believe they will be the same way ... very disappointing from such a reputable company !!!
 Too dark for light toast . I was looking for a color just a bit darker than nude . I will keep looking . Capezio seems to be a better choice .
 This hat was a great disappointment , it is nowhere near as warm as other comments made it seem .
 The front seams on these pants are scratchy , especially on the knees . The seams do n't drape well , so the pants hang funny . I returned them . I have other Under Armour pants that fit well and feel great -- but these definitely did n't . The Gear Tech fabric keeps you cool , washes and hangs dry in a few hours -- so I give the product two stars for the quality of the material .
 Tight , it slides down , not like the other thigh high panty hoseby Hue .
 This wallet/organizer is very difficult to use . The frame is inflexible so it is hard to remove your currency or get at your credit cards . I bought it because it would hold all my `` necessaries '' but found out that I would need at least 1 other carrier anyway . The leather is nice and soft but that 's as much as I can praise .
 I was buying these bibs for my infant , so I needed them to absorb milk as I gave her a bottle . The milk seems to roll off the bib instead of being quickly absorbed . Perhaps these are better for an older infant who is eating solids .
 I got this from amazon at discount price , but it did not look authentic at all . Luckily , I was able to return it .
 The sunglasses came unassembled and were defective . Forzieri would n't give me return instructions in a timely manner . I will never buy on amazon or Forzieri again after this experience .
 At first sight I thought the bra was nice so I ordered it in blue . However , once it arrived it was what I call the Madonna look or the cone pointy look . So thanks to Amazon 's great return policy I returned it for another style .
 I 'm still looking for a well-fitting bra . The wide straps are more comfortable than narrow ones , but I need to shorten them more than the construction allows .
 The bra cup was super uncomfortable , unless your breasts are `` cone shaped '' , they will not fit into the cup correctly . All sorts of mushing and pressing very uncomfortable . Even through the shirt , you can tell it 's the cone shaped cup comes to a pointy end . what is this ? 1984 madonna bra ?? The straps create bulge in the back , also unflattering . I returned it .
 This bra is made of industrial strength elastic and I agree with another reviewer who said the sizes are inconsistent . Another reviewer mentioned how pointy the cups are -- I agree with that also . Makes me look like one of those women in an old Perry Mason episode with breasts which look like weapons . In any case , it reminds me of a bra from the 40s or 50s when bras and panties and girdles and underwear were called `` foundations . '' It will outlast me and go to my heirs , I 'm sure . I bought the black one which is very stiff -LRB- even after washing -RRB- and it 's so heavy and thick it feels like I 'm wearing another shirt . Not my idea of comfort .
 for most of my adulthood , I 've been searching for THE perfect bra to wear and after hearing my grandmother 's advice for years and years to try an `` 18 hour brassiere , '' I bought one last week to try it . I am so disappointed . The fit is terrible and not true to size -LRB- incredibly small -RRB- and the fabric is a scratchy mess . I had bulges coming out in places I never knew I had . I did wear the bra for several hours , hoping that it would maybe relax a bit , but after four hours , the straps just dug into my shoulders causing more uncomfortableness . I really wanted to like this bra , but I ca n't . I would take the bra back , but because it 's unsanitary to return a bra , it 's getting thrown in the trash .
 Do n't waste your money . Fit is OK but unbearably scratchy elastic ! Color is great . I was really hoping for and improvement in what I usually buy but this is not it !
 I felt like my 44D boobs were being herded into industrial-style containers . Wow , it definitely supports them , and they 'd better not ask questions !!! I went around all day feeling like my boobs were ` out there ' , well-managed , and not going anyplace.It 's not something I 'd buy again - it 's just a bit too uncomfortable - like they were stitched from the same material used to make backpacks , but the one I have will probably last a good while .2 stars because it is indeed well-constructed . SOMEBODY at Playtex said , by golly , I wan na design a bra that MEANS it !
 I really wanted to like this bra as it is very pretty . However , it was extremely scratchy and irritated my skin in several places . I did not like the cone look ! I felt I looked ridiculous . I am big busted so this bra will probably work for those who are smaller . It 's just not for me .
 this product ran too small . I will have to return.the color was nice but it is not true to size
 I 'm not one to brag , but my breasts are perfectly round DDs . This bra turned shaped them into long pyramids with extra room around the nipple . I looked so weird in a shirt and even my boyfriend was politely not into it . The bra was pretty comfortable aside from that but I would never buy this again .
 Yes the straps are comfortable and it has decent support but the bra itself is so rough underneath my breasts as well as my entire midsection that it leaves marks and literally hurts . If you loosen it to the last hook setting then it 's not worth wearing.Don ' t buy . Seriously .
 if it were possible to give a negative star rating , i would . COMPLETELY disappointed by this bra . ordered in 36DD and after it finally arrived -LRB- almost 2 weeks later -RRB- , i balked at the sight of it . within minutes of opening it , i was already preparing it for return to Amazon . straps are HU-monguous -- so thick i thought it was the 50s again . bra extends down to middle of my torso , and the cups are n't flush with your chestbone as it should be for a correct fit . itchy lace border . on and on and on ... . learn from my lesson & try VF -LRB- cheaper -RRB- or Olga -LRB- great support but with straps that someone under the age of 70 would actually wear -RRB- !
 I bought this for the first time over the internet . I prefer going into stores & trying bras out , but there are no plus-size stores in the area I live in . I have used Lane Bryant 's bras for quite a few years with great success , but I always find myself purchasing bras after approximately 1 1/2 years due to the underwires snapping in half . Since LB 's bras are so expensive , the cost adds up over time . The size I normally wear with LB 's bras is 44DDD . It 's not the greatest fit because I continually find myself adjusting the back -LRB- the band does not stay in place -RRB- . My boobs are heavy , so the back rides up . Quite annoying , but the cups are a dream fit . However , I do love the underwires as I need that support.I bought 2 of these bras in a beige 46DDD because of some comments stating that Playtex 's bras are smaller than the norm . I tried it on & immediately had to take it off as the back was so tight that it was causing my skin to tingle -- giving me the sensation that if I did n't take it off , my back would turn numb -- & the cups were much too big . If I filled it out properly , I have no doubt that it would look like I had cone boobs . I had absolutely no support whatsoever with this bra . I also wear a lot of square-necked shirts , & this bra is not something I want to show off while wearing them . The scalloped edges actually showed above the square-necked hem ! Quite embarrassing . My hopes were completely dashed.Needless to say , they are being returned.I will continue to stay with Lane Bryant until I find another bra that has a better fit in the back & is easier on my wallet . Playtex is NOT that , & this experience only served to remind me of one of the reasons why I stopped wearing their brand . What a pity .
 The were huge and no support . Probably good for people that do not have huge watermelon boobs . lol , but seriously .
 The plastic thing that you use to adjust the strap broke - I ca n't wear it and do n't know how to repair it -- and since I 've already worn/washed it , I ca n't return it.I gave it a couple of stars because it did fit well ...
 This bra reeks . It smelled bad when I opened it and the smell gets worse after each wash . According to many other reviews on other sites it 's because there is rubber in the bra . I have been unable to get rid of the smell . I plan on ordering a different bra from another manufacturer and throwing these away . I am so upset but the smell wo n't come off these bras and I can no longer stand the horrible smell that surrounds me when I wear this bra .
 I hate tis bra . I read the other reviews and bought this bra based in them . But it is really uncomfortable and i am returning it .
 Made my boobs look pointy and the material was itchy . I did like the comfort straps , hopefully I can find that feature in a different bra that works for me .
 Clearly not a sexy bra , but I figured it looks very comfortable . Unfortunately when it 's actually on it 's 1 -RRB- not comfortable , and 2 -RRB- very &#34; old school &#34; -- pointy ! Very unattractive line under clothes . So it does n't serve any purpose .
 These are very thin and unlined in the cup area as well as very scratchy . They also create a very unattractive cone shape once you try to put a shirt over the bra . They are not at all what I expected . :-LRB- I &#8217; m not sure why they took so much time to make the straps padded and comfortable -LRB- which ARE pretty nice - which is why this product is getting two stars from me instead of one -RRB- when the cups are like wearing burlap on your breasts .
 I tried this particular bra twice , in two different sizes and although I love the color -LRB- the sailor blue -RRB- and the makeup of the straps , the cup is just too pointy and does not seem to contour correctly . This is the only bra that I have experienced this `` overage '' with . I went down a cup size and it did not make a difference ... I just could not get this bra to fit me.I 've tried several washes -LRB- even drying on hot -RRB- to see if a little shrinkage would help . No go . What I am left with is a relatively comfortable bra around the back and shoulders with a cup that has too much fabric in the front and is too pointy for me . Usually not a problem . Unfortunately , this bra has been relegated to the bottom of my drawer and is only used under multiple layers where any kind of wrinkles or gathered material wo n't be visible . I 'm glad I only paid around $ 10 for it.Two tries though and it still did n't work for me .
 i WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT . . THE SIZE IS WEIRD . THE MATERIAL I THOUGHT WOULD BE COMFORTABLE -LRB- ITS SCRATCHY -RRB- AND IT JUST DOES N'T FIT .
 When i got this bra i was so happy ... i have been looking for this model for years ... but then when i finally tried it on it was big ... i know my size -LRB- i constantly measure myself -RRB- and i always wear a 38C ... but the cups were so large i can not wear the bra ... so know your size well and maybe contact the company before you buy one
 Well , I was desperate for a bra lately , as I 'm recently pregnant and gaining in size . I saw the reviews on this one , and pounced on it . I 've never worn a comfortable non-underwire bra , so this was a leap of faith for sure . I was disapointed when I tried it on ... first off , it 's super tight around the ribs . I know I 'm a 38 , and that size fits me with any other bra I wear , yet this one has no give whatsoever , and also is worn much further down on the `` ribs '' so I suggest you order up a few inches . I also noticed the material was super scratchy . The straps in the back - the metal adjuster parts DIG into your flesh if you have to twist . The cups give you a triangle look that points unnaturally high and sits strangely high on the chest . It looks just awful under a tee shirt . Then there 's so much material on the top , over the cleavage , that you ca n't wear anything that 's not completely full coverage over it , so it severely limits your outfit choices . Plus the straps are wide , so they 'll show on any tank top , no matter how thick-strapped the tank top may be ... I am NOT a fan . I wore this for 40 minutes and wanted to burn it . I 'm sending it back !
 I ordered this bra in 42C . It was very tight when I tried it on . I 've never had a 42 band feel tight on me before , so I measured the band . It 's actually 35 '' long . The box says 42C , the tag on the bra says 42C , but the band is seven inches shorter than it should be . Obviously I have to return it . VERY annoying.My favorite bras are Playtex 18 Hour bras , style 4019 . That style does n't seem to be made anymore . Even though I love my Playtex 4019s , I do n't think I 'll be buying any Playtex bras again unless I 've tried them on first . Their sizing does n't seem to be reliable .
 Makes the girls look like 1960s cone bras . It 's so cheaply made it 's not even worth the time to return it . No bueno .
 I must say I had to take it off within the hour , I am a size G so finding a good bra is hard and I do n't fell like I found a good one here . itchy and hurt my shoulders :0 -LRB-
 This bra is well built and would no doubt give a great deal of support ... if you can figure out what size to order.I wear a 44DD . I 've worn bras by various brand -- Glamour , JMS , Playtex , and everything inbetween . My size is consistent . So , when it came time to order more , I picked out this bra -LRB- hoping to get a good , supportive bra -RRB- and ordered these in a 44DD . I got these in , tried them on , and found they were * MASSIVELY * oversized.At first , I thought it was a matter of adjusting so I tightened the band so that I was on the 3rd/tightest set of hooks , I played with the straps , and readjusted &#34; the girls &#34; , but it was all for not . There was a large bunch of fabric under my armpits and the cups had a great deal of floppy , extra material , too.I went from wondering why it would n't fit to thinking they 'd put the wrong size in the box . I checked the label and found that it read 44DD -- same as I ordered.So , I got curious and lined up a newly purchased Playtex bra in another style against this bra and discovered the bra band was a full 3 1/2 &#34; longer than it ought to be ! Not only that , but the cups were a full 1 &#34; larger , too ! It was no wonder they did n't fit . And it was n't just one defective bra , but both of them!In addition , I found the fabric -LRB- possibly the dye in it or some chemical added -RRB- to be horribly itchy . I found the skin on my breasts and below them where the band sits to be irritated just after trying them on . Usually I 'm not sensitive to these types of things , but this was enough that it hurt . If you do decide to purchase this bra , I 'd HIGHLY recommend washing it before wearing it.Totally disappointed in my purchase and am sending it back . After this -- the poor sizing and the scratchy/burning from the dye used -- I honestly do n't think I 'll be purchasing Playtex in the future .
 I am pregnant and needed new bras . I thought this would be great and figured it would offer great support . It does offer support , however , it makes you look like you have cones on your chest ! This is something my grandmother would wear ! Not only that , the top of the bra in the front is so high that I ca n't wear it with normal t-shirts . Everyone would be able to see it . Talk about full coverage !!!! I am mid thirties and this bra is way too old fashioned for me .
 I already have the UPS return receipt to send this back for credit . I think there were so many on sale because the sizing was so far off the mark.I wear this size all the time in other bras I buy and this was just huge . Could n't give this one away so I 'm sending it back.Uses to getting good products but NOT this time . Oh well .
 This is a granny bra . What in the world are people raving about ? This bra looks awful and makes it look like you have ice cream cones under your shirt . I can not comment on comfort or feel because I only had it on for a few seconds . It looks so ridiculous , I do n't care if its comfortable . Do not buy this unless you try it on and like the 1940s pointy look . Sorry Playtex , but I 'll keep my boobs round .
 Be aware , in larger cup sizes , there is no support and a definite undesirable uni-boob effect . Not recommended for larger bust sizes . .
 The product I received is NOTHING like the one advertised ! It is n't the same color , shape or style , and I SINCERELY doubt it is the same brand as advertised . What I received is a very cheap , unflattering , too tight piece of junk . It looks NOTHING like the images . It shapes your breasts into very strange cone-shapes with a ridiculous seam right to the ` point ' . It 's so uncomfortable -LRB- the cut and the material are awful -RRB- . BE CAREFUL IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THIS ITEM .
 We were skiing on a warmer day , and my body heat fogged the lenses up in a matter of seconds .
 I bought this pair of jeans for working in . They are not very tough/strong . I already have one hole . And the weave is coming out fast . I will get it patched , but I wo n't be buying anymore carhartt jeans . Seeing that this was the first carhartt item I have ever bought I also doubt I will buy anything else carhartt 's .
 I do n't think that it is too much to expect one year 's service out of a set of work dungarees , but apparently I 'm wrong . I carry tools around all day at work in the tool pockets . And two out of the four pairs I bought in July have worn through the tool pockets already . Carhartt could do with a better quality denim for work dungarees .
 I ordered the exact same product a year ago and they fit great . This time they are too long and tight across the top 's of my legs . You wonder how a product could change ; did the sweat factory person have a bad day ; was she or he new at the job ; I mean how can you mis-cut or screw up a pair of Carhartt 's ... I am going to keep them and allow the local Vocational School -LRB- Tailoring Program -RRB- fix them to fit . My bad ! You really need to try stuff on before purchasing . It is just disappointing that crap changes for no reason .
 I was n't at all expecting cargo jeans when I opened the package , which I strongly dislike as does my husband .
 way to big ... i ordered ' 32x28 ' ... which is a hard to find size ... they fit bigger than most ' 32x30 ' jeans ! ... bummer ... gave them to salvation army , not even worth returninglame >

 The front seams on these pants are scratchy , especially on the knees . The seams do n't drape well , so the pants hang funny . I returned them . I have other Under Armour pants that fit well and feel great -- but these definitely did n't . The Gear Tech fabric keeps you cool , washes and hangs dry in a few hours -- so I give the product two stars for the quality of the material .
 While this item is comfortable , it is in no way body shaping ! First of all it 's too short so if you are looking for some tummy control look somewhere else ! You could barely tuck this into your pants and if you do it will just come out if you sit or move too much . The fabric is the same as a bathing suit but without the tightness or thickness , it is very thin . I 'm 135lbs but after 3 children -LRB- 3 c-sections -RRB- I was looking for some tummy control without having to wear a giant pair of panties that go half way up your body and then roll down while you are wearing them -LRB- not to mention having big panty lines ! -RRB- If you are looking at this as a support bra , forget it , the fabric is too thin and flexible to lift or support anything.In my opinion if you have a great body , much like the models and want a comfortable tank to wear under clothes or around the house and do n't mind your tummy hanging out , then this is for you . People will think you are wearing a bathing suit top though -LRB- with no bra liner -RRB- .
 This cami is just like any cami you would wear with any outfit . I would not categorize this as shape wear ... Not to mention that it is pretty short in length .
 After all the hype on tv shows about this cami and other products that help prevent the fat from hanging out too far , I am very DISAPPOINTED . I purchased the L and can only guess that I have too much to control ! It also does not offer much support and in the heat , it 's too much to wear between a bra and a blouse .
 I bought the raincoat for unexpected rainy weather . The size advertised was 2 sizes below expectation , and I had to return it . The replacement had a missing button , and a terrible design and fit . I had to cut it to make it fit . And it weighs a ton . It is probably suited for someone needing a firemans uniform or some place where they have daily huricanes .
 I liked this bag until the inside pocket opposite the shoe compartment ripped . Now everything I put in this pocket -LRB- keys , phone , ring etc -RRB- ends up floating around the inside of the bag . the shoe compartment is great ... and the bag is the right size but the torn pocket now makes it unusable . It worked for a about 6 months before it gave out .
 When it was time for a new gym bag , I went for the Ogio Crunch.It was a deal at $ 25.00 and I 've had a few Ogio bags in the past -LRB- laptop bag and suitcase -RRB- that are great.This bag was a bit of a let down from the begining.I purchased this bag as a gym bag.My last gym bag has alot of inner compartments for shampoo , soap etc as well as a hook to hang a lock from.This bags side pocket has nothing of the sort.The `` shoe compartment '' takes up most of the main compartment once you put shoes in it.The final straw was a few days ago when the stiching on the shoulder strap came undone and it fell off my shoulder.This happened less that 45 days after purchase.Luckily , I was within the return period with Amazon.The bag is on it 's way back and my refund is being processed .
 The bag looks exactly like it does in the picture , but the provided dimensions are not accurate . The bag is more like 18 inches rather than the advertised 24 in length .
 IMO , Ogio makes a pretty nice gym bag but with two of the bags I have purchased and am returning they are smaller than expected . The Crunch is advertised at 13 x 24 x 12 but that is only when the bag is fully stretched , and I mean stretched . I go to the gym each day and shower there before work , needing the gym bag to hold all of my stuff until I return home . The Crunch will not hold my wet gym clothes and towel , sneakers , shaving bag , shower shoes and sweatshirt.Also , the side pocket of the bag does not have much depth at all nor does it have separate compartments . The material looks as if a set of keys would cut right through it , particularly when stretched . A couple of other reviewers have complained about this pocket ripping on other models.Otherwise , it has well made double zippers on all openings but the side pocket and the strap is well padded and the hardware is good quality . As stated I do have a concern with the durability of the side pocket and would like to see a more reinforced bag bottom.I have asked Ogio to add more product images on their website , showing different views of their bags along with interior shots of the pockets.I 'm sure this bag will be fine for anyone who is going to toss a couple of items in there and not pack it to capacity.Vito
 I previously owned an Ogio Transfer bag purchased from the same vendor . I work in the travel industry and found that particular bag to be way too big and so I would find myself over-packing and getting weighted down . So I bought this as it was smaller , still expecting the same quality . Well first when I opened the package I was disappointed as the color was not correct , but I 'm not really picky so I kept it . The zipper on the seldom used front pocket is starting to get caught up and snag after just two months of use . The overall quality is lower than the previous Ogio bag , I do n't know if they changed manufacturers or what ? If you need a small travel bag , find another . If you can live with a bit larger bag forr the money , get the Ogio Transfer you 'll be glad you did .
 I got this after reading good reviews and wish I had n't . The bag is too big , which makes it awkward to carry around . I do n't need this much room in a gym bag , it 's hard to carry it on the streets and in the subway . I will stick with my canvas bag .
 This bag looks nice but has very few features it is nothing like the Ogio bag I 've had for years the shoe sleeve makes the inside cramped
 This was a nice looking bag when I took it out of the plastic but wow did it smell . it smelled like oil or gasoline . What are they making these bags out of anyway ??? I would never buy another bag from this company.Dont waste you money
 I bought this to hold some photo equipment , including some small light stands that are 21 '' long but they do n't fit . The description says the bag is 24 '' -LRB- as does the manufacturer 's tag that was attached when I got the bag -RRB- but it 's only about 19 1/2 '' long -LRB- exterior dimension using a measuring tape -RRB- . I see now there 's another review that mentions that it 's not 24 '' but I missed it before buying mine.It seems like a really nice bag with some good features and would have been perfect for my needs if it was just a little bit longer .
 Bag is a piece of junk , save your money , was working ok for my needs but out of nowhere 2 months into owning seems starting falling apart . Save your money and buy something else .
 I purchased this bag 3 months ago.The size of the bag is perfect for gym lockers . Side pockets are nicely designed for shoes and a shaving kit.The inside cover started to show signs of wear and tear in the 2nd month.The shoulder strap is connected to the bag by a metal latch . The metal latch has caused the nylon to rip . this results in the shoulder strap becoming disconnected from the bag as I walk down the street.Zippers are not as smooth as they were 3 months ago and are already showing signs of wear and tear . A quality gym bag should last at min 12 months . I am rather disappointed that I will be shopping for a new gym bag so soon .
 The bag looks good . It has enough compartments that you would probably need for every day work out . The biggest problem i see with the bag is the bag does keep the shape .
 I purchased this about 5 weeks ago and have been using it ever since . The bag itself has no body or form , including he bottom . When the bag is empty and on top of a table you have to support the sides and top just to fill it . My old bag had some rigidly to it so that when empty it filled up easy.Putting sweaty gym clothes in this bag is like putting a wet watermelon in a tight fitting plastic bag , very difficult . The bag itself is a great color with lots of compartments but it is otherwise useless . I tried to return it tonight but found out I was past my 30 day mark , which is my fault . So I 'm stuck with it for a while until it pisses me off enough that I purchase another one . Do n't buy this bag , there are plenty of good ones out there .
 Bag is nice size but smells so bad of gasoline or petroleum . That smell permeates clothing and you can smell it when the bag is in the car . Its horrible .
 When I first received this gym bag , I was so excited . Until I opened it up and the smell of gasoline nearly knocked me out . I decided to use it anyway that day and it worked fine . However , the bag still reeked of gasoline so much , that I wrote to the company for suggestions . Waiting to hear back from them , I sealed the bag up with a box of baking soda in a Ziploc bag to get the smell out . That did not work and neither did trying to air it out -LRB- as they had suggested -RRB- . Since neither worked , I am sending it back and they want to charge me a re-stocking fee for returning it . Wait , so you want to charge me a re-stocking fee for something that smells like an oil spill ? This does not seem right .
 This is way smaller then i was expecting it to be , and cheaply made . Probably works well for people who do not use it ofter , but not god for everyday use
 this top was horribly wrong sized . it was very square and big ... i havent worn it once and was very disappointed .
 the material is super cheap , you can see through the skirt part of the dress , the sleeves are way too short and the came only comes to mid back . i ended up making my own costume and it was a lot cheaper
 The dress had a huge rip in it . I did return the dress and was given a credit promptly .
 If this is supposed to go with the sexy women 's costumes that are so popular these days , why is is 3 inches shorter than the hemline of the already-short costumes ? I had to wear the thing wayyyyy down on my hips to make it accentuate the skirt of my Marie Antoinette costume . Plus , if I adjusted it at all , it tore . I was very disappointed with this purchase .
 I bought it thinking red one was just red , but it has a kind of a white ? trim , so instead of elegant it looks suitable for a gipsy costume .
 I 'm very disappointed because of size . I ordered size `` M '' . It seems that tag is incorrectly attached . I 's obviously `` L '' or even `` XL '' size.Was not expecting such stupid mistake from Outer Banks.Quality is good and color , but size ...
 I purchased those Dri-power performance crew sock 12 pair package at costco . To my surprise , it was the worst socks I ever purchased . The sock 's fiber on bottom of sock come off completely after 4 washes . It was extremely hot after you put it on and walk for a while and disintegratd after a few washes . I wo n't consider to buy this Russell product unless it is for one time use only .
 Beware of this product . The ones I got have excess material around the toes that wrinkles and makes you feel like there is foreign material in your shoes . Know the feeling ?! It does n't rate even one star but Amazon does n't give you a no star option . I will never buy the brand again .
 While the socks fit fine and are otherwise comfortable , they do NOT keep your feet dry . My feet become and stay more sweaty in these socks than in my previous Champion basic crew socks . I 'm currently at work with my shoes off to try and keep my feet dried out.In short , `` dri-power '' does not work .
 Have been using this product for over 15 years . I was shocked and disappointed with my recent purchase . The fabric quality is not the same . It is like buying used socks -- wash worn . And , every sock is now marked with a blue `` R '' on top of the toe . Wearing them without shoes covering the letter marking gets the same question . `` Could n't you afford a left sock . '' Tried bleaching out the `` R '' , but no luck . I 'm looking for a different brand . Or , maybe I will find the NEW/LEFT sock .
 I purchased 5 packs of these because the composition of 88 % acrylic 11 % nylon and 1 % lycra spandex was the formula of the Russell 12pr packs sold at Costco for so many years . Having recently purchased a pack from Costco -LRB- which by the way cost around $ 14 . for the same socks -RRB- , I discovered that the formula had changed to 86 % acrylic 11 % nylon and 3 % other fibers-the socks were bigger , thinner and nowhere near the quality of the old formula ... Anyway , when my order from Amazon arrived , imagine my dismay when they turned out to be the same new , poor quality socks as currently sold by Costco . I am waiting to return them ... If I wanted more of these not so great socks , I 'd buy them at Costco for half the price !
 These are NOT THE SAME QUALITY AS IN 2008 ! I purchased 24 pairs of these socks in 2008 . They were very soft , thick , strong , extremely comfortable & very long lasting . Made being on your feet all day a lot easier to take . I recently purchased another 24 pair and there is NO comparison . The portion above your ankles is reasonably thick & soft . The important part below the ankle is rough & thin . I 'm going to keep them because they are still better than other athletic socks but I sure am disappointed . Russell added their logo but ruined the quality IMHO . Figures !
 I have purchased these socks for years . I just purchased 2 packs of these socks . I discovered that the sock had changed . The socks now are bigger , thinner and have a rough toe seam that is irritating when wearing I am returning them . I hope they change back to the old sock in the future . I tried to contact the company to let them know my thoughts but there is no contact number on their website .
 I too am very disappointed with the change made in the composition of these socks . I 'll be looking for a new sock to wear . I 've worn these for about 15 years and the new socks -LRB- with the `` R '' on the toe -RRB- suck in comparison.If you wish to contact the manufacturer , here 's the number : -LRB-800-RRB-334-9091 Candice was the person who you can speak to about the new formulation of the socks .
 There are good Russel socks . These are not them . The shipping charge is a rip off , and the socks are cheap ass . And they sent me two orders by mistake . $ 70.00 for a bunch of bad socks . thanks .
 This is not a kit . It is only a wig and the wig does n't even look like a George Washington wig .
 My son needed this for school . My son is 8 years old and the wig was a little too small . He wore it anyway and it was good enough for what he needed it for . I gave two stars because of size . The wig was fine otherwise .
 Junk , spend another few dollars for better wig ... frilly scarf was not frilly at all . Even for a 10 min class project , this was n't good enough quality.jen
 once again i fell for it ... i bought them , wore them , washed them in cold water and hung them out to dry and `` should '' have tried to get the cat to wear them after washing ... they 're cute ... and VERY VERY TINY ...
 Dickies - Girls ' Flat Front Pantsi found the same pants at walmart.com for $ 12 each . Why would i pay more in amazon.com ?
 The first thing I noticed was the frayed edges on the lace that were unraveling right out of the package . The hose are indeed quite thin and while I managed not to put a run in them , I ca n't imagine they would last anywhere near a good pair of L'Eggs . They were a bit hard to get on -LRB- imagine putting on your garters with your hose together , good luck getting it straight the first time ... ! -RRB- but , you get used to it . What I would never get used to is that once I sat down to dinner and then stood back up , the garter was now riding halfway down my butt ! The host themselves were now down near my knees , with the lace tops well below where a mid-thigh skirt would hit . Nope , these are going in the trash .
 These ripped as soon as i put the on . I bought a size up , which i thought would keep that from happening so soon ... but nope !!! these ripped at almost every seam and there was a run in them within 10 minutes of putting them on . Also , they are a bit too stretchy which caused them to slip down my legs . Unless you plan to only wear them around the house , I would n't recommend these at all . I am very disappointed .
 The first time I tried putting on the stockings they ripped . It is a great idea but I had to go back to my panty hose for the evening .
 These are poorly made , cheap stockings . I got a run in the stocking the first time I put them on . And the belt twists up while you wear them . Do n't waste your money .
 was not happy w this bra . the inside of the cup did have a seam and it was not comfotable .
 I wore it once and never wore it again . It makes my `` girls '' look pokey and weird . And it was a bit small .
 Disappointing ! This t-shirt shrank about five -LRB- ! -RRB- inches in the length even though I followed laundering directions on the label .
 I am very disappointed in the T-Shirt that I received . Not only does it have small flaws but it is NOT the T-Shirt that is pictured on the web site . I will NOT be ordering anything else from this vendor .
 We have purchased Russell Athletic tshirts in the past and they were very true to size . My husband is 6 ' 6 '' and this `` tall '' size is at least 4 '' -6 '' short in the length compared to Reebok , Nautica and Cutter & Buck . Such a disappointment . I even washed them in cold water . I will say that the quality of the material of the shirt is good but does me no good if he wo n't wear them . Will NEVER buy these again !
 I bought these shirts because i have a hard time finding good shirts for tall people -LRB- 6 ' 3 '' 270lbs -RRB- . These shirts all shrank up in just a couple of washed the carhartt tall shirts have been far superior to these and so I will not be buying any more of these shirts .
 The packaging had dead insects in it , and in one of the 3 shirts there was a hole in it , near the collar . Whether it was a sewing mistake or insect munching , I do n't know .
 At first I was thrilled that I finally found a 2XT Tee Shirt that was actually cut for a tall person and not a fatty.The material also had a nice thickness to it , which has become a problem with many garments of late.After some inspection , I realized that the construction of one of the shirts was so far off that I had to go back to see if I ordered a blemish or factory second.If you pay $ 30.00 -LRB- with shipping -RRB- for a Tee Shirt , you should n't expect such an awful job . One of the side seams is fine , but the other starts at the armpit and then takes a sharp turn , ending close to the middle of the back . Not only does this look ridiculous , but I feel the pulling from this terribly made shirt.The packaging said that this shirt was made in Pakistan , which might be the reason for this reject of a shirt.Shirt companies were having shirts made in Mexico and Honduras , which was a slight decline from what is made in the US , but this is just unacceptable.What is next , $ 40.00 for a Tee Shirt made in Madagascar ?????
 I ordered 3 of these and they were not only on the small side , they also had significant size differences between supposedly equal sized shirts ... Someone slip some irregulars into this batch ?
 I order 2 extra long shirts to try . I ordered 1 red 1 grey . When the package came the first thing noticed was the red shirt was in a smaller bag size than the grey shirt . Upon opening , the grey shirt had cardboard that the sirt was wrapped around . The red shirt had no cardboard that the shirt was wrapped around . The grey shirt had no size tag on the back of the neck for the size just a stamp and made in Pakistan . The red shirt had tag with the size Russel brand and made in Pakistan . I put the grey shirt on , it on and it was very good in size and length . Loose fitting all around and nice and log . I then tried the red shirt , it was tight fitting , almost choking me around the neck and clearly shorter in length than the grey shirt that came in the same package . I placed both out on the bed and the red shirt was around 2 inches shorter in width 3 inches shorter in length and the neckline was an inch shorter and the sleeves were not as wide.Maybe they shipped me a returned shirt that was washed and shrunk ? Who knows but a 2XT with 2 different packaging , tags and sizes is not acceptable quality imho . I will be returning both shirts .
 Quality not very good . My expectations for a Russell Athletic product were not met . To me , the material was of a very low grade .
 this shirt started out at 34 '' length after wash and dried on low heat it was 32 '' inches long so cant where it which is bad new because it cost a lot more than the others i bought of other brands , i would recommend no one over 6.0 to 6.2 buy this i am 6.7 and it is way to short unless you like showing you back off and if that 's the case save the money and do n't wear a shirt
 For years I have loved Russell Athletic products -LRB- I have one shirt that I have worn at least 500 times and it still looks new -RRB- , but then my local Academy stopped carrying them . Although I prefer to buy locally , I had no choice and so ordered from Amazon . One of the shirts I bought came out of its third laundry cycle with the sleeve seams split in several places . Not what I had expected !
 The first time my son wore this shirt the length was great , as soon as I washed and dried -LRB- on low -RRB- the shirt shrunk . Do not wash , this shirt will shrink drastically . At least 3 inches .
 Dickies - Girls ' Flat Front Pantsi found the same pants at walmart.com for $ 12 each . Why would i pay more in amazon.com ?
 These pants were way too big -LRB- looked about 2 sizes larger -RRB- , and they were incredibly stiff . They would have been very uncomfortable for my daughter to wear all day .

 I love toeless hosiery , but these are the most uncomfortable pantyhose I have ever worn . If I 'm sitting down at all the backs of my thighs start to itch so horribly , and it gets worse when I stand . These are awful , I ca n't stand it . The only good things I can say are unlike some toeless pantyhose I have worn in the past , the toe thong does not bind , and the lightest color actually is light enough for my skin tone , but it is so not worth the itching . Also , they run rather large , the material does n't have nearly enough stretch and they bag around the ankles and knees . I 'm only 5 feet tall but out over 120 lbs . and the smallest size is still too big . I 'll give Hue 's a try and I might even spring for the Donna Karan toeless panythose , but I wo n't get these ones again .
 These hose are rough and thick , and while that probably prevents them from running so easily , it does not make them feel sexy or smooth.They also make a lot of noise when you walk if your thighs rub against eachother . Also not sexy.They 'll do , but I 'm really hoping the other pair of hose I ordered comes in before I have to leave for the wedding that I bought these for .
 The binding is too tight . I have a wide toe box . The moment the hose went on all the way , my toes started changing color . I thought that they might just need to stretch a bit , so I 've been wearing them for the past half hour . Now , my toes are swollen . The strappy bit that wraps around the toes is too thick , too , to effectively be worn with a reasonable variety of sandals . I bought them to try with my wedding shoes , but they clearly wo n't work on any level . Will try Hue first , then DKNY . Hoping that something affordable works out ASAP .
 The color is a little dark for nude . The fabric is awful , there is no stretch . They remind me of old stalkings before the advent of lycra . I already ordered a different pair from another company because I ca n't rely on these for the even I ordered them for .
 The idea of this socks if very nice , I order 3 pcs , the material was not as expected . almonst nylon !! the control top was very tight . . i did not use them , i sold them !!!
 I did not get what I wanted . I needed Utopia in size 3 and I was so confident that was what I selected . Instead I got Nude in size 2 . I am so disappointed But I wo n't send them back . I ca n't bother ! The occasion for which I needed them has passed anyway . I gave 2 stars , not because the product is poor , but because they are of no use to me !
 i ordered 3 different brands of these stockings and although they do feel quite terrible , the nude shade is very close to my skin tone . i made the mistake of buying open toe sandals for a dressy affair and my legs are just too white . i think i 'll just bear the pain for a few hours.i would stress though you have to buy a size bigger . i 'm 5 ' 5 , 115 lbs . and the c/d or = sz 3 are perfect.p.s . i 'm not `` Jim '' reviewing .
 The quality is very poor , not worth the money . Ripped and stretched out after one use . already in the garbage .
 These hose are horrible . They run easily and are extremely uncomfortable . Great idea but horrible execution .
 Seemed like nice nylons but provided no support so I was unable to wear them . The price was good but I am unable to comment onthe longevity of the item as their extreme looseness made them unwearable as support stockings .
 I got the size A , and this size was too big for me . I wore these stocking when I was 7 months pregnant , at that time I was about 120 pounds , I 'm 5 ' 2 '' -LRB- my pre-pregnancy weight is 100 lbs -RRB- . The stocking were loose especially around the ankles and I got a runt in it after wearing it just once . The part that goes over my belly fit just fine . For the cost , I just do n't see that these stockings are worth it . I would not recommend these hose .
 These were great out of the package -- very thick , well designed , and extremely warm . However , after just two month 's wear and washing -LRB- in accordance with the directions of course - turned inside out , cold water , delicate cycle -RRB- , both the top and the bottom are pilled like crazy , especially along the seams which are , to my distress , starting to unravel.Pilling I 'm okay with , but total seam failure I 'm definitely not . Since these only come with a 30 day manufacturer 's warranty , I was stuck at 60 days with no recourse and a pair of wool wear that probably only has another month 's lifespan . I expect a $ 140 baselayer set to last more than a couple of months . This is the last time I 'm ever buying `` Made in China '' apparel.Perhaps the set I purchased was somehow a fluke , since other reviewers here are satisfied , but I wanted to share my experience in the interest of helping other shoppers .
 I 'm very disappointed because of size . I ordered size `` M '' . It seems that tag is incorrectly attached . I 's obviously `` L '' or even `` XL '' size.Was not expecting such stupid mistake from Outer Banks.Quality is good and color , but size ...
 The shorts I bought came way over my belly button . Made me look like a funky old man . I returned them . Otherwise the sizing was good .
 This is a very styling money clip , however , it is not like a big paper clip . It opens like a butterfly , then closes together with the strenght of the magnets . It feels that your money and other cards might fall off . I 'm not sure if the magnet could wipe of your credit card information .
 was not happy w this bra . the inside of the cup did have a seam and it was not comfotable .
 I wore it once and never wore it again . It makes my `` girls '' look pokey and weird . And it was a bit small .
 I was not pleased at all with the quality , fit or design of the slip . It looked very cheap and did n't hang well . I 've never worn it . Maybe I can use it for a craft project .
 The Bra squeaked loudly until after multiple washings . Now the wire has poked through and I can no longer wear it , after only several months . I would like to return .
 Waiting patiently for a response led to frustration . Assuming the product details were correct , I placed the order -LRB- THE TITLE DID SAY CAPTAIN AMERICA SHIELD COSTUME !! -RRB- I received the package today and was horribly disappointed to find no muscle costume , no hood , and a shield that was made out of the same plastic as a party cup ! It is not suitable for children of ANY age . I am still waiting on a response !! Not a trusted seller and the whole description was a complete lie . Not appreciated . Especially 4 days before Christmas !!
 Even the sales information says for `` Ages 7 - 11 . '' The film is rated PG-13 . Does n't anyone else think this is inappropriate for toy companies to market toys to children based on movies they are too young to watch ? Proof the toy companies care MUCH more about their profits than the well being of their customers , our children .
 it was fun for about two minutes and is easily breakable . my 3 year old likes to play super hero but this shield was very flimsy . tried to mend cracks with duct tape but did not help much . Walmart and Toys R Us carry a frisbee like shield a bit smaller but very durable and is the one all the children play with .
 product information detailed a costume with a muscle body and hood , but all I got was a cheap plastic shield ... got no muscle body or hood or anything else . I can buy the same cheap shield at my local store for 8.00 dollars and no need to wait a week to get it . other reviewers made comments about getting a costume with this order ... that 's why I placed the order myself . very disappointed .
 My 4 year old likes anything super hero . He had a captain america shield that a neighbor took home and moved the next day . So the search was on . I found this shield , read the reviews , and ordered . I did notice reviews saying it broke , but I assumed it was a defective shipment or something since other reviewers talked about their sons `` throwing it '' and `` it was tough and did n't break . '' My son was thrilled when it came . He did throw it , on the grass , imitating the super hero . However , just two hours later , his cousin bumped the shield out of my son 's hands and it fell 2-3 feet to the ground and BROKE ! A 2 foot drop onto a black top should n't have broke it , but it did . I returned it and got my money back . Luckily , I went to Target a few days later and lucked out , finding a thick plastic `` Captain America '' shield . It was $ 9.99 , if you have a target red-card you get 5 % off and free shipping . The difference between these two products is night and day . This item on Amazon is a thin , brittle plastic . The Target one is 6 times thicker , about the thickness of a good frisbee . And the Target one states on the package `` throw it and it flies ! '' Please do n't waste your money on this , and avoid the look of disappointment in your little super hero 's eyes when it falls apart in their hands .
 Bought this for my son for Christmas . It 's the one and only thing he has asked for over and over for Christmas this year , but we are going to return it immediately . It looks cheap and feels cheap - it 's so flimsy it 'll likely break the first time he drops it on the ground .
 I ordered this to go with my son 's Halloween costume . I went for the cheaper version and that is exactly what I got . It cracked within 5 minutes . I should have purchased the more durable version , so he could get more play time out of it playing in his costume after Halloween .
 I bought this for my 4 year old - who LOVED it - but the thin brittle plastic it 's made of cracked in less than two days of normal play . It should have been priced more like a $ 2 party favor than a $ 15 gift . Apparently not made with children playing in mind .
 I 'm so disappointed . And , now that we have to return it , so is my three year old son . The plastic is incredibly flimsy ; just about the same as a disposable plastic cup . It bends very easily and is better suited for a $ 3.00 party favor than a $ 17.00 costume accessory . The elastic loops on the back are very large ; too large for young kids ' arms . I have never been so disappointed in anything I have ordered online before . Really over-priced and cheaply made . I chose this particular shield because it was a little bit more money and I thought it would be a more durable product . It is the same one that others are selling for significantly less . Same poor quality shield , more money .
 I am extremely dissatisfied with this purchase . The fit of the shirt is absolutely horrible - Not proportioned at all . Also , this is not a true spread collar shirt . It 's more like a pinpoint collar shirt . The shirt fits like a garbage bag with sleeves .
 I wear suits shirts and ties 5 days a week . I have over 50 dress shirts in my closet . I like to keep a plain white shirt at the office in case of emergency spills . I ordered this shirt not expecting much and I got even less . First the fabric is sooo thin , it 's listed as a cotton blend but it 's 55 poly 45 cotton ... that sounds more like a poly blend to me . Next the fitment is horrible . I have an 18 inch neck but I often have to order a 18.5 or 19 to fit my 50 inch chest . I ordered a 19 on this shirt and it was SOOOO tight . The sleeves were short and if I decided the roll them for use with french cuffs the sleeve would END at my forearm . The shirt was made in China and clearly meant to fit a petite Chinese boy.Stay away from this shirt , go to a Van Husein outlet and your money will be better spent .
 was not happy w this bra . the inside of the cup did have a seam and it was not comfotable .
 I wore it once and never wore it again . It makes my `` girls '' look pokey and weird . And it was a bit small .
 Wow ! This is the coolest yamaka I never ordered . I would have liked it better if it would have covered the tops of the ears , but it does n't . This is actually more akin to a sailors cap . Returned ...
 I do n't recommend this hat unless it 's for your kids . Even with the adjustable strap it 's way too small for large head size .
 This is so strange and a first experience of this type . I ordered 2 of these and both emit a horrible burnt smell . I washed and line dried and the smell is still there . I have washed many many times now and still the smell persists and is no weaker . It is so strong that my clothes absorb it . I have never used the dryer for them and I wash in cold water . I guess I will have to throw them away .
 Playtex Women 's 18 Hour Original Comfort Strap Bra # 4693This bra runs smaller than other Playtex products . I recommend ordering a size larger , including cup size .
 I wear a 34D -LRB- very hard to find -RRB- . I was really looking forward to a great fit and was sorely disappointed . The cups are incredibly pointy and larger than a D and there was absolutely no support on the sides . Will be returning .
 Usually , when you order from a specific line -LRB- Playtex 18-hour for instance -RRB- , when you find a bra that fits , you know that any bra in that line will have the same fit.Not in this case ; and that is frustrating.Ordered my uaual size in this brand , but this style -LRB- 20/27 -RRB- fit nothing like other bras in Playtex 18-hour line . Band fit a size smaller ; cup a size larger . Do n't know if bra was miss-sized , miss-identified , or what.Checked the return specifications . Way too complicated to bother with . Stuffed it back in the box and will hold it for next charity clothing drive .
 was not happy w this bra . the inside of the cup did have a seam and it was not comfotable .
 I wore it once and never wore it again . It makes my `` girls '' look pokey and weird . And it was a bit small .
 Any slouch socks I have ever purchased were very loose on the cuff part - allowing you to push them down to the desired height . These socks were nothing more than crew socks and there was just no length or width to push them down at all . I will never purchase them again .
 because of the thick straps they have very limited tightening . Because of this the straps are too loose and it was uncomfortable .
 I order 2 extra long shirts to try . I ordered 1 red 1 grey . When the package came the first thing noticed was the red shirt was in a smaller bag size than the grey shirt . Upon opening , the grey shirt had cardboard that the sirt was wrapped around . The red shirt had no cardboard that the shirt was wrapped around . The grey shirt had no size tag on the back of the neck for the size just a stamp and made in Pakistan . The red shirt had tag with the size Russel brand and made in Pakistan . I put the grey shirt on , it on and it was very good in size and length . Loose fitting all around and nice and log . I then tried the red shirt , it was tight fitting , almost choking me around the neck and clearly shorter in length than the grey shirt that came in the same package . I placed both out on the bed and the red shirt was around 2 inches shorter in width 3 inches shorter in length and the neckline was an inch shorter and the sleeves were not as wide.Maybe they shipped me a returned shirt that was washed and shrunk ? Who knows but a 2XT with 2 different packaging , tags and sizes is not acceptable quality imho . I will be returning both shirts .

 The packaging had dead insects in it , and in one of the 3 shirts there was a hole in it , near the collar . Whether it was a sewing mistake or insect munching , I do n't know .
 At first I was thrilled that I finally found a 2XT Tee Shirt that was actually cut for a tall person and not a fatty.The material also had a nice thickness to it , which has become a problem with many garments of late.After some inspection , I realized that the construction of one of the shirts was so far off that I had to go back to see if I ordered a blemish or factory second.If you pay $ 30.00 -LRB- with shipping -RRB- for a Tee Shirt , you should n't expect such an awful job . One of the side seams is fine , but the other starts at the armpit and then takes a sharp turn , ending close to the middle of the back . Not only does this look ridiculous , but I feel the pulling from this terribly made shirt.The packaging said that this shirt was made in Pakistan , which might be the reason for this reject of a shirt.Shirt companies were having shirts made in Mexico and Honduras , which was a slight decline from what is made in the US , but this is just unacceptable.What is next , $ 40.00 for a Tee Shirt made in Madagascar ?????
 I ordered 3 of these and they were not only on the small side , they also had significant size differences between supposedly equal sized shirts ... Someone slip some irregulars into this batch ?
 I am very disappointed in the T-Shirt that I received . Not only does it have small flaws but it is NOT the T-Shirt that is pictured on the web site . I will NOT be ordering anything else from this vendor .
 We have purchased Russell Athletic tshirts in the past and they were very true to size . My husband is 6 ' 6 '' and this `` tall '' size is at least 4 '' -6 '' short in the length compared to Reebok , Nautica and Cutter & Buck . Such a disappointment . I even washed them in cold water . I will say that the quality of the material of the shirt is good but does me no good if he wo n't wear them . Will NEVER buy these again !
 I bought these shirts because i have a hard time finding good shirts for tall people -LRB- 6 ' 3 '' 270lbs -RRB- . These shirts all shrank up in just a couple of washed the carhartt tall shirts have been far superior to these and so I will not be buying any more of these shirts .
 Disappointing ! This t-shirt shrank about five -LRB- ! -RRB- inches in the length even though I followed laundering directions on the label .
 This hat is so horrible , I am so disappointed ! It is SO heavy weight , that you ca n't even hardly alter its shape . It is thicker than a wool blanket , I 'd send it back if I could , but it 's too much trouble/complicated !!! UGH !
 I agree , these are cut small ... Buy an inch or two larger than you normally do . The waist band does NOT stretch .
 I got the shippment quickly . But wrong items was sent . I have to return it to the seller . I got the refund pretty quick , but only for the value of product . I spent about & 10 for two way shipping without geting anything .
 Did not like the pants at all , and threw them in the trash rather than pay return postage . Flimsy , smelled of dye , cheap fabric , etc. . Too bad .
 Merchant was out of stock on the second pair of pants , so when it was shipped I was charged $ 9 again when the second pair was in stock weeks later.Will not buy from Amazon vendors again .
 If you search for Super Saver shipping this advertisement comes up , but this product is not shipped by Amazon is does not go out with the Super Saver shipping , and the cost of shipping is nearly 20 % the cost of the pants .
 I have bought dockers for years but these are cut smaller than they usually are . Even with the `` stretch '' waist band they are tight . So much for an `` extra '' inch . Beware . Try these in a store before you buy .
 I DID NOT GET THE SLACK THAT HAD THE WAISTBAND . I GOT SLACK WITH NO WAISTBAND , SO I SEND THEM BACK AN WAS TRYING TO GE A 42 29 BUT I RECEIVED A E MAIL STATETING THAT THE PRODUCT WAS NO LONGER AVABILITY . SO FAR I ` AM NOT SURE WERE MY REFUND WENT . PLEASE LET ME KNOW.TOM ATKINSON
 I have worn these pants for years ; my size is the same as always . I could n't get them on ; they were so tight I could n't get the button buttoned around the waist . What is going on ? These pants seemed to be cut for a skinny 25 year old , not someone who is a little on the hefty side . Further , the shipping and handling charges are just out of sight ... $ 16.95 above and beyond the already rather pricy product . I would not recommend doing business with this seller at all . You can go to other outlets and get the same thing without the shipping and handling , and there are `` deals '' out there from major store chains . I was really disappointed in this product and the seller . Go to WalMart and get their khakis ; they are very inexpensive and wear like iron .
 Dockers are Dockers , so that 's not the problem . Just be sure you do n't trust the images if you choose to buy these via Amazon . `` Cafe , '' for example , should be `` Coffee . '' Despite the fact that the image for `` Cafe '' shows a stone or very light gray color , `` Cafe '' is actually dark brown . So the product is n't defective , but IS misleading
 I bought Uvex Shooter Sport sunglasses two months ago . Within one month the plasic frame broke but was still usable - just now , it broke for good . Save $ 40 , do n't make the same mistake .
 I was not pleased at all with the quality , fit or design of the slip . It looked very cheap and did n't hang well . I 've never worn it . Maybe I can use it for a craft project .

 My husband loved the look and workmanship of this messenger bag but we ended up returning it due to a serious size issue . We liked the nylon material for all weather durability and although the dimensions were exactly as described , the main zippered compartment does not run the length of the bag and can not fit a letter sized folder without serious bending and twisting . This messenger bag looks good but is not really functional . You will need to go at least the next size up for it to work . Also , the straps were uncomfortable to wear for any length of time . In our opinion , this messenger bag is not worth the money . We ended up purchasing a Coach messenger bag that cost a lot more but was worth it .
 Croch got holes in it first time . Poor quality I have a pair that is 3 years old that still have no holes .
 I used Danskin tights for 20 years & couldnt believe when they went out of business in Las Vegas , NV ! I purchased a few pair online for my GF & I. . . both of ours -LRB- different sizes -RRB- were ripped out of the box ! I still have a pair that I havent opened bcuz I believe they will be the same way ... very disappointing from such a reputable company !!!
 Too dark for light toast . I was looking for a color just a bit darker than nude . I will keep looking . Capezio seems to be a better choice .
 I guess I should have opened the package sooner , but when I opened the package of tights to put them on , I discovered a large run in the tights . Since I 'd purchased them over 30 days ago , I guess I 'm S.O.L. ...
 I wore these once , for less than 1/2 day , to my office for work , I sat down in my chair and got a run in them !!!! I thought the Danskin product would be much stronger than that!I am very disappointed with this product .
 Stay away from these , they are junk . Several pairs started falling apart after two months . Waste of money .
 The item shown is a clima-cool tank . You can see that on the back in the picture . The item sent , is not . It 's just a rough farbic tank . I have a red version of the clima-cool tank show in the picture and it 's a completely different fabric/feel .
 Very rough fabric . I do n't like it . My $ 16 Champion Running T , I bought from Target is much metter and softer.I rerurned this product to amazon anyway .

 I recently purchased this costume for a party . I ordered it over a week before the party around 4 pm on Friday Oct. 17 , the company is in California . It was supposed to take 3-5 business days to get to me , it did n't . It was rescheduled and arrived after my party which was Oct. 25 , it actually arrived on Oct. 27 . They explained to me when I asked why it took so long to ge to me , that I apparently ordered the costume after business hours . Now , I am on the east coast and it was 4pm here , making it 1pm in California . After hours ? That was my first bad experience . When I finally received it , it was too small , way too small . I ordered the right size and being a woman , I expected that it would run a little small , but this was at least 3 sizes smaller . I called to try to return it , before Halloween , and I was basically told that I was out of luck and now out $ 70 . It was now my responsiblity to find someone that would want to take that costume off my hands . Really ? Fantastic customer service . I would 've sent in a video review of my trying the costume on , but that is just offensive . Anyone want a costume ?
 I returned all 3 pair I ordered due to sizing - WAY TOO SMALL for the size I ordered !
 the hat is fine but size is not correct . the hat is too small and not the same size as advertised or labeled . will not buy from this supplier again and recommend against them
 piicture is misleading . The garment is very loose fitting . It is a thong , not a jockstrap . Sorry I bought it .

 I was n't at all expecting cargo jeans when I opened the package , which I strongly dislike as does my husband .
 way to big ... i ordered ' 32x28 ' ... which is a hard to find size ... they fit bigger than most ' 32x30 ' jeans ! ... bummer ... gave them to salvation army , not even worth returninglame >
 I do n't think that it is too much to expect one year 's service out of a set of work dungarees , but apparently I 'm wrong . I carry tools around all day at work in the tool pockets . And two out of the four pairs I bought in July have worn through the tool pockets already . Carhartt could do with a better quality denim for work dungarees .
 I ordered the exact same product a year ago and they fit great . This time they are too long and tight across the top 's of my legs . You wonder how a product could change ; did the sweat factory person have a bad day ; was she or he new at the job ; I mean how can you mis-cut or screw up a pair of Carhartt 's ... I am going to keep them and allow the local Vocational School -LRB- Tailoring Program -RRB- fix them to fit . My bad ! You really need to try stuff on before purchasing . It is just disappointing that crap changes for no reason .
 I bought this pair of jeans for working in . They are not very tough/strong . I already have one hole . And the weave is coming out fast . I will get it patched , but I wo n't be buying anymore carhartt jeans . Seeing that this was the first carhartt item I have ever bought I also doubt I will buy anything else carhartt 's .

 The hair on the wig is longer on the left than the right . The style is completely unrecognizable from the photo . Do n't buy it .
 I purchased this wig for a school play for my son . He was Danny in the play . Needless to say I was less than disappointed when the wig arrived . It is NOT anything like the picture but a black Shirley Temple wig . The front doo is not noticeable nor does it sweep the forehead as in the picture . The sideburns are undectable ! It was useless . When I attempted to return the other 3 wigs to Costume Craze , in package , untouched , UNWORN ! I was told they do not take returns on wigs . NOT STATED ON THEIR POLICY OR WITH REPS WHEN I ORDERED ... JUST OPPOSITE WAS TOLD TO ME WHEN I ORDERED ! Rep with Costume Craze was NASTY and actually accused me of lying when I stated that all three wigs had not been worn or touched ! School play was two weeks away and I even offered to send a program to show my validity ! Rep was NASTY and told me SOL ! When I accused them of selling misrepresented goods she stated they disclaim all their products MAY NOT LOOK LIKE THE PICTURE . Guess I am the fool who was trying to do something nice for my child 's school . I would not only NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT but NOT RECOMMEND COSTUME CRAZE . They DO NOT STAND BY THEIR PRODUCTS !!
 We got this wig along with the Sandy wig and they were both unfortunately a total mess to wear and try to work with . We ended up not wearing either of them . I really have to believe that the photos taken for the product photos are a totally different wig -LRB- or one that someone took 3 hours to style with epoxy -RRB- . When I put it on it looked like a giant afro . Of course I am not expecting a whole lot out of a cheap wig , but the photos of the product were definitely deceiving . Unfortunately you ca n't return wigs due to sanitary concerns . So Buyer Beware !
 ... they are not described entirely accurately here . The very fuzzy photo of the DKNY label above , if it were legible , would mention that the items on offer here are the CONTROL TOP version of the tights . -LRB- I do see it mentioned lower down , but not in the headline . -RRB- Personally , I find them to be not as comfortable , nor as opaque , nor as long-lasting , as the opaque non-control top version from DKNY . Otherwise , I would completely agree with the other reviewer who gave 5 stars for DKNY.Also , be aware that this seller charges shipping both ways , if you need to return items .
 The petite plus claims to fit a 4 ' 10 '' -5 ' 4 '' gal with a broad weight range of 155-210 pounds . Since I 'm 5 ' 1 '' and 168 , these should fit perfectly , right?Wrong.The control top part was ranging on the the dominatrix side of `` control . '' There is NO way any woman closer to the 200 range is going to be comfortable whatsoever in these . Also , the `` petite '' aspect also was n't all that successful either as I had plenty of fabric bunched at the crease of my thighs.You 're 0-2 there , DKNY . The only saving graces are that they are closer to being accurate in size than the Spanx brand since they I will be able to wear them and the fabric is otherwise comfortable .
 I was very disappointed that these tights ripped on the first wear . Literally went to work and home ... no shoe changes or anything . Too bad because they were perfectly soft and opaque : -LRB-

 I am unable to purchase the same style bras that I got last year and I 've tried looking at other web sites and department stores.I have tried 3 other styles which do not fit well , have cheap stretch straps or very uncomfortable material to edge straps and front which cause itching and redness from rubbing .
 This bra looks pretty but makes a total madonna cone look . It 's comfy , just not great looking . I love playtex bras but not this one . Also , the toffee color is actually peach , go figure . Makes a nice sleeping bra !
 I did not feel that these tights were truly opaque . They were reminiscent of pantyhose . Nice control , but not opaque .
 Shipped very quickly , but not at all opaque . These are completely sheer and SO thin ! I 'm really disappointed in these `` opaque '' tights !
 The quality of this wig was low . It had patches of baldness and the material of the `` hair '' was awful . There was even a spot of hair that seemed to be melted together . I will not buy here again .

 I never wear this top after having purchased it . The stripes have awkward stitches that irritate the skin touching them . The shirt itself hangs very awkwardly . I prefer fitted shirts for working out and this one kind of flares out at the waist on me and , therefore , is n't very flattering . I think I 've worn it once and will probably donate it soon . Generally , I have been pleased with Adidas products , but this shirt did not work for me personally .
 this is great idea . I bought 3 . This product is VERY Cheaply made and was ineffective in keeping tie in holder . I never used it and ended up returning them . DONT BUY

 This is based on the fact that I did not get what I ordered from Brands on Sale . It was a size smaller and came with no mask . AND I am still airing for a refund . Ca n't believe this company is allowed to sell on Amazon !!! Deplorable !

 While the shipping was speedy , the tights on the other hand were horrible . The fit was not true to size , the top band rests in an awkward and uncomfortable place and according to their return policy on the receipt they do not accept returns or exchanges on tights . Meaning I am stuck with a horrible pair of tights and out nearly $ 15 . If you do order these I would highly recommend getting at least one size bigger and ordering them through a different vendor that accepts exchanges in case you are unhappy with the product like I was .

 The Chantelle Bra was incorrectly sized ! The Bra was supposed to be a DDDD but instead I was sold an H or a Z cup ? Anyway the cup size on the bra was completely wrong and immensely huge ! One of my boobs was pointing east and the other to the west ! I do n't know about you but I like my tiots in the middle . Do not buy a bra from this seller it will end in great dissapointment and a total and complete ripoff !

 I ordered this and another umbrella from the same company . This one the 10 '' Eclipze has a horrible design and it arrived broken . The other Eclipze 15 '' is a great umbrella . Both have are the same size in the canopy but the 10 '' has shorter handle and it would be hard to open and shut - if it had worked properly . The 15 '' has an automatic open feature that is great . The shade it provides is wonderful and it takes the heat out of standing in the sun .
 I got these for my daughter as her swim yeam uniform . They are a terrible cut . They look really like old school gym shorts .
 I was looking for some gym shorts for my little girl . These said they were for children . The shorts were adult size . I was stuck with them as to ship them back would cost more that I paid for them . I threw them in the garbage .
 The way the products are linked together is misleading . All the sizes on the page make it very hard to tell what are the junior and what are the kids sizes . thought I was ordering one , got the other . Price and quality where great though . I would have spent more sending them back than I spent buying them . So I have 3 pair of worthless shorts now .
 Is this a joke or what ? These are n't an adult X-large they are a childs medium . It wo n't pay to send them back because of the shipping so I wasted $ 7.99 on a cleaning rag .
 I ordered 4 pairs of LARGE , and the shorts are way too small -- might fit a 10 year old !
 IT WAS MY MISTAKE . I DID N'T REALIZE THAT THIS ITEM WAS &#34; JUNIOR &#34; SO OF COURSE THEY DID N'T FIT . I DID N'T HAVE A PACKING ORDER SO I COULD N'T RETURN THEM . I 'LL FIND SOME SMALL PERSON TO GIVE THEM TO .

 The Chantelle Bra was incorrectly sized ! The Bra was supposed to be a DDDD but instead I was sold an H or a Z cup ? Anyway the cup size on the bra was completely wrong and immensely huge ! One of my boobs was pointing east and the other to the west ! I do n't know about you but I like my tiots in the middle . Do not buy a bra from this seller it will end in great dissapointment and a total and complete ripoff !
 Good idea , but the suctuion cups were defective making the item worthless . We sent it back .
 This travel laundry kit has been around for ages . I got one when I first traveled abroad a decade ago , and it turned out to be something of a nightmare . While seductive with its packets of Woolite , sink stopper , and clothesline , you 'll quickly notice that the suction cups on the clothesline rarely stick to a surface and can not support the considerable weight of wet hanging laundry.I 'd recommend instead purchasing such elements separately . TheFlexolinelaundry line has long been preferred by people traveling light , and it 's strong and stretchable enough for anything . Woolite packs can be bought on their own at greater number for less cost . The sink stopper , being a simple slab of rubber , can be had for pennies in a store near you . Avoid this kit .
 I returned all 3 pair I ordered due to sizing - WAY TOO SMALL for the size I ordered !

 It is not sheer pantyhose . Looks thick and color is not right as what I was thinking . Do n't like it very much .
 The pants that are shown are carpenter style . pants you get are not . very upsetting . seems like false advertising . will be returning them .
 The quality of the jeans is very poor . I 've bought these in stores and they were acceptable but the order I received had frayed material at the cuffs and other frayed spots on the jeans . They looked like they 'd be washed and worn for a couple of years when I received them . Definitely not buying more Lee jeans .
 I ordered these especially for my slightly chunky grandson . He has trouble finding jeans that fit and do n't &#34; squeeze &#34; his little 5-year old belly . The snap came apart with the first attempt to wear . when I looked at the snap , I could see the head of the snap was bent , as though the maker had done a poor job of situating the snap when adding it to the jeans . I have n't had time to contact Amazon about this , but I plan to return them for a replacement .
 The pants that are shown are carpenter style . Pants you get are not.I still Like the pants just wish they were carpenter style .
 I bought this pair of jeans for working in . They are not very tough/strong . I already have one hole . And the weave is coming out fast . I will get it patched , but I wo n't be buying anymore carhartt jeans . Seeing that this was the first carhartt item I have ever bought I also doubt I will buy anything else carhartt 's .
 I do n't think that it is too much to expect one year 's service out of a set of work dungarees , but apparently I 'm wrong . I carry tools around all day at work in the tool pockets . And two out of the four pairs I bought in July have worn through the tool pockets already . Carhartt could do with a better quality denim for work dungarees .
 I ordered the exact same product a year ago and they fit great . This time they are too long and tight across the top 's of my legs . You wonder how a product could change ; did the sweat factory person have a bad day ; was she or he new at the job ; I mean how can you mis-cut or screw up a pair of Carhartt 's ... I am going to keep them and allow the local Vocational School -LRB- Tailoring Program -RRB- fix them to fit . My bad ! You really need to try stuff on before purchasing . It is just disappointing that crap changes for no reason .
 way to big ... i ordered ' 32x28 ' ... which is a hard to find size ... they fit bigger than most ' 32x30 ' jeans ! ... bummer ... gave them to salvation army , not even worth returninglame >
 I was n't at all expecting cargo jeans when I opened the package , which I strongly dislike as does my husband .

 This is a well-made item , but definitely NOT made for a Verizon XV6700 ! It 's simply too small -- you 'll have to jam it in -- and how will you answer a call quickly ? The phone wo n't slide out easily.Also , the hole at the top for the antenna nub is on the wrong side , meaning your XV6700 external screen will be facing you -- and making phantom calls . Mine called my boss on a re-dial -- twice . Very embarrassing.You 'll need to look elsewhere for a case for the XV6700 . Like one REALLY made for this sweet `` pocket PC '' cell phone .
 I ordered this for Halloween a month in advance . Received the product and was damaged . Send the item back and paid $ 10 for postage . I did not receive a credit on my credit card nor did not receive a non damage item in the mail before Halloween.After Halloween check my credit card and still did not received my credit . I lost $ 10 in postage for a product that was defective . I did request a refund for the postage but not receive a refund for the postage . Very disappointed with this company . I paid my hard working money for nothing but disappointment .
 This coat is sized too large in the shoulders and huge in the waist . -LRB- And I 'm not thin . -RRB- I needed to go down a size from my actual size , and yes that 's with a suitcoat on underneath . So if you say yes when you 're asked , `` Can I super size that for you ? '' , order your regular size . Anyone with a BMI under 25 should go down a size.Since it did n't fit , I re-ordered the item . It 's been 11 days and the item has n't shipped , and after two emails to customer service they pretty much said it will ship when it ships . They do n't take customer service calls on the weekend . -LRB- The year 1965 called , they want their customer service department back . -RRB- At the real prices for Jos A Banks -LRB- 70 % discount from `` list '' -RRB- , this is a reasonable value for my needs - for an everyday coat for the subway , to save wear on my real topcoat . The design and construction is OK . The wool is fairly thin . It 's just good enough not to return . If I ever actually get it in my size , that is .

 I wear a 10.5 EE shoe and these socks fit tight out of the package . After washing the first time they shrank to 5 1/2 '' from heal to toe and 2 1/2 in height . Had to give them away after one use . Someone with a size 4 to 7 and a narrow foot may want to give these a try .
 I purchased these sox for my husband who has Parkinson 's Disease , and has trouble putting on sox . -LRB- The disease has limited his finger dexterity . -RRB- The sox came in a package of six pair . I opened the package and we tried to get them on his feet . It was difficult as the sox did not stretch . At the end of the day I had to help him take them off . After washing them I found they shrunk so much he could not wear them at all . I looked into returning them but because they came in a six pack I could not do so . I ended up giving them to a charity . This is the only time Amazon has disappointed me . I decided to only use Amazon for books , not other products .
 The socks are soft , but fit loosely on my foot , not snug . They are thin and after a few hours no longer provide absorption . Instead , they seem to get looser and often get creased under my feet.I ordered 24 pairs . About 3 socks came damaged when I opened the packages . I also do n't like that the paper that holds them together leaves glue behind .
 new york yankees `` franchise `` fitted mlb cap -LRB- blue -RRB- -LRB- x-large -RRB- ordered the hat believing it to be and extra large adult hat for my husband . received the hat and found to be much to small . found out from jr 's sports that the ad hadnt been clear enough and that it was a childs size . was offered to return or get a 20 % discount on another item . as i had given it to my granson i couldnt return it and had no desire to purchase anything else.i felt misled and with no options that would have not cost more money .
 I was very upset when this hat arrived . The picture makes it look darker than it really is . I was looking for the closest to black yankee hat I could find , but this picture was very decieving . From now on , I 'm shopping at the stores .
 These pants were way too big -LRB- looked about 2 sizes larger -RRB- , and they were incredibly stiff . They would have been very uncomfortable for my daughter to wear all day .

 This is the sheerest cashmere I have ever seen . Looses it shape after one wearing . Huge seams . TRULY a disappointment .
 The constume was missing parts , looked as if someone had cut the hood off the shirt , the pants were ripped .
 The fabric and cosntruction of this costume was terrible . It only vaguely looked like the pictures and many of the accessories were n't proportional to the rest of the costume . In the picture , the belt hangs to the boy 's kness . On my son , it was so short that the ends just stuck out of the knot while the rest of the costume was a little big for him . I do n't know how the black mask was supposed to attache to anything . It was too small to tie around his head so we just threw it away . He wore the costume because we did n't have time to replace it but I would have if it had been an option .
 This costume is horrible . It arrived with loose threads all over it , fraying at every seam , and the hood is not attached as pictured . The hood had two small pieces of velcro on either side to fasten it under the chin , however one of the pieces had come unsewn before we even took it out of the bag . Almost a complete waste of money ; my son did enjoy wearing it .
 The costume works well but the hood was NOT attached to the shirt it is separate and does n't look right . Luckily my son has a red hooded shirt to wear underneath . Just was n't exactly what I was looking for . He is happy with it and has worn it seveeral times to events before Halloween .
 Okay , so we could go two routes here
 Received item quickly , earlier than estimated time . Item did NOT include the face mask as stated on package . 3 of 4 arm/leg ties were a shorter length and one was longer . Waist sash was fine . Agree with other comments about detached hood . Size information was hard to find . My 7 year old wears a 6/7 so I ordered a Medium and it was a good fit - roomy , not snug over clothes .
 Order this for 2011 Halloween . My son loves it but gets frustrated . The description is misleading . The hood is not attached and no way for the hood to stay in place on the shirt . With that said the material is too short to tuck in the hoodie . The pic shows the waist sash long up to the boys knee . The longest fabric is only enough to double tie . My son is 6 yrs old 44inches and only 40lbs . The ties around arms , legs keep sliding since the fabric is a slippery type fabric that pilts . The face fabric does not hold up . It slides so I had to put Velcro on it to stay put . My son is keeping it only because he likes that it is red and had a cool skull , not to mention his grandma is going to fix it . Hope this helps .
 Flimsy material . We were very disappointed - the item is not as shown . There is no hood with the top despite it being described with it . I was hoping to exchange but the item was sold out so had to run around finding the right material to sew a hood on . In the end it would have been just as easy to make it ourselves . Red top , red pants , strips of black material - done .
 I highly recommend not to order this . Very Low quality , first was eagerly waiting for the product , when received did n't meet exceptions.The costume was not properly stitched . complete rip off . They should not be allowed to sell their products and rip customers , I ll will email to amazon as well the ruined my kids holidays . Will find a way to get money back . the shipping was 3 times the price of the item , which i accepted this whole thing is a scam.Doesn ' t Amazon get a bad name for putting these kind of stores online ?
 It wasnt impressed at all . It was different than what the picture was shown . The packaging had other costume pictures inside it and the hood wasnt attached as shown in the picture . Had to sew it on or there was a huge gap between costume and hood . The mask kept sliding off my sons face no matter how you tied it unless you wanted to suffocate the child it was pointless to try to put it on him . Not sure who made it but it was really cheap .
 The costume mateiral is of low quality . I was worried whether it would last for just one-evening use . I would not buy it again .
 Poor quality hood was detached from shirt and did n't have the mask that went over the face . This was a piece of crap I did not have enough time to send it back so I had to fix the damn thing myself . Will never order from them ever again .
 very misleading ... hood is detached . . and broke . . no way to somehow attach it to the shirt or put ot on right unless I sew it on ... . it 's just a triangle hanging over the head . . hope we can get a new one given that we are overseas
 One of the pants legs is cut up at the bottom and there was another costume 's cover -LRB- Superman -RRB- packaged with the shirt . I 'm a very unhappy Aunt Tee right now !
 This costume arrived WITHOUT the most important part ... the HOOD for the ninja and it has a HOLE in it !!! Very disappointing overall
 my 10 yr old hated it , its not good quality at all so i have to agree with him ! i had to return it and order him a new one
 of the black accessorized parts . The part that is supposed to cover the face . It would seem to be that there should be some type of quality control check to ensure all parts are included in the package prior to mailing . How difficult can that be ?
 The Chantelle Bra was incorrectly sized ! The Bra was supposed to be a DDDD but instead I was sold an H or a Z cup ? Anyway the cup size on the bra was completely wrong and immensely huge ! One of my boobs was pointing east and the other to the west ! I do n't know about you but I like my tiots in the middle . Do not buy a bra from this seller it will end in great dissapointment and a total and complete ripoff !

 Great shorts , but I needed to get a smaller size , so I returned it . Several weeks later now , I have NOT received my refund .
 I bought this umbrella in 2009 and used it only a few times before it broke . It was only one month after I received it . I sent back the defected umbrella but the company would not refund any of my money . Do n't buy this bad product !
 I am of average build 5 ' 5 '' / 130 lbs , and I got these b/c I wanted socks that would stay up , yet not suffocate my legs . All I can say is they simply DO NOT STAY UP . No matter how or where I wear them . They also bunch up under my foot constantly regardless of what type of shoe I wear . The softness is okay , but I avoid wearing them for the above reasons .

 I WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN THE BAG ARRIVED , SINCE I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT THIS IS REALLY A ` SMALL BAG ' . AND THE COLOR , THE PINK IS QUITE DARK . .
 Wiley X Blink Model 555 are not Polarized . I bought a pair recently from Amazon and found out the hard way . If you are looking for Aluminum Gloss Frame Blinks with Polarized Silver Flash lenses the model number is 558 . The seller -LRB- Sunglass Express -RRB- in the case of my order just blamed Amazon for improper item description and told me to complain there . Since then Sunglass Express has removed there posting .

 I assumed it was a good product because of Rick Steve . Well , he maybe an expert on travel but he 's like everyone else with merchandizing.This neck wallet seems to be well made and that 's about the only good comment I can make . It has a vinyl/plastic insert that just sit in main pocket . and it does n't seal . So if you want to protect anything from getting wet or soaked , get a ziploc bag and keep it dry . Trust me , when you have money , check , or any documents that gets soaked because of your sweat , this wo n't protect it . plastic liner does n't sit in there too well either.If you want someting more reliable , pick anything but this . Same goes for the money belt .

 I returned all 3 pair I ordered due to sizing - WAY TOO SMALL for the size I ordered !
 The product description says that this items comes with THREE pairs per package . I bought five packages , expecting to get 15 pairs of stockings . I got ONE pair of stockings in each package . That 's false advertising.The nylons are fine - but I would not have bought them if I had thought I was only getting 5 pairs , instead of the 3 pairs per package as the page advertises .

 Whats so funny , funny guy ? You think my hair is so damn funny you go and write a funny book about it ? I happen to like my hair , and so do the ladies , if you know what I mean . I can rock all night at a Dokken concert , then tie it back and go to my security guard job the next day . Hairstyle of the gods , yer damn straight . Now a manatee with a mullet , now thats funny .
 I am a big fan of the Mullet -LRB- even though I do not sport such exotic plumage -RRB- and almost died laughing when reading several of the sites dedicated to mullets on the web . So when I saw this book I decided to buy it . What a mistake ! There is absolutely no humor in this book , and what makes it pathetic is that it is trying to be funny . It is filled with cartoons , people dressed up in mullets , constant references to Billy Ray Cyrus , and stuff on twinkies and ding-dongs - what do they have to do with mullets . Too much filler and not enough real mullets . My advice , keep your money and visit the GALORE of MULLETS sites that one can find on the net . Sites that are actually funny . Sorry , this book was a waste of my money .
 I 'm dumfounded that anyone could find this book amusing . Chief among its sins

 I do n't know what shape or size of breast this bra is designed for , but mine are definitely not it . If you want your girls held up in a loose fitting banana hammock , this is the bra for you . I tried to keep an open mind when I first put it on even though I was stupefied with incredulity , and thought maybe it looks good under a shirt . I put on a sweater , and thought ... `` oh , this is how older people get that weird look like their boobs have fallen down but the nipples still manage to point up '' . It 's not a bullet bra , but it 's a similar unnatural shape .
 The generic product description says that there are only 3 rows of hooks . Once you move up to the 38DD size , there are 4 . I know that an extra row does n't sound like a lot , but it makes a huge difference regarding the width of the backstrap . I went back to a 36 b/c I just wanted the three rows of hooks . If you can stand the 4 rows , this is a great bra for women with smaller frames and larger breasts . I found a good amount of support while still having a little movement . Most bras my size are granny-approved , so it is nice to have a lacy one that looks fresh .
 Perhaps this bra will work for those who are not very busty . For me 34DD , it gave me banana boobs . Good construction though , it looks like it would last a while if I actually wore it .
 Very scratchy fabric and very uncomfortable . The fit is nice , but I ca n't stand to have it on all day ! Ugh !
 Pros : ComfortableVery SupportiveNice Lace -LRB- Ca n't comment on durability - I returned it -RRB- Cons : SHAPEI found this bra to give my breasts a very bizarre shape . Not cone or bullet shaped , but definitely too perky - my breasts pointed up . If you look closely you can actually see the shape on the model in the picture . I did n't notice until I tried it on myself but then I looked back at the picture and sure enough - they point up . I think everyone has a different idea of an appropriate breast shape so my advice is to look very carefully at the picture being mindful of the shape - if it looks good to you then you might like it . It is also possible that with bigger breasts the extra gravity might balance out the extra lift and make a nice shape . -LRB- I am a 40D -RRB-
 The bras fit well but after a few times of wearing , the wire popped out .
 It was comfortable , but did not fit at all like I had hoped it would . The cups had pretty much no support , and it even seemed like they had too much material . It sort of bunched up ... not attractive . I returned it .

 This dress has a nice cut , but wo n't be flattering on anyone without alterations . My tailor will have to raise the hem 3-4 inches and take in the shoulder straps . The fabric is polyester and a bit cheap feeling , but it will work fine with a cute jacket or shawl for weddings or nice dinners out .
 The dress has a lovely cut and I thought it would look great on me . I was disappointed in the fabric and how it layed . Because the dress has a really low back , you need to either go braless or have a good low back bra .

 Not too good ... it came WAY too large and its a lot thicker material than it seems , needs to change its Sizing .
 shown item is not what you get . NO liner included.shown item is not what you get . NO liner included .
 This jacket was n't what I expected.when I see authentic and vintage , that is a sign that its an original vietnam jacket.this looks like a remake of one and no I do n't like it.you need to change what this is , because it is n't `` authentic '' at all or `` vintage '' by far.I 'm a veteran and this is somewhat discraceful to me .
 Unfortuneately , the vendor and I had a difficulty with the description of the item , and what I received . They would not offer , nor allow a return . Since then , I have already issued a review -- which prompted them -LRB- several weeks after the problem was pointed out to them -RRB- to respond . The nature of my negative review prompted them to offer a return acceptance of the item if I would remove the negative review . I advised that I could not alter the facts . Their response was to tell me to enjoy the jacket . I had already donated it to the Homeless Shelter by that time .
 This jacket is total dissapointment . Should have known better since its made in china . Really poor quality , texture , and the sizes are way too big . I returned it back to the seller and they are charging restocking fee and shipping . Save your money and shop somewhere else and buy the real thing . this jacket is nothing close to a military issued jacket .
 I 'm 5 foot 8 inches tall , weigh 165 lbs . Ordered the Small size jacket , which turned out to be too long in the sleeves , yet not very roomy in the body . So I had to return the jacket . Warning
 This is not an original M65 field jacket - it is a cheap knock off . When I received the jacket , it was fully zipped and snapped . When I pulled the flap to unsnap it , the brass snap pulled right through the fabric This is junk !
 It 's a nice M-65 type jacket but it 's massive . The sleeves are a good 6 inches past the tips of my fingers . I had to roll the sleeves back quite a bit . I think that I could have gotten away with a medium on this jacket . Do n't trust the sizing charts on this jacket . I read elsewhere on Amazon that you should order about two sizes smaller than what you usually wear for this particular brand of M-65 and I agree .

 In the past found this Danskin bra -- both straight strap design and high percent -LRB- 90 or so -RRB- cotton material -- comfortable for all activities . Lycra or polyester now almost half of the content and the comfort and absorbency are gone . This was a superior product . Now ruined by cheap downgrade in manufacturing process . Big disappointment to find it scratchy instead of getting high quality cotton .

 I loved my first trager backpack . After many years of use it eventually came apart at the seams . I liked it so much , that I bought another . The same thing happened , the seams came apart , but this time it happened almost immediately . I contacted Trager and they asked me to send it in for repair or replacement . I did this . Then I NEVER heard back from them again . I have emailed , called and left VMs and tried everything . They have never responded to me . I now have to buy something else as I have been without the bag I was using every day . I will not buy another Trager product .

 I bought this at an LL Bean store and clipped it to my belt . The carabineer slipped it 's spring before I got home .
 i didnt evan last 20 min in the . as soon as i put them on walked down stairs and sit hdown they split right down the middle . i still have them but dont know if i can exchange or not
 Much to my disappointment , these pants arrive with elastic band torn out of them ; I have had to take to local cleaners to repair the band = $ 20.00 cost out of pocket ; I was going to order two more pair , but have canceled said order !!!
 The product that was sent was NOT what was listed in the online site . The retail site was nice enough to refund the purchase ; however , their customer service never admitted to the listing error .
 For a big and tall pant , this is an awful fit . I wear a 44W x 34L , so I was glad to find that Amazon carried Docker 's in this size . Saves a trip to the mall . Price seemed good . When I got these pants I was very disappointed . While the fit in the waist and length were tight on , the butt and the thights were sized like a skinny jean a teenage boy might wear . Not at all the fit I was expecting . Very misleading . I have bought the `` signature '' khaki through JC Penney in their stores tons of times so I thought I was getting the same thing with a nice comfortable fit , you know , the things dockers are know for . I was really disappointed that amazon would not reimburse the shipping saying that incorrect fit is not their problem . I told them it was a case of incorrect descriptions , but they did n't care . How the hell did they win for best customer service a couple years ago ? I do n't see it . Do n't buy these unless you a tall fat guy who wants a really tight pair of pants .
 I expected the same Dockers I 've been buying for years . These are not them . The waist does n't close with a button . It closes with a hidden button and a hook . It 's more like dress pants . The color I got is called `` cloud '' which makes me think white . I have several older pairs that I think of as white . The color is more like a light-khaki instead . And finally , there is a piece of elastic in the left and right sides so that the waist can expand . I 've never seen such a feature on Dockers and do n't like it . It makes the pants too loose and they do n't hold my shirt tail in . I can cinch up the belt but then it looks all pleated at the waist . The delivery was not a problem but these were the only available Dockers I could find in 40x36 anywhere on Amazon and they do n't have the features I wanted . I already washed them and its too late to return or I would .
 Other reviews dead on , these are not what I expected , I took a chance because I needed green pants , the waist size was right , but the pants are tight in the thigh and butt area , I do not like the elastic above both side pockets , I probably will not wear again , salvation army for these !
 Bought a size larger than I am , pants were loose in the waist , but looked like skinny jeans on my thighs . I did n't have time to return them , so I just wrote them off and ordered WAY larger . Legs fit , waist could fit an elephant . However , after two weeks both pairs are already falling apart . The pocket seems have split , and they both have random holes that Remind me of rotting canvas . They also wrinkle if you look at them . I have never owned a fabric that wrinkles so quickly.DO NOT BUY ANY OF THESE PANTS . The size does n't matter , the style does n't matter , they are all absolute garbage . Dockers used to be a quality brand , now they are even pants fit for the homeless .
 As you can review my purchases with you they are quite a few and never have I complained because there was no reason . Sadly there is always a first time , the Dark Khaki pants I bought at the part where it streches the cloth ripped open , this happened on both sides and I was very very surprised , I tried to put them on once and that was when it happened , I took it to a tailor to fx them but told me the cloth was rotten , pudrid.I want to know with my record with you can you please send me no charge a new pair of pants , if you send them to me I will be able to return the ones I have in the package you send me the new ones if you want me to return them , I have already spent $ 20.00 trying to fix them but with no success.Please let me know your feed back . I wrote a few days ago to the packaging division with no answer up to know.I hope I have better luck with you.With kindest Regards , Jules Garcia
 I gave this product 1 star only because I ca n't give it 0 . Unfortunately I bought three pair of these pants . They fit fine in the waist , seat and hips , but were cut so shockingly lean in the legs as to be unwearable . -LRB- No , my weight/size has n't changed since an earlier purchase of these pants in the same size . -RRB- I see another reviewer commented on this same problem . Dockers has apparently drastically altered its sizing - or it has a new supplier who has no idea how to size pants.I also bought several pairs of shirts and had the same problem with them . They fit the torso fine but I felt like my forearms were going to split the material , and I could barely button the cuffs . It 's as if the sleeves were from a child 's shirt . Same thing with the pants . There may be some men somewhere in the world who can wear these pants and shirts , but they must be tiny-boned and without a muscle in their arms and legs.I have completely lost confidence in Dockers . They ca n't make the price low enough for me to ever buy any of their clothing again . Even if it were free , what good is an article of clothing that you ca n't wear without physical discomfort ?
 I chose this rating because the inseam was not 36 &#34; . I measured after I noticed they looked a little shorter than usual . A little more attention to detail please . The inseam was 35 1/2 &#34; . When you are tall and have difficulty finding pants that 1/2 ' makes a big difference .
 The description of this pant mentions a `` modern waistband . '' It should say a `` stretch '' or `` elastic '' waistband -LRB- that when extended shows the white lining of the pockets ... like cheaper pants from other retailers ... like the one that starts with `` J.C. '' -RRB- . Unlike the Dockers I have always purchased , this is a design downgrade that I was not expecting based on the item description and my prior purchases . Had to return the pants.I will say that Amazon made the return process easy and free ... way to go Amazon ! 5 stars on their commitment to customers .
 I returned the 2 pair of Dockers for a refund . The material was not worth the expensive price tag , even on sale . I found a higher quality pant from another brand for about a third of the price . Much happier . Amazon was great to work with however .
 The stretch waistband is the worst design in 15 years of wearing Dockers . Had to sew it closed to stabilize the waistband . Shirt would n't stay tucked and waistband stretch mechanism tended to fail . STAY AWAY FROM THIS CATASTROPHE OF POOR DESIGN !
 Come on Amazon , get with the it and put up decent description!These are not your standard Dockers!They are the comfort wait which unless you know what it is you will most likely hate it .
 Long-time Dockers fan , wearing 38x36 khakis . `` Modern waistband '' is not an accurate or complete description of an elastic , poorly designed panel for those with roller-coaster waistlines . For me this feature detracts from the fit . I have had the same waistline for over thirty years and do n't need elastic for a fit -- elastic that will likely create problems over time without adding value . I returned my order with regrets that Dockers had ruined the fit that I have enjoyed for so long . Pants otherwise were the same old Dockers that I have grown to appreciate . Now I have to look elsewhere for a proper fit .

 I bought these from amazon because I was having trouble finding them in stores . I went to walmart who usually carries them not wanting to spend to much for somthing my baby is just gon na puke on , they told me they didnt carry any so I came here and found these . They suck ... badly . These are not very absorbent , except for the middle part on the mostly brown one . They are reasonably attractive iv had many ppl ask what they are becuz they dont exactly look like ur average burp cloth . I would do better to use a kleenex to burp my baby they would be more absorbent .

 My son wanted to be a Swat officer for Halloween and this is the one he selected . It was a thin material , so he had to wear sweats under the costume . The mask was cool . But , for the price , I do n't know if it was really worth it .
 I returned all 3 pair I ordered due to sizing - WAY TOO SMALL for the size I ordered !
 This is the sheerest cashmere I have ever seen . Looses it shape after one wearing . Huge seams . TRULY a disappointment .
 I purchased this cashmere robe for my husband for his birthday , but the XL men 's size robe that arrived was woefully too small . It would maybe fit an x = large napolese man , but certainly not an American . To make it worse not only was my husband disappointed , but I had to hassle with shlepping to the post office to return it only to now have to argue with `` the boutique '' to have my money credited to my card . `` They are generously offering me a store credit '' -LRB- yeah , right -RRB- . so ... now they have their merchandise AND my money ! BEWARE , DO N'T BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE .

 While it is a real prada , it looks and feels extremely cheap . It is also very small . The best way to describe it ... you know when makeup counters like clinique or lancome do free gift time and they put products in those little makeup bags , that 's basically what this looks and feels like . A cheap makeup bag with the prada logo slapped on it.Mine also arrived stained.If I could give this bag 0 stars I would .
 I did n't actually buy this off amazon . But I got if from Hottopic . While it has a really neat design the zhoodie is made for people who have a small torso but a wide stomach . I am an average size gy 5 ' 10 '' 185lbs . I got a Large and it went almost to my belly button the sleeves went way below my hands and the extra room to stash whatever in the zhoodie with me . One unique quality is the zipper is on the left side . Most have them on the right .
 The Chantelle Bra was incorrectly sized ! The Bra was supposed to be a DDDD but instead I was sold an H or a Z cup ? Anyway the cup size on the bra was completely wrong and immensely huge ! One of my boobs was pointing east and the other to the west ! I do n't know about you but I like my tiots in the middle . Do not buy a bra from this seller it will end in great dissapointment and a total and complete ripoff !
 I never even recieved this product and im not sure if I was charged for it or not . So im not satisfied with this order
 I thought this piece would add something extra to my marriage and while it does n't detract , it 's not the sort of material or look that my husband is especially responsive to .
 We order a man Lacoste Classic Polo and received a Yoga pants for women ... very poor customer services ... never get the item that ordered ... J.E.
 I returned all 3 pair I ordered due to sizing - WAY TOO SMALL for the size I ordered !
 Dickies - Girls ' Flat Front Pantsi found the same pants at walmart.com for $ 12 each . Why would i pay more in amazon.com ?

 This bra is comfortable enough , and just supportive enough not to be completely embarrassing . The materials are pretty crappy . After less than a month I was starting to see the edges starting to run . I was happy to find a nursing bra in 42L -LRB- do n't have any options at this size -RRB- , but I ca n't wait to be finished nursing so I can go back to a sturdy , supportive bra.The straps look somewhat wide , but under load they end up bunching up and digging in more than others . Keep trying Fancee Free , maybe some day you 'll figure out that the same designs and fabrics just do n't scale up the same when you get into bigger cup sizes . I look forward to the day when a large size bra is actually designed and built for the large size bust . Someone let me know when they do , this one just does n't cut it .
 I was really excited when I saw this bra online in my size , but unfortunately when the bra came it did not fit like the picture . It was uncomfortable and had absolutely no support ... my breast looked like sandwiches
 This bra provides ok support . It 's not the best and not the worst that I have found . It is extremely itchy ! I even tried trimming the lace off but it 's not the lace . It is the fabric around the inside edge . I am not sure what type of fabric it is but it definitely is not cotton ! When I took this bra off after wearing for a few hours my skin was red and very irritated around the edges of the bra . The cup fit ok and inside seams did n't bother me . It is one of the few that I have found in my size 38/40 H but there are others out there . Unfortunately I was not able to return this because I prewashed and had to wear it because I did n't have another nursing bra .
 It lost its hold after a few hours . I am heavy busted and with milk it 's worst , so this bra is not good for holding up anything that a nursing bra should . It seems as though the straps kept getting longer and longer as the minutes rolled by . By the time I took it off it was a hula-hoop around the band and the length of suspenders at the strap , but did not support as well as suspenders . A picture is worth a thousand words , but this picture lied .
 There are exposed seams crossing the inside of this bra . I found it extreemly painfull to wear as the seams rubed on a sensative area -LRB- I do n't want to get to graphic -RRB- . I 'm not nursing yet but clearly a nursing bra that causes pain is a bad design . It was supportive and others might find it more comforatable than I did but I 'm returning the one I bought .
 This bra is unwearable - and I have never found * any * bra uncomfortable before . The seams in the front , and in the back , and over the nipple -LRB- seams over the nipple in a nursing bra , are you kidding ?! -RRB- all hurt . And itch . Look at that picture and all those seams and imagine them all scratching and irritating you , and the back hurting and itching as well , and save your money . The nipple seams hurt even with nursing pads.I 'm a size 36 J and found that the support was just OK , comparable to a cheap XL nursing bra from Walmart . Really upset that I spent so much money on this poorly designed thing .
 Seems to run smaller than labeled . My other bras of the same label size are larger than this one ... so I have n't been wearing it , and ca n't rate the wear-ability of it .
 It does n't do anything for the tummy ! It does work for the butt and thighs but I was hoping for a lot more !
 Spanx ended up tearing on me the first time i used them , i got two pairs of them too . Smoothes well but rolls down on the stomach part too . Gets annoying
 Well lets start off with the good . This product is very comfortable not to mention they are very thin very comfortable . The problem is that they do n't really do anything for my stomach in perticular I am not big at all I am a normal size girl . The thing is that they actually create tummy rolls for me which is odd . I mean it does not slim me at all . It is good though for the reason i bought them which was so that i can wear them under skirts . They are very thin and cover all so i like that aspect about them .
 I thought that these would be kind of like cut-off control top panty hose . They 're more like just cut-off regular pantyhose . There was no ` control ' at all in the 4 pair I bought , following their sizing charts . Unlike other reviewers , I did n't find them too tight , in fact I thought they 'd be tighter . Regular firm control briefs are better . Waste of money .
 They do n't pull up to your waste all the way so that when you sit down the top rolls down . The control around the hips and thighs are okay . But if you 're looking for tummy control , find another product .
 I ordered over $ 800 worth of spanx products including 3 different types of bras , 2 power panties , and 2 shapeware bottoms all in several different colors . I measured carefully as according to the website and thought the sizes seemed too small -LRB- 36 C when I usually wear a 36D -RRB- . The website says 100 % satisfaction guarantee so I ordered one size up as well and planned to keep the ones that fit the best . Only two items worked and they were sized differently than the others -LRB- had their own size chart -RRB- . Everything else was much too small . I probably wear either a 38 D or 38DD in their stuff . So I thought , no big deal , I placed a large order , I 'll just call customer service and let them know that I want to directly exchange the same items for larger sizes . They would not do that . They said that I had to return everything that did n't fit , at my expense , to arrive to them within 30 days of purchase . They would refund the purchase price but not the shipping . And then I had to get online and place a new order of everything I wanted and pay shipping again . Of course , if those do n't fit again , I pay return shipping again . So basically , if you order something that does n't turn out to be the right size and you want to exchange , you pay shipping 3x . I do n't expect shipping to be free . I would have even been happy with them taking my order over the phone and shipping out the replacements free -LRB- so I only paid shipping two times -RRB- . They would n't do that . After much conversation and my pointing out the size of my order several times , she did agree -LRB- after talking to someone else -RRB- , as a ONE TIME COURTESY -LRB- which she stressed multiple times -RRB- to refund my shipping . That is all . She would n't take my new order . I am disappointed because I think if I got the right size some of these bras would be awesome and I would order again and again -LRB- I tend to be loyal with underwear brands -RRB- . But I really do n't think I want to deal with them again .
 Was so excited to get my spanx - and , well , unfortunately it is so not the miracle worker i expected it to be . basically , this is the honest truth
 I ordered these according to the size chart . I am 5 ' 5 135 and ordered size `` B '' . I put them on according to the instructions and I thought they fit . Within minutes they were rolling down and creating the worst side fat ever . I am not chubby but this totally made me look it and gave me a muffin top that I do n't have . THESE THINGS ROLL UP !! Wish I could return them but the packaging said they do n't accept returns once product has been open . Biggest waste of money .
 The product is good and durable . Unfortunately , the sizingis all off . I purchased a size that was way over my weightyet I had a difficult time getting is on and felt like I waswearing a girdle . I suggest you get the next size up . I wishI had .
 I bought the Spanx shorts to wear under my wedding dress and when standing this product is great . However , as soon as I sit down they start rolling down . I bought Spanx because I heard that they did n't roll -- but they do . They fit pretty comfortably and I definitely feel strapped in but the rolling is pretty bad .
 LOVE the spanx however I have purchased this item from Breakout bras store , they have an Extremely poor customer service , first I have received a defected spanx -LRB- a whole in the leg -RRB- and then they replaced back the item after 5 weeks which this involved couple of times phoning & emailing the customer service , which I was N'T happy as I needed the spanx asap , so AVOID purchasing this product from BREAKOUT bras store .
 The Spanx Power Panties with tummy control did n't work for me . They would either starting rolling down in the front or the back . They we 're easy to put on and they felt great unlike the other tummy control items I have tried . But like the rest they started rolling down . It was either have a bludge in the front or the back . I really wanted these to work like others I read reviews about . But I only wasted my money .
 I am a fairly thin person with a little extra weight in the upper thigh area and was hoping these could minimize the look under dresses or more fitted pants , but unfortunately they did n't seem to do anything for me . They were very tight and hard to get on , and once I did I still had the same lumps and bumps . Very dissapointed .
 I 'm 5 ' 6 '' , 155lbs . This does n't work for me at all . The waistband keeps rolling down the whole time i was trying to wear it , plus it was extremely uncomfortable .
 My height and weight pu me smack dab in the size B. I tried them on at home with the dress I was going to wear . The tummy part rolled down . I figured that was n't optimal but it was still usable . While I was out the panties caused so much static , I was embarassed to stand up . I used some water in the restroom to reduce the static . A couple of hrs into wearing them , the leg hem started rolling up my thighs , creating once again embarassing bulges . Not sure if the sizing chart was wrong or what happened , but I sure wo n't be wearing these expensive underwear again .
 I bought this item about 3 months ago . It works fine around the legs except mine rolls up.I didnt like the tummy control though.Im short so it goes up really high so then I have the bulge in the back because its mashed everything up so all my fat is on my back now.Also its really really HOT !!!
 This is my second time to buy Spanx brand shapewear . Normally I buy a store brand . True to my last experience , these did n't last . I bought them and wore them for the first time on 6/29/11 . I have worn them about twice a week since and by the middle of July they were already ripped at the seam . I have a similar black pair that I bought at a department store for half the price that have lasted over a year and I am still wearing them with no rips or tears . In my opinion , Spanx brand is definitely not worth the extra cost .
 OK I had a lot of hope in this product
 These pants are thick , and they do n't compress me very much , so they actually make my clothes fit tighter . Expensive and a waste of money .
 They work fine until I sat down and the waistband rolled up so that when I stood up I was constantly having to fix them .
 They are okay however the waistband keeps rolling so not really what I am looking for as it bunches up at waist and not a smooth look like I thought it would be .
 Very disappointed . I had a spanx in the past with no issues . This product did not hold anything in and the top part kept rolling down . Will try a smaller size next time
 I bought these `` panties '' to smooth out my butt in a very sheer bridesmaids dress I was wearing . Let me put this in perspective , I 'm 5 ' 7 '' , 127lbs and have very little body fat . I do have a bit of a butt so I just did n't want the dress clinging too it and wearing regular panties would show through . I thought this would be a good option . At first , I thought they were n't bad . They did smooth things out and you could n't really see them under the dress . That being said , they 're very uncomfortable and my stomach DID bulge out of the top as others have suggested . I 'm pretty damn close to having a 6-pack so if my stomach was squeezing out I ca n't see these things working well for many people . I was so uncomfortable in the damn things that I wish I just let my bum show . :-RRB- The were fine in the thigh and butt area but did not fall comfortably on the stomach . I was constantly trying to keep them pulled up and I had to sit up completely straight to keep everything in . I might try the low waisted version or the full body suit but these are a NO GO ! I do n't really see myself wearing them again .
 I did not wear these for the outfit/occasion I had ordered for and have promptly returned . I am 5 ' 2 '' and fairly slender at 105 lbs . Sometimes when I am bloated or drink an excess of water , my lower tummy expands out . Since I was wearing a dress that fit like a glove in a jersey material , I did not want any bulges apparent from anywhere.First , the item completely cuts the waste area . It came about an inch above my belly button and managed to squeeze my skin creating two bulges cutting into my figure . When I tried to lower it , even worse ! Second , the front seam which ran right along the middle -LRB- lined with belly button -RRB- caused the top to curl forward and could also be seen through the fabric of my dress.Overall , I am very disappointed with the product .
 I 've long been searching for a meansTo improve the way I look in jeans.Then I found a Spanx that binds us , Shapes and smoothes what is behind us.So here am I all sleek and svelte , But such sore feet I 've never felt!For while this may be what I fit in , It 's not something I can sit in . - Gail Cooke
 Received incorrect color - ordered bare , got black . Flying out for a wedding in two days - really disappointed , will have to head to the mall anyways . What a pain ! Wo n't be buying from this seller again .
 This product description is deceiving , does not do as described . sent a e mail to the company and they DID NOT RESPOND
 Bought a pair hate them.Uncomfortable , roll at waist , hard to get on and off .
 I HAD TO VISIT THE VENDORS SITE TO KNOW WHAT THE LETTERS A , B , C , D CORRESPONDED TO SIZE-WISE . I ENDED UP HAVING TO EMAIL THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE BECAUSE I COULD N'T FIND THE INFO ON THE SITE . I GAVE UP ON CUSTOMER SERVICE AFTER 2 DAYS OF NO RESPONSE AND ENDED UP ORDERING THE WRONG SIZE .
 I carefully chose the correct size as shown on the chart . These `` power panties '' did n't hold in anything more than regular underwear . Also the top kept rolling down . very uncomfortable . I ca n't return them because I wore them or they would be going back . A total waste of $ 30 . Very disappointed . The second star is because the fabric was light and unfortunately too freeing .
 I have a short waist so the long or full body shapers never fit me right , so I decided to try the shorts and at first they seemed pretty good . They were comfy , smoothed out the body nicely but like other reviewers said as soon as you sit down or simply bend over they roll . It is very annoying !
 I have both this product and the high-waisted mid-thigh shaper , and the high-waisted shaper is a * significantly * better product . Perhaps it may be due to my long torso , but the power panty is honestly too short in the waist . Whenever I wear it , my bulges all show above the waistline of the power panty , and after a while the top starts rolling down , creating even more bulges . Overall , this does not work at all . Buy the high-waisted mid-thigh shaper instead !!
 I last purchased Spanx a few years back . It was one continuous piece of material , seamed at the crotch , obviously . Wore them out and loved them . I am now returning the `` new construction '' model `` power panties '' that have a double layer of material very poorly stitched below the `` bootie '' all around . These were delivered to me June 12 and are torn w/in two weeks . The stitching will continue to unravel until the double material is long enough to reach way below my knees . On calling the manufacturer , I was told that I can not wear these on a daily basis . They need to `` rest . '' Rest ? Properly fitting and properly laundered clothing should not need a rest ! And , the manufacturer 's rep said that if I plan to wear them every day , I need to buy more . Let 's see
 I ca n't review this product since I could n't get into it ! I ordered the exact size for my height and weight . WOW are these things tiny .
 SPANX POWER PANTIESPositive
 I ordered this product and easily fit within the size i bought . I find that the product rolls down regularly and does not stay in place . It does control the `` muffin top '' but not for long before it moves . i would not buy another item like this .
 Bought a pair of these after reading all the `` rave reviews '' on Amazon . What a waste of $ 30 ! First of all , these things are no more than glorified control top nylons . Secondly , was a little unsure about the size , so did my best guess . I 'm assuming I need a size smaller , but wo n't waste anymore money . In The Mood Intimates , the company these shipped from , refused any refund or exchange because the packaging was disturbed , well DUH , had to try them on . Was really unhappy with their services . The legs of these rolled up . They were tight and uncomfortable . They did tuck my tummy in SLIGHTLY , but because they are an extra layer of fabric , made my favorite jeans TIGHTER . Do n't listen to these reviews . Wearing these for more than 2 hours is torture , and mine were even a little BIG . Ca n't imagine squeezing into anything smaller ...
 The Chantelle Bra was incorrectly sized ! The Bra was supposed to be a DDDD but instead I was sold an H or a Z cup ? Anyway the cup size on the bra was completely wrong and immensely huge ! One of my boobs was pointing east and the other to the west ! I do n't know about you but I like my tiots in the middle . Do not buy a bra from this seller it will end in great dissapointment and a total and complete ripoff !
 This wallet is almost useless - should be renamed a card holder which realistically can only hold approximately 6 cards . Much too costly ! It should be noted that this item can not hold any money , unless folded very small , which ofcourse makes it bulky and unable to close ! I wasted $ 30.00 !

 Dickies - Girls ' Flat Front Pantsi found the same pants at walmart.com for $ 12 each . Why would i pay more in amazon.com ?
 I returned all 3 pair I ordered due to sizing - WAY TOO SMALL for the size I ordered !

 For a big and tall pant , this is an awful fit . I wear a 44W x 34L , so I was glad to find that Amazon carried Docker 's in this size . Saves a trip to the mall . Price seemed good . When I got these pants I was very disappointed . While the fit in the waist and length were tight on , the butt and the thights were sized like a skinny jean a teenage boy might wear . Not at all the fit I was expecting . Very misleading . I have bought the `` signature '' khaki through JC Penney in their stores tons of times so I thought I was getting the same thing with a nice comfortable fit , you know , the things dockers are know for . I was really disappointed that amazon would not reimburse the shipping saying that incorrect fit is not their problem . I told them it was a case of incorrect descriptions , but they did n't care . How the hell did they win for best customer service a couple years ago ? I do n't see it . Do n't buy these unless you a tall fat guy who wants a really tight pair of pants .
 I expected the same Dockers I 've been buying for years . These are not them . The waist does n't close with a button . It closes with a hidden button and a hook . It 's more like dress pants . The color I got is called `` cloud '' which makes me think white . I have several older pairs that I think of as white . The color is more like a light-khaki instead . And finally , there is a piece of elastic in the left and right sides so that the waist can expand . I 've never seen such a feature on Dockers and do n't like it . It makes the pants too loose and they do n't hold my shirt tail in . I can cinch up the belt but then it looks all pleated at the waist . The delivery was not a problem but these were the only available Dockers I could find in 40x36 anywhere on Amazon and they do n't have the features I wanted . I already washed them and its too late to return or I would .
 Other reviews dead on , these are not what I expected , I took a chance because I needed green pants , the waist size was right , but the pants are tight in the thigh and butt area , I do not like the elastic above both side pockets , I probably will not wear again , salvation army for these !
 Bought a size larger than I am , pants were loose in the waist , but looked like skinny jeans on my thighs . I did n't have time to return them , so I just wrote them off and ordered WAY larger . Legs fit , waist could fit an elephant . However , after two weeks both pairs are already falling apart . The pocket seems have split , and they both have random holes that Remind me of rotting canvas . They also wrinkle if you look at them . I have never owned a fabric that wrinkles so quickly.DO NOT BUY ANY OF THESE PANTS . The size does n't matter , the style does n't matter , they are all absolute garbage . Dockers used to be a quality brand , now they are even pants fit for the homeless .
 As you can review my purchases with you they are quite a few and never have I complained because there was no reason . Sadly there is always a first time , the Dark Khaki pants I bought at the part where it streches the cloth ripped open , this happened on both sides and I was very very surprised , I tried to put them on once and that was when it happened , I took it to a tailor to fx them but told me the cloth was rotten , pudrid.I want to know with my record with you can you please send me no charge a new pair of pants , if you send them to me I will be able to return the ones I have in the package you send me the new ones if you want me to return them , I have already spent $ 20.00 trying to fix them but with no success.Please let me know your feed back . I wrote a few days ago to the packaging division with no answer up to know.I hope I have better luck with you.With kindest Regards , Jules Garcia
 I gave this product 1 star only because I ca n't give it 0 . Unfortunately I bought three pair of these pants . They fit fine in the waist , seat and hips , but were cut so shockingly lean in the legs as to be unwearable . -LRB- No , my weight/size has n't changed since an earlier purchase of these pants in the same size . -RRB- I see another reviewer commented on this same problem . Dockers has apparently drastically altered its sizing - or it has a new supplier who has no idea how to size pants.I also bought several pairs of shirts and had the same problem with them . They fit the torso fine but I felt like my forearms were going to split the material , and I could barely button the cuffs . It 's as if the sleeves were from a child 's shirt . Same thing with the pants . There may be some men somewhere in the world who can wear these pants and shirts , but they must be tiny-boned and without a muscle in their arms and legs.I have completely lost confidence in Dockers . They ca n't make the price low enough for me to ever buy any of their clothing again . Even if it were free , what good is an article of clothing that you ca n't wear without physical discomfort ?
 The product that was sent was NOT what was listed in the online site . The retail site was nice enough to refund the purchase ; however , their customer service never admitted to the listing error .
 i didnt evan last 20 min in the . as soon as i put them on walked down stairs and sit hdown they split right down the middle . i still have them but dont know if i can exchange or not
 Much to my disappointment , these pants arrive with elastic band torn out of them ; I have had to take to local cleaners to repair the band = $ 20.00 cost out of pocket ; I was going to order two more pair , but have canceled said order !!!
 The stretch waistband is the worst design in 15 years of wearing Dockers . Had to sew it closed to stabilize the waistband . Shirt would n't stay tucked and waistband stretch mechanism tended to fail . STAY AWAY FROM THIS CATASTROPHE OF POOR DESIGN !
 These Dockers are very poorly made of low quality material.Of four pairs that I purchased two pairs were unwearable after the first use.I have several pairs of Dockers that I have worn for more than ten years and do n't recall ever having a seam failure . I have experienced a belt loop tearing out , but this was after many years of normal wear.I ordered these items from my Amazon order history as direct replacements of those received from earlier ordersThe problems with the new pants occurred the first or second time I wore them . One pair these new pants have ripped out at the seam and the other ripped from the waist line to the back of the knee away from any seams.I do n't believe that the pants I received were made by Dockers even though they had the Docker labels .
 Come on Amazon , get with the it and put up decent description!These are not your standard Dockers!They are the comfort wait which unless you know what it is you will most likely hate it .
 Long-time Dockers fan , wearing 38x36 khakis . `` Modern waistband '' is not an accurate or complete description of an elastic , poorly designed panel for those with roller-coaster waistlines . For me this feature detracts from the fit . I have had the same waistline for over thirty years and do n't need elastic for a fit -- elastic that will likely create problems over time without adding value . I returned my order with regrets that Dockers had ruined the fit that I have enjoyed for so long . Pants otherwise were the same old Dockers that I have grown to appreciate . Now I have to look elsewhere for a proper fit .
 I chose this rating because the inseam was not 36 &#34; . I measured after I noticed they looked a little shorter than usual . A little more attention to detail please . The inseam was 35 1/2 &#34; . When you are tall and have difficulty finding pants that 1/2 ' makes a big difference .
 The description of this pant mentions a `` modern waistband . '' It should say a `` stretch '' or `` elastic '' waistband -LRB- that when extended shows the white lining of the pockets ... like cheaper pants from other retailers ... like the one that starts with `` J.C. '' -RRB- . Unlike the Dockers I have always purchased , this is a design downgrade that I was not expecting based on the item description and my prior purchases . Had to return the pants.I will say that Amazon made the return process easy and free ... way to go Amazon ! 5 stars on their commitment to customers .
 I returned the 2 pair of Dockers for a refund . The material was not worth the expensive price tag , even on sale . I found a higher quality pant from another brand for about a third of the price . Much happier . Amazon was great to work with however .
 There are exposed seams crossing the inside of this bra . I found it extreemly painfull to wear as the seams rubed on a sensative area -LRB- I do n't want to get to graphic -RRB- . I 'm not nursing yet but clearly a nursing bra that causes pain is a bad design . It was supportive and others might find it more comforatable than I did but I 'm returning the one I bought .
 This bra is unwearable - and I have never found * any * bra uncomfortable before . The seams in the front , and in the back , and over the nipple -LRB- seams over the nipple in a nursing bra , are you kidding ?! -RRB- all hurt . And itch . Look at that picture and all those seams and imagine them all scratching and irritating you , and the back hurting and itching as well , and save your money . The nipple seams hurt even with nursing pads.I 'm a size 36 J and found that the support was just OK , comparable to a cheap XL nursing bra from Walmart . Really upset that I spent so much money on this poorly designed thing .
 Seems to run smaller than labeled . My other bras of the same label size are larger than this one ... so I have n't been wearing it , and ca n't rate the wear-ability of it .
 I was really excited when I saw this bra online in my size , but unfortunately when the bra came it did not fit like the picture . It was uncomfortable and had absolutely no support ... my breast looked like sandwiches
 This bra provides ok support . It 's not the best and not the worst that I have found . It is extremely itchy ! I even tried trimming the lace off but it 's not the lace . It is the fabric around the inside edge . I am not sure what type of fabric it is but it definitely is not cotton ! When I took this bra off after wearing for a few hours my skin was red and very irritated around the edges of the bra . The cup fit ok and inside seams did n't bother me . It is one of the few that I have found in my size 38/40 H but there are others out there . Unfortunately I was not able to return this because I prewashed and had to wear it because I did n't have another nursing bra .
 It lost its hold after a few hours . I am heavy busted and with milk it 's worst , so this bra is not good for holding up anything that a nursing bra should . It seems as though the straps kept getting longer and longer as the minutes rolled by . By the time I took it off it was a hula-hoop around the band and the length of suspenders at the strap , but did not support as well as suspenders . A picture is worth a thousand words , but this picture lied .
 This bra is comfortable enough , and just supportive enough not to be completely embarrassing . The materials are pretty crappy . After less than a month I was starting to see the edges starting to run . I was happy to find a nursing bra in 42L -LRB- do n't have any options at this size -RRB- , but I ca n't wait to be finished nursing so I can go back to a sturdy , supportive bra.The straps look somewhat wide , but under load they end up bunching up and digging in more than others . Keep trying Fancee Free , maybe some day you 'll figure out that the same designs and fabrics just do n't scale up the same when you get into bigger cup sizes . I look forward to the day when a large size bra is actually designed and built for the large size bust . Someone let me know when they do , this one just does n't cut it .
 I chose this rating because the inseam was not 36 &#34; . I measured after I noticed they looked a little shorter than usual . A little more attention to detail please . The inseam was 35 1/2 &#34; . When you are tall and have difficulty finding pants that 1/2 ' makes a big difference .
 The description of this pant mentions a `` modern waistband . '' It should say a `` stretch '' or `` elastic '' waistband -LRB- that when extended shows the white lining of the pockets ... like cheaper pants from other retailers ... like the one that starts with `` J.C. '' -RRB- . Unlike the Dockers I have always purchased , this is a design downgrade that I was not expecting based on the item description and my prior purchases . Had to return the pants.I will say that Amazon made the return process easy and free ... way to go Amazon ! 5 stars on their commitment to customers .
 I returned the 2 pair of Dockers for a refund . The material was not worth the expensive price tag , even on sale . I found a higher quality pant from another brand for about a third of the price . Much happier . Amazon was great to work with however .
 The stretch waistband is the worst design in 15 years of wearing Dockers . Had to sew it closed to stabilize the waistband . Shirt would n't stay tucked and waistband stretch mechanism tended to fail . STAY AWAY FROM THIS CATASTROPHE OF POOR DESIGN !
 These Dockers are very poorly made of low quality material.Of four pairs that I purchased two pairs were unwearable after the first use.I have several pairs of Dockers that I have worn for more than ten years and do n't recall ever having a seam failure . I have experienced a belt loop tearing out , but this was after many years of normal wear.I ordered these items from my Amazon order history as direct replacements of those received from earlier ordersThe problems with the new pants occurred the first or second time I wore them . One pair these new pants have ripped out at the seam and the other ripped from the waist line to the back of the knee away from any seams.I do n't believe that the pants I received were made by Dockers even though they had the Docker labels .
 Come on Amazon , get with the it and put up decent description!These are not your standard Dockers!They are the comfort wait which unless you know what it is you will most likely hate it .
 Long-time Dockers fan , wearing 38x36 khakis . `` Modern waistband '' is not an accurate or complete description of an elastic , poorly designed panel for those with roller-coaster waistlines . For me this feature detracts from the fit . I have had the same waistline for over thirty years and do n't need elastic for a fit -- elastic that will likely create problems over time without adding value . I returned my order with regrets that Dockers had ruined the fit that I have enjoyed for so long . Pants otherwise were the same old Dockers that I have grown to appreciate . Now I have to look elsewhere for a proper fit .
 i didnt evan last 20 min in the . as soon as i put them on walked down stairs and sit hdown they split right down the middle . i still have them but dont know if i can exchange or not
 Much to my disappointment , these pants arrive with elastic band torn out of them ; I have had to take to local cleaners to repair the band = $ 20.00 cost out of pocket ; I was going to order two more pair , but have canceled said order !!!
 For a big and tall pant , this is an awful fit . I wear a 44W x 34L , so I was glad to find that Amazon carried Docker 's in this size . Saves a trip to the mall . Price seemed good . When I got these pants I was very disappointed . While the fit in the waist and length were tight on , the butt and the thights were sized like a skinny jean a teenage boy might wear . Not at all the fit I was expecting . Very misleading . I have bought the `` signature '' khaki through JC Penney in their stores tons of times so I thought I was getting the same thing with a nice comfortable fit , you know , the things dockers are know for . I was really disappointed that amazon would not reimburse the shipping saying that incorrect fit is not their problem . I told them it was a case of incorrect descriptions , but they did n't care . How the hell did they win for best customer service a couple years ago ? I do n't see it . Do n't buy these unless you a tall fat guy who wants a really tight pair of pants .
 I expected the same Dockers I 've been buying for years . These are not them . The waist does n't close with a button . It closes with a hidden button and a hook . It 's more like dress pants . The color I got is called `` cloud '' which makes me think white . I have several older pairs that I think of as white . The color is more like a light-khaki instead . And finally , there is a piece of elastic in the left and right sides so that the waist can expand . I 've never seen such a feature on Dockers and do n't like it . It makes the pants too loose and they do n't hold my shirt tail in . I can cinch up the belt but then it looks all pleated at the waist . The delivery was not a problem but these were the only available Dockers I could find in 40x36 anywhere on Amazon and they do n't have the features I wanted . I already washed them and its too late to return or I would .
 Other reviews dead on , these are not what I expected , I took a chance because I needed green pants , the waist size was right , but the pants are tight in the thigh and butt area , I do not like the elastic above both side pockets , I probably will not wear again , salvation army for these !
 Bought a size larger than I am , pants were loose in the waist , but looked like skinny jeans on my thighs . I did n't have time to return them , so I just wrote them off and ordered WAY larger . Legs fit , waist could fit an elephant . However , after two weeks both pairs are already falling apart . The pocket seems have split , and they both have random holes that Remind me of rotting canvas . They also wrinkle if you look at them . I have never owned a fabric that wrinkles so quickly.DO NOT BUY ANY OF THESE PANTS . The size does n't matter , the style does n't matter , they are all absolute garbage . Dockers used to be a quality brand , now they are even pants fit for the homeless .
 As you can review my purchases with you they are quite a few and never have I complained because there was no reason . Sadly there is always a first time , the Dark Khaki pants I bought at the part where it streches the cloth ripped open , this happened on both sides and I was very very surprised , I tried to put them on once and that was when it happened , I took it to a tailor to fx them but told me the cloth was rotten , pudrid.I want to know with my record with you can you please send me no charge a new pair of pants , if you send them to me I will be able to return the ones I have in the package you send me the new ones if you want me to return them , I have already spent $ 20.00 trying to fix them but with no success.Please let me know your feed back . I wrote a few days ago to the packaging division with no answer up to know.I hope I have better luck with you.With kindest Regards , Jules Garcia
 I gave this product 1 star only because I ca n't give it 0 . Unfortunately I bought three pair of these pants . They fit fine in the waist , seat and hips , but were cut so shockingly lean in the legs as to be unwearable . -LRB- No , my weight/size has n't changed since an earlier purchase of these pants in the same size . -RRB- I see another reviewer commented on this same problem . Dockers has apparently drastically altered its sizing - or it has a new supplier who has no idea how to size pants.I also bought several pairs of shirts and had the same problem with them . They fit the torso fine but I felt like my forearms were going to split the material , and I could barely button the cuffs . It 's as if the sleeves were from a child 's shirt . Same thing with the pants . There may be some men somewhere in the world who can wear these pants and shirts , but they must be tiny-boned and without a muscle in their arms and legs.I have completely lost confidence in Dockers . They ca n't make the price low enough for me to ever buy any of their clothing again . Even if it were free , what good is an article of clothing that you ca n't wear without physical discomfort ?
 The product that was sent was NOT what was listed in the online site . The retail site was nice enough to refund the purchase ; however , their customer service never admitted to the listing error .
 Dickies - Girls ' Flat Front Pantsi found the same pants at walmart.com for $ 12 each . Why would i pay more in amazon.com ?
 I returned all 3 pair I ordered due to sizing - WAY TOO SMALL for the size I ordered !
 The Chantelle Bra was incorrectly sized ! The Bra was supposed to be a DDDD but instead I was sold an H or a Z cup ? Anyway the cup size on the bra was completely wrong and immensely huge ! One of my boobs was pointing east and the other to the west ! I do n't know about you but I like my tiots in the middle . Do not buy a bra from this seller it will end in great dissapointment and a total and complete ripoff !

 The stretch waistband is the worst design in 15 years of wearing Dockers . Had to sew it closed to stabilize the waistband . Shirt would n't stay tucked and waistband stretch mechanism tended to fail . STAY AWAY FROM THIS CATASTROPHE OF POOR DESIGN !
 These fit well and seem well made.However , the claim they make in the description that they 're wrinkle free is a joke!These wrinkle worse than any other pants I own.I can put a clean dry pair on , sit down in a chair for five minutes , and then stand up and the result is the front being covered with unsightly wrinkles that do n't go away .
 These Dockers are very poorly made of low quality material.Of four pairs that I purchased two pairs were unwearable after the first use.I have several pairs of Dockers that I have worn for more than ten years and do n't recall ever having a seam failure . I have experienced a belt loop tearing out , but this was after many years of normal wear.I ordered these items from my Amazon order history as direct replacements of those received from earlier ordersThe problems with the new pants occurred the first or second time I wore them . One pair these new pants have ripped out at the seam and the other ripped from the waist line to the back of the knee away from any seams.I do n't believe that the pants I received were made by Dockers even though they had the Docker labels .
 Come on Amazon , get with the it and put up decent description!These are not your standard Dockers!They are the comfort wait which unless you know what it is you will most likely hate it .
 Long-time Dockers fan , wearing 38x36 khakis . `` Modern waistband '' is not an accurate or complete description of an elastic , poorly designed panel for those with roller-coaster waistlines . For me this feature detracts from the fit . I have had the same waistline for over thirty years and do n't need elastic for a fit -- elastic that will likely create problems over time without adding value . I returned my order with regrets that Dockers had ruined the fit that I have enjoyed for so long . Pants otherwise were the same old Dockers that I have grown to appreciate . Now I have to look elsewhere for a proper fit .
 I chose this rating because the inseam was not 36 &#34; . I measured after I noticed they looked a little shorter than usual . A little more attention to detail please . The inseam was 35 1/2 &#34; . When you are tall and have difficulty finding pants that 1/2 ' makes a big difference .
 The description of this pant mentions a `` modern waistband . '' It should say a `` stretch '' or `` elastic '' waistband -LRB- that when extended shows the white lining of the pockets ... like cheaper pants from other retailers ... like the one that starts with `` J.C. '' -RRB- . Unlike the Dockers I have always purchased , this is a design downgrade that I was not expecting based on the item description and my prior purchases . Had to return the pants.I will say that Amazon made the return process easy and free ... way to go Amazon ! 5 stars on their commitment to customers .
 Actually it should be ZERO stars !!! REALLY DISAPPOINTED !!! I love the Baggallini bags and own a couple of them . I have been thinking on getting the red Only Bagg for a long time and when I saw the price I could n't resist . This bag seems to be an imitation or second hand item . It does NOT have all of the zippered pockets -LRB- 7 -RRB- inside and is missing the 2 meshed bottle holders completely !!! The coin purse is missing the id window as well . Amazon is sending an replacement , so I will update my comments once it arrives.Well , I received the replacement and again the Bagg was not up to the quality I 'm used to from Baggallini . Both Baggs have been returned . VERY DISSAPOINTED !!!
 I bought this bag based on the Amazon reviews and I completely disagree with most of them . This bag is bulky , and the lining is so thin between compartments that the bag has no structure . If you put something in the middle compartment , it sticks out in to the outer compartments and everything feels like a big mess . The bag is n't deep enough and feels bulky on my shoulder when filled -LRB- not over-stuffed -RRB- . Not a good bag .
 I was very disappointed that the bag was not as photographed . A key selling point was the photo window on the small enclosed bag pictured . If the photos can not be trusted , I am going to be very cautious about buying items from Amazon .
 Felt that the quality was quite poor for the price . Gratefully , I was able to return it . The customer service was good .
 The Chantelle Bra was incorrectly sized ! The Bra was supposed to be a DDDD but instead I was sold an H or a Z cup ? Anyway the cup size on the bra was completely wrong and immensely huge ! One of my boobs was pointing east and the other to the west ! I do n't know about you but I like my tiots in the middle . Do not buy a bra from this seller it will end in great dissapointment and a total and complete ripoff !
 I ordered gift wrapping and the scarf was wrapped in `` natural '' tissue . No box , no ribbon . Disappointing . After I posted a review describing my dissatisfaction , I was contacted by the company . They explained that , in the crush of holiday orders , they had failed to wrap my gift and were refunding the charge for gift wrapping . The natural tissue was their customary non-gift wrapped presentation.I am impressed that the company tracked me down , not an easy task since Amazon will not release my contact information . I feel that the refund is an honorable resolution to their failure to include the gift wrapping with my order .

 I returned the 2 pair of Dockers for a refund . The material was not worth the expensive price tag , even on sale . I found a higher quality pant from another brand for about a third of the price . Much happier . Amazon was great to work with however .
 The stretch waistband is the worst design in 15 years of wearing Dockers . Had to sew it closed to stabilize the waistband . Shirt would n't stay tucked and waistband stretch mechanism tended to fail . STAY AWAY FROM THIS CATASTROPHE OF POOR DESIGN !
 These fit well and seem well made.However , the claim they make in the description that they 're wrinkle free is a joke!These wrinkle worse than any other pants I own.I can put a clean dry pair on , sit down in a chair for five minutes , and then stand up and the result is the front being covered with unsightly wrinkles that do n't go away .

 i didnt evan last 20 min in the . as soon as i put them on walked down stairs and sit hdown they split right down the middle . i still have them but dont know if i can exchange or not
 Much to my disappointment , these pants arrive with elastic band torn out of them ; I have had to take to local cleaners to repair the band = $ 20.00 cost out of pocket ; I was going to order two more pair , but have canceled said order !!!
 For a big and tall pant , this is an awful fit . I wear a 44W x 34L , so I was glad to find that Amazon carried Docker 's in this size . Saves a trip to the mall . Price seemed good . When I got these pants I was very disappointed . While the fit in the waist and length were tight on , the butt and the thights were sized like a skinny jean a teenage boy might wear . Not at all the fit I was expecting . Very misleading . I have bought the `` signature '' khaki through JC Penney in their stores tons of times so I thought I was getting the same thing with a nice comfortable fit , you know , the things dockers are know for . I was really disappointed that amazon would not reimburse the shipping saying that incorrect fit is not their problem . I told them it was a case of incorrect descriptions , but they did n't care . How the hell did they win for best customer service a couple years ago ? I do n't see it . Do n't buy these unless you a tall fat guy who wants a really tight pair of pants .
 I expected the same Dockers I 've been buying for years . These are not them . The waist does n't close with a button . It closes with a hidden button and a hook . It 's more like dress pants . The color I got is called `` cloud '' which makes me think white . I have several older pairs that I think of as white . The color is more like a light-khaki instead . And finally , there is a piece of elastic in the left and right sides so that the waist can expand . I 've never seen such a feature on Dockers and do n't like it . It makes the pants too loose and they do n't hold my shirt tail in . I can cinch up the belt but then it looks all pleated at the waist . The delivery was not a problem but these were the only available Dockers I could find in 40x36 anywhere on Amazon and they do n't have the features I wanted . I already washed them and its too late to return or I would .
 Other reviews dead on , these are not what I expected , I took a chance because I needed green pants , the waist size was right , but the pants are tight in the thigh and butt area , I do not like the elastic above both side pockets , I probably will not wear again , salvation army for these !
 Bought a size larger than I am , pants were loose in the waist , but looked like skinny jeans on my thighs . I did n't have time to return them , so I just wrote them off and ordered WAY larger . Legs fit , waist could fit an elephant . However , after two weeks both pairs are already falling apart . The pocket seems have split , and they both have random holes that Remind me of rotting canvas . They also wrinkle if you look at them . I have never owned a fabric that wrinkles so quickly.DO NOT BUY ANY OF THESE PANTS . The size does n't matter , the style does n't matter , they are all absolute garbage . Dockers used to be a quality brand , now they are even pants fit for the homeless .
 As you can review my purchases with you they are quite a few and never have I complained because there was no reason . Sadly there is always a first time , the Dark Khaki pants I bought at the part where it streches the cloth ripped open , this happened on both sides and I was very very surprised , I tried to put them on once and that was when it happened , I took it to a tailor to fx them but told me the cloth was rotten , pudrid.I want to know with my record with you can you please send me no charge a new pair of pants , if you send them to me I will be able to return the ones I have in the package you send me the new ones if you want me to return them , I have already spent $ 20.00 trying to fix them but with no success.Please let me know your feed back . I wrote a few days ago to the packaging division with no answer up to know.I hope I have better luck with you.With kindest Regards , Jules Garcia
 I gave this product 1 star only because I ca n't give it 0 . Unfortunately I bought three pair of these pants . They fit fine in the waist , seat and hips , but were cut so shockingly lean in the legs as to be unwearable . -LRB- No , my weight/size has n't changed since an earlier purchase of these pants in the same size . -RRB- I see another reviewer commented on this same problem . Dockers has apparently drastically altered its sizing - or it has a new supplier who has no idea how to size pants.I also bought several pairs of shirts and had the same problem with them . They fit the torso fine but I felt like my forearms were going to split the material , and I could barely button the cuffs . It 's as if the sleeves were from a child 's shirt . Same thing with the pants . There may be some men somewhere in the world who can wear these pants and shirts , but they must be tiny-boned and without a muscle in their arms and legs.I have completely lost confidence in Dockers . They ca n't make the price low enough for me to ever buy any of their clothing again . Even if it were free , what good is an article of clothing that you ca n't wear without physical discomfort ?
 The product that was sent was NOT what was listed in the online site . The retail site was nice enough to refund the purchase ; however , their customer service never admitted to the listing error .
 The Chantelle Bra was incorrectly sized ! The Bra was supposed to be a DDDD but instead I was sold an H or a Z cup ? Anyway the cup size on the bra was completely wrong and immensely huge ! One of my boobs was pointing east and the other to the west ! I do n't know about you but I like my tiots in the middle . Do not buy a bra from this seller it will end in great dissapointment and a total and complete ripoff !
 I returned all 3 pair I ordered due to sizing - WAY TOO SMALL for the size I ordered !
 I have bought 3 Ogio backpacks over the years . My first one lasted literally seven years - mid-way through high school to college - and looked extremely good for about 5 of those years . My second one lasted about 2 years ; I attributed the short lilfe to the fact that I took it traveling across Asia.I got my last one last May 2012 and it has literally fallen apart . Completely . The front-chest clip fell off after three weeks - bad sign . The main zipper no longer works - the zippers just run along the outside . The front packet cloth completely tore off around the entire edge . I cut it off so it would n't just flap around -LRB- not aesthetically attractive -RRB- . The pencil pouch zipper has also stopped working . I could not be more disappointed . $ 60 for this type of shoddy craftsmanship ? Completely unacceptable.Ogio has clearly decided to cut costs and milk their traditional quality brand . Bad move -- leads to crappy products . I will never buy Ogio again and would not recommend anyone else does either .
 backpack looks great . BUT ! shipping was horrible . my ogio came with a huge rip in the front.ruined my first week of college . had to carry my books and buy a new backback.so much for this .
 I do n't understand the positive reviews on this pack because it fell apart under light use in just 2 months.I 'd give this zero stars if possible . -LSB- ... -RSB- . Stay away from this POS ! I 'll never buy an OGIO product again because I 've never owned a backpack that has fallen apart this quickly or extensively - especially under such light use.Advice for OGIO : Product test the pack and maybe you 'll realize you 've chosen the wrong material and stitching . FAIL !!!! and worst part is there 's no way to return it even though they say it 's under warranty.Thanks for stealing my money.Stay away from OGIO crap .
 I am very disappointed in the quality of this product.I have been using this product since I bought it in September to carry my books at school.Last week the entire bottom of this backpack ripped open and dumped everything on the floor.The features of this pack are awesome.I love the laptop pocket and all of the other cool pockets and handles.This is such a comfortable and feature rich bag.It is such a shame that the quality is so poor.I have not done anything abnormally crazy , this is just from Normal daily use.I guess that I am going to have to kiss my 60 bucks goodbye .
 Dickies - Girls ' Flat Front Pantsi found the same pants at walmart.com for $ 12 each . Why would i pay more in amazon.com ?

 I was looking for something sexy but not sleazy , and when I saw this I thought I 'd hit the jackpot ; it was marked down from about 30 dollars to 10 , and it looked like exactly what I wanted . Unfortunately I learned the hard way that you get what you pay for - this was terrible . It was white rather than baby pink , it was badly made , and had a saggy fit in the shoulder straps . I wo n't be buying from this seller again .

 Bought this for my wife and am disappointed . What arrived does n't look quite as plush as pictured , had a stain on it , and started to unravel after the first washing . Will probably stick to clothes shopping in person from now on .
 Robe arrived as gift from a friend ; what a waste of money . The first washing had it unravel along the hem line and belt . Lint trap filled up so full it was hard to pull the trap out of the machine to clean it . Material very thin . Not spa quality by any means . Keep shopping for the real deal .

Sadly there is always a first time , the Dark Khaki pants I bought at the part where it streches the cloth ripped open , this happened on both sides and I was very very surprised , I tried to put them on once and that was when it happened , I took it to a tailor to fx them but told me the cloth was rotten , pudrid.I want to know with my record with you can you please send me no charge a new pair of pants , if you send them to me I will be able to return the ones I have in the package you send me the new ones if you want me to return them , I have already spent $ 20.00 trying to fix them but with no success.Please let me know your feed back . I wrote a few days ago to the packaging division with no answer up to know.I hope I have better luck with you.With kindest Regards , Jules Garcia
 I gave this product 1 star only because I ca n't give it 0 . Unfortunately I bought three pair of these pants . They fit fine in the waist , seat and hips , but were cut so shockingly lean in the legs as to be unwearable . -LRB- No , my weight/size has n't changed since an earlier purchase of these pants in the same size . -RRB- I see another reviewer commented on this same problem . Dockers has apparently drastically altered its sizing - or it has a new supplier who has no idea how to size pants.I also bought several pairs of shirts and had the same problem with them . They fit the torso fine but I felt like my forearms were going to split the material , and I could barely button the cuffs . It 's as if the sleeves were from a child 's shirt . Same thing with the pants . There may be some men somewhere in the world who can wear these pants and shirts , but they must be tiny-boned and without a muscle in their arms and legs.I have completely lost confidence in Dockers . They ca n't make the price low enough for me to ever buy any of their clothing again . Even if it were free , what good is an article of clothing that you ca n't wear without physical discomfort ?
 i didnt evan last 20 min in the . as soon as i put them on walked down stairs and sit hdown they split right down the middle . i still have them but dont know if i can exchange or not
 The Chantelle Bra was incorrectly sized ! The Bra was supposed to be a DDDD but instead I was sold an H or a Z cup ? Anyway the cup size on the bra was completely wrong and immensely huge ! One of my boobs was pointing east and the other to the west ! I do n't know about you but I like my tiots in the middle . Do not buy a bra from this seller it will end in great dissapointment and a total and complete ripoff !

 I bought this bra because the ad says 100 % cotton . There is no cotton in this bra . It is 76 % nylon and 24 % elastane . If you want a cotton bra , this is not for you .
 Dickies - Girls ' Flat Front Pantsi found the same pants at walmart.com for $ 12 each . Why would i pay more in amazon.com ?
 For a big and tall pant , this is an awful fit . I wear a 44W x 34L , so I was glad to find that Amazon carried Docker 's in this size . Saves a trip to the mall . Price seemed good . When I got these pants I was very disappointed . While the fit in the waist and length were tight on , the butt and the thights were sized like a skinny jean a teenage boy might wear . Not at all the fit I was expecting . Very misleading . I have bought the `` signature '' khaki through JC Penney in their stores tons of times so I thought I was getting the same thing with a nice comfortable fit , you know , the things dockers are know for . I was really disappointed that amazon would not reimburse the shipping saying that incorrect fit is not their problem . I told them it was a case of incorrect descriptions , but they did n't care . How the hell did they win for best customer service a couple years ago ? I do n't see it . Do n't buy these unless you a tall fat guy who wants a really tight pair of pants .
 I expected the same Dockers I 've been buying for years . These are not them . The waist does n't close with a button . It closes with a hidden button and a hook . It 's more like dress pants . The color I got is called `` cloud '' which makes me think white . I have several older pairs that I think of as white . The color is more like a light-khaki instead . And finally , there is a piece of elastic in the left and right sides so that the waist can expand . I 've never seen such a feature on Dockers and do n't like it . It makes the pants too loose and they do n't hold my shirt tail in . I can cinch up the belt but then it looks all pleated at the waist . The delivery was not a problem but these were the only available Dockers I could find in 40x36 anywhere on Amazon and they do n't have the features I wanted . I already washed them and its too late to return or I would .
 Other reviews dead on , these are not what I expected , I took a chance because I needed green pants , the waist size was right , but the pants are tight in the thigh and butt area , I do not like the elastic above both side pockets , I probably will not wear again , salvation army for these !
 Bought a size larger than I am , pants were loose in the waist , but looked like skinny jeans on my thighs . I did n't have time to return them , so I just wrote them off and ordered WAY larger . Legs fit , waist could fit an elephant . However , after two weeks both pairs are already falling apart . The pocket seems have split , and they both have random holes that Remind me of rotting canvas . They also wrinkle if you look at them . I have never owned a fabric that wrinkles so quickly.DO NOT BUY ANY OF THESE PANTS . The size does n't matter , the style does n't matter , they are all absolute garbage . Dockers used to be a quality brand , now they are even pants fit for the homeless .

 Much to my disappointment , these pants arrive with elastic band torn out of them ; I have had to take to local cleaners to repair the band = $ 20.00 cost out of pocket ; I was going to order two more pair , but have canceled said order !!!
 The stretch waistband is the worst design in 15 years of wearing Dockers . Had to sew it closed to stabilize the waistband . Shirt would n't stay tucked and waistband stretch mechanism tended to fail . STAY AWAY FROM THIS CATASTROPHE OF POOR DESIGN !
 Come on Amazon , get with the it and put up decent description!These are not your standard Dockers!They are the comfort wait which unless you know what it is you will most likely hate it .
 Long-time Dockers fan , wearing 38x36 khakis . `` Modern waistband '' is not an accurate or complete description of an elastic , poorly designed panel for those with roller-coaster waistlines . For me this feature detracts from the fit . I have had the same waistline for over thirty years and do n't need elastic for a fit -- elastic that will likely create problems over time without adding value . I returned my order with regrets that Dockers had ruined the fit that I have enjoyed for so long . Pants otherwise were the same old Dockers that I have grown to appreciate . Now I have to look elsewhere for a proper fit .
 I chose this rating because the inseam was not 36 &#34; . I measured after I noticed they looked a little shorter than usual . A little more attention to detail please . The inseam was 35 1/2 &#34; . When you are tall and have difficulty finding pants that 1/2 ' makes a big difference .
 The description of this pant mentions a `` modern waistband . '' It should say a `` stretch '' or `` elastic '' waistband -LRB- that when extended shows the white lining of the pockets ... like cheaper pants from other retailers ... like the one that starts with `` J.C. '' -RRB- . Unlike the Dockers I have always purchased , this is a design downgrade that I was not expecting based on the item description and my prior purchases . Had to return the pants.I will say that Amazon made the return process easy and free ... way to go Amazon ! 5 stars on their commitment to customers .
 I returned the 2 pair of Dockers for a refund . The material was not worth the expensive price tag , even on sale . I found a higher quality pant from another brand for about a third of the price . Much happier . Amazon was great to work with however .

 These fit well and seem well made.However , the claim they make in the description that they 're wrinkle free is a joke!These wrinkle worse than any other pants I own.I can put a clean dry pair on , sit down in a chair for five minutes , and then stand up and the result is the front being covered with unsightly wrinkles that do n't go away .
 These Dockers are very poorly made of low quality material.Of four pairs that I purchased two pairs were unwearable after the first use.I have several pairs of Dockers that I have worn for more than ten years and do n't recall ever having a seam failure . I have experienced a belt loop tearing out , but this was after many years of normal wear.I ordered these items from my Amazon order history as direct replacements of those received from earlier ordersThe problems with the new pants occurred the first or second time I wore them . One pair these new pants have ripped out at the seam and the other ripped from the waist line to the back of the knee away from any seams.I do n't believe that the pants I received were made by Dockers even though they had the Docker labels .

 Bought a size larger than I am , pants were loose in the waist , but looked like skinny jeans on my thighs . I did n't have time to return them , so I just wrote them off and ordered WAY larger . Legs fit , waist could fit an elephant . However , after two weeks both pairs are already falling apart . The pocket seems have split , and they both have random holes that Remind me of rotting canvas . They also wrinkle if you look at them . I have never owned a fabric that wrinkles so quickly.DO NOT BUY ANY OF THESE PANTS . The size does n't matter , the style does n't matter , they are all absolute garbage . Dockers used to be a quality brand , now they are even pants fit for the homeless .
 As you can review my purchases with you they are quite a few and never have I complained because there was no reason . Sadly there is always a first time , the Dark Khaki pants I bought at the part where it streches the cloth ripped open , this happened on both sides and I was very very surprised , I tried to put them on once and that was when it happened , I took it to a tailor to fx them but told me the cloth was rotten , pudrid.I want to know with my record with you can you please send me no charge a new pair of pants , if you send them to me I will be able to return the ones I have in the package you send me the new ones if you want me to return them , I have already spent $ 20.00 trying to fix them but with no success.Please let me know your feed back . I wrote a few days ago to the packaging division with no answer up to know.I hope I have better luck with you.With kindest Regards , Jules Garcia
 I gave this product 1 star only because I ca n't give it 0 . Unfortunately I bought three pair of these pants . They fit fine in the waist , seat and hips , but were cut so shockingly lean in the legs as to be unwearable . -LRB- No , my weight/size has n't changed since an earlier purchase of these pants in the same size . -RRB- I see another reviewer commented on this same problem . Dockers has apparently drastically altered its sizing - or it has a new supplier who has no idea how to size pants.I also bought several pairs of shirts and had the same problem with them . They fit the torso fine but I felt like my forearms were going to split the material , and I could barely button the cuffs . It 's as if the sleeves were from a child 's shirt . Same thing with the pants . There may be some men somewhere in the world who can wear these pants and shirts , but they must be tiny-boned and without a muscle in their arms and legs.I have completely lost confidence in Dockers . They ca n't make the price low enough for me to ever buy any of their clothing again . Even if it were free , what good is an article of clothing that you ca n't wear without physical discomfort ?
 The product that was sent was NOT what was listed in the online site . The retail site was nice enough to refund the purchase ; however , their customer service never admitted to the listing error .
 i didnt evan last 20 min in the . as soon as i put them on walked down stairs and sit hdown they split right down the middle . i still have them but dont know if i can exchange or not
 Much to my disappointment , these pants arrive with elastic band torn out of them ; I have had to take to local cleaners to repair the band = $ 20.00 cost out of pocket ; I was going to order two more pair , but have canceled said order !!!
 For a big and tall pant , this is an awful fit . I wear a 44W x 34L , so I was glad to find that Amazon carried Docker 's in this size . Saves a trip to the mall . Price seemed good . When I got these pants I was very disappointed . While the fit in the waist and length were tight on , the butt and the thights were sized like a skinny jean a teenage boy might wear . Not at all the fit I was expecting . Very misleading . I have bought the `` signature '' khaki through JC Penney in their stores tons of times so I thought I was getting the same thing with a nice comfortable fit , you know , the things dockers are know for . I was really disappointed that amazon would not reimburse the shipping saying that incorrect fit is not their problem . I told them it was a case of incorrect descriptions , but they did n't care . How the hell did they win for best customer service a couple years ago ? I do n't see it . Do n't buy these unless you a tall fat guy who wants a really tight pair of pants .
 I expected the same Dockers I 've been buying for years . These are not them . The waist does n't close with a button . It closes with a hidden button and a hook . It 's more like dress pants . The color I got is called `` cloud '' which makes me think white . I have several older pairs that I think of as white . The color is more like a light-khaki instead . And finally , there is a piece of elastic in the left and right sides so that the waist can expand . I 've never seen such a feature on Dockers and do n't like it . It makes the pants too loose and they do n't hold my shirt tail in . I can cinch up the belt but then it looks all pleated at the waist . The delivery was not a problem but these were the only available Dockers I could find in 40x36 anywhere on Amazon and they do n't have the features I wanted . I already washed them and its too late to return or I would .

 The stretch waistband is the worst design in 15 years of wearing Dockers . Had to sew it closed to stabilize the waistband . Shirt would n't stay tucked and waistband stretch mechanism tended to fail . STAY AWAY FROM THIS CATASTROPHE OF POOR DESIGN !
 Come on Amazon , get with the it and put up decent description!These are not your standard Dockers!They are the comfort wait which unless you know what it is you will most likely hate it .
 Long-time Dockers fan , wearing 38x36 khakis . `` Modern waistband '' is not an accurate or complete description of an elastic , poorly designed panel for those with roller-coaster waistlines . For me this feature detracts from the fit . I have had the same waistline for over thirty years and do n't need elastic for a fit -- elastic that will likely create problems over time without adding value . I returned my order with regrets that Dockers had ruined the fit that I have enjoyed for so long . Pants otherwise were the same old Dockers that I have grown to appreciate . Now I have to look elsewhere for a proper fit .
 I chose this rating because the inseam was not 36 &#34; . I measured after I noticed they looked a little shorter than usual . A little more attention to detail please . The inseam was 35 1/2 &#34; . When you are tall and have difficulty finding pants that 1/2 ' makes a big difference .
 The description of this pant mentions a `` modern waistband . '' It should say a `` stretch '' or `` elastic '' waistband -LRB- that when extended shows the white lining of the pockets ... like cheaper pants from other retailers ... like the one that starts with `` J.C. '' -RRB- . Unlike the Dockers I have always purchased , this is a design downgrade that I was not expecting based on the item description and my prior purchases . Had to return the pants.I will say that Amazon made the return process easy and free ... way to go Amazon ! 5 stars on their commitment to customers .
 I returned the 2 pair of Dockers for a refund . The material was not worth the expensive price tag , even on sale . I found a higher quality pant from another brand for about a third of the price . Much happier . Amazon was great to work with however .
 The Chantelle Bra was incorrectly sized ! The Bra was supposed to be a DDDD but instead I was sold an H or a Z cup ? Anyway the cup size on the bra was completely wrong and immensely huge ! One of my boobs was pointing east and the other to the west ! I do n't know about you but I like my tiots in the middle . Do not buy a bra from this seller it will end in great dissapointment and a total and complete ripoff !

 These Dockers are very poorly made of low quality material.Of four pairs that I purchased two pairs were unwearable after the first use.I have several pairs of Dockers that I have worn for more than ten years and do n't recall ever having a seam failure . I have experienced a belt loop tearing out , but this was after many years of normal wear.I ordered these items from my Amazon order history as direct replacements of those received from earlier ordersThe problems with the new pants occurred the first or second time I wore them . One pair these new pants have ripped out at the seam and the other ripped from the waist line to the back of the knee away from any seams.I do n't believe that the pants I received were made by Dockers even though they had the Docker labels .

 The Chantelle Bra was incorrectly sized ! The Bra was supposed to be a DDDD but instead I was sold an H or a Z cup ? Anyway the cup size on the bra was completely wrong and immensely huge ! One of my boobs was pointing east and the other to the west ! I do n't know about you but I like my tiots in the middle . Do not buy a bra from this seller it will end in great dissapointment and a total and complete ripoff !

 I received wrong item , but there was no service after that .
 I ordered womens sweat pants extra large and I was sent mens extra large.They are to big.Instead of sending them back I use them for bed only . I am very disappointed in this mix up . I know that extra large in womens fit me right .
 These sucked . I wear a small in everything . so i ordered these in a small , and they were like balloon pants that went all the way up to my chest ! worst buy from internet , ever .

 I tried it on , fits well , good support and tummy control , great under clothes ... BUT HOW DO I GO TO BATHROOM WITH THIS ON ??? I would have to take off my top and remove it all the way to go to the bathroom . If I knew it did n't have a snap on off bottom , I would n't of bought it . My fault and waste of money .

 I bought this raincoat -LRB- at Nordstrom -RRB- as a stylish solution for a travel/rain coat . The coat is beautiful , and I get lots of compliments , but I also get soaked . It is definitely not waterproof ; it is water resistant . Carry an umbrella or you will get soaked in a heavy rain . I feel as if I wasted over $ 200 .
 Although I am looking forward to receiving the merchandise as of yet I have not received the merchandise . It has been quite sometime and although promised that the merchandise would be coming in last Wednesday I am beginning to loose hope !!

 Its itchy and Does not keep you very warm falls apart after ten washes . Iwould recomend carharrt L.Johns all the way
 While these bottoms are warm , they do n't fit very well -LRB- long in the waist area -RRB- and Iwould not recommend them . I have tried different brands of these all in the small size , -LRB- I am 6 foot and thin -RRB- and some fit very well while others do n't . They are all long enough , but some of them fit weird in the waist area , -LRB- length , not width -RRB- go figure .
 bought these so called double insulated thermals , they do not perform as advertised.they might begood for a cold day in the bahamas when it gets to 80 degress otherwise do n't bother.I will never again buy from this manufactor .
 IT 's warm and comfortable , since I choose the `` middle '' , i figure it should be just suitable for my body . But it 's a little to long for me.Also , the piture shows that it includes cloth and trousers but in fact there are just the trousers ... . I have a feeling that I 'm cheated ! ...

 I was mislead by the advertisement . The shorts are skin thin and do n't have pockets in them . Quality it is ok for what they really are ... pijama shorts.Maybe it is my problem 'cause I am not a native English language speaker , maybe not .
 I took a chance on these shorts sight unseen and unfortunately I gave them away after trying them on . The fabric is some sort of icky synthetic and feels terrible .

 Rib Caps are fine as long as they stay on the head . The problem occurred when the conditions were heavy snow and the Ribcap became very wet . I crashed twice and the Ribcap fell off both times . Not only did the Ribcap not protect at all as it flew off , I then had to retrieve the Ribcap from down the slope.Some Ribcaps have ties to secure them but I feel that the non secured Caps are very dangerous as they expand when wet and give a false illusion of protection.I believe that these products should be withdrawn immediately before someone seriously hurts themselves .

 I was really dissapointed when I got my 3 new bras -LRB- black , white , bare -RRB- ... First , I am a 34C and they are ment to fit a 34B cup personSecond , they are not `` lightly lined '' THEY ARE LINED so , besides more bulky material ... it is impossible to try and strech the cup a bit.In conclution , I had to give them away ... what 's worse , I live outside USA and I had someone deliver them home to me so ... It was a waste of money and effort .
 When I look it the Lily of France Value In style microfiber seamless lightly lined underwire with soft stretch pad , best beige 34A , I found it has a metal cycle . I did not like it at once . Only the metal cycle on it , I feel it is too cool for a woman . I like a plastic cycle on it . It is better than a metal one .
 Agree with the first reviewer . On the bras I received , it was the bra 's band that was at least half the size it should 've been . Would 've fit around my thigh , not my rib cage . Its amazing that these ever left the factory . Helloooo quality control ?
 I now wear a 34DD of a different brand , but lost some weight in the rib cage area , so the bra band is a little loose . I decided to buy this bra in 32DD . When I took this bra out of the box , I knew right away that it was too small . I took out one of my 34DD 's and put it next to this bra , Le Mystere Women 's Ybra size 32DD . The cup size of this new bra looked to be only 1/4th the size of my old bra . I could barely fit my fist into the cup of this bra . I did n't even bother to try it on . This bra looks more like a deep B cup , not a DD . I gave it one star because it looks well made . I promptly returned it . I am gratefull to Amazon for their quick response to my return and for crediting my money back so soon .

 The material is okay . The snaps are plastic instead of metal and I have no idea how long they 'll last . No idea because there 's no chance that my children can wear these . At 9 months old , these should fit them in maybe six months . Seriously . It 's about 30 inches long from shoulder to toe . The size I got was 9-12 month . What year old child is two and a half feet tall?I have consistently had this issue with baby garments manufactured in China . All of them are the exact same size -LRB- from 3-6 months on up -RRB- and the size seems to be approximately that of an 18 month to 2 year child.Eventually they 'll be able to wear them . Aside from the sizing and snaps , they 're cute enough . They are a very lightweight cotton suitable for summer/spring . If you have an especially large child , I can see this being awesome . Or if you 're looking for clothes for a young toddler . The snaps are worrisome and cheap , but I do n't mind cheap for the price , as long as they keep working after going through the laundry a few times . We 'll see .
 I was really dissapointed when I got my 3 new bras -LRB- black , white , bare -RRB- ... First , I am a 34C and they are ment to fit a 34B cup personSecond , they are not `` lightly lined '' THEY ARE LINED so , besides more bulky material ... it is impossible to try and strech the cup a bit.In conclution , I had to give them away ... what 's worse , I live outside USA and I had someone deliver them home to me so ... It was a waste of money and effort .
 When I look it the Lily of France Value In style microfiber seamless lightly lined underwire with soft stretch pad , best beige 34A , I found it has a metal cycle . I did not like it at once . Only the metal cycle on it , I feel it is too cool for a woman . I like a plastic cycle on it . It is better than a metal one .
 I am a big fan of Chantelle bras -- but this one is embarrasing to wear because it makes this squishy noise when you move . Strangest bra I have ever owned ... it fits well , but I do n't wear it much because of the noise ?? Anyone else have this problem ? All my other Chantelle bras are great .
 Especially for the price , this bra is just terrible . The descriptions reads `` Molded underwire cups '' . Not only are the cups not molded , on the one I got , they are not padded or even lined . The construction is bad & the material is cheap . I have purchased bras for half this price that are constructed better . Maybe I got one different from the other reviewers because I just ca n't give it more than one star . I have heard this brand is good , but this particular one is not & is going back . Do n't waste your money .
 Not much to like about this sweater ... upon opening the bag , it reeks of some type of plastic/rubber smell -- if you 've ever thrown something made of plastic into a fire -- you 'll recognize the smell immediately ! It also had some kind of ` crease ' across the midriff , that bulged out like a sore thumb . After the first washing , the smell and the crease pretty much went away -- but both were still faintly noticeable . The sizes do run a little small , but they DO stretch , so you might be OK with that . I 've worn it 3 times since I got it , and after the third washing , the material on the elbows/shoulder patches are falling apart , and developing a ` threadbare ' look ... in other words , spend the money and buy a REAL wool , commando , sweater -- not this China-made , plastic crap . For the price they 're charging -- it is n't worth it .
 the sweater was to long on the bottom and the sleeves . Also the sweater was harsh on the skin . We returned the sweater with no problem . Usually my husband takes a 2X .
 I was really looking forward to receiving this sweater and disappointed that it has to be returned . The body of this sweater is too tight and too long . I am 6 ' and the size XL I purchased comes down almost below my `` backside '' without stretching . I 'll admit the days of washboard abs are behind me but only someone built like Ryan Reynolds would look good in this sweater . This is not designed for the average guy .
 I had to return this thing . It was the wrong size but even if it was n't I would have returned it anyway because its the ugliest sweater I have ever seen . Amazon was awesome on the whole returns process as always though .

 I ordered womens sweat pants extra large and I was sent mens extra large.They are to big.Instead of sending them back I use them for bed only . I am very disappointed in this mix up . I know that extra large in womens fit me right .
 These sucked . I wear a small in everything . so i ordered these in a small , and they were like balloon pants that went all the way up to my chest ! worst buy from internet , ever .

 I guess I do n't know enough about bucket hats . My keratosis face needs something to cover more of my nose and cheeks .
 After one go in the wash , this thing completely looses its shape and starts to look more like a 50s-style baby bonnet and less like the `` Puritan '' bonnet it 's supposed to be . Also , I have a problem with the label . Puritans were in the 1600s , and the manifest destiny settlers were in the 1800s . I have actually studied the `` wagon train '' settlers to some extent , and this item does not match historical drawings/pictures . Regardless , it 's a shoddy item . Do n't try to wash it - perhaps that aspect is historically accurate , in that Puritans sure did n't bathe much ...
 I am extremely disappointed in this item . The product description is completely misleading . It says the product includes the hat and jacket with attached jabot and vest , but `` includes '' is a misleading word because that 's all the package contains . There is no wig -LRB- I assumed the wig was attached to the hat -RRB- and no pants!Regarding quality , the material is flimsy and worth no more than a dime . Additionally , the `` jacket '' does n't look like a jacket at all , on this poor-quality one-piece item , and the hat does n`t hold its shape.I wrote the company 10 days ago , voicing my concerns , and received NO RESPONSE . I strongly discourage anyone from buying this product or any other from CostumeCraze.Incidentally , I shop on-line regularly with Amazon and others , and this is the first time I 've ever been compelled to write a review . That 's how disappointed I am in this product . BUYER BEWARE !

 Umbrella broke in no time but due to the life time warranty , I got a new one which I am suspecting will break soon as well even though I try to be gentle with it ... It just can not stand up to wind pressure as it claims .
 The Victorinox umbrella has a clever open and close design that is appreciated when getting in and out of cars . One hand open and close button works well.The issue is that the ribs are made of strong but very stiff steel . Stiffness is great for maintaining form but is a liability in strong winds . Willows do n't snap in strong winds . This would be a great umbrella if the steel ribs were replaced with fiberglass ribs.Mine snapped two ribs at the joints two months after purchase which is disappointing given the price.Nice attempt but the ribs are a material flaw.I do not recommend due to the poor longevity .
 It broke the first day . The mechanism does n't work anymore ... also noticed the bad quality of the plastic around the button and the button itself looks suspitious ... Also too small.Stay away .

 This was nice one time , but on laundering with other delicates dissolved and was unwearable a second time .
 I am sure my lady would have looked good in this , no doubt about it . But this product never arrived so I can not give an honest review .
 They are very cheap -LRB- in all aspects -RRB- I only bought them for a night out . And that was all they lasted . I even bought them a size bigger than what I normally wear . The moment I put them on they ripped at the toes . Then when I went to a Fund Raiser they snagged on a chair -LRB- that was n't even sharp or anything -RRB- and they were completely destroyed .

 When I ordered the jacket , I was told it was in stock . A few days later I received a disappointing email stating it would not be delivered for a month , and I could not cancel the order . After contacting the company , they assured me I would have the jacket shipped to me on 2-6-09 , but they said I could cancel after all . As of 2-9 , the jacket was still not in stock , so I cancelled the order . I do not like receiving false or misleading information from a company .

 Like the other reviewer indicates in his review , I bought these shorts expecting a 10 '' inseam , but they arrived with an 8 '' inseam . The description lists these shorts as having a 10 '' inseam . I wish I had read his review before ordering ! I called the store -LRB- 1-800-569-9038 -RRB- and in their system , this short DOES have an 8 '' inseam , so they think they sent me the appropriate item . They need to fix the info on this page ! Anyway , I was determined not to have to pay return shipping for their error . I explained the situation , and they are sending me a FedEx slip with postage paid and I can return the shorts in that . So in the end , I will have to eat the costs of shipping the shorts TO me -LRB- they wo n't refund that -RRB- and of course , I never got the shorts I wanted . At least I do n't have to pay to return them , thank goodness . Still -- it 's annoying .
 Although the item was listed as having a 10 '' inseam , it only had an 8 '' inseam . Had I known this , I would never have purchased the shorts . Because of the inaccurate listing , I had to pay shipping both ways - for delivery and to return the item . In sum , I would never do business with this seller again .
 These shorts come with a non-standard 8 '' inseams that will likely not fit anyone who is ordering their waist size if they wear a 10 '' inseam . In fact , I have a few Columbia shorts and the standard size for the inseam is 10 '' on all of them -LRB- mind you these were off the rack at Columbia stores , in their standard sizes -RRB- . 10 '' also happens to be the size that is advertized on the site , although now it says 8 '' and 10 '' inseams , without the option of choosing which one you will receive.I have asked Amazon to replace the items since they claim that the 10 '' size is available and will see how it goes . However , I would recommend that you stay clear from these shorts since they will likely not fit , unless you know an 8 '' inseam is the correct size .

 The dress looks totally different when you receive it . It is very cheap . In addition the dress is shipped from overseas . You might have to pay customs when you return it . I did n't like the material of the dress . It should not be listed as formal because of the fabric .
 My complaint is with design and quality of the Messenger bag . I first wrote in February 2010 to Baggallini and got NO REPLY . I wrote again yesterday.In February , my complaint was the cheap quality of the mesh for the water bottle holder -- it tore the second time I used it for a water bottle . The same low-weight , poor quality mesh serves as a divider in the front compartment , so I try not to put my car keys there for fear of ripping it.Then I took it on a month-long trek and saw some serious flaws in the design . The `` hidden pocket '' is misplaced . If one wears the bag to one 's front , the pocket lays across one 's mid-back , accessible only by pickpockets . If one wears the bag to one 's back , the pocket bends across the top of the shoulder.Worn to the front , the strap 's heavy metal buckle is exactly on top of the shoulder . You have a choice of wearing it close in and having the buckle riding the muscle near your neck or wearing the strap further from your neck . Then the buckle rides on the bones of your shoulder . Wearing this bag for 12 + hours a day is next to unbearable . Within a few days of my month-long trip , I bought something to pad the strap . It did n't help and by the end of the trip , my shoulder would start hurting as soon as I put the bag on . I carried only two ` heavy ' items -- camera and 16 ounce water bottle . Carrying a guide book was out of the question ; I tore out pages to carry with each new city.The ties in the zipper pulls quickly came untied will not stay re-tied ; one has been lost as a result . I wonder why the factory does n't melt the ends with heat ?? I am very , very unsatisfied with this bag .
 I love the quality , love the space . But for some reason the bag slides around and always ends up resting on my hip . Two other family members had the same issue . And the thick strap around the front is not flattering .
 This may be a fine bag , but the advertised size is 20 x 5 x 14 . The actual size is 12 x ? x 10 -- much smaller . Wasted my time ordering this .
 Overall the material is durable . I can fit a 16 oz . contigo coffee cup in the pouch . My iphone with otter box fits in the side pocket with flap , but not on the strap . The otter box makes the phone too big for this space . I have tried wearing this a few ways , none are real comfortable . The strap cuts into my neck . I like the size of the bag and pouches . My ipad with otter box fit in the big pouch but made the bag heavier than I 'd like . My wallet fit just OK in the second largest pouch . My wallet is a trifold and the width did n't work real great . I did n't want to place it in the larger area 's and rifle through stuff to get to it . I 'm not comfortable putting my credit card and drivers license in the slots build into the bag . I wish the bottom had a different material to clean after setting it down in various places . I want to love it ... but I do n't . So , I have decided to return it .
 I had ordered the bag to fit my laptop with sleeve . The description states that the size of the bag is 20 `` x14 '' . The actual size is 12 `` x9 '' which is not even close to the size that I require for my laptop .
 Size , color are great . However. , hangs very awkwardly when worn crossbody . Seems to be either in front or nearly behind me . I prefer it hang at my side . Tried different adjustments to strap but no help . Anyone out there with ideas ? Have always loved Bagallini but not happy with this one .
 I wear shoulder bags on my left shoulder - this bag did not sit comfortably on the left . Personal preference ...
 I ca n't believe I paid this much for a bag of such weird quality . The bag 's material is flimsy and light , while the strap is heavy and bulky , made of something like seatbelt webbing , it 's really slippery and falls off your shoulder . The bag looks much bigger in the picture than it really is . Not a messenger bag at all , more like a little purse - for those who actually need their bag to carry more than keys and a wallet , the large compartment is not really big enough . Also , the tomato red is really orange , not like the red in the photo . All in all I 'm really sorry I bought this .
 The moment I saw this bag I was very disappointed with the very thin and poor school bag like material and returned this item immediately ... and was even more disappointed because the seller took a $ 19 restocking fee . Do n't buy this.Also I just realized that there is no seller reviews or rating that can be set ... this is not good : - -LRB-
 I bought this bag for my daughter to take to school -LRB- 1st grade -RRB- . It is a cute bag , but the strap is bulky and much heavier than the rest of the bag . It is also much smaller than I expected . The largest compartment is not even big enough to fit her homework folder . The material is a slick material that would probably be stain resistant , but for anyone wanting to use this for work/school - DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY . It wo n't work .
 I ordered this bag and was very disappointed with it . The sling strap runs from front to back and fits snug only if you put it on your right shoulder . If you want to sometimes change and put it on the left shoulder the zip on the strap goes to the back and the bag is very uncomfortable to use . I was very unhappy with the product and design . I returned it back to Amazon who promptly gave me a refund .
 I was looking for a lightweight bag to take on vacation to Greece that would leave my hands free , be comfy and hold a reasonable amount of items . Being a messenger bag , I thought it would at least be large enough to hold a 9.5 '' x 11.75 '' folder which organized my travel papers , computer printouts etc. . Not so . The only way to zip this shut over the folder was to bend the folder and crush the corners . Just a very slight increase in size could have this bag much more functional for paperwork.The bag was indeed large enough to hold my 10.5 '' Netbook , which was great . The problem was that with the weight of only the netbook in the bag , the strap buckles dug painfully into my skin no matter how I adjusted it . I guess it would be fine if you are wearing a coat or sweater , but for summer travel , the buckle arrangement is a disaster ... unless of course you are carrying extremely minimal weight . Why these buckles were placed here I have n't a clue , and why there is no padding or strap under them is a shame . The zipped shoulder pouch seemed useless to me because of it 's position . Nothing of value should be put in it or it 's an easy target for pickpockets . It is unmovable , so you ca n't put it in front . If it is positioned on top of your shoulder with the main bag more towards your side or back , you really ca n't put anything in it but something soft and flexible because it 's right on top of your shoulder.The water bottle holder is a joke . It 's too small to fit the smallest size of my brand of water . I suppose I could go to the store and try to find an extremely skinny water bottle , but it was n't worth the effort ... the bottle would probably not hold enough to keep me hydrated anyway if it 's that small.The construction of the bag looked good , and the front zipped compartments looked very functional which is the reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 . It might be a good purse option , but not for carrying any weight at all . Too bad , I liked the look and idea of this bag but it 's design flaws made me return it to Amazon . If they made the bag ever so slightly bigger , the water bottle holder a functional size and thought out the buckle and shoulder pouch placement , this bag could be a winner .

I called the store -LRB- 1-800-569-9038 -RRB- and in their system , this short DOES have an 8 '' inseam , so they think they sent me the appropriate item . They need to fix the info on this page ! Anyway , I was determined not to have to pay return shipping for their error . I explained the situation , and they are sending me a FedEx slip with postage paid and I can return the shorts in that . So in the end , I will have to eat the costs of shipping the shorts TO me -LRB- they wo n't refund that -RRB- and of course , I never got the shorts I wanted . At least I do n't have to pay to return them , thank goodness . Still -- it 's annoying .
 Although the item was listed as having a 10 '' inseam , it only had an 8 '' inseam . Had I known this , I would never have purchased the shorts . Because of the inaccurate listing , I had to pay shipping both ways - for delivery and to return the item . In sum , I would never do business with this seller again .
 These shorts come with a non-standard 8 '' inseams that will likely not fit anyone who is ordering their waist size if they wear a 10 '' inseam . In fact , I have a few Columbia shorts and the standard size for the inseam is 10 '' on all of them -LRB- mind you these were off the rack at Columbia stores , in their standard sizes -RRB- . 10 '' also happens to be the size that is advertized on the site , although now it says 8 '' and 10 '' inseams , without the option of choosing which one you will receive.I have asked Amazon to replace the items since they claim that the 10 '' size is available and will see how it goes . However , I would recommend that you stay clear from these shorts since they will likely not fit , unless you know an 8 '' inseam is the correct size .
 My shirt is already unraveling up the side , which is ridiculous . Its not that the shirt is too small or under any stress either . I actually bought it oversized a bit . Its just not as well made as the ancient one by the same company I bought it to replace . Like many companies , this one seems to have let quality slip over the years .
 Have a 15 year old Duofold shirt that I wear during my winter runs of 4 miles . It has developed a few holes . This shirt is not close to quality and weight of the older model . I use the midweight as a dry shirt change after summer runs . It bearly keeps my sweaty torso warm in 70 degree air temperatures.Order at least one size larger . If you want to stay warm go with a heavier version or buy something else .
 I was really dissapointed when I got my 3 new bras -LRB- black , white , bare -RRB- ... First , I am a 34C and they are ment to fit a 34B cup personSecond , they are not `` lightly lined '' THEY ARE LINED so , besides more bulky material ... it is impossible to try and strech the cup a bit.In conclution , I had to give them away ... what 's worse , I live outside USA and I had someone deliver them home to me so ... It was a waste of money and effort .
 When I look it the Lily of France Value In style microfiber seamless lightly lined underwire with soft stretch pad , best beige 34A , I found it has a metal cycle . I did not like it at once . Only the metal cycle on it , I feel it is too cool for a woman . I like a plastic cycle on it . It is better than a metal one .
 I ordered this item to wear to a christmas party on Dec. 9th , paid extra shipping for 2-3 business days . My item arrived two days after the day of my event and I had to miss it as a result . This item fit nicely and was true to size , however the quality of the fabric was fair at best . I was very upset to have missed my party after paying extra for express shipping , I did not know this item shipped from China or I would have chosen differently .

 Nice concept . but the straps for adjustment are poor at best . if they would have spent a few cents more a strap the toy would have been much better . Parts do come off , do double sided tape is a must , and the lenses that you look through are so distorted walking more than a few feet would be a danger to any child enclosed . Over all poor at best .
 We soon discovered that this would be awesome if there was a volume/microphone control . The pre-programmed phrases worked fine , but when the microphone was turned on to change my son 's voice , it was too loud and full of static like a blown speaker . It sounded better if he took it off and spoke while it was further from his mouth , but that is no fun if he ca n't wear the helmet . We paid almost $ 50 dollars for this including shipping to get it by Christmas and my son only played with it a couple of times . If the glitches were corrected , it would be well worth the money , but as is , it was a waste .
 Has gone up over $ 30 in price . Do n't buy from these bloodsuckers . Fred Meyer has it for $ 34 and I 'm sure any other toy store has it as well . Hell , check Wal Mart or Target .
 I ordered a 36 '' belt . In order to get it to work , I got ta stretch it so much it almost hurts . If you order this belt , add on at LEAST 6 '' . I think the reason it is on sale is because the size is WRONG
 I tried to iron a shirt and it was a nightmare . it leaks and all the floor around got wet.In addition to that , you can spend an hour just ironing a sleeve.It is a pretty bad system , please do not purchase it , listen to a friend who is warning you !!!!
 This product looked so lovely on line , I just could n't wait to receive and so far I am still waiting for it to arrived . I have e-mailed the sender on several occassion and yet I have not received my Chef Jacket .
 This review applies to all 2 -LRB- x -RRB- ist Men 's Jeans . While the color is great , the fabric is cheap and VERY thin . I bought 4 of these jeans and dont even wear them b/c the material is very thin . Im afraid if i move to fast i might rip the jeans right at the seams . I dont recommend these jeans .

 I bought this rain gear for a hiking trip for my son . Shortly after he put it on it tore in 3 different places and did n't do a good job keeping him dry ! I bought him an XL so it was plenty big to go over his clothes so although I thought it was a good buy it ended up being a big disappointment .
 Bought this for a vacation with rain likely . My son used a couple of times on the trip with no problem . The next time he used it , a couple of months later , it tore all the way up the jacket next to the zipper . I guess it 's good for an emergency , but does n't last .
 I live in the desert so this is not something I was likely ever going to use for it 's intended purpose . I had purchased this to use as a halloween costume and for that it served it 's purpose . However , if I had intended to use it as a rain suit I would have been beyond upset . There is a seam on the inside of the pant legs and on one of the seams there was about a 6 '' tear along the inside of that seam . Needless to say , if keeping dry was my intention , it would not have worked . I think I remember reading a similar review before I purchased the product , however I was looking for a cheap outfit for halloween so it was n't a deal breaker for me .
 I PURCHASED THIS ITEM THINKING I WOULD USE IT TO SHIELD MY BODY AND CLOTHING FROM THE ELEMENTS -LRB- NOTABLY RAIN -RRB- FOR THE LITTLE TIME I SPEND OUTDOORS . THE PRICE WAS RIGHT , -LRB- $ 8.88 FOR BOTH PANTS AND JACKET ? SURE !! -RRB- AND I KNOW A GOOD DEAL WHEN I SEE ONE . THE PROBLEM WAS THAT I DIDNT SEE THIS ITEM IN PERSON SO I DIDNT REALIZE IT WAS MADE OUT OF THE CHEAPEST , THINNEST PVC LINING POSSIBLE . THE FIRST DAY I GOT TO TRY OUT THIS RAIN OUTFIT , THE PANTS RIPPED IN 2 PLACES !!!!! HOW EMBARASSING !! THE HOLE IN MY PANTS BECAME BIGGER WITH EACH STEP I TOOK AND I 'LL TELL YOU WHAT - I LOOKED LIKE A D@&% FOOL !! SEEING THE LOOKS ON PEOPLES FACES WHEN THEY SAW THE STATE OF MY RAINGEAR MADE ME DIE SEVERAL TIMES INSIDE , AND I WILL * NEVER * GET THAT PART OF ME BACK , EVEN WITH AMAZON 'S AMAZING RETURN POLICY !!! I AM 100 % AGAINST THIS PRODUCT , UNLESS YOU ARE GOING TO BE STATIONARY . IF YOU THINK YOU MIGHT ATTEMPT MOVEMENT WITHIN THIS PRODUCT - YOU ARE WRONG !! DONT EVEN BOTHER !! IF YOU ARE VIEWING THIS ITEM TO POTENTIALLY PURCAHSE , PLZ REMOVE IT FROM YOUR SHOPPING CART OR WISH LIST AND PLACE IT IN THE `` THINGS TO NEVER BUY '' TAB !! XOXO-LOUISE
 The bag as shown has a velcro closure for the handles . No velcro closure . It was advertised as the original Baggalini , but it has less storage inside . The one that was delivered the zipper was ripped on the interior . Save you rmoney , buy something else . I returned it .
 Baggallini Complete Cosmetic Bagg - The Bagallini cosmetic bag is not as well made as I would expect from them ! I have three of their other style bags and love them ! This bag 's material is thin and translucent -LRB- not their usual -RRB- , and offers no padding or protection for your contents , which may be fragile . The compartments are not well thought out -LRB- too large -RRB- and are impractical or impossible to access without other items cascading elsewhere out of the bag . Access to some compartments require you to twist sections of the bag upside down while hanging -LRB- very awkward -RRB- . The most annoying aspect of this bag is the single zipper tab , where two would have made more sense . It is difficult to locate and access contents quickly . The hanger is flimsy . Although I love the turquoise color I chose , I would not recommend this bag to anyone !
 I do n't like how this looked on , I was really unhappy with how it fits . I got a medium and it was HUGE on me , and I was hoping a medium would be tighter . it looked nothing like that pictured , the top hung much higher over the panties than pictured .

 Sport Rain SuitI was very disappointed in the rain suit pants . The seam on the pants delaminated after the first wearing . I had specifically ordered one size larger to prevent seam stress but this planning was worthless . I found myself without the coverage I had hoped for for two weeks while on vacation white water rafting in the Grand Canyon -LRB- hence unable to buy a replacement -RRB- . Perhaps these rain suits are more appropriate for the golf course .

 We thought the sunglasses looked very cute , but our dog did not think so . He 's a maltese -LRB- longer hair/fur -RRB- , so his fur would get stuck inside the glasses and in front of his eyes .

 GREAT idea with the easily visible colors , but I am not impressed with Samsonite 's luggage strap . It opens VERY EASILY . Even if someone accidentally touched the sides of the locking mechanism , it opens very easily.Samsonite USED to make an excellent luggage strap which had a little slide lock to prevent accidental opening . I 'm disappointed that Samsonite does not do this any more . Samsonite does make the combination lock luggage strap , but that is not what I wanted .
 The product is great for someone with very skinny legs . I thought I was buying queen size and maybe that was the problem , it was not .
 The product is ok . I have not worn them yet , but they are very sheer and I have a feeling they are going to run easily . My biggest issue is that the knee highs are packaged in a small envelope and they are shipped in a huge box . If it was shipped in another envelope instead of the box the company could have charge the cost of shipping a letter !! Instead you will pay more for shipping than for the cost of the product .
 I have n't worn these yet , but it seems that they will serve their purpose . My only gripe is that the product package does n't indicate how many pairs you are purchasing . I paid more for shipping than I did for the product . Had I known there was only one pair , I would have passed .
 Been looking for those for a long time . Was very exited to find them online and ordered 2 pairs . Shipment took a week . When I finally got it and put the first sock on it ripped right from the toe hole up . What a disappointment ! I was very careful putting the other sock on , tried it on with the open toe shoe . It looked great ! However when I removed the shoe my sock had a huge hole on the back . So , one pair is going to the garbage can and I am afraid to try on the second pair . The sock itself is a great idea but this particular one is a very poor quality!One star is for the idea . Would not recommend this to anyone .
 If you are looking to wear the knee highs only once then this product will work for you . I would not recommend this product at all .
 This helmet is said to origianlly cost over $ 200 , which leads one to believe this is an exceptional piece of handmade helmetry . In actually it has a Made in India sticker on the inside and it looks like it was caste from a simple mold . Another issue , I do n't have a large head , but this helmet is very wide and deep . The depth is good to stuff a shirt into for comfort , but the extra width ca n't be accomadated for . Also , the plume is attached by two nuts/bolts at either end , so without an additional support in the middle somewhere the plume can easily flop side to side . Overall , the $ 48 -LRB- after S+H -RRB- is maybe a little to much for this item .
 First and foremost , if you saw the picture and then saw the price and said `` Too good to be true '' you 're absolutely right . If you came here looking for a good fashioned Corinthian style helmet -LRB- the traditional Hoplite/Spartan helmet -RRB- you came to the wrong place . Turn around and spend your moeny somewhere else , because you 're going to get a chinsy Trojan looking helmet . I spent a good 100 on my Spartan-300 helmet and got some qualitity piece of equipment , but this was a dissapointment . Do yourself a favor and buy from a source that can actually supply historically accurate material , not something that the picture does n't even promise.If you 're looking to create a Spartan costume or are just looking for a good quality Greek helmet , do yourself a favor and do n't give into the false advertisement . Go and research and get a good buy.As a Greek who has built up his own Greek armor , I hope my testimony speaks to you all as words of wisdom . Do n't trust this source.Aroo !
 I ordered this shirt in a medium which is my normal size . The neck on the shirt was much too small for a medium shirt , and it felt like I was being gently choked . So if you really want this shirt , make sure to order it at least a size larger than you would normally .
 this pant is made tight on the thigh so if you are athletic thighs than do n't buy it ! but for skinny people , it 's great \

 This shirt 's quality is very poor and wo n't last you past two wears . The design is good but quality needs to improve dramatically . The color will fade very quickly and badly . Do n't recommend it .
 Husband bought these for work . After 5 months of light duty and a mild winter , the boots have come apart at the seams . At first they fit good and felt good , then they fell apart . These are NOT a bargain . They 're a ripoff !
 I waited two months for my size to become availible and now that i have them i am disappointed . There are not enough lace up ties for one and the two there are to small . And wahts the deal with the stupid lace buckle on the sides . All this makes the shoes impossible to tie tight and to remain tied . The only plus is that there is plenty of room for feet and toes insided the shoe .
 The way the products are linked together is misleading . All the sizes on the page make it very hard to tell what are the junior and what are the kids sizes . thought I was ordering one , got the other . Price and quality where great though . I would have spent more sending them back than I spent buying them . So I have 3 pair of worthless shorts now .
 I got these for my daughter as her swim yeam uniform . They are a terrible cut . They look really like old school gym shorts .
 I was looking for some gym shorts for my little girl . These said they were for children . The shorts were adult size . I was stuck with them as to ship them back would cost more that I paid for them . I threw them in the garbage .
 I ordered 4 pairs of LARGE , and the shorts are way too small -- might fit a 10 year old !
 IT WAS MY MISTAKE . I DID N'T REALIZE THAT THIS ITEM WAS &#34; JUNIOR &#34; SO OF COURSE THEY DID N'T FIT . I DID N'T HAVE A PACKING ORDER SO I COULD N'T RETURN THEM . I 'LL FIND SOME SMALL PERSON TO GIVE THEM TO .
 Is this a joke or what ? These are n't an adult X-large they are a childs medium . It wo n't pay to send them back because of the shipping so I wasted $ 7.99 on a cleaning rag .
 I have never received the belt but my account has been charged for it . Can you help me ?

 I just received my coat today . I have not used it yet and I 'm debating on whether to return it . The material looks nice and waterproof and comfortable , but the workmanship is terrible . The pockets have big holes in them . I put the coat on and decided to put the hood in the pocket for safekeeping . The hood fell right to the floor . Upon further examination I notice big holes in each pocket . The way the holes are set up , it looks like they were put there on purpose . I ca n't imagine why except that maybe they want to play a mean trick on you . Imaging putting your keys or cell phone in your pocket while on the trail only to find them gone at the end of the ride . Also , upon further examination , I saw that the collar was not sewn on completely and is already coming apart.The picture shows the rider 's legs all covered and comfortable , but in reality , you would have to sit on the coat to get that effect . My friend 's raincoat wraps over the horse 's rear end covering both your legs and the horse . I guess if you do n't care about soaking water into your saddle , it does n't matter , but it is deceiving .
 I bought Samsonite eye shades . AT first , I was very please with it . It is very light and comfortable to wear . Unfortunately , after I used it a couple of times , the inside layer started to come out . It is a shame how little it lasted.Samsonite Eye Shades & Earplugs

 I received this hat recently , took it in the sun , nothing . Zip . Nada . Stuck a battery in it and the fan works . So what I discovered is that you have to take it in the sun and give the fan a nudge to get it going . Then when you walk through shade , it stops . To get it going again , you have to nudge it again . Talk about annoying . It can be run off a battery instead . So technically speaking , yes it works , if you do n't mind constantly nudging the fan to restart it .
 This was a big mistake to buy . It has little or no effect as to cooling , the solar panel quit charging almost immediately and the hat itself heats up in the sun . Warning to potential customers , stay away from this piece of junk .
 I see I 'm in the minority . I ordered the hat as a father 's day gift but it seemed such a good idea that I could n't resist trying it out with the idea of getting one each for myself and my wife . When I tried it out I was so disappointed . The tiny little fan blew such a small spot on my face that I could n't tell that it really cooled at all . The sensation was , however , very annoying . It was n't at all like being in front of a fan , more like someone blowing through a straw on your face . So now I have to go through the ordeal of returning it . And btw there is a 20 % restocking fee .
 The solar panel does not work . It takes me 3 hours to mow my lawn . In northern Illinois we had a very hot and sunny summer . The fan did not ever work under solar power . If I had had the time , I would have returned this product . Lord knows that I am so sick and tired of buying % ^ * # @ crap .
 Good guality tie but it does not look as purple as shown under natural light . If you want plum , it will fti the bill . Returned .
 I love CK underwear because of its softness , but buy this only if you enjoy walking around all day with a mild wedgie .
 i just recieved the gloves and when i put them on , the thumbs are as long as the fingers , poor stiching and the fit is not what i expected . i can buy better quality gloves at any convienence store in town . i would not buy these gloves again .
 long fingers , short and skinny palms . i would go a differant route if i was to do this again . thanks .
 nice leather and stitching - thin as advertised - however the fit is completely inconsistent ... my sample size is -LRB- unfortuntely -RRB- 3 ... one is acceptable the other is not ... the third is a different size altogether ... especially the thumbs ... clown like really ... you can really get spoiled by the quality of most of the products on AzC - however this is not one of them and sniffs of the krapshoot to be had on ebay - beware ...
 This is my first review.These gloves have a label saying they 're made in Pakistan . The quality of the materials is good and thin enough for me -LRB- although the leather is a bit stiff -RRB- . However , my right hand glove has a thumb that is comically large . You can literally fight three of my fingers in that thumb.The left hand size is a lot better ; almost a 90 % fit to my fingers and thumb.It 's not worth my time or money to return , but you may also get unlucky . Rothco does not appear to have quality control standards .
 I wish I could say they the gloves are great . They arrived and I placed them in my duty bag . The package said 2X-Large , but when I removed them in the field and attempted to put them on my hand they where to small . I looked on the size inside the glove and discovered that they where size Large . I ended up giving them to one of my co-workers . I can not fairly rate the gloves ...
 These gloves are not at all what I expected , though I ordered a medium it seems the only one who would be able to fit into them would be a child , not to mention they are not warm , attractive , or really any use to me . I tried to contact the company to return them and never got an email back.TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY !!!!!!!

 I love this bag for its storage , lightness and look . The straps sit well on my shoulder and it is very comfortable to carry . I have been using it for LESS THAN a month -LRB- got it for Christmas -RRB- and today when I went to pick it up - the metal buckle that holds the handle to the bag snapped . I do n't carry anything but a laptop and my ipad in it so I know i did not over load the bag . Seriously disappointed .

 I would not classify this article of clothing as a `` jacket . '' The material is very lightweight , about the equivalent of an inexpensive denim shirt.It looks ok but certainly was n't what I expected from the description .

Only the metal cycle on it , I feel it is too cool for a woman . I like a plastic cycle on it . It is better than a metal one .
 As I have stated above , to this date , I have not received the product that I ordered , but have been charged . Please look into this for me . Thank You , Dolores Barthuly
 I first saw this Dickie 's bag during my daily commute -- a woman had the black-with-pink-stars bag slung over her shoulder and I thought it was the coolest looking bag I 'd seen in awhile . Luckily for me , the Dickie 's label was prominently displayed on the front -- so I looked up the bag on amazon later the same day.When I received the bag I was pretty happy . The material is stiff -LRB- although it does break in -RRB- and certainly seemed at least somewhat waterproof . The construction seems rugged , the stitching is tight . I had no reason to question whether or not I 'd bought a quality product . However -- my thoughts on that changed withing a few weeks.Here 's the thing . On one side of the bag -- where the strap meets the actual bag itself -- the strap is looped through an elongated `` O '' ring . This is to accommodate the adjustable strap . Because of this `` O '' ring , however , the strap bunches up and forces the O ring on to it 's side . This may not seem like a big deal , but it throws the strap off and also looks pretty stupid . It 's minor , and initially it did n't bother me too much -- but now that it 's been about 6 months it irritate me to no end . Also , the strap is permanently warped at this point -- it wo n't lay flat no matter what.So , this is an okay bag for the money -- the quality is good for the most part , the choice of designs is really nice . But it has a significant design flaw that Dickie 's needs to adjust .
 I think it is awful that this would even be advertised as a clildrens toy.Why do children need to be subjected so much violence . I was looking for a TOY that my grandson could pretend to cut trees with , NOT BLOODY
 This is retarted ! I Waited more than 1 week . And I get a toy like this ! I do n't like it . I pushed the blade in and the sound and lights do n't go off ! I have 2 other spring action light sabers and they 're a lot better . My friend had the same problem .
 I bought this product mainly because of all the excellent reviews I read about it . Unfortunately , after trying it on our toddler a few times , I have to say that I 'm a bit disappointed and I would n't recommend paying the premium price for this kind of bib.First thing , you 'll notice from the pictures that there is no protection for the arms . So unless your kid is wearing something that 's sleaveless or you roll up their sleeves all the way up to their shoulder -LRB- which probably is n't practical -RRB- , the sleeves will get dirty . I 've seen some bibs that have protection to the elbow , and I wish this bib would have incorporated some kind of arm protection . It kind of defeats the purpose of keeping the rest of the clothes clean if the arms get all dirty.Second , the velcro straps to hold the bib around the neck are too small . I wish they were longer because when we put the bib on our kid , there 's still an opening around the neck area that allows food to get under the bib and onto the clothes . If the velcro straps were longer , the bib could be tightened around the neck area to prevent this . Maybe this bib was designed for toddlers with thicker necks in mind , but having longer velcro strips would have allowed for more flexibility in neck sizes.Third , this item is pricy -LRB- ~ 3x the price of regular bibs -RRB- . I would n't have minded paying extra if it did n't have the flaws I mentioned above which still allow clothes to get dirty . I 'm thinking of just getting an art smock or one of those smocks used at a barbershop and customizing that for our toddler .
 this bib is not long . i was disappointed to find out that it only reaches my daughters torso .
 This is a great bib but it has just one problem
 I bought these for my husband , he wore them twice when the bit of plastic holding the sweatband broke off so the whole purpose of these was defeated . He works outdoors and wanted to keep the sweat out of his eyes ... no sweatband , nothing but sweat .
 I was trying unsuccessfully to replace a really nice white Columbia fleece jacket that I bought some years ago which resisted stains amazingly , looks really nice on me , and goes with everything . This is not it . This -LRB- Benton Springs Style Number 209 WL 6114 -RRB- is a cheap imitation of my old fleece Columbia jacket -LRB- style number 207 WL6114 -RRB- . I bought three Benton Springs jackets on 1-27-2010 at Sports Authority and I 'm returning at least the two white ones , where the difference in quality is really noticable . I 'm going to keep a navy blue one where the inferior cut , styling , workmanship , and quality control is not as noticable . In white , mine look cheap and slightly flawed , workmanship wise . I have another white fleece jacket from Walmart with the same problem that came as a liner with a -LRB- cheap -RRB- white raincoat.Another difference is that the new ones are fuzzier , softer and thicker and the white is pinker . That would be fine if it hung and fit nicely like it 's predessor.It 's so hard to replace women 's clothes when they wear out , even in classic styles . Often I have to go to another brand to get the same thing since it 's `` out of style '' in the brand I start with . Are they assuming it never wears out ? The zipper eventually broke on my original Columbia fleece jacket , not before I got a lot of wear out of it , and a white jacket can not stay stain free forever even though this fabric was very stain resistant .
 I ordered this item through Amazon from The Fashion Rack on December 8 , 2010 and never recieved it . I have ordered many things from Amazon and have always received them , but did not recieve my order from The Fashion Rack or a response from The Fashion Rack . I watched the USPS tracking as it came to my state then went to a totally different state . I emailed The Fashion Rack through Amazon and never got a response to my email . I have emailed a second time still waiting to hear something .
 I ordered this columbia fleece in a size small . I received it today and it was a medium . The tag on the inside of the jacket says medium , and the sticker on the bag it was packaged it said medium , but the price tag said it was a small . The jacket is way too big for me , and I would like to return it . I am hesitant though , because I 'm worried that if I return it and order from this seller again I will receive another jacket in the wrong size . Has anyone else had this problem ?
 I ordered This almost 20 Days Ago And still Havent recieved it.So Im Completely Done With this seller.If you Expect it a Certin Time Dont Bother .
 Although I ordered the size I usually wear , the sleeves were much too long and it was n't large enough around the bust even though it was advertised as being loose fitting . Apparently this item was designed for tall , slender women with long arms . The advertising is misleading .
 I owned a similar Columbia jacket years ago -LRB- not sure exact style -RRB- but I know that even then I would n't have spend an arm and a leg on it , so I figured it was reasonable to compare the two . This jacket feels incredibly cheap ! It 's ok , keeps me warm . A nice light fleece , but I was expecting something a little heavier and more durable . Hanging this over the back of my chair , I was worried that the posts on the chair were going to pop a hole through ! They are n't pointy and are a good size , at least an inch , and this was n't by exerting any sort of force on the jacket.The seller shipped me the wrong color anyway , and I 'm supposed to be getting a full refund . Otherwise , I 'd likely return it and fork some money out for something worthwhile .
 This belt would be great and a bargain - if it fit through any belt loops.I 'd hoped to have a trim looking every-day belt that could take more wear and tear than the basic leather belt . In other words , the type of army belt I used to buy in stores.Unfortuntately , it can only be worn w / one pair of shorts I own .
 I 'd like make one point before reviewing these `` jeans '' . They are LOW RISE jeans , meant to be worn on the HIPS . When you order , order your HIP SIZE , not your waist , otherwise you may be dissapointed to find that they do not fit you , or are one size too tight.Okay , I ordered this with high expectations , considering it 's from one of the leading designers for male underwear , but these jeans are a letdown compared to other products manufactured my 2 -LRB- x -RRB- ist . Just as a poin of reference , I purchased this pair and the Banger style , from the same brand , same size . That last point is very important as the Dubliner seems to be an inch more loose and with an extra inch on the inseam , which is quite annoying . The Banger pair fits like a charm . There are quite a few cons I 'd like to point out though.One , the fabric is rather thin , and I was surprised to find the tag noting that it is 100 % cotton . They feel -LRB- and smell , even -RRB- more like polyester , as hard as that is to believe . Two ... They are rather soft for jeans , but they just do n't have the feel or texture you would expect from denim . I 'm not exactly satisfied with these jeans , not considering the difference in fit compared to the Banger pair . The wash itself looks alright , but the front has very many light specks which LOOK like pulled threads , which is a bad thing , although they just seem to be part of the style . As I wrote in my other review , I would call these faux jeans as opposed to authentic denim . The actual stitch seems rahter cheap as well . Aside from that , I would say 19.99 is a just price for the product , but it is definitely not worth the 128 retail . Why they even put that on the tag to begin with is beyond me . Concerning the durability ... they DO seem built to last , though I have to admit , they ca n't possibly be as durable as higher grade denims .
 I normally wear 32x32 jeans , so I was pleased when my 32x32 Dubliners fit perfectly . The styling was not as dramatic as in the pictures , and this also pleased me . My only complaint regarding the fit or looks is that the flare is a bit large . It 's not too bad , though.However , I have a major complaint with the durability of these jeans . The fabric is exceptionally thin ; any time there is any stress on the seams , the stitches look like they 're going to pop out . Plus , I wore them only once and there 's already a hole in the fabric . Needless to say , I am not pleased.Pros
 unlike the photo , the jacket I received was shiny in an oily polyester way . I expected a more matte finish , like better quality nylon bags , but this is the cheapest possible fabric . I ordered an XL it seemed a little small - so I would tend to say it runs smaller . Mine went to the salvation army the day I got it .

 But this bag had to be removed . It is very long , wide and sturdy . If your closet can accomodate a garment bag of reasonable quality , that Can hold multiple garments , consider purchasing this . I bought -LRB- 2 -RRB- and ca n't use them . Maybe the the kids could use them ... hmmmm

 First , the material is strangely thick and stiff for athletic shorts . This would be good material for sweats in cold weather but these are shorts so all it does is collect sweat . The shorts are poorly shaped with oversized legs . This feels odd due to the stiff material . I feel like I 'm running inside them instead of wearing them and I imagine this looks a little funny . Finally , no pockets limit their usefulness . Unless you need to save ten bucks , look at other pairs .
 In my drawer , I have an old pair of Russell cotton workout shorts which are comfortable and long lasting . So I wanted to have more . Knowing that the model I had was older , I could n't find the exact thing . So I settled on the Russell Cotton workout short -LRB- 42175MO -RRB- . It arrived quickly and as ordered ; however , the short itself is cheap and thin . It is so poorly shaped that it is uncomfortable in the legs . The fabric and the make are so low quality that I felt cheated . What 's worse , the pants have no pockets . I ca n't use something this poor . I threw them away .
 ' 0 ' is wat i give this product did n't get what the picture showed.Fitted worst.Don ' t waste your money.Its up to you .
 It 's my own fault for not reading the description more carefully . A bit long - I like to see my legs when I squat . Otherwise sturdy and reliable shorts .

 I bought these for my husband and the color said rinse so I thought regular jean color . In fact they were so dark that they almost look black . I have washed then about 5 times but they wo n't fade .
 I am vey unhappy with the sales professional in Nautica outlet stores . I had a very bad experience at Nautica store outlet stores . The customer service representatives are very rude and unprofessional . They basically said they do n't really care if they lose one customer , other customers will still buy . -LRB- if that is the case , why are prices slashed by 50 % ... it is because people do not want to pay the full price ... -RRB- I do not think I will ever buy from Nautica . A few uncaring sales represtatives give a very bad name to the whole company .
 I 'm a size 16 , and this did n't fit at all on the legs . The makers of this think that plus size people only have larger stomachs and nothing else , I could have fit 2 pillows in the tummy area with me but the legs are normal sized . I personally needed an extra 2 '' on the thighs . If you have the same pear shape I have DO NOT buy this product !
 I 'm a size 14/16 and the stocking did n't fit . The material is good looking , but not soft at all .
 This is the most uncomfortable thing I 've ever slept in - I woke up partway through the night and threw it across the room ! The seams on the inside are NOT flat so they dig in and leave marks on you . The elastic around the bottom is both very thin and cheap and is unfaced on the inside so it is scratchy . The elastic around the shoulders is also not faced so it is scratchy . I think the only way this might be wearable at all is inside-out ... as if it was n't ugly enough to start with . Totally disappointed with this product !!
 Another reviewer stated that this bra might as well have been made of tissue paper and I completely concur . For anyone with a bust beyond A or B - and a band size outside of the typical 34-36 - this bra just does n't provide any support or fit correctly . It rides up in the back and sags in front providing little to no support . Despite the improper fit , I did try to make it work , only to find that the elastic gave out after very few washings . Overall , a disappointment . Spend your money on another more `` constructed '' bra .
 The size on this bra runs very small . I bought a medium and it was tiny , so much so that I threw it out I could n't bother to return it and pay for reshipping .
 This bra is absolutely not true to size . I ordered an XL and felt like I was trying to put on a training bra . Also , the quality is very poor .
 Oh dear . Instead of sending me this bra , someone accidentally took a hairband , attached a scrap of fabric and put it in the bra package . And then sent it to my house , where I opened it and laughed hysterically and put it back in the package . This bra is so cheap and flimsy that I 'm not even going to bother . Back it goes .
 I read the reviews for this bra before purchasing it and did n't think I 'd dislike it - I have a small frame , so I was n't worried about the small fit that others have complained about.Not so.The real fit issue for me is that the straps do n't adjust in length at all , making the bra too `` short '' for me - and my guess is that it would be too short for a lot of other women too.So although the band is comfortable , and I like the pull to the side aspect of this bra for nursing , the fact that it slowly rides up and eventually over my chest as I wear it means that it is unwearable .
 Unfortunately the quality of this product is poor -- the elastic edging started to unravel after the first wash ! Also , the sizing runs small .
 This bra is extremely poor design and poor quality . The bra size runs small and the material is quite thin . It 's not supportive and very uncomfortable . Big disappointment from MEDELA . Go with Lamaze Cotton Spandex Sleep Bra instead .
 I really liked this bra in the past when I wore a size large . I needed more because I have lost 60 pounds since the birth of my daughter . A couple weeks before I bought this one , I was sized by a lactation specialist at my nearby hospital and we both came up with size L for me , so I am sure that is my size . The one I bought there was falling apart after one week of use and before I knew it , this 2nd one was already ordered . I am so dissapointed because I have worn XL in the past and had bras with this child and the first child last for 6-12 months or longer , still intact and in the past I bought new ones , more because they were faded and stretched out or too small , not because THE ELASTIC THREADS WERE BREAKING THE FIRST WEEK OF USE , as these last two . I was really hopefully that the one I had from the hospital was just a fluke or from a bad batch . These are so comfortable -LRB- especially for my sensitive skin , etc. -RRB- and convenient for nursing , and possibly the size XL is made with a bigger band to hold up better , but for me , not I have to figure something else out :-LRB- I will still stay loyal to Medela 's regular daytime nursing bra , but I am really disappointed in the sleep bra now . I would return them now , but I would have nothing to use till I find a back up . I would really like to see Medela step up and make this better , esp . with being such a well respected company . I would gladly pay more -LRB- as I do for the daytime bra -RRB- for the same bra if it lasted for a few months .
 These bras must run small . I have other sleep bras in a large and they fit perfectly . This one in a large is tight and rides up my back . I hate it and should of returned it before I thought I should wear it longer and get used to it .
 I absolutely love the bra for the comfort , and support that it gives . Love that it is light and soft , but ... what is wrong with the size ? I 'm usually always a small ... to small . Bought medium ... to small . Bought large still no difference at all Except for the fact that the cup is bigger which I do not need . It rides up so bad that its under my armpits and the racer back is clear up to my neck . Highly disappointed that I spent money on 3 different sizes and yet I still can not wear them . I really want to try an XL but why throw more money away !
 This bra was very comfortable at first , but after the first wash , it shrunk horribly . I washed it on cold and did a gentle dry but it shrunk so much it 's unwearable and I bought a size bigger
 I bought 2 Motherhood nursing sleep bras and 2 Medela bras . The Motherhood bras are great . They fit perfect and provide good support . The bra is easy to move out of the way to nurse . I wear them around the house all day and at night . The Medela bras ride up in the back and do not feel as comfortable as the Motherhood bras . I recommend you buy 3 or 4 Motherhood nursing sleep bras because you will need them .
 I ordered an XL and it is too small . Have n't delivered my litle one yet so I know it definitely wo n't fit when it 's time for my milk to come in . The band is very itchy and uncomfortable !
 I am small chested and based on the size chart for this particular nursing bra , I ordered Small . Its really small -LRB- even for a current full 32B -RRB- . The back does n't fit well and goes way up due to how tight it is . I had to return it .
 If you want to be able to wash and dry this , order 2 to 3 sizes up from the medela size chart ! It 's very flimsy and a single layer . I went with a similar style from A pea in the pod . Yes , it 's more expensive , but the front is a double layer and it 's made from soft modal . In the pea in the pod one I had to get one size up from their suggestion . Well worth it!This style of bra I would NOT recommend for big breasted women . I 'm 5 ' 4 '' 142lbs -LRB- all baby bump -RRB- , a 36 B and a half and 9 months pregnant . Ca n't imagine I 'll grow too much bigger once my milk comes in , but for now the Pea in the Pod bra in M works great !
 This bra does not hold its shape and becomes fairly uncomfortable after only a few washes , with the racerback pulling your shoulders in . Perhaps buying a size up would fix the problem , but that means having to purchase two bras for the use of one , which as far as I 'm concerned is not worth it . If you 're looking for a great nursing sleep bra , splurge a little and get something like the Belabumbum , which is much better quality and fit .
 I suppose this would be sufficient coverage/holding power for small-chested women , but when I nurse I 'm a 36DD + , and it was TERRIBLE . I returned it immediately as it did not cover or provide any sort of hold .
 I am a 40C so I purchased the extra large and it is way to small . I was falling out of it , it was extremely tight , and there was no way to adjust it .
 The sizing chart is not correct ... do not follow it . Either try this product on before you purchase or buy 2 sizes bigger . I bought it one size bigger than I am according to the chart for when my milk comes in and it is too tight now and I still have 10 weeks to go before my due date . I am going to return it . Also for some reason it is too high up on my back and barely long enough to go under my breasts
 After washing the bra the band under the breast curls up . The bra also rides up in the back to compensate the weight in the front . It could be that I ordered the wrong size . I went by the recommendation . Target has a night one by Bravado -LRB- basics -RRB- that looks way more quality . When I get the extra cash I 'll be getting this ...
 I bought this bra from a chain baby store and followed the chart on back to get the correct size , which for me was a Medium ; 34C . This bra 's elastic is not strong enough to stay firmly around my body . For some reason it always slides up when I wear it so the bottom of the bra ends up sitting across my nipples - not very comfortable to wake up to . I think this is a case of a poorly designed bra with not enough elastic , or they mislabeled the size chart on the back . Do not get this bra if you are thinking about it . Madela makes one that resembles a sports bra and clips at the shoulder and is made of a super stretchy material -LRB- it is far more comfortable and it works fine for sleeping and nursing -RRB- . If you decide to buy this bra and are on the borderline between sizes , go with the larger size .
 A hole appeared near the seams after just a handful of washes ! I washed it a netting bag for delicates and sometimes even handwash . Also the seams are coming undone . I had to use scissors to cut the seams that was starting to fall apart . This is not worth the money since I only got 5-10 uses out of it and it 's starting to fall apart.I gave it one star because I like how it is very convenient w/o the clasps . When you have a crying baby you can easily get to the breast w/o the clumsy clasps . It does not hide the breast pad very well . this is definitely something for sleeping not going outside especially if you worn under a thin blouse.Also the sizes run small . I am normally a small and 34A . After pregnancy I did go a size up on normal bras . I first ordered medium but when it came it was so tight around the bust and the back was riding up . I had to ship it back and exchange for a large .
 I normally do n't rate my product but I 'm sorely disappointed with this bra . I 've been on a hunt for a good and comfortable nursing bra for a few months now . I love Madela pump so how bad can their nursing bra be ? I did n't buy mine here but thought I would share my experience ! My new bra elastic unravel after the first wash ! It rides up my back making me very uncomfortable and does n't provide any support . There is nothing great about this bra at all ! They should just stick breast pump ! I 'm still in a hunt for comfortable nursing bra . I got two of these and is just a waste of money : -LRB- P/s sorry do n't mean to talk about a product like this and I normally do n't rate products even if I some wha are not satisfied but this one is just horrible and I do n't want anyone else to waste their hardworking dime like me !
 Just got this bra in the mail yesterday . It seemed really light and soft , but it 's not really the same once you wear it . It 's made for petite women . I 'm average sized , with a 38C bra size . Ordered the Large and quite disappointed . The elastic in the front is digging in and leaving marks . The back rides up pretty significantly - the bottom band in the back of the bra is just about 6 inches from the nape of my neck . Bottom band is tight too . Am on a budget as it is . Sorry I spent $ 18 on this and can not return even it .
 Support ? What support ? I have tank-tops that hold up my breasts better than this thing . You buy Mandela because it is a trusted brand but this thing is cheap and flimsy as can be .
 I went from a 34DD to now a 34F during pregnancy and this bra fits okay for wearing around the home and getting a rest from underwires . However , this bra is cheaply made . After the first time I washed it , the threads at the bottom started pulling out and even though I cut it where it was shredding , the threads continue to pull off so this is definitely not going to hold up for long term use .
 Do not purchase this bra if you are large chested and nursing . It offers 0 support and barely covers my breast . I bought XL and still too small . Was a waste of $ 20 . Material is very thin as well .
 I liked this item when I first got it . I washed it and it worked ok for a sleeper . Especially when my son woke up in the middle of the night and demanded food that instant it was fast and easy to feed him . After washing a couple times I noticed the bra continued to shrink . It 's stopped shrinking but now I almost do n't fit this one . I left one unwashed and compared it to the washed ones and it 's shrunk about an inch all around . Not happy with this item .
 i am not very large chested but had to go up TWO sizes and it was still a bit snug and uncomfortable . returned item for that reason . purchase the Coobie or Motherhood Maternity instead and you wil get a much better product .
 I BOUGHT THIS BRA SO THAT I CAN BREASTFEED A LITTLE EASIER @ NIGHT , IT WAS NOT WORTH IT . YOU CAN GO TO WALMART AND GET A BETTER BRA FOR A CHEAPER PRICE . IT IS NOT CONFRONTABLE , IT RUNS VERY SMALL .
 This will not fit any bigger than a 36D . The size chart claims it will fit a 38DD but it runs up the back and will not fit at the front . It is not a good choice for a full figured nursing mother .
 I purchased this bra since I trust the Medela brand . I am a 34C and ordered a size M -- not only is the band tight but the bra also rides up in the back ! I should 've tried the bra on before washing it so that it could be returned but now I 'm stuck with it and wear it only if I 'm out of laundry .
 I ordered the size suggested , but I have to say , if you think you need the large , do n't buy it unless you are very pert - it does n't provide any support and you tend to fall out all over .
 I did n't like this bra at all . The fabric is too thin and this bra looks horrible with nursing pads . I prefer mimi nursing bra .
 DO N'T REPEAT MY MISTAKE !!! DO N'T BUY THIS PRODUCT ! My size is currently M. However , I had read some reviews and a lot of reviewers complained that the size on this bra runs very small . Thus , just in case , I ordered a Large one and it barely fits - sic ! It rides up in the back . An extra large would have been better - but as I have mentioned , my size is M ! I wanted to exchange it for XL . Thus I wrote to SET 4 Baby Customer Service . The answer was that I can return it but the refund will be less $ 3.99 . Moreover , you have to pay for the shipping . Thus I just put it to the trash . IT 'S A WASTE OF MONEY ! Do n't buy it .
 The address I gave Amazon was apparently not one that I could receive a package . I have a PO box for USPS , but receive UPS or FedEx at my physica address . However , upon entering my address , was not alerted by Amazon to give the appropriate address according to that info . Therefore , I did n't receive the product for a couple of weeks . The seller did finally contact me by phone message to say that they needed another address because it was shipped back to them . I called back , giving them both addresses and after a week or so , received an email stating that my money would be refunded . I feel they needed to make further attempts , but am not sure why I never received it . I ended up having to go into `` the city '' -LRB- an hour away -RRB- , to purchase this much-needed item .
 Very soft , but fabric is too thin . It also creeps up in the back . Amamante makes a much better nursing slumber bra .
 I wanted a nice cotton sleep bra and read good reviews about the Medela sleep bra before purchasing it . When I tried it on , it provided okay support . However , sleeping in it is another thing altogether . It is not very comfortable due to the thick seams at the shoulders and in the band under the bra - all of which left red marks the following morning . The next time I wore it , I turned it inside out . It is more comfortable wearing it inside out , but I should n't have to do this just to feel more comfortable ! If Medela would change the design to a more comfortable bra , then it would be much better .
 I think this would be okay if you 're pretty small-chested , but if you are , you probably do n't need a bra to lounge around in . I ordered the size indicated for me on the chart , but it 's too small - the back rides up and there 's almost no support for the girls . Just say no if you 're larger than a C-cup .
 i even went up a size , hoping for something that would fit well . this is n't it . it 's rather small . i would suggest ordering maybe two sizes up .
 This bra has very wimpy elastic around the rib cage so that it easily rides up . The fabric is too thin so you can see through even when wearing a regular top over it .
 Bra is pretty comfortable , but the quality is lacking . After first wash the hem started to unravel . Sizing seems to run a little small also - I am normally a 34 C. Went with the Large for nursing and seems like it is a little tight .
 This is much smaller than the size charts state . Save your money and by these from Target , much softer and with more stretch .
 Like some other reviewers have said , the fabric of this bra is extremely thin , and the way the elastic band around the bottom attaches makes me think it would n't last very long before getting holes along the seem line . It seems very cheaply made . Also , the sizing seems off . I ordered a large , which should have fit by the sizing chart on the back of the package , but it seemed a little small . Final complaint is that it was a bit too short for me , the elastic being pulled up at the shoulders rather than sitting straight and secure around the bottom , as though the straps are too short . Overall , it just felt a flimsy and thin . I 'll be returning it .
 I purchased 2 of these bras and I have to say that I do not like them one bit . The material is incredibly thin but the worst part is how high it rides up in my back . I am not big chested so it holds my girls in just fine but it drives me crazy how ridiculously high it goes on my back . I am forever tugging it down but it is as though the back is a size extra small and the front is a medium . I would NOT recommend this bra to others .
 I ordered a large after I decided the medium was n't big enough -- and frankly , the medium and large are not very different in size . I 'm contemplating trying an extra large . But I 'm not sure . The elastic band that goes around my ribcage seems very tight -LRB- and I generally wear a 36 -RRB- . Bummer . Finding comfortable bras ... Otherwise , the $ 14 price and the stretchy , light fabric are the upside of this bra .
 After the birth of my son , I was determined to nurse him until his first birthday . I knew I needed supplies that would last , so when I selected my nursing bras I went with a brand name I could trust - Medela . Now , they make fantastic pumps and have excellent customer service . So imagine my disappointment when after only 2 washes , BOTH of my sleep bras disintegrated . The elastic lining was pulling away from the cotton fabric and fraying despite a delicate wash cycle . Moreover , I was n't able to get far with a complaint to Medela 's customer service.Problem List : - Poor value for the money . I spent about $ 15 for each of my bras . The cotton was so flimsy and uncomfortably tight , they feel like they 're worth $ 5 - Poor fit . I think they run small , mine cut into the breast area where I needed there to be good support . - Poor construction . After only 2 washes -LRB- delicate cycle for both wash and dry -RRB- the elastic frayed on one and the elastic band separated from the cotton on the other - Customer service . When I wrote Medela to complain , I essentially got an email back saying `` Awwwww . That 's too bad . `` Suggested Substitute : - The Emma bra by Basics by Bravado . Unfortunately , it is only sold in select stores so you 'll have to check online . I was able to purchase 2 at my local Target . They are comfortable and have accessability from the top and bottom . I 'm in my second pregnancy now , and I 've been using it this last trimester . They 're so comfortable and still in great condition after all this time . They cost about $ 19 each and feel as if they 're work every penny !
 I was a 32DD before baby and this nursingbra does not fit at all . Do n't waste yourmoney if you have a larger bust and a smallrib cage . It is not comfortable at all , causes boob pillows and rides up in the back .
 This is a really simple bra , but it runs very small - I was a 36C b/f pregnancy and a 38D during ; I ordered a large and found it uncomfortable .
 This bra is very comfortable and fits well , but I am disappointed that the printed label on the back has started sticking to my skin after only 4 months of wear .
 I am not a large person . I normally wear extra small or small ; however , the small was too small . If you order this item order a size larger than you think you need . The lamaze cotton spandex sleep bra for nursing and maternity is comparable price to the medela sleep bra and a much better product . In the end , if you are only going to get one nursing bra I recommend the bravado silk seamless nursing bra over both of these products . While the bravado is more expensive it is also a much better product .
 I received item on time but when I had ordered product it gave options of sizes to choose from . I chose medium and received extra large
 This felt very , very cheap and was really tight and small . I 'm normally a 36B/C cup and the medium felt super-tight and rode up in the back . I ca n't imagine sleeping in this or wearing around the house . The elastic was also a bit scratchy . This is a simple bra and it just is n't worth the cheap price . There are better options out there !
 This bra did not fit properly , and it did not hold up in the wash . The elastic thread unraveled and wrapped itself around my other clothes . It 's uncomfortable and too small . By the size chart I would be a small . The small and the medium are too small . Do n't waste your money ! I like the target-gillian brand MUCH better .
 This bra is a waste of money . It is nothing special - yes , can be pulled away for feeding , but so can many other bras . It is a thin material which would be nice for these hot summer nights , except that after a few washes the trimming is already coming off . I doubt the bra will survive more than two months - a rather costly investment for such a short time . Would not buy it again .
 I was a 36D before getting pregnant and I ordered an XL because I was n't sure how much larger I would get when my milk came in . Apparently I got too large ! This bra rides up in the back , and when I pull it to the side to nurse it digs into my breast . It was nice and comfy before I gave birth , and I 'm sure it would work for someone of a smaller size , but it is not made for larger women !
 I agree with many reviews . There is really no point to this bra . I get more comfort from old navy sleep tanks . There are seams that dig into my sides and poke . Barely any firmness and no support . I prefer cotton wireless sports bras to sleep in for a firmer , cozy hold , and sports bras also have thicker fabric . The fabric on this is very thin .
 I thought this would be a good bra , but both sizes I tried , much bigger than I needed according to the charts and other reviews recommendations , were too tight , too small , and too uncomfortable to wear . I went through the exchange process and everything , yet it still did n't fit . I 'm so disappointed . Never again .
 This bra was way to flimsy and offered zero support . I know it 's a sleep bra but I need some support from any bra . It was returned immediately .
 It was great and comfortable for a week ... then it ripped to shreds and is no longer usable . Waste of money , imo . Wish they were better constructed !
 This bra is very flimsy and thin . It is also small . I bought an XL and it is small on me -LRB- 36DD -RRB- . It is ok for sleeping , but I bought a much nicer one at Destination Maternity for half the price .
 It looked like a comfortable bra , but after trying it on I found that the straps are made too short and as a result it rides up in the back . Also , after just 3 or 4 washes it 's already falling apart . I should have returned it when I had the chance . : -LRB-
 I was more than happy with the prompt delivery from the seller but the product itself I am not so impressed with . It has already started to fall apart on the bottom chest band elastic . It also was never as comfortable as my other sleep bra .
 The 38 C/D is more like a 34 B ! Ridiculous . Ca n't even wear the thing . I hate that I thought I was buying a snug sleep bra and now I have nothing .
 This bra is not comfortable to wear at night while nursing . There is no support and it moves a lot while you sleep . It is also not true to size and fits very tightly . Order a larger size then you normally wear if you order this bra .
 This bra is not very comfortable aTheir had problems with the sizing - the medium was too loose and the small is too tight . Also , the bra is not very supportive and the material is very thin . You 're better off sleeping in a camisole .
 I purchased this for my mother and she was very pleased with the size and the leather cover , however she felt that the plastic pages were not clear and did not allow one to see the photos very well .
 One luggage tag snapped on arrival on my overseas trip and the other broke on return . Not exactly what i would consider durable products .
 Ripped as my daughter tried it on . Skirt not the same length around . Very poorly made . Will never be seen outside her room .
 Dress was very cute but the light colors do not match what is displayed on screen . One color lights not multi . The lights only worked a few times and then stopped working all together . Had used for 2 hours , long enough to trick-or-treat .
 Looks adorable online , but its complete crap . Poorly assembled and can barley differentiate between the colors on the tutu . . dont waste your money . I spent $ 40 on it and put another $ 20 buy things from michaels to make it look presentable . The only cool thing was the lights !
 My daughter fell in love with this dress when she saw it online . We were very dissappointed in the quality of the costume . The lights in the skirt do not stay on and you have to keep turning it on all the time . I would not waste your money on this product .
 fabric on the outfit was cheap and very itchy . I did not want any child to wear it for fear of skin irritations the lights did not work either
 I was very disappointed with the quality of these shirts . I ordered them for my son serving in Afghanistan . I decided to go ahead and wash them so I could get them shipped quickly with other items he needs right now . I will have to search for a better quality shirt .
 Cause it 's GARBAGE ! Everything comes wrinkled to the point of being unwearable . Just do n't buy this . Please . I 'm begging you .
 I really liked the jacket , but in the end had to send it back . Zipper on the arm pocket was nearly unusable and the main zipper not much better . But the clincher was that the quilting inside around the armholes was coming apart . I have * never * had this happen on a new jacket . Not sure if mine was just a fluke or if it 's characteristic of Rothco . -LRB- did see a couple reviews of their MA1 where the pocket snaps were coming off , so maybe it is too common for their jackets -RRB-
 If you want to look cheap ? Then this is the garter for you ! Everything about this garter belt was cheap and poorly constructed ... The lace was the cheap , thin , scratchy lace ... The hook in the back was hard to find , un-do , re-do ... You get the idea.The return was a lot of fun ! I made a call to Love Fifi ... The customer service agent was a tad rude and less than helpful ... So I held my breath when I mailed it back , and was suprised that I did get a refund .
 Good prodcut and photo is of the actual product . Be careful it is the new style measurements where a size 16 is a 2X .

 I thought I was buying a leather briefcase , but this one is plastic . Worse , the brown plastic veneer scrapes off and reveals black , gummy plastic underneath.This briefcase is barely two months old and I already need a new one .
 I bought the 18-24 month old size for my 15 month old who is in the 90 % of height and 40 % of weight . The sock felt soft and fit her foot perfectly . But the ankle elastic part was so tight it left a dark red mark within seconds of wearing . And our daughter does not have fat ankles ! I wish the ankle was n't constructed so tightly , but I now have 6 socks that will never be worn ...
 I did not like these socks . They were not worth what I paid . They slipped off too easily . They are thin too , where I live I need them thicker . The only socks that worked for me were fisher-price socks , only problem is I ca n't find them anywhere . I do not recommend you buying these socks if your child always tries to take off his socks . The fisher price socks he can never get off . DO NOT BUY !
 I bought several in several sizes . I have very few left , as they fall off every time .
 as someone have already said in the review , the soks are too tight on the top , cut in to the leg : -LRB-
 I was expecting a simple LARGE bookbag . This is a SMALL book-bag . It 's not 9 '' deep . If it 's 2000 cu . ft. then I need to find a larger volume . If you want something for High School ... this will work , but that 's about all . The free return to ebags was very easy .
 I bought these for my husband and the color said rinse so I thought regular jean color . In fact they were so dark that they almost look black . I have washed then about 5 times but they wo n't fade .
 I am vey unhappy with the sales professional in Nautica outlet stores . I had a very bad experience at Nautica store outlet stores . The customer service representatives are very rude and unprofessional . They basically said they do n't really care if they lose one customer , other customers will still buy . -LRB- if that is the case , why are prices slashed by 50 % ... it is because people do not want to pay the full price ... -RRB- I do not think I will ever buy from Nautica . A few uncaring sales represtatives give a very bad name to the whole company .
 The T-Shirt has indeed an UBUNTU logo on the front ... But it 's made out of cheap cotton , it feels thin , and after 3 washes it looks old , the logo is losing its colors . Really cheap produtc in my opinion .

 I bought this bra for its comfort strap feature but that 's the worst thing about this bra . I wear a DD and the straps are too thin and really dig into my shoulders . The rest of the bra is very nice . The cups are nice and full and I think it truly is a `` minimizer '' . Unfortunately , the straps are too painful for me to continue wearing the bra .
 The padded straps are only in front -LRB- probably just for the picture to pretend to have padded straps -RRB- . The shoulder straps are not padded , and they cut into your shoulders badly . would NEVER buy again .
 Like the other reviewer indicates in his review , I bought these shorts expecting a 10 '' inseam , but they arrived with an 8 '' inseam . The description lists these shorts as having a 10 '' inseam . I wish I had read his review before ordering ! I called the store -LRB- 1-800-569-9038 -RRB- and in their system , this short DOES have an 8 '' inseam , so they think they sent me the appropriate item . They need to fix the info on this page ! Anyway , I was determined not to have to pay return shipping for their error . I explained the situation , and they are sending me a FedEx slip with postage paid and I can return the shorts in that . So in the end , I will have to eat the costs of shipping the shorts TO me -LRB- they wo n't refund that -RRB- and of course , I never got the shorts I wanted . At least I do n't have to pay to return them , thank goodness . Still -- it 's annoying .
 Although the item was listed as having a 10 '' inseam , it only had an 8 '' inseam . Had I known this , I would never have purchased the shorts . Because of the inaccurate listing , I had to pay shipping both ways - for delivery and to return the item . In sum , I would never do business with this seller again .
 These shorts come with a non-standard 8 '' inseams that will likely not fit anyone who is ordering their waist size if they wear a 10 '' inseam . In fact , I have a few Columbia shorts and the standard size for the inseam is 10 '' on all of them -LRB- mind you these were off the rack at Columbia stores , in their standard sizes -RRB- . 10 '' also happens to be the size that is advertized on the site , although now it says 8 '' and 10 '' inseams , without the option of choosing which one you will receive.I have asked Amazon to replace the items since they claim that the 10 '' size is available and will see how it goes . However , I would recommend that you stay clear from these shorts since they will likely not fit , unless you know an 8 '' inseam is the correct size .

 I was very disappointed to find that this vest was n't the same thickness I have purchased in the past . I ca n't imagine this layer will be able to really keep me that much warmer as it 's intended . What happened to the Columbia quality of old ? My husband also received a vest for Christmas , and we were equally disappointed with that one for the same reason . His vest that I bought him 4 years ago is much thicker -LRB- aka much warmer to wear in below freezing temps -RRB- . We were very disappointed .
 This waist cincher did nothing for me . Very hard to put on . Maybe if you are a size 14 or below it might do something but not for the plus size woman .
 It is simultaneously too big -LRB- even though I ordered down a size indicated from the size chart , I can slip my finger between the garment and my skin if I suck in -RRB- and too small - too short , as it 's cut up in the front - which makes it flip up in the back .
 I got a size bigger so it will not bend but that didnt work the quality is great but it just doesnt do the job i was asking for . I guess i was expecting a miracle but i guess its back to the diet n gym i go
 Like the other reviewer indicates in his review , I bought these shorts expecting a 10 '' inseam , but they arrived with an 8 '' inseam . The description lists these shorts as having a 10 '' inseam . I wish I had read his review before ordering ! I called the store -LRB- 1-800-569-9038 -RRB- and in their system , this short DOES have an 8 '' inseam , so they think they sent me the appropriate item . They need to fix the info on this page ! Anyway , I was determined not to have to pay return shipping for their error . I explained the situation , and they are sending me a FedEx slip with postage paid and I can return the shorts in that . So in the end , I will have to eat the costs of shipping the shorts TO me -LRB- they wo n't refund that -RRB- and of course , I never got the shorts I wanted . At least I do n't have to pay to return them , thank goodness . Still -- it 's annoying .
 Although the item was listed as having a 10 '' inseam , it only had an 8 '' inseam . Had I known this , I would never have purchased the shorts . Because of the inaccurate listing , I had to pay shipping both ways - for delivery and to return the item . In sum , I would never do business with this seller again .

 We were so excited about ordering this costume . We ordered from costumehub.com and they did not include the hat shown in the photo . They include a piece of felt you put on your head - and it makes the kid look like Napolean , not a patriot . If you order this costume call ahead and make sure you will receive the real tricorner hat , not a piece of black felt with a gold dot on it that you could make yourself for 50 cents .
 I must admit that I am a little disappointed in this costume . It is CHEAPLY made and the hat -LRB- the one pictured -RRB- is not included ! The manufactures include a felt hat instead and it is triangular shaped and does n't fit on a 9 year old 's head because it is too small ! I am not happy with this purchase .

 When I saw this item on Amazon , I thought how very cute it was . It is cute but the quality of most of the items in the set leaves a lot to be desired . It is very overpriced for the quality . One of the shoes fell apart about five minutes after our granddaughter -LRB- age 4 -RRB- wore it -- the little tutu began losing the sequin flowers about two days after receiving it . Very disappointing to realize that I overpaid for this set . I contacted Amazon and they said they are Sorry -- so am I !!!
 I bought this for my 5 year old . Within an hour of opening the package one of the straps on the wings broke , the elastic on the tutu broke and the crown came apart . The shoes broke a couple days later .
 I bought this product for my 4 year old niece . Everything but the bracelet , necklace , and wings fell apart . The wand and headband/crown broke within 5 minutes without hard play . Glue was visible on the headband/crown . The wings did not break but did sit right on the back-they hung sideways . The elastic was stretched out within an hour from taking it off and putting it back on repeatedly . The plastic shoes also cracked and eventually broke to the point where they were no longer wearable . The idea of the outfit is very cute but the quality is very poor . My niece 's birthday present was ruined within an hour .
 The rise on these socks has been made shorter than all previous socks from Gold Toe ; I ca n't stand wearing short socks . They also seem to be of a lighter weight than previous socks . I wo n't buy these again .
 First , the material is strangely thick and stiff for athletic shorts . This would be good material for sweats in cold weather but these are shorts so all it does is collect sweat . The shorts are poorly shaped with oversized legs . This feels odd due to the stiff material . I feel like I 'm running inside them instead of wearing them and I imagine this looks a little funny . Finally , no pockets limit their usefulness . Unless you need to save ten bucks , look at other pairs .
 In my drawer , I have an old pair of Russell cotton workout shorts which are comfortable and long lasting . So I wanted to have more . Knowing that the model I had was older , I could n't find the exact thing . So I settled on the Russell Cotton workout short -LRB- 42175MO -RRB- . It arrived quickly and as ordered ; however , the short itself is cheap and thin . It is so poorly shaped that it is uncomfortable in the legs . The fabric and the make are so low quality that I felt cheated . What 's worse , the pants have no pockets . I ca n't use something this poor . I threw them away .
 ' 0 ' is wat i give this product did n't get what the picture showed.Fitted worst.Don ' t waste your money.Its up to you .
 It 's my own fault for not reading the description more carefully . A bit long - I like to see my legs when I squat . Otherwise sturdy and reliable shorts .

 Promising but uncomfortable brief . 100 % cotton loses its shape in the legs after wearing all day and shrinks on washing . Would be better as a blend of cotton / spandex -LRB- 96 % / 4 % ratio -RRB- to keep the shape in the legs and give a little . Also would be more comfortable with more pouch area . As an average sized man , they feel like they were made for little boys . Very tight especially after washing . Wo n't buy it again .
 These are great the first day you get them but beware , you wash them and they turn into nut crunchers . Shrink like there is no tomorrow . I can not even wear them anymore . They squeeze your package until you want to cry . I use them for rags now . Expensive rags .
 These were shipped quickly but they are poor quality . There are strings dangling on fingers and do NOT seem to be 100 % wool , like the other gloves I have .
 I 've bought these same type of gloves on at least four different occasions but the last pair I bought were below the usual standard . The wool in the previous gloves I bought were durable and stayed cohesive but this current pair kept shedding like a wool sweater . Certain portions of the gloves shed to the point that the only thing there now is the cotton mesh foundation that the wool was attached to.While the other pairs would last months -LRB- I use them at work -RRB- , I 've had these less than a month and I already need a new pair .
 In general , the quality was poor . The gloves had holes in them where the fingers joined the palm and the yarn was very thin .
 This suit would be fine if it was n't cut so incredibly low in the back .
 I got snowed in during a business trip a month ago , and had to stay over an extra two days , which meant a trip to the shops for a bit of extra clothing . I picked up one of these bras in a brick and mortar in my standard size ... and that was a mistake.If you 're looking for uniboob , this is your garment . If you like being squished and still feeling insecure , here you go.The only good thing I can say about this is that it appears that it will last until approximately three days after the sun expands and engulfs the earth ...
 Do not be tempted by the low price . I ordered 7 role playsets for a birthday party . 4 arrived damaged . The helmet is very stratched when it arrives in the box . Poor packaging both for toy and shipping . Easy to get replacements sent in time for party , if you like contact with a computer NOT a real person . Of the replacements 1 was damaged on arrival . I now have the inconvenience of shipping at least 4/5 of these playsets back . WOULD NOT ORDER AGAIN .
 This is fair representation of a knight 's armor . The product is hard plastic , which I did n't like , especially the weapons . If a child fell while running , there could be a bloody mess . The helmet , breast plate lasted the longest . The weapons were taken away after some play . A little to dangerous in my opinion . It is not appropriate for younger children , and dangerous for a nonresponsible child . Buy it at your own peril . We bought the book on armor and were glad to rid ourselves of the product .
 Very disappointed . Cheap quality . I wanted to send it back , but waited too long for a return . Glad I only paid $ 6 for it . I have since thrown it out .

 I recently purchased this shirt from Ultra force and was very disappointed . The material is so thin I can see right through without even holding near light . The lettering on the front is n't properly centered and is also thin and cheap . Obviously an inexpensive and unprofessional job of making a shirt . Do not buy from this company !
 Do n't buy this costume . It is definitely not worth the money . The skirt and blouse are ok but the hat is ridiculous ! The rim has tubing in it to help it stand up but unfortunately it is that collapsible tubing that is used in childrens ' toys and there is no way to straighten it out . The hat just stays twisted no matter what you do.Also the crown of the hat is very small.I actually had to cut the crown off to even slip the hat on my head.It is sized for small child.The hoop petticoat is also a joke . It is made with the same silly tubing for hoops.There is no way to unbend these hoops . Once out of the package they are crammed into to , they just stay twisted.If the cost was around $ 50 for the skirt and blouse , it would be ok but it is definitely not worth this big price tag since other items are not usable .
 I did not like to product . This product does not give the breasts a natural smooth shape . I felt like I was wearing my grandmother 's bra .
 I bought these for my husband and the color said rinse so I thought regular jean color . In fact they were so dark that they almost look black . I have washed then about 5 times but they wo n't fade .
 I am vey unhappy with the sales professional in Nautica outlet stores . I had a very bad experience at Nautica store outlet stores . The customer service representatives are very rude and unprofessional . They basically said they do n't really care if they lose one customer , other customers will still buy . -LRB- if that is the case , why are prices slashed by 50 % ... it is because people do not want to pay the full price ... -RRB- I do not think I will ever buy from Nautica . A few uncaring sales represtatives give a very bad name to the whole company .

 I got to this product by searching for `` Women 's '' sizes and then swimsuits . I am plus sized and ordered a size `` 22 '' of this suit . When it came , the packaging said `` Size 22 '' , but the suit itself is toddler sized , maybe a 3 or 4 ! I 'll save the suit because I have a niece that is 2 and will likely fit into the suit next summer . However , there needs to be a clearer guide about how this is sized !
 Non-durable pirate set made of very cheap plastic . Not worth the money !! Purchased this set for my son as an accessory to his pirate halloween costume and most of the items split or broke apart when removed from packaging . The pirate hat does not even have a secure latch or band to keep hat on head . Very disappointed !!!
 My poor unsuspecting son was soo excited when he saw the pirate box set but within seconds of opening the package the pirate flag 's stick broke off -LRB- a slight premonition of things to come -RRB- . The toy is cheaply , cheaply made . The hat is made of plastic , does n't resemble much of a pirate hat and does not fit securely on my son 's head . The treasure box does not open -LRB- what is the point -RRB- . Where am I going to store the treasure of rubies and gold coins ?? I 'm sure they 'll be safely lost in the couch abyss . The hook is loose and will probably fall apart after a few more uses . The chain broke after the first use . I do n't know what i was thinking buying this particular kit . I feel so many things are missing and to make things worse , whatever items I do have will fall apart soon.If I could easily return it I WOULD !
 This was purchased as a gift for a three year old boy , and happily he likes it . Unfortunately , I did not
 The toy is cute but not durable . We bought it for a costume party , not even to play with and many things were broken in one night .
 I paid $ 20 for this and in one day all that is left that isnt broken is the hat and hook . I dont recommend this , although my son loves wearing the pirate hat all the time .
 My son -LRB- 3 1/2 yrs -RRB- loves Jake and the Neverland Pirates on Disney Junior . Unfortunatly there is no merchandise out there for this show . When i stumbled across this gift set I was so excited to get it for him . Almost everything broke immediately and i paid almost $ 40 . The only thing standing is the Hat , sword and scope . Everything else we had to glue or throw away and the little treasure chest is plastic , hallow and it does not open . He loves the set do n't get me wrong I just wish it were made more durable
 I am not sure which was worse the appearance of the Napoleon `` costume '' itself or the unreasonable return policy and poor customer service offered by the company , Costume Craze . In any event the costume did not match the picture featured on their web site plus it fit improperly . Next time I would have simply dressed my son up in a leisure suit from Goodwill or a `` vote for Pedro '' t-shirt . Do not waste your money on this item and for God 's sake avoid Customer Craze unless you know for a fact you will never need to return your purchase . Amazon made me whole after a couple emails back and forth and for that I am appreciative .

 The plastic is about 1/8th thick on both sides of the buckle and will break on the first strain , or even when first used to wrap any luggage.Got 2 , both broke before even `` taking off '' ! Item
 I was leery of the buckle when I bought this strap . It broke on the very first trip after being handled by the airlines . Do n't waste your money on this item . Get a strap with a good metal buckle instead .

 The bra came and although lovely it is useless for support . Also runs very small , as it is I am typically a B cup but in Elle Macpherson I am a D cup ! Who manages bra sizes anyway ?

 These wouldh ave been a great purchase if they were made for people who have skinny legs . They were also way too long for me . I am 5 ' 3 '' and weigh about 135 lbs and could not keep these on my feet . I thought they would be perfect for wearing with slacks , but unfortunately , they are not one-size-fits-all as advertised .

 I ordered this product from Amazon.com . Recieved order confirmation from Sportsman 's Guide , a week later I recieved not a shipping confirmation but a notice that this order was not in stock and they gave me a new ship date . Amazon.com just sent me a cancellation confirmation telling this order was canceled becuase a month had passed . I think the Sportsman 's Guide needs to be taken off Amazon as it seems this is a common accurance with this company . If you do no have the product why do you advertise ? Sportman 's Guide , a bit of bussiness advice from a non bussiness man ... your company is looking pretty weak and not worthy of doing bussiness with hard working people .
 i paid for this vest way back in september and was told several times it was on back order , that i was recieving coupons and eventually my vest , so far it is december and i have recieved nothing not my vest not my money back no emails , you are the biggest liars and scammers i have everheard of , what kind of scam are you running , do not buy from this company they wripped me off and they will do it to you , i dont know how you people sleep at night and thanks for the grief
 This is the worst legging/tights I have ever tried on . I am thoroughly disgusted with the quality of merchandise that I have recently purchased through Amazon . It has been getting worse and worse , untilay these tights were the final straw . The brown lace is a different color than the rest of the brown legging and it is completely twisted when it is on your body as if the wrong bias cut of fabric was used to make it despite being stretchy . And although I purchased a medium/long , it is so short that it could be for girls . Adding $ 5.95 for shipping to the price of $ 9.99 makes these not even worth shipping back for a return credit . That is likely the entire scam of the thing anyway . In the same order for these `` brown '' leggings , I ordered three leggings made by Hue - two in a denim finish and one in brown . Although the leggings are much better , all three have very loose waistbands , which means I spend most of my time pulling them up in the back to make sure they are not coming down and hanging . These leggings by Hue were $ 21.00 each . I would have been better off buying leggings from Macy 's or Newport News because ALL of my other leggings from these companies FIT !!! I am NOT buying any more `` stuff '' from Amazon because you are NOT watching the quality of merchandise coming from your third party vendors . You must be bringing in enough revenue from the third party vendor contracts that it does not matter what the quality is of their merchandise . Every Joe Vendor can send out garbage at a low enough price but charge shipping at a high enough price that the customer will never bother to send it back . This review is going on the Hue url also . I rated it a one star because I had to rate it something in order to submit my review . It is not even a one star .

 Did n't fit me very well . The back of the neck bunches up and the collar should be tighter . Otherwise it 's not a bad value for the low price though the stitching should be better too . So if my main complaint is the fit I should give more detail.I bought a size Medium and have a 15 1/2 '' neck . Normally medium sized shirts , sweaters , mocks and jackets work really well for me . Occasionally the chest is too tight but I do n't like that Large sized items are so wide in the waist . I 've gotten many other medium-sized mocks that fit better , especially in the back of the neck .
 The list price for this product is 9.99 but they will charge you 3.50 shpping per shirt even when they ball them up and send them all in the same package that cost less than 3.50 to ship . With the shipping added in to the price of the shirt , you could go to Land 's End and get a far superior shirt , for the same price . Do n't waste your money - Keep shopping .

 They get one star because there is no zero stars . I bought this because it was a good price compared to other wedding sites . I guess you get what you pay for . Extremely poor quality . When I put this on , the word Bride stretches out and looks like it 's been through the wash about a hundred times . The collar is up too high . I would return this , but I do n't know how since it 's through a third party vendor and with planning a wedding I do n't have the time to hassel with this . My recommendation is to look elsewhere !
 I did not like to product . This product does not give the breasts a natural smooth shape . I felt like I was wearing my grandmother 's bra .
 I bought this suit for a sprint triathlon , but the bottom was so small and the rise so short , there was no way I could wear it . I ended up getting a Tyr 2-piece that was much better

 I live in North East PA , and winter lasts 9 months around here . I picked up a pair of these thinking they would be the best . I 've tired them twice , and I was very disappointed each time . I found a pair half the price that works twice as good . These seem to be popular , and well promoted , but if you spend time outside , and you do not like being cold , I suggest you pass on these.They washed well , were constructed well , but did n't keep me any warmer then a $ 10 pair of flannel PJs under a pair of jeans .
 I loved the space & pockets of this duffel . However , there was a major problem . The first time I used the duffel was on a flight cross country and the zipper around the drop bottom split open . Luckily the two buckles held my clothes in , although they did get dirty . I ended up using packing tape to hold it together . The duffel was strong & light - so a new zipper design is definitely needed .

 Bought this for my son for his birthday . The bow tie pulled away from the center within the first few hours of him wearing it . Want to return for a refund . Not well made .
 I can not rate this product because I ordered it and the seller e-mailed me and said that it was out of stock and he could not get the shirt again .
 This could have been nice glasses , but they have been made so cheaply they are just not worth the price
 This is one ugly top ! I have never worn this and never will . The neckline is way too low for work and I hate the fabric which is some type of nylon more suited to underwear !
 The product description was 3x but when received the size was `` one size '' . The top would fit a 12 year old without a chest . The G string was bigger than the top . Greatly disappointed and would not buy from this line ever again .
 Sorry to say but this is just junk . When we opened the package we could n't tell what was what ! Very skimpy and poor quality . At least Amazon accepted the return . Looks great on the model but she would probably look good in a burlap sack !
 I am a loyal Bali Bra customer . I thought I 'd give this style a try . The front `` loops '' cause the bra to stretch lower than it should -LRB- after only a few days of wear -RRB- . Also the nylon lining was itchy . I do n't recommend this particular style to anyone .
 I have never seen such cheap manufacturing practice as in this product . I liked the feel and the color of these sweats but the ankle was a little tight so I decided to make them straight leg . Upon opening up the seam I found a rubber band on both legs . What happened to elastic ribbing ? About a week later the draw string came unstitched in the back and came out making me more irritated . I tossed these sweats . I remember Russell having good quality back in the 90s ! What happened ?
 Not correct size . I have several pairs of these sweats . Gave to friend . Will not order items from this store again , because they may be selling rejects . Do n't know for sure .
 Nice sweatshirt . Terrible zipper . Bought 4 of them , and 2 of them had zippers fall off within a couple months .
 This showed up with holes . Very poor quality . Not what I expected from a Columbia product , as usually they have pretty high quality products . Very disappointed and sent it back .
 Having had one of these fleece jackets that had served me well for many years , I bought a second one recently . After one hard use fishing in Montana , the zipper casting broke and made the jacket useless . Comparing the two I noticed that they have changed the zipper manufacturer . The new design is not suitable for its intended use . Do n't buy until they strengthen the zipper design .
 I liked this jacket . It fit well . Was fairly warm and thin . Looked decent . But after 8 months , the zipper got stuck in the closed position for some unknown reason , forcing me to cut out my keys .
 Very disappointed in the quality of the zipper . After 2 1/2 months of light use , mostly around the house , the zipper broke such that it would separate -LRB- unzip -RRB- from the bottom . I sent it back to Columbia for warranty service , but had to pay over one-third of the cost of the jacket to ship it to them after owning it for only 10 weeks . I think this is pathetic quality for a jacket that cost what this one did . I ca n't remember the last time I owned anything , including cheap stuff from places like Old Navy , where the zipper did this , particularly on a new jacket
 It 's my 2nd fleece from Columbia . I bought previous one couple of years ago , and I liked it , so decided buy second one as first is too old . This time I received damaged item - zipper is not working . Unfortunately for me , but I 'll give 2 stars for Columbia , so they can work on their QA ...
 This item literally collects all the dirt around . It gets dirty easily . The material also shrinks when washed . Order another brand or texture . It also fades
 The fleece was not densely woven enough to provide much warmth and the wind goes right through it . The fabric is kind of shaggy unlike any fleece I 've ever had or seen . Last Columbia product that I 'll try .
 I liked this jacket when I first got it . It was warm and had a comfortable fit . Within a month , however , the sleeve started to rip off the body of the jacket . As it was past 30 days and I did n't have the original tags , packaging , etc. , the jacket could n't be returned . I understand that it was n't an expensive jacket but it 's Columbia , you would think that it would last more than 30 days before falling apart .
 I got this jacket for Christmas . It 's awesome and all , except the logo is stitched on the wrong side of the jacket and I noticed the multiple layers of white backing used to stitch the logo patch in was still in there and very difficult to get out . I would recommend spending the extra $ 5-10 buying this same thing from the real website instead of buying it here . Really embarrassing to go around and wear a noticeable fake .
 I had purchased the same fleece at Academy Sports , and decided to get a second one , thinking this would be identical . The material in the one I received is actually much lighter , so think twice about purchasing something online that you ca n't inspect first .
 This is my second buy from Columbia ... But this one has fleece problem ... Because while skiving the stuff they made verev line ... So this is not FAIR ... I think while controlling quality was eye off . . I am sorry and I ca n't send you because I am living in Istanbul/TURKEY and will cost me ... Maybe you can compensate this situation to my credit card ... I hope and wait ... But I advised those sweaters everybody ...
 I purchased this Columbia Steens Mens Small Navy sweater to replace a blue one that I had recently lost.When I pulled it out of the package , I found that it was made of lightweight fleece material which in no way resembled my other Steens sweaters . It did not lie flat at the side seam and I found that the material of the pocket interior was missized but sewn in anyway causing it to pull . Also , not enough material was provided for the width . I can easily zip shut my other Mens Small sweaters but this one would have needed four more inches of material to allow the zipper to be closed.I checked this one against my other Steens and found that the country of manufacture had changed as had the collar tag . It is now a blue and white label , not the traditional black and white tag . It is marked `` China '' . The tags in my other Steens are marked `` Vietnam '' . I can only assume that when Columbia changed its manufacturer , it also changed its quality standards . I returned the Steens sweater the same day I received it and I will never buy another one if the quality is not returned to the product.By the way , the Amazon return process was quick and easy . It included free shipping on the product return .
 Bad fit , but I like the Tusk color . I thought this was going to be a sweater . It 's like a Hike Jacket . I 'm 6 ' 3 '' and normally do n't require a tall size in extra large , but here I do . Then , an inside pocket is needed , since this really is a jacket . The zipper is n't lined up properly . That makes the fit even worse , when it 's zipped up . I 'll keep this one because I like the color and that 's the only reason . I also ordered a grey , but it came with a broken zipper I could n't get to zip . I returned it . This was a bad choice for me , since I 'm taller , but I 'll wear it around the house . It does provide warmth and I like the fleece feel .
 I 'm very disappointed to receive the jacket with a `` Made In China '' label . It feels cheap , it looks cheap ... I wo n't be ordering anything more from your company.Sincerely , Damon
 My order came 3 weeks late . I took the advise of other buyers and bought a small size which is as big as my other medium size clothing . I was disappointed that I ordered a tusk color jacket which looks much whiter , fashion on the screen . In fact , it is a dirty silver grey color that I am embarrassed to wear it to my office , or anywhere . Even wearing it at home my wife asked me where I got it from a second hand store . Its warm though . The cuff has no elastic .
 I 'm from Russia . Some weeks ago i bought these Fleece Sweater on Amazon.com . It 's made in Vietnam . Thread sticking everywhere -LRB- -LRB- I can send you photos , write to greengel@yandex.ru . Sad , I just wanted buy good quality Columbia , but got &#34; bad Vietnam &#34; . Also , i bought/got bad Bugaboot Plus Snow Boot &#34; Columbia &#34; from China ! I wrote about this also.If you want to buy this firm , be careful - forgery is everywhere in this mad world ... Sad .
 These jackets are light and nice to look at . However , they have a serious lint problem . I wore this to work on a white shirt and I was horrified to see lint all over my white shirt ! I am returning it now .
 Columbia opted to save $ 0.003 and not use YKK zippers any longer . The zippers they use now are complete trash . Buy North Face , Patagonia , anything else . I can not defend or support a company that opts to save a fraction of a penny at the expense of quality.edit
 I purchased this for my fiance at the end of Dec 2010 and gave it to him as a gift at the end of Jan 2011 . It is now April 2011 and the collar is already tearing . It wo n't be long before there is a huge hole . I believe Columbia products should last longer then this epecially since he only wears it casually he does not wear to work or anything . I contacted Moontree and they said there is nothing they can do because you only have 30 days to return something . I will not purchase products through that seller again .
 I know the Columbia brand , and trust the products they manufacture . It could be , then , that my experience was a fluke . . BUT I bought this jacket for my father for Christmas . He started wearing it mid-January , and before the end of January , the zipper pull had broken off . So he could n't zip it shut at all . So he stopped wearing it . I contacted the seller , and got great customer service . I am in the middle of the exchange process , and trust that it will go smoothly . I 'm not sure if others have had the products break so soon after purchase , but mine did ... Good luck !
 If you do n't care about the fit , buy it . It 's cheap and warm . If you care about quality and the fit , you might want to look for a higher priced columbia fleece . I 've tried this on and the fit was just awful . The large on this jacket is way too big ... It 's like a XXL ... I own two other Columbia jackets -LRB- more expensive -RRB- and the fit is great . This jacket just seems like Columbia made a mistake in the sizes ... It seems as if there should be a M and a half ... There is a major difference in size between a M and a L. . .

 This is not very warm enough . I bought so I can wear it inside office when they make AC too cool during summer , but I still do n't feel warm . Also not warm enough during fall or spring .

 I got this really hoping it would fit . I got a large , since I 'm a pretty tall guy . I 'm 6 ' 3 and I put on the jacket and it did n't even go past my waste . I think they need to re-do their sizing chart . Very disappointing .

 It looked and smelled like a quality leather belt but within a week of my starting to wear it , it started to tear . That 's when I found out that most of the belt was made out of a weak cloth like substance with a coating that looks like leather . If you need any strength at all from your belt , do n't get this one and I would advise you not to buy from this company .
 This theater belt was fake theatre not real ! Terrible quality ! I would like to send it back for a refund however it was a gift for someone else and as such has not mentioned anything to me , I suspect they are being polite .
 This is the second cheap belt I bought they usually last about a month before the cover starts to seperate . I guess what should you expect , you get what you pay for buy a cheap belt get a cheap belt .
 I got this because I really wanted a belt so I can wear my belt buckles . It did just that . Over-all , I thought it kinda sucked . The inside lining is tearing and peeling of . Have to buy another belt after having this for about two weeks . I am not buying this again . BUT it is a cheap belt , you get what you paid for .
 I CALLED THESE PEOPLE I BROUGHT THE BELT FROM . THE BELT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE A 54-56 INCH BELT.I MEASURED BOTH BELTS THEY DID NOT MEASURE 56 INCHES . . THEY DID SENT ME ANOTHER BELT.STILL THE SAME BELT
 This is low cost leather belt and it is also a very low quality leather belt . Only had it 4 weeks and it is already stretched on the buckle holes and is showing great wear . will opt for the better quality belt next time .
 I bought this belt , and after 2 weeks , the holes started ripping . Short and sweet , DO N't Buy this belt , VERY cheap
 This belt was worn with a pair of white golf shorts . The belt stained the fabric black . The color did not wash out and the shorts are permanently stained . I tried stain remover , bleach , and drying in the sun and the black stain only fade a little . This same black belt put permanent stain marks on a white belt because I put them together . I went to the mall , bought a new black belt , and threw the nightmare belt away . Total waste of money .
 This belt is very flimsy . The back is felt , and the top is NOT leather . I am very unhappy and would not recommend this seller . This is false advertising . The people that think it 's real leather do not know what real leather is .
 This is a scam ! This belt is entirely vinyl and is cheap . Don ; t buy if you are looking for a good leather belt !!! I sent mine back !
 I guess for being as cheap as it is , I should n't complain . However , after having it for a short month , I am no longer using the belt since it is already falling apart.The lining in the back fell off a few days into having it . I was able to get over that very quickly.But once the wholes started to rip open and became larger to the point that I could no longer use my buckle , i just gave up and threw it away.I would had given this Item 0 stars , but I have to vote , that 's the only reason why there is a star there at all .
 The belt is cheaply made with a very thin leather vineer over a fiber composit core . It will not hold up . The buckle slot was not cut as shown in photo .
 The belt that I bought from this company did not meet the expectations that I had for it , not long after purchasing it the `` leather '' started to peel off the belt which just goes to show that the belt really was n't real leather because I 've purchased leather belts before and that has never happened before .
 Synthetic Leather Looking Belt - fell apart after first use.Don ' t buy this !!!!
 Piece of Junk , It fell apart after wearing it two times . Was not real leather , But genuine pleather witha card board interior . It found a fateful home in a landfill . Nostars had to pick one to review it .
 Belt is not real leather that I can tell . It is not to true size . Order one size larger if you want it to be true . Cheap belt ... cheap price . Arrived on time and as stated . Vendor supplied exactly what they said they would .
 THE BELT WAS JUNK NO DAM GOOD IT SUCK I WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF TAKEING THE MONEY AND BUYING ME A PIZZA
 Ordered belt lasted 2 days , broke , they sent replacement . Received it a week ago , paper backing of belt separating , leather distending , and this is while belt is loose on smallest hole .
 I bought three of the belts last month -LRB- in april 2012 -RRB- . My daughter used one three days and it started peeling apart . But for a few dollars you will not waist your time sending it back . Maybe for use at one or two times then throw away I buy from amazon all the time and this is so far the only thing I was disapointed with .
 cheap , should have listen to the reviews but was hopeful that i would get a good made in America product , well i was wrong , its cheap and will fall apart as soon as is worn once , in the packaging its already coming apart from the lining , cheap cheap cheap , do n't waste your time or money .
 the belt said it came with a free buckle , this was not the casethe belt said size 30 - 32 waist , and i am a 30 waist and it is too smallworst purchase ever , and i am going to return asap !
 Problems :1 . As people have mentioned - not real leather2 . The belt I received did not have a slot for the buckle 's latch which makes the belt useless .
 Do not buy this or any product from this supplier . This is a very cheap product . Ordered two belts and both were defective . The `` leather '' split apart . Freight charge is way too much . Vendor will not return calls .
 I ordered this belt with few expectations , except that it would be reasonably close to the size stated . It was n't . I gave them a few stars for effort and within a few weeks received an email asking that I remove the less than stellar review and they would refund my money . I removed the review , but never received the refund . Ergo - not to be trusted .
 I ordered a belt in a one size bigger than i really need -LRB- just to be safe with sizing -RRB- and when i received it , it was at least THREE sizes SMALLER than what i needed , much less ordered . And it says that it 's a leather belt ... BULL ! this is one of the cheapest belts I 've seen in a long time . I 'm a belt buckle collector and i tend to go through belt buckle belts , and this is one belt i would NEVER recommend buying . Not only is the price cheap , but so is the quality !
 the belt i ordered was supposedly within my size range , and when it arrived it was way too small . i know i did not make a mistake because i double -LRB- if not triple -RRB- check everything .
 This is about as cheap cost wise as you can get . But still not worth it . The belt cracks at the hole used , and the color comes off on my chinos . Do n't bother with it . Get a better belt .
 if anyone who had this item for more then two weeks , there would be NO reviews higher then one star . The first day , by buckle tore the hole ... the fifth day , the `` black '' started to peel off . i work in retail , and only use the belt as decoration , not function ... they are of the lowest quality i have ever seen.don ' t waste you money.seriously .
 Description from seller states that this is leather , but the entire inner lining is FABRIC , and the outer `` leather-textured '' coating peels off like some kind of vinyl . It may have leather pressed into its layers somewhere , but this is not solid leather . Poor quality .
 The quality of the belt was poor and I was unsatisfied with the belt . Ultimately I went to Bealls and bought a good one . Save your money and do n't waste it on this belt .
 The only thing leather about this belt is a thin laminated strip that peels off of the cardboard composit material witin a couple of weeks!Oh , and this `` Made in the USA '' belt is clearly stamped `` Made in China ! `` Do n't waste your money ...
 IT IS NOT 100 % GENUINE LEATHER . A very poor product . - The make quality is poor - Not Durable . I could only use it for four weeks . - The material is NOT 100 % LEATHER . IT IS FAKE - The material gives a worn look within a week . - The material tore into two.I would not recommend this to anyone .
 Do n't buy this belt if you want something that will last more than a week . At the price I did n't expect something super long lasting but it could have gone more that 1 week . The entire belt is falling apart .
 Seemed like a good belt but after a few weeks of wear it started splitting and falling apart .
 Looks like leather and has very good belt buckle.However , thin strip of a black material stuck on the inside length of the belt flaked off.This spoiled the appearance of the belt .
 I got this belt about an hour ago . I took it out of the package and I noticed a few things :1 . A strange smell , closer to overpowering new plastic than to new leather .2 . There was a scratch along the edge of the belt . I could live with that because if it was leather , it would get evened out by the wear of using it .3 . The belt felt very light . It weighed less than the 1 '' width leather belt I made a while ago .4 . The belt did n't bend in the same way as leather should.So , I started looking closer . I crumpled it up and it made very slight tearing sounds . It did n't really return to the proper shape . I was getting really suspicious , so I took each side of the belt and pulled . It freaking snapped in HALF ! I did n't even have to pull that hard on it . I did it a few more times and started taking apart the layers of the belt . The black pleather , the gray composite paper , and the black cloth backing were all poorly glued together -LRB- I uploaded a picture -RRB- . I would n't have minded getting a fake leather belt if it had been sturdy , but this was just pathetic . I will not buy from this company again .
 When I was searching for this belt it said it came with a free buckle and I did not get a free buckle , im not sure its real leather it has a very awkward smell and the belt seemed a bit too small to be the advertised size . I 'm not very happy with this product .
 MENS/WOMENS BLACK LEATHER BELT FOR BUCKLES.This belt was cheap , but it was also junk . You usually get what you pay for , but buying online can be tricky , as you ca n't hold it and look it over before buying . A picture is all you get to work with . After a few weeks , the glued on inner liner started to peel off , and the belt holes started to rip . Wonderful . I do n't know what it was made of , as it did n't seem to be leather . Probably some kind of recycled material . It is difficult to find a belt with a removable buckle . They used to be common everywhere , but nowadays you need to go to a western clothing store , travel to the south or west of the country , or search Amazon for `` Clothing and Accessories '' ; `` western belts leather '' . Just searching for `` belts '' is a waste of time , as most of the belts shown do not have removable buckles , and the few that do are junk like this . I bought it late at night and forgot to read the reviews first , so I was just another mark who got ripped off . Amazon should delete this seller from their catalog , as he gives Amazon a bad reputation . -RRB- - :
 The belt started peeling after about a month . Poor Quality . I 'd definitely spend the extra money next time and buy one that lasts .
 My purchase was a very inexpensive belt so I did not expect much - which is good because I did n't receive much . I bought this belt for my son so he could wear his `` Captain America '' character belt buckle . He wears this belt everyday because it 's the only one he has.I purchased this belt for him almost 2 months ago . I do n't consider 2 months to be a very long time in the life of a leather belt . Already the belt looks bad ; it has a layer of a thick `` felt-type material '' peeling off of the underside running the complete length of it . Because the quality of construction & material appears poor , I am having a hard time believing it 's made of leather & not a plastic imitation of leather or `` pleather . '' After all , there is a lot of `` pleather '' available in the form of leather goods that look very good when compared to a real leather product due to today 's advanced technology.I 'm a woman who wears a belt to work everyday . By this , I feel I am somewhat qualified to judge the construction of a leather belt . I have several leather belts that I paid very little money for that I 've been wearing for close to 10 years & will continue to wear . They are still in very good shape & there is no backing -LRB- felt or otherwise -RRB- to any of them.If you are purchasing a belt for everyday wear , you might want to invest in a leather belt that is a bit more expensive than this one . If your intention is only to wear this belt occasionally to show off a novelty belt buckle , this belt will probably work out just fine for your needs.There was no problem whatsoever with the company who sold this belt to me , the packaging , shipping or delivery time involved with the transaction.Amazon contacted me via email & asked me to review this product on 12/21/2011 .
 I brought this from a Amazon seller , and it was n't worth the couple of bucks . The quality is shoddy , like pressed cardboard . I threw out the buckle straight away , basically tin foil . Do n't waste you money on this . It was true to size thus the two stars for being able to measure !
 The belt is long enough but it 's made out of cheap plastic material , you could buy a better one at a swap meet .
 I sent you my fendi bag about 20days ago because when i sent you a mail that my bag has lots of problems , you sent me a reply mail and said that you will fix it with no charge.However , i still did n't get my bag.Plz let me know when i can get back my bag or refund my money .
 The Power Touch case is useless . The description states that there is room to store 4 books , but there is no extra pouch for the books so how is that possible ? We purchased this for my daughter so she would have a place to keep all of her Power Touch equipment together . I plan on returning it and purchasing the Leap Pad backpack instead . We already own one of those backpacks -LRB- for our Leap Pad -RRB- so I know there is plenty of room in it for our Power Touch unit , books , and cartridges .
 This back pack is n't helpful at all because , it does n't offerany storage for other books and cartridges !
 Wow . Just got off the phone with Samsonite about a wheeled duffle bag I bought from them in November 2010 -LRB- less than a year ago -RRB- that now needs to be repaired . According to Samsonite , it has a 10-year warranty but the warranty does NOT cover `` normal wear and tear '' or `` defects not due to the manufacturer '' , which can be very subjective . I was to mail the luggage to an authorized service center since there is not one near me.I called the authorized service center and asked their opinion of whether or not the needed repairs on my bag would be covered under the Samsonite warranty and was told probably not . I 'm glad I called since it kept me from spending time and money to ship this bag to them only to be told that Samsonite would not honor their 10-year warranty . It would have cost me at least $ 35 plus shipping to get my Samsonite bag repaired and I can buy a NEW wheeled duffle bag from another brand for that much.I had purchased this Samsonite luggage set at a premium price since I had a high regard for Samsonite and their warranty . No more of that nonsense . From now on , I 'll only buy from Samsonite if they are priced low enough to compete with other brands since I now know that they are no better than most of the other established luggage brands .
 Customer service is worse than awful , especially a gal called Kim . I did n't get a 2nd chance to give purchaser 's name & she refused to talk to me further , no matter how much purchase information I gave to show I 'm the actual purchaser . The irony is that it was they who got my records wrong ! So , do n't sigh , nor cough , nor say `` what ? '' . She 'll count these as buyer 's name misquoted too . The consolation is that the product is of good quality for the discounted price .
 The dimensions of this wallet are not what is advertised . The actual measurements are 6 5/16 by 3 1/4 by 1 inches . This is not Powersport Superstore 's fault . It is the manufacturer 's fault , I contacted River Road and they had no more information -LRB- like pictures of the inside -RRB- than the seller did . River Road 's website had very little information about this wallet on it.Pros-Leather is good quality-Wallet seems very sturdy-Wallet has a lot of pocketsCons-Dimensions are too small-Wallet has a lot of pockets that do n't work-Wallet can not actually hold a dollar bill without it having to be folded-Wallet can not hold more than a couple of credit cards and reach it 's snaps to closeThis wallet basically ca n't fulfill it 's function , which is to hold money . The only useful thing about it is that it look good . The leather is good but it 's too compact . Leather does stretch out over time - this may mean that it can eventually close over the two -LRB- and only two -RRB- cards you want to put in it but there is n't any easy way to stretch it longer . This wallet just ca n't do what it is supposed to . DO NOT BUY THIS!I have not yet contacted the seller to return or replace the wallet but I do not fault them for this product . It would however have been nice if they had posted pictures of the inside of the wallet .
 I would expect better quality considering the brand and previous items purchased from them . They are just not what was expected .
 I was very excited about this shawl because I had been searching for one in a dark brown with a ruffled edge.The problems :1 . The edge is NOT ruffled . Yes , it has waves when it arrives as it seems to have been temporarily crimped in some way . It is not evenly done . Many areas are completely flat and the whole edge will flatten with time because it is not actually sewn to be ruffled .2 . The color is far lighter than any monitor setting difference could account for . That photo is not a good indication of color . It 's a medium-light brown .3 . The quality is absolutely terrible . I would compare it to an airline blanket .4 . It was already pilled and stretched when it arrived.Maybe I got someone 's used return , but even so , the quality is extremely low and it 's not a ruffled shawl . Now that I look closely at the photo , I can see the uneven `` ruffles '' but it 's hard to tell it 's so crappy from the photo.Their return policy is that you lose shipping both ways and a restocking fee , so mine is going in the cat bed.Trust me , you would never buy this if you saw it in real life first . Keep looking .
 I ordered two of these hats believing that they were adult size , however the hats I received were not the same as what is pictured on line . The shape is very different and the size is for a child 's head , not for an adult . I 'm not at all happy about this and I do n't recommend them to anyone unless you are buying it for a child . Not only that but the price -LRB- especially after shipping costs -RRB- is way too much to pay for a child 's cap . I am convince that this is a case of INTENTIONAL MISREPRESENTATION , so BUYER BE WARE !
 The product in itself is great , good crisp picture not an iron on so will last through many washings , but my major flaw with this product is n't the product so much as the sizes . The seller of these shirts needs to better understand sizes and the groups they belong to . I ordered an Extra Large figuring it would fit me a woman who likes to breath in my clothes lets say and allow for shrinkage in wash . What they neglected to say was it was a Jr. . Ex Large . Something I have not been since 7th grade . The sizing button did not work something I wish had as I would have liked a chart explaining sizes . I think it should be with all clothing products , a size chart , even it it 's just chest measurements at least explain without going to a page that may not work , put sizes these clothes fit . I have resolved to keeping this shirt in hopes one day a grand child will wear it . Only have to wait oh 8 more years .
 This is a licensed product ?? That 's hard to believe . Raybies is dead R.I.P. . What band member from Warzone is responsible for selling t-shirts on Amazon ? Raybies would n't have approved this , had he been alive . . i 'm sure of it . Whatever .
 This hat is wrong in it advertised as oversized . It is made in China which maybe that is a oversize for them . I had to return it and they did n't even give me the full purchase price back plus you have to pay for shipping back to vendor .
 I had purchased the same fleece at Academy Sports , and decided to get a second one , thinking this would be identical . The material in the one I received is actually much lighter , so think twice about purchasing something online that you ca n't inspect first .
 This is my second buy from Columbia ... But this one has fleece problem ... Because while skiving the stuff they made verev line ... So this is not FAIR ... I think while controlling quality was eye off . . I am sorry and I ca n't send you because I am living in Istanbul/TURKEY and will cost me ... Maybe you can compensate this situation to my credit card ... I hope and wait ... But I advised those sweaters everybody ...
 Bad fit , but I like the Tusk color . I thought this was going to be a sweater . It 's like a Hike Jacket . I 'm 6 ' 3 '' and normally do n't require a tall size in extra large , but here I do . Then , an inside pocket is needed , since this really is a jacket . The zipper is n't lined up properly . That makes the fit even worse , when it 's zipped up . I 'll keep this one because I like the color and that 's the only reason . I also ordered a grey , but it came with a broken zipper I could n't get to zip . I returned it . This was a bad choice for me , since I 'm taller , but I 'll wear it around the house . It does provide warmth and I like the fleece feel .
 I 'm very disappointed to receive the jacket with a `` Made In China '' label . It feels cheap , it looks cheap ... I wo n't be ordering anything more from your company.Sincerely , Damon
 My order came 3 weeks late . I took the advise of other buyers and bought a small size which is as big as my other medium size clothing . I was disappointed that I ordered a tusk color jacket which looks much whiter , fashion on the screen . In fact , it is a dirty silver grey color that I am embarrassed to wear it to my office , or anywhere . Even wearing it at home my wife asked me where I got it from a second hand store . Its warm though . The cuff has no elastic .
 As others have said , it 's too thin for the price . It 's thinner -LRB- less warm -RRB- than your average sweatshirt . The breeze goes through it like a breeze . For 55 degrees and over only , with no wind . Spring and early fall only . It is stylish and the fit is good . Too bad Columbia cheeped-out on the thickness .
 Columbia opted to save $ 0.003 and not use YKK zippers any longer . The zippers they use now are complete trash . Buy North Face , Patagonia , anything else . I can not defend or support a company that opts to save a fraction of a penny at the expense of quality.edit
 This item literally collects all the dirt around . It gets dirty easily . The material also shrinks when washed . Order another brand or texture . It also fades
 It 's my 2nd fleece from Columbia . I bought previous one couple of years ago , and I liked it , so decided buy second one as first is too old . This time I received damaged item - zipper is not working . Unfortunately for me , but I 'll give 2 stars for Columbia , so they can work on their QA ...
 I liked this jacket . It fit well . Was fairly warm and thin . Looked decent . But after 8 months , the zipper got stuck in the closed position for some unknown reason , forcing me to cut out my keys .
 Very disappointed in the quality of the zipper . After 2 1/2 months of light use , mostly around the house , the zipper broke such that it would separate -LRB- unzip -RRB- from the bottom . I sent it back to Columbia for warranty service , but had to pay over one-third of the cost of the jacket to ship it to them after owning it for only 10 weeks . I think this is pathetic quality for a jacket that cost what this one did . I ca n't remember the last time I owned anything , including cheap stuff from places like Old Navy , where the zipper did this , particularly on a new jacket
 I purchased this for my fiance at the end of Dec 2010 and gave it to him as a gift at the end of Jan 2011 . It is now April 2011 and the collar is already tearing . It wo n't be long before there is a huge hole . I believe Columbia products should last longer then this epecially since he only wears it casually he does not wear to work or anything . I contacted Moontree and they said there is nothing they can do because you only have 30 days to return something . I will not purchase products through that seller again .
 If you do n't care about the fit , buy it . It 's cheap and warm . If you care about quality and the fit , you might want to look for a higher priced columbia fleece . I 've tried this on and the fit was just awful . The large on this jacket is way too big ... It 's like a XXL ... I own two other Columbia jackets -LRB- more expensive -RRB- and the fit is great . This jacket just seems like Columbia made a mistake in the sizes ... It seems as if there should be a M and a half ... There is a major difference in size between a M and a L. . .
 The fleece was not densely woven enough to provide much warmth and the wind goes right through it . The fabric is kind of shaggy unlike any fleece I 've ever had or seen . Last Columbia product that I 'll try .
 I liked this jacket when I first got it . It was warm and had a comfortable fit . Within a month , however , the sleeve started to rip off the body of the jacket . As it was past 30 days and I did n't have the original tags , packaging , etc. , the jacket could n't be returned . I understand that it was n't an expensive jacket but it 's Columbia , you would think that it would last more than 30 days before falling apart .

 This is not very warm enough . I bought so I can wear it inside office when they make AC too cool during summer , but I still do n't feel warm . Also not warm enough during fall or spring .

 The product was fine , but it took forever to receive my shipment , and did not come as promised even after talking with their customer service .
 Nice sweatshirt . Terrible zipper . Bought 4 of them , and 2 of them had zippers fall off within a couple months .
 This showed up with holes . Very poor quality . Not what I expected from a Columbia product , as usually they have pretty high quality products . Very disappointed and sent it back .
 Having had one of these fleece jackets that had served me well for many years , I bought a second one recently . After one hard use fishing in Montana , the zipper casting broke and made the jacket useless . Comparing the two I noticed that they have changed the zipper manufacturer . The new design is not suitable for its intended use . Do n't buy until they strengthen the zipper design .
 I 'm from Russia . Some weeks ago i bought these Fleece Sweater on Amazon.com . It 's made in Vietnam . Thread sticking everywhere -LRB- -LRB- I can send you photos , write to greengel@yandex.ru . Sad , I just wanted buy good quality Columbia , but got &#34; bad Vietnam &#34; . Also , i bought/got bad Bugaboot Plus Snow Boot &#34; Columbia &#34; from China ! I wrote about this also.If you want to buy this firm , be careful - forgery is everywhere in this mad world ... Sad .
 These jackets are light and nice to look at . However , they have a serious lint problem . I wore this to work on a white shirt and I was horrified to see lint all over my white shirt ! I am returning it now .
 I know the Columbia brand , and trust the products they manufacture . It could be , then , that my experience was a fluke . . BUT I bought this jacket for my father for Christmas . He started wearing it mid-January , and before the end of January , the zipper pull had broken off . So he could n't zip it shut at all . So he stopped wearing it . I contacted the seller , and got great customer service . I am in the middle of the exchange process , and trust that it will go smoothly . I 'm not sure if others have had the products break so soon after purchase , but mine did ... Good luck !
 I purchased this Columbia Steens Mens Small Navy sweater to replace a blue one that I had recently lost.When I pulled it out of the package , I found that it was made of lightweight fleece material which in no way resembled my other Steens sweaters . It did not lie flat at the side seam and I found that the material of the pocket interior was missized but sewn in anyway causing it to pull . Also , not enough material was provided for the width . I can easily zip shut my other Mens Small sweaters but this one would have needed four more inches of material to allow the zipper to be closed.I checked this one against my other Steens and found that the country of manufacture had changed as had the collar tag . It is now a blue and white label , not the traditional black and white tag . It is marked `` China '' . The tags in my other Steens are marked `` Vietnam '' . I can only assume that when Columbia changed its manufacturer , it also changed its quality standards . I returned the Steens sweater the same day I received it and I will never buy another one if the quality is not returned to the product.By the way , the Amazon return process was quick and easy . It included free shipping on the product return .
 I got this jacket for Christmas . It 's awesome and all , except the logo is stitched on the wrong side of the jacket and I noticed the multiple layers of white backing used to stitch the logo patch in was still in there and very difficult to get out . I would recommend spending the extra $ 5-10 buying this same thing from the real website instead of buying it here . Really embarrassing to go around and wear a noticeable fake .
 I got this really hoping it would fit . I got a large , since I 'm a pretty tall guy . I 'm 6 ' 3 and I put on the jacket and it did n't even go past my waste . I think they need to re-do their sizing chart . Very disappointing .
 I asked for a larger hat and never heard from the company again . someone contacted me and said another hat would be available in a larger size . I have heard nothing . so I am stuck with something I will never use.Mary Ann Grymala

I contacted the seller , and got great customer service . I am in the middle of the exchange process , and trust that it will go smoothly . I 'm not sure if others have had the products break so soon after purchase , but mine did ... Good luck !
 I 'm from Russia . Some weeks ago i bought these Fleece Sweater on Amazon.com . It 's made in Vietnam . Thread sticking everywhere -LRB- -LRB- I can send you photos , write to greengel@yandex.ru . Sad , I just wanted buy good quality Columbia , but got &#34; bad Vietnam &#34; . Also , i bought/got bad Bugaboot Plus Snow Boot &#34; Columbia &#34; from China ! I wrote about this also.If you want to buy this firm , be careful - forgery is everywhere in this mad world ... Sad .
 These jackets are light and nice to look at . However , they have a serious lint problem . I wore this to work on a white shirt and I was horrified to see lint all over my white shirt ! I am returning it now .
 I got this really hoping it would fit . I got a large , since I 'm a pretty tall guy . I 'm 6 ' 3 and I put on the jacket and it did n't even go past my waste . I think they need to re-do their sizing chart . Very disappointing .
 Had a big hole in the top of the hat with in 2 weeks . I do not recommend buying this . Save your money
 I can not review this item because I have not received it yet . I purchased this item August 07 , 2009 and have not received it . Thank you.Carl J. CastroP.O . Box 7865 SVRBSaipan , MP-USA 96950
 looks comfortable in the photo but it doesnt keep anything warm . Go with a dickies beanie they 're better and have that last long feeling .
 This item has keyrings on chains . I did n't like it because it does not have the conventional several keyholder thingies -LRB- that 's the technical term -RRB- inside , however if you like this style it appears to be good quality .
 This would be a really nice product if the zipper was better . Mine wore out in less than 9 months .
 I bought this a while back as an alternative to the usual key cases with flimsy key hooks . Seemed like a good concept , but as someone else has mentioned , the zipper is not the greatest . It broke not long after I started using it . I continue to use it without the zipper , but am still searching for something more secure .
 I 'm a sucker for details and got excited about the possibility of detaching one or both of those long chains and replacing it with another , shorter alternative . The images shows a spiral connector inside the pouch that connects the pouch to the chains . Unfortunately , what 's given is a clamped alternative -LRB- what acts much like the connection between your forefinger and thumb when you put them together to form a circle -RRB- that is much more challenging to replace . Additionally , the zipper quality is questionable . It 's flimsy and seemingly unreliable . Will I keep it , Yes . Will I buy it again , No . Will I keep my eye open for a better alternative , Yes .
 The belt looks nice but I actually broke one of the snaps on the inside pulling the label off of it immediately after I opened the box . If you want a quality belt that 's going to last this is not the one .
 Customer service is worse than awful , especially a gal called Kim . I did n't get a 2nd chance to give purchaser 's name & she refused to talk to me further , no matter how much purchase information I gave to show I 'm the actual purchaser . The irony is that it was they who got my records wrong ! So , do n't sigh , nor cough , nor say `` what ? '' . She 'll count these as buyer 's name misquoted too . The consolation is that the product is of good quality for the discounted price .
 make sure you review the final page before ok ` ing your order . I hit the drop down list to order a black xl jacket . Apparently I must have done something between then and the final ok to end up with a bright orange jacket ! I returned it for a full refund ! In trying to return my order , it took over 3 days to get a response from the company . Apparently the business is run out of someone 's house . Not very professional results !
 I recently purchased an Ariel dress for the 4 year old flower girl in my daughter 's wedding , to be used as something to play in . It looked quite cheap when it arrived by mail and I was sort of embarrassed to give it to her because it did look flimsy . The little girl liked the dress ok , but it was not well made and I do n't think it was worth the price I paid .
 Well I am bummed to say the least . I bought two pair of these panties 2 months ago and thought great my quest for underwear that does n't ride up has ended . Well here I am now having worn these several times and had them go through several washings and yes they are now riding up ... . I will not buy these again . I guess my quest continues ... Darn I wish the Victoria 's Secret people would bring back there older versions ... I loved those !!!

 They sent the wrong color and for the price and shipping cost , I thought it would be of better quailty .
 If you bought this for some other reason than to help with round ligament pain due to pregnancy , skip to the next review . I bought this belt because I began suffering significant round ligament pain , to the point that walking was extremely painful , around 20 weeks of pregnancy . In particular , for me , it seems to be severely exacerbated by jogging or running.I purchased this belt after surfing around Amazon looking at the various maternity belt options . This one is definitely one of the smallest options of the bunch , and also one of the cheapest . Unfortunately , after trying it out for a few days , I really do n't think it 's helped me at all . The round ligament pain is as bad as ever . Perhaps it would be worse without the belt as my pregnancy is progressing - who knows.The belt itself is well-made and easy to put on . I am 22 weeks pregnant and 140 lbs or so currently , and I found the size Small fits on the smallest setting .
 I found this to be very uncomfortable , I am a nurse and am on my feet for over 12 hours a shift and I ended up taking it off the first night within just a few hours of wearing it . I also could n't sit down with it on , it pressed into my belly and just hurt !
 I received the band last week and it really did not help but made my pelvic pain worse . I ordered another one with more back support to see if that helps better . I bought a band that was a litlle bigger so I asjust it to 3 levels of tighness and none of those work for me .
 Everyone reviewing this product said to size one up . I did and it was huge . I could not exchange , just return and was charged shipping . My belly support from Amon just arrived and thankfully it does fit according to the size chart and seems much more supportive for the whole belly .
 I purchased the It 's You Babe Mini Cradle , size small . At 5 ' 3 '' and a current weight of 152lbs , I ordered the SMALL because according to the size chart it ranges from 136-180lbs . I am almost 35 weeks and have already stopped gaining weight -LRB- the same thing happened with my first pregnancy -RRB- . I was afraid the medium would be too large since I am not anywhere close to 180 . I should have listened to the other reviewers ! The second to last clasp was way to tight . I put it on the last clasp and it fit , but just barely . If I gain any more weight or if my stomach drops anymore this would not fit . I adjusted the position several times thinking maybe it was in the wrong spot but no such luck . I ended up having a weird crampy fealing both times I tested it out and have n't bothered with it since . The company needs to change their size chart so it 's based on your stomach circumference . Then maybe people would have an easier time getting the right fit .
 After reading the reviews , I purchased a size up as many reviewers said this product ran small . I 'm 33 weeks and weigh 170 pounds and decided to order the medium . It is definitely too big . It does not fall off , it stays on , but even on the tightest hook setting , it does n't actually give me any support . I do n't use it at all at this point . I should have just ordered the Small based on the product 's weight chart .
 I wish I had returned it but now it 's gathering dust . There are only 3 spots where it can be adjusted so just hope that your particular size works with one of them . They are too far apart . So if you pick one and it 's too tight , the next one is going to be too loose . It was n't comfortable at all . At least Velcro is more adjustable to various sizes ! Would not recommend !
 this band does not give you any support , It is just useless . I returned it immediately . Would not recommend it .
 I guess it 'd be fine if you 're only at 4 or 5 months , but beyond that , it 's too narrow and provides no support .
 Did n't give the back support I was really looking for - sizing was a little off as well . This helped some while sleeping at night .
 I bought the medium as I was solidly in the weight range listed and it fits just fine - I alternate between using the middle tightness and the highest tightness setting with no problems.Unfortunately it does n't offer any pain relief for me . My hips and pelvis hurt just as much with it on as with it off . I keep trying it and hoping , and while it does make me feel a little more secure when I 'm walking around , it really does n't lessen the pain any .
 This belt did n't seem to do anything for me.I do n't feel more support . I am glad that I read reviews prior to buying this item because you really do need to get one size up otherewise it will be too small .
 This band can provide back support if you are not experiencing any other issues due to pregnancy . My abdominal discomforts , especially sharp round ligament pain got worse with the band . And also , because of the pressure , I felt the urge to run to the restroom every half hour . But of course , if you are having a pain-free very comfy pregnancy , and just looking for back support , this band could be for you.The sizing info is a bit tricky . I am 5 ' 6 '' and my pre-pregnancy size was 0-2 -LRB- occasionally 4 -RRB- or XS-S . Now that I 'm passed midway , I hit 136lbs , I got the size S following the chart . There is no way I could fit into smallest setting . The medium setting provided support while giving more room for the future . I think I would use the largest setting at the end of my pregnancy , but I ended up returning it because of the discomfort I had .
 I ordered the petite size.I was size 0 -LRB- pants -RRB- before my pregnancy , and 122 pounds at the time of ordering it.On the biggest setting -LRB- using the first set of loops -RRB- it is still too tight !!! I should have ordered the small ! Cant use it as it hurts me so I cant say if it really works or not .
 The band was made of very hard , uncomfortable elastic . It was poking me and binding . It should have been covered in some sort of fabric . Further , the hook and eye closures were very far apart making it difficult to get a comfortable fit . The belt was either too lose or too tight . Babies R Us has a mini belt with a velcro closure that is a much better design .
 This belt was absolutely useless for my wife . her size fell between the 2 settings . it was either too tight or too loose.Though the idea of having the hooks seems like a good idea , it 's not as easy as velcro .
 Didnt fit well . 5 ' 3 &#34; , size small pregnancy clothes , and 140lb at 40 weeks , this never seem to fit comfortably . Would recommend they put more adjustment hooks on so the gaps are not spaced out so far from one another .
 I am 35 weeks and started getting mid to lower back pain on one side only a couple of weeks ago . When I went for a prenatal massage and evaluation - its just a knot in my back that 's formed from the baby 's weight and its pressing down on part of a sciatic nerve . I researched and thought I 'd buy this belt because I saw the good reviews - I 'm 5 ' 5 , started at 118 and am now 145 so the medium was the right choice but the belt does n't help anything.I took it on vacation with us when I knew I 'd be walking alot , wear it at my desk at work , wear it in the car , etc. but it does n't help the pain at all and its not really supporting anything . I think something with a broader back brace and possible straps would work better so I 'm going to buy the Soft Form and see if that works - sadly I threw away the packaging on this piece of crap so I ca n't return it - $ down the drain ... sigh and no back pain relief . = -LRB-
 This belt did not work for me . The sizing recommendations also seem off ... I followed them , and this was still too big . And even though it was too big , it mad me feel like I had to pee way more than usual while wearing it .
 I am 25 weeks pregnant , 5 ' 3 '' , currently 133 pounds , pants size -LRB- pre-pregnancy and maternity -RRB- is 4 or 6 . I ordered the prenatal cradle mini cradle in a size small.I was so excited to get this in the mail today . What a huge disappointment it is . Here are the 2 reasons I am returning this item . -LRB- 1 -RRB- Completely Inaccurate Size Recommendations -- I thought I had heeded the advice of the reviewers by ordering a small -LRB- supposedly 136-180 lbs. , size 6-12 pants size -RRB- . However , the only setting that I can close is the largest setting - and I have 15 weeks to go ! Ridiculous . -LRB- 2 -RRB- `` Adjustments '' Are Way Too Far Apart -- This is actually the main reason for my return . As I mentioned , I can fasten only the largest setting , but that one is just a little too loose to provide any support . The next smallest closure is almost 4 inches apart from the largest . I can not come close to fastening it . I have no idea why the manufacturer made the closures so far apart.I wish I did n't have to give this a bad review ; I really could use a good maternity belt . Please comment on this if you have any recommendations ! Thanks ! : -RRB-
 I read other reviews on the size and decided to go for the petite anyway , since it says 90-135 pounds . I am only 24 weeks pregnant and weigh 108 pounds . Surprise ! it 's way too small for me . I am not returning it because of the hassle . But I am giving one star for such misleading information .
 Maybe for a smaller woman it would be helpful . I am a pregnant size 14/16 , xl in maternity and I noticed almost no support for my belly while wearing this . Also , it is a huge pain to move when going to the bathroom and readjusting . I would not recommend this product at all . I find the much wider belly bands with no hooks to be more supportive , and less hassle to wear .
 I bought the mini cradle because I was getting bigger and needed support to hold my growing belly . This didnt help much . Sometimes I thought I felt the support but it didnt last long . The belt also kept biting into me and that hurt . I felt it should have been a tad broader .
 I 've been having problems with the muscles in the top of my belly spreading , and causing sharp pains . My OB suggested a belly band to help take some of the pressure off . Unfortunately this produce did nothing for my pain . I gave it two stars because it was relatively comfy and I did n't buy it for what it was intended . It did n't help me in the least though .
 after reading all the reviews i thought this would be the perfect thing for my back pain and was quick to purchase it for some relief but after i reccieved it and tried it , fail ! it was not what i was expecting it hurt to wear it and it was very unconfortable ! dont wate your money !
 Got this when I was about 8 months pregnant to help give me some back pain relief . Did n't do anything for my back or anything else and it was really uncomfortable , the fabric is n't very soft to the touch and was stiff , felt like fabric cardboard . Waste of money .
 I purchased this and the Boppy Maternity Support Band at the same time - and I 'm 31 weeks pregnant , with some ongoing feelings of thigh pain and belly pressure . For me , the mini cradle was ill-fitting , as many other reviewers have said . The largest hook-and-eye setting was just too large , and the medium setting was far too small . Additionally , the band was uncomfortable , and I was not able to find a position that worked for me.The Boppy band was much more supportive , and it 's extra width helped lift my belly more evenly than the Mini Cradle , which put a lot of pressure on one area . I 'm planning to return this product .
 The size does run small , so I ordered the next size up . I was eagerly waiting for the support belt , but was disappointed on day one because the material the band is made of is uncomfortable , and dug into my skin when i was sitting . It did its job , but it was so uncomfortable that i will be returning it and looking for another one with softer and more comfortable material .
 I bought this for extra support on walks . This thing was horrible . It was nothing more than an elastic with pins . THere is very little room for adjustment . In addition , the one I received was stained . I ended up returning this and buying something with velcro .
 Getting a lot of pressure in the abdomen with my twin pregnancy and this belt was recommended by a friend . I thought I would like it because it is simple and can be hidden between the pants and shirt . First , it runs super small . I got a medium , which was a size larger for me and wish it had been a large . There are three settings on it and by the 20th week with my twins , I was already on the last setting . Tried to put up with it numerous times , but it seems to add to the pressure . My doctor has since suggested getting one with a harness .
 I dont know if it 's just me or what but I found this belt to provide no extra support what so ever . Save your money or invest into a belt thats worth it .
 I believe I tried this during my second trimester . I found it to be uncomfortable , and it provided no support . Waste of time and money .
 The sizing for this belt is pretty ridiculous , there are only three options to adjust it , so you just have to hope that one of those options will fit , but being pregnant your belly is constantly growing so this is very limiting . Also , the support is very light , I am on my feet a lot at work and needed much more support than this belt offers and I am only 23 weeks .
 I ordered a size small , and it 's too small -LRB- even on the largest setting -RRB- . The other reviews indicating that the belt runs small are correct . Except that I * just * hit 130 pounds , and their `` small '' size says it goes from `` 136 - 180 lbs '' . It is ridiculous that their sizes should be * that * inaccurate . I 'm returning it , and going to buy one in a store that I can try on .
 I 'm only 17 weeks but wanted to try this out because I am already having sciatica . I ordered the medium based on other reviews saying the sizing was extremely small . I 'm 5 ' 8 '' pre pregnancy 145 lbs ... now 155 ... the smallest setting is very uncomfortably tight and huge on the mid setting ... it is pretty worthless to me for now -LRB- maybe when I 'm a little bigger ... -RRB- I ended up getting the Babies R Us support belt ... it 's got a lot more fabric but is extremely comfortable and fits properly .
 This was the worst thing ever ! I understand that it would need to be rigid enough to offer support , but this thing dug into my hips so bad ! I had it on for 5 minutes before I took it off and sent it back . Look elsewhere for something different !
 I ordered the petite size 90-135 Pounds . I weigh 120 pounds and am at 28 weeks . I figured by the time I reach the end of my pregnancy I would be at or under 135 pounds -LRB- my end weight goal is 130-135 pounds according to my Dr. -RRB- . I just received the prenatal cradle , and I can only hook it to the last notch . Even at the last notch , its super tight ! So looks like the sizing is totally off !!! I 'll obviously have to return it as there is no way I am going to be able to wear this for the next three months !!! Very unhappy , as I was really looking forward to wearing this belt and having some relief from the constant back pain .
 I did n't find this belt to be that comfortable . It is very hard and stiff . Does n't do as good as a job as the maternity belt I purchased from Babies R Us . Which has an upper and lower support band .
 Pre-pregnancy sizes quoted are not accurate . I ordered a small belt based on those recommendations and although I am not in 3d trimester yet the first two sets of hooks are already too tight , while the last set of hooks makes it still too lose . And since there is no velcro I ca n't really use it , until I get big enough to fit the last set of hooks .
 A day after receiving my belly band I went to my prenatal visit and was instructed by my Dr NOT to use this product . It decreases blood flow to baby , for the same reason u ca n't sleep on your back . His exact words were , `` these things should be banned '' ... Sorry to be Debbie downer just think all mommies should know .
 I had high hopes that this belt would help with back discomfort , but it has n't . I think these must be for very specific types of problems . I am only 32 weeks pregnant , so it may prove more useful later . My advice is to not have very high hopes about this helping significantly -- it is not very expensive , so it may be worth a try for you .
 I opened up the small 3 '' x 3 '' box labelled `` Its you Babe Mini Cradle , Small , New '' , and inside was a very nice roll of Scotch brand Magic Tape , 1/2 in by 450 in ! They really should say in the description `` product pictured is waaay different then that being sold '' . At least theres no sizing issues
 I was supposed to have the package past thurday , and 4 days later have n't received it yet . Need to know what 's going on ??? thanks
 The hat pictured in the advertisement is not the item I was sent . What I received was made of felt and had tiny tears in it . It had craft store fur sewn around the edges and did not have a fur pom on the end . It was of less quality than the one I already own from the dollar store and this one cost $ 10.00 after shipping . This is definitely not made of velvet and looks nothing like what is in the photo . I am still awaiting a return response from the seller and may have to file a claim with Amazon . It appears I was ripped off .
 I ordered this expecting to be able to wear it to a nice dinner . The only problem is , I CA N'T WEAR IT WITH HALF MY SHIRTS ! Sure it holds me in fine , but wear it with a V-neck shirt and it peeks out all night . It even shows in a nice cowl-neck sweater .
 LOW quality CHEAP plastic bag for a unreasonable price . The zipper stuck in the beginning , then the bag rip/torn after used . The strong plastic/vinyle smell is really bad . If I am not in a hurry for my upcoming special day , I willdefinitely return the bag and buy from other seller . DO N't waste your $ $ $ on this bag !!
 Cheap piece of garbage . The thing tore the first time I used it , even under light use .
 The first time the belt was worn ... it fell apart.How could you trust a simple product like that to hold up your pants at a funeral ... while others struggle to keep a straight-face ?
 I bought these a size too big and they still barely fit , then a seam split when I had been wearing them for 15 minutes . Complete waste of money .
 If I had known these had polyester in them I would have never purchased them , they are very uncomfortable and not a good fit . The material with 99 % cotton and only 1 % spandex were a much nucer jean and ones I could wear and be comfortable . I just wish I had sent these back . Awful is all I can say .
 Lee Jeans has always been my favorite jeans and I would buy nothing but Lee 's . But as with everything it is about cutting cost and by doing so it has made a bad judgement call . Lee Jeans has changed it 's material to a lesser quality jean fabric resulting in the material just suddenly spilting open or just fraying on the seams . In the last 4 months I have gone thru 3 pairs of jeans . They did away with the french seam on the inside of the leg wrong choicethat is the one area on women that wears out first . The french seams makes for a stronger and longer lasting seam . But because the material is so thin any real stress and the material splits in a way that can not be repaired other than an iron on patch.Needless to say that they have lost me as a customer and will now go back to wranglers . I live in my jeans and it is important that they hold up . Farewell Lee Jeans it has been great up unitl now.Lee Women 's Relaxed Fit Jean
 I bought two pairs of stretch jeans , exact same style and size . One pair is definitely stretch and fits tighter than the other pair . I am not sure why both pairs are not the same since I ordered the same pairs of jeans . Perhaps the tags were wrong . At any rate , both pair fit , but I have to wear a belt because they gap in the back . That 's the only draw back . They wash up well and do not shrink .
 I had n't worn these jeans until just last week but when I put them on , the stitching in the right pocket was messed up . I figured it was too late to return these for another pair where it was n't messed up so I have washed them . If I am still able to return them for an exchange , please advise .
 These jeans have a comfortable fit for curvier bodies . The waist is high -LRB- higher than my preference -RRB- but tolerable . By far their biggest problem is that the jeans material is thin and easily tears . Both of my pair lasted only about 2 1/2 months , because they tore at the back pocket . I do n't expect strength-of-steel but I do expect jeans to last longer than this . I am shopping again , but not for Lee brand jeans .
 Even though the company tried to describe the fit of these jeans , they fell short of the mark . The jeans did n't even come close to fitting me . Not only were they too big , the shape was totally different from what I thought from the decription . I am short 4 ' 10 '' , but not a plus size . I did not understand they were for a plus size woman .
 AS SOON AS I PUT THESE ON I BEGAN DEVISING A PLAN TO RETURN THEM TO OUR LOCAL KMART FOR AN EXCHANGE ... TOOK TWO TRIES BUT I GOT THEM SWITCHED FOR A KMART BRAND THAT WAS MUCH BETTER ... AND YOU COULD SIT DOWN IN THEM .
 Im not sure if this review will link to the seller at all , but this seller is ridiculous . For one pair of pants , it took them 12 days to ship it and THEN another 12 days to arrive once they were marked as shipped , and I paid over 8 $ in shipping costs . bogus . The specific seller that i suggest avoiding is Silberman 's .
 I just purchased these double knee along with 2 regular pair of Dickie workpants . All three pair were 32 x 30 , but the pair of double knee were more like a 34 '' waist . So I am returning that pair and will try again . After reading all reviews , it seems as though the problem with fit isnt new to this company .
 Not even kidding ... brand new they are stiff as cardboard and extremely uncomfortable , especially when you walk or sit/crouch . Washing them a dozen times may help slightly , otherwise wear them everyday for a couple years without washing them.Unbelievable .
 Got my work pants and found they sent the completely wrong size . The slip with the correct size was sitting in the bag . Laziness is what I call it . Unacceptable .
 I bought these in khaki for work . Problem is I ca n't use them for work , because in florescent light they are green . They are perfectly khaki in natural light , but in a big box retail store they are green . Yep , definitely green .
 I recently purchased my first pair of these work PANTS . Size 30 x 32 . I have been happy with OTHER Dickies pants ... namely the workhorse jean with double knee . But if you are on your knees at all with these work PANTS , the lower seam of the double panel falls directly under your kneecap , making it almost impossible to kneel down on a hard surface without pain . Note that on their double knee JEANS , the reinforcement panel starts 10 inches above the bottom of the pant leg and works like it should . On these work PANTS , the panel starts 13 inches above the bottom of the pant leg . Why would they change it up like that ? I assumed when I bought them , the positioning of the knee reinforcement panel , within the same manufacturer , would be the same . When kneeling down , they ride up just enough to be too high for knee reinforcement . More like thigh reinforcement.When Dickies Customer Service was contacted for explanation , and refund , I got just the standard , non-personal form letter , not signed by anyone -LRB- but still saying to `` just call me '' if you have questions -RRB- They want me to pay shipping , handling , and insurance to send them back , and all they can do is send me another pair of the same style , size etc. . Very disappointed in this product and their customer service .

 This bag is not as vibrant as expected ... lighter in Colorado than dukes of bazaars products . Fabric is also cheap looking with a harsh chemical smell .
 I was mislead by the advertisement . The shorts are skin thin and do n't have pockets in them . Quality it is ok for what they really are ... pijama shorts.Maybe it is my problem 'cause I am not a native English language speaker , maybe not .
 I took a chance on these shorts sight unseen and unfortunately I gave them away after trying them on . The fabric is some sort of icky synthetic and feels terrible .

 My order arrived in a timely manner , but was n't accompanied by any sort of invoice or return information . After finding the information on line , I returned the pants , which did n't fit , requesting the next size up . I received an e-mail shortly thereafter stating that an exchange was n't possible , and that I 'd have to re-place an order via Amazon or the web site . These pants run small . I do n't know why an exchange was n't possible , since the size I needed was in-stock , but I probably wo n't re-order since shipping is not refunded and I had to pay to return the product .
 My daughter has to wear these pants for work BUT the only style that fits her well is the Dickies BULL pant . I got into a hurry and ordered 2 prs . from merchant but did n't compare style numbers . I went by the photo shown which is the bull pant photo . The pants were a bit slow to arrive and needless to say , we were sorely disappointed as the style we received runs WAY smaller than the Bull pant that we were expecting . Merchant did let me return pants but I paid double shipping which makes me sick in this economy . Be careful when you order online to compare everything which was my fault , I 'm ashamed to admit .
 I ordered these pants and when I received them , which took awhile , they were the wrong size . I tried multiple times to contact the vendor to return them with no response . Then I had no choice but to keep them and eat the money . I would never order from this vendor again .
 I will be returning this product because it did not fit . From the picture it looked like it would but then when I took it out of the package , it did not .
 I think this bra is ok . There is nothing great or amazing about this bra . Its light . Thats it . But on to the interesting part . When I put this particular brazire on I 'm instantly transported to the 1950 's or at least my bosom is ! Why must I look like madonna in a cone bra?I do n't like it and after the 18 hours are up this bra becomes the most uncomfortable thing ever.Just do n't bother !
 I use to buy the Playtex Cross Your Heart bra all the time , then could n't find it anywhere , so I was glad to see it on Amazon . The size around and the cups fit ok . The problem is the straps , so much shorter than my other bras , which makes it very uncomfortable ! I did not have this problem before so maybe the current CYH bra is not made exactly like the ones I use to buy .
 I believe it is mis sized . I have used this brand for many years , but this was too tight to be comfortble .
 This has to be the most uncomfortable bra available . I would never recommend this bra . It is very very constricting .
 I 've worn this bra for years and years . The last two bras I ordered have such a scratchy lining in the cup that I ca n't wear them without major irritation . I 've written Playtex but have n't heard . In the meantime , I 'm looking for a similar bra without the scratchy lining .
 I never expected a Playtex bra to be so uncomfortable ! The cups are lightly lined with some thin mesh-like fabric that is very itchy ! I bought it for my 13-year-old daughter . She brought it back to me after trying it on and said , she just does n't like it . I tried to wear it myself , but I could n't handle the fabric . I ended up donating it to Goodwill.I prefer soft fabrics for a bra . The breast area is very sensitive and I ca n't stand to have a coarse , itchy bra on . I could n't imagine wearing it in the hot Atlanta summer , sweating and having that mesh clinging to me.If you do n't care about fabric , the bra was very well engineered otherwise . The cups had nice lift , even without an underwire . And the shoulder straps adjust in the front , so they are easier to reach . I would not buy it again , and I am glad I only paid $ 9.00 for it .
 I ordered 2 40D Cross your Heart bras . The band measurement was 31 &#34; . Guess I should have ordered a size 50D ??????? I could not believe the band measurement . Naturally , they did n't fit ----- you ca n't stuff 40 pounds of stuff into a 31 pound bag !!! I returned both and had no problem doing this and received my refund very promptly .
 This bra is very flimsy , you could probably punch a hole right through the side panels with your finger . It does n't provide enough support for me . The Playtex bra that I had been wearing for years was abruptly discontinued so I gave this one a try ... do n't like it at all .
 The picture was different when I ordered , so I thought I was getting more of a sports bra than this . It was uncomfortable and itchy and frumpy . I 'm not particularly well-endowed , so I do n't need a lot of support in my bras , which I 'm sure this one would offer . I just was n't right for me .
 This bra was not what I ordered and it was totally unacceptable to me . It was cheap and scratchy . I sent it back .
 This bra has a good fit , supports nicely , and I like the lace detail . My biggest complaint is the matterial it is made of . The fabric is rough and itchy feeling and can be uncomfortable . For this reason I will be spending my money on a different Playtex bra in the future .
 I have used Playtex Cross your heart bras for years , and always took a size 36B . Compared to the ones i have , and the ones I ordered - the size is very different and no longer fits . I have returned them for an A cup and have not received my replacements from Rockin Sox at this time.Thank you for your attention .
 I have worn Cross Your Heart for years so was deeply disappointed in this style . It is a look that would be more at home in the 1960 's .
 I was surprised to open my UPS box and find a stiff , pre-shaped bust . From the description `` lightly lined '' and lack of underwire I assumed wrongly that this item would be a simple bralette-like bra , not a stiff-cupped bra . This may be good for someone with a larger bust , but I do n't recommend for anyone who likes bralette styles.Another problem I had with this bra was the uncomfortable fringe around the edges - apparently an effort to make it more frilly , but also a source of itching for those of us who do not like poking edges . If you look really closely at the most zoomed-in image available , you might be able to make out the fringe , if you 're looking for it .
 The way it fits in real life is not at all like the photo they use for the product . There are 3 levels of hooks when there should be 2 at maximum , and the cups are oversized . Their B-cup is like a C. Also , the straps are very wide , and the whole bra is cumbersome , uncomfortable , and unflattering .
 In what world does a 2-pack of Hanes knee-highs go for $ 40 at full retail ? I mean , I see no problem with marking up the retail a little to make it look like stuff here on Amazon is on sale , but geez . I 'll just go to Target where I know I can get the exact same thing for the `` sale '' price at all times .
 The advertised description and my receipt clearly state that this is supposed to be a Pack of 6 . There are two pair in the box . Next time I 'll go to Penney 's or Wal Mart and get what I pay for .
 I was mislead by the advertisement . The shorts are skin thin and do n't have pockets in them . Quality it is ok for what they really are ... pijama shorts.Maybe it is my problem 'cause I am not a native English language speaker , maybe not .
 I took a chance on these shorts sight unseen and unfortunately I gave them away after trying them on . The fabric is some sort of icky synthetic and feels terrible .
 This dress is cute but was very disappointed that it had a big hoop at the bottom , very easy for kids to trip on it or bump into things . I do n't remember this being in the description of the dress & the picture does not look like it has a hoop at the bottom .
 I ordered a size 4-6 for my little girl . The packaging slip said 4-6 , but what we received was a size 8-10 , which was much too big for her to wear . A total Halloween disappointment , as my little one did not get to wear her otherwise cute princess dress for Trick or Treating . Be careful when dealing with this seller - allow plenty of time to correct mistakes .
 In order for me to tie my daughters costume i had to cut off one of the ties and tie both of them together . It did n't really give me the look i was going for . everything else was fine but tie was a pretty big issue if you would see it . However my five year old did love it : -RRB- oh and the dragon stuck to gether i had to pull it apart and part of the dragon ripped off it was minor but still and issue .
 The belt was of good quality and value for money . However the colour was distincly brown and not olive green as specified . I ordered one belt and received a brown one and although it was the wrong colour I decided to keep it . After checking with the Company that they in fact had an olive green belt in stock I ordered another . When it arrived it was again brown . I have now purchased an olive green belt off another supplier and when it arrived I was pleased to see that it was olive green . The moral of this tale is to ask your supplier if they are colour blind before ordering goods .
 I recently purchased my first pair of these work PANTS . Size 30 x 32 . I have been happy with OTHER Dickies pants ... namely the workhorse jean with double knee . But if you are on your knees at all with these work PANTS , the lower seam of the double panel falls directly under your kneecap , making it almost impossible to kneel down on a hard surface without pain . Note that on their double knee JEANS , the reinforcement panel starts 10 inches above the bottom of the pant leg and works like it should . On these work PANTS , the panel starts 13 inches above the bottom of the pant leg . Why would they change it up like that ? I assumed when I bought them , the positioning of the knee reinforcement panel , within the same manufacturer , would be the same . When kneeling down , they ride up just enough to be too high for knee reinforcement . More like thigh reinforcement.When Dickies Customer Service was contacted for explanation , and refund , I got just the standard , non-personal form letter , not signed by anyone -LRB- but still saying to `` just call me '' if you have questions -RRB- They want me to pay shipping , handling , and insurance to send them back , and all they can do is send me another pair of the same style , size etc. . Very disappointed in this product and their customer service .
 I bought these in khaki for work . Problem is I ca n't use them for work , because in florescent light they are green . They are perfectly khaki in natural light , but in a big box retail store they are green . Yep , definitely green .
 Not even kidding ... brand new they are stiff as cardboard and extremely uncomfortable , especially when you walk or sit/crouch . Washing them a dozen times may help slightly , otherwise wear them everyday for a couple years without washing them.Unbelievable .
 Got my work pants and found they sent the completely wrong size . The slip with the correct size was sitting in the bag . Laziness is what I call it . Unacceptable .
 AS SOON AS I PUT THESE ON I BEGAN DEVISING A PLAN TO RETURN THEM TO OUR LOCAL KMART FOR AN EXCHANGE ... TOOK TWO TRIES BUT I GOT THEM SWITCHED FOR A KMART BRAND THAT WAS MUCH BETTER ... AND YOU COULD SIT DOWN IN THEM .
 Im not sure if this review will link to the seller at all , but this seller is ridiculous . For one pair of pants , it took them 12 days to ship it and THEN another 12 days to arrive once they were marked as shipped , and I paid over 8 $ in shipping costs . bogus . The specific seller that i suggest avoiding is Silberman 's .
 I just purchased these double knee along with 2 regular pair of Dickie workpants . All three pair were 32 x 30 , but the pair of double knee were more like a 34 '' waist . So I am returning that pair and will try again . After reading all reviews , it seems as though the problem with fit isnt new to this company .
 Was wanting a nice underarmour shirt , but this one was something I could get at Walmart . Not the quality of what I wanted .
 I ordered a men 's and got a women 's I called and they said they were out of stock on men 's . Then she said she was sorry . thank you for shopping at Amazon.com . I will NEVER Bbuy from them again !
 I ordered this and it was too big for the recipientso I sent it backcompany was very good on return and resending another shirtcathy
 The sizes for some reason run really large . Bought a large longsleeve T tops for my boyfriend and he looked like he was swimming in it . And the quality of the fabric is cheap . Will not buy online for under armour shirts ever again .
 I like the look and fit but after a few washes it got pretty rough and would cause uncomfortable rubbing on the chest . I talked to UA customer service and they mentioned that the poly blend is not the best ... it 's not the newest UA technology . I would n't recommend it at all ... go for the newer models .
 I ordered a reversible black & tan Sean John jacket and received a reversible black & gray Sean John jacket . I did n't want to go through the hassle of exchanging via package mail as I needed the jacket , so I settled for it .
 Very poor quality , falling apart at the seams . Also really long .
 I ordered this item one month ago and still have n't recived JACK !!!!!
 i sent this one back and got a full refund after looking at the item . the leather quality seems suspicious compared to my FENDI pieces purchased from the FENDI stored .
 I ordered this shirt as a birthday gift for a 24 fan . The company sent me the wrong shirt -- one with a picture of Jack Bauer on it -LRB- holding a gun , so the recipient could not wear the shirt to school -RRB- rather than the one offered here , with the circle and the 24 insignia on the front . It was too late to go through the hassle of making an exchange , so I kept it , but could n't help but notice also that the t-shirt is not a heavy , high-quality material . Pretty disappointing .
 do n't hold out much hope you 'll get what you ordered . I only received one of the items I ordered , the rest were bandanas I did n't want ! They just sent all the wrong thing . Maybe they think people wo n't notice the difference .
 This product was perfectly priced - it was on sale . I ordered an extra large because I like things a little big . But this was really extra large . I got it and it just was way too big . But instead of returning I gave it to someone as a Christmas gift . They love it and it fits . The quality was good and I liked the color and texture . It was a good deal -- even though it did not fit me .
 I was sent the wrong item . I asked for white v-necks not crew necks . Completely oblivious to what was ordered .
 Ordered two pkgs thinking I was getting the Hanes quality . Well , DO NOT order these shirts . They are not quality . I received Irregulars , clearly stamped on the back of the shirt . The fabric is thin , the hems are uneven . And 4 of the 6 shirts have wholes , tear and rips ! They even have the red arrow stickers pointing to the wholes , tears and rips . REPEAT - DO NOT ORDER THESE SHIRTS.PS They were very quick to send a refund . And I did n't have to send the undershirts back and pay postage .
 I just received my order and the shots are all stamped &#34; irregular &#34; in black ink ! I was a little annoyed because the website says nothing about them being anything less than standard quality new shirts . I opened the bag and some of the shirts actually had stains ! Disgusting ! I 'm really surprised with Amazon .
 Product advertised and then after paying for them they were not available . Tied up money for over two weeks before refund credited back . Bad experience .
 I 've worn Haynes T-shirts for decades ; this is not what I 've come to expect . Not sure whether these are knock-offs or ` seconds ' intended for the bargain bin . The fabric is absurdly thin . The neck sags , and the body is baggy . I 'm not even bothering to wear these - they 'll make decent rags .
 I was really disappointed with these undershirts . They are the thinnest undershirts I 've ever seen and would never have purchased them if I had seen them first . If I put my fingers inside the shirt I can see them through it . They resemble a t-shirt you have had for 20 years and ca n't bear to throw out because of sentimental value . I have no attachment to these and they will be going right to the Good Will bin .
 Hanes provides an acceptable product , and yet I find myself tossing the Hanes t-shirt back into the drawer whenever I have a clean Jockey t-shirt . The Hanes fabric is less dense and less soft than the Jockey fabric . You decide , of course , but I wo n't be buying Hanes if I can afford not to . You really do get what you pay for .

 This seller , `` In the Mood Intimates , '' is disreputable . I bought a matched bra and panty set , same color , as a gift . The bra was at a great sale price , the matching panty was at full price . The total , in excess of $ 100 , qualified me for a $ 10 discount and free shipping.Twelve -LRB- 12 -RRB- days after receiving my credit card remittance , they shipped the panty only to me , with no explanation as to the missing bra . I left eleven -LRB- 11 -RRB- detailed voice mail messages with In the Mood Intimates over the next three days , with no response . Finally , another nine -LRB- 9 -RRB- days later , I received an e-Mail asserting that they no longer had the bra in stock , and refusing to accept a return -LRB- even though the panty packaging is unopened -RRB- owing to the nature of the item.Meanwhile , they have charged me for shipping and taken away the $ 10 discount.These people are disreputable . Stay away from them .
 Customer service is worse than awful , especially a gal called Kim . I did n't get a 2nd chance to give purchaser 's name & she refused to talk to me further , no matter how much purchase information I gave to show I 'm the actual purchaser . The irony is that it was they who got my records wrong ! So , do n't sigh , nor cough , nor say `` what ? '' . She 'll count these as buyer 's name misquoted too . The consolation is that the product is of good quality for the discounted price .
 The sleeves on this fleece are very long . I have a 34 '' sleeve and a medium nearly covered my entire hands . Not practical if you want to play any sports with this fleece . I returned mine .

 My rating is low to get the attention of the customer due to `` size '' alone . The costume runs very small . It would fit children size 4 and under , not size 4 to 6 . Other than the size being untrue , the material and overall look of the costume is wonderful .
 too small , poor quality ... the ears dont even fit , a complete waste of money.wish i had returned it , will never purchase a costume or clothing from amazon again .
 My order never arrived on time , I tryed to contact UPS but they dont answer calls.Amazon doesnt allow to file a claim with this type of orders , so be ready to lose your time and your money .
 The costume states that it 's a child size 4-6 -LRB- small -RRB- when in reality it 's 4T-6T . Those are two COMPLETELY different sizes . My son looks like pee wee herman in this costume . I called the company and the only way they will refund my money for the full amount is to exchange it for a different product on their website . Otherwise you only get back half of what you paid for . So I went to their website and they literally do n't have anything worth my while . So instead I ended up cutting the pants and making them into shorts for my son to wear for Halloween .
 My son is 3 years old and wears a size 3T . He 's about 34 lbs and 37 1/2 inches tall . He is not tall , or heavy , actually is is on the smaller-side according to my pediatrician . That said , I bought a size 4-6x , based on the advice in other reviews . This is waaaay to small . I will need to return it . The jumpsuit/costume is exactly the right length for his height , but it is tight all over . And because the fabric is so flimsy , my son would need to wear street clothes under it , which would make it even tighter . Also , the ears hat is so small the ties would n't reach under his chin ! It looked ridiculous ... Like it was made for a doll . I am not happy with this costume and I will be returning it right away . I advise not even trying it . Do n't buy it , if your little wants to dress up like Mickey Mouse , find another costume/brand . This one is terrible .
 Poor costume quality and the hat/ears is WAY too small for a 2 year old . I was n't expecting much but it looked nicer online . It will hopefully hold up for the one night it needs to ...
 My 3 year old could not wait to be Mickey Mouse for Halloween . The day we got this costume was such a disappointment !! We ordered the size Child S -LRB- 4-6x -RRB- . My son wears a size 4 or 5 in regular clothes . This costume was so snug -LRB- with only a t-shirt and underwear on -RRB- - and the hat was so small , my guess is it would only fit a baby . He was n't happy , but we had to return it . So sad . I should have read the other reviews about the size discrepency before I ordered it .
 I ordered this costume for my five-year-old , 46 lb , size 5T , 43 inch tall son , and it is horribly small . I am so disappointed since we just got it today and Halloween is next week . If you have a 2-3 year old , this costume might work , but it will definitely not fit the size stated on the costume guide .
 Costume not as pictured - poor quality , overpriced , size information deceiving - my 2 year old `` string bean '' could not fit into size 4 ! - had to break his heart and return to the seller . Did not get my money back nor hear from anybody since over 1 month of returning the costume - will NEVER buy from this seller again !
 I have to pay an overcharge so i am very disapoint with your rervice.I have to pay 25 euros.I am very disapointed
 The material is polyester but it is the stiffest polyester ever made . You ca n't really tie this scarf appropriately because it is so stiff and awkward that does n't sit well . It 's basically useless and does n't look good at all . I would certainly not recommend this product .
 the vest was made of really cheap quality material . there were dark outlines around the pockets on the front of the vest . The only thing I liked was that it was light weight and the tie was nice

 When I read the reviews , I knew this costume would take a little work to make it wearable . I 'm experienced in sewing , and I felt confident that this would be a great starting point and I 'll tailor it to my liking . However , one whole panel of red fabric -LRB- the panel on the back left leg -RRB- was a different shade of red ! They also cut that piece of fabric against the grain so it 's very , very obvious that there 's something wrong . I also had the same problems as everyone else
 I am 5 ' 4 , size 6-8 and the medium was way too short . The jumpsuit fit around my body , but was digging in between my legs , making it very uncomfortable .
 This product is very thin and easy to bend and break under the slightest pressure . Also the plastic edges are poorly cut .
 This was something that was needed for a school show for my son , so instead of making one myself I thought it would be smart to order it . Wrong !!! The hat is cheaply made , very very , lightweight plastic and flys right off your head . It is so thin it is almost see thru.To top it off they charged me over $ 10 to ship this object that weighs less than a pound.Red Devo Energy Dome Plastic Costume HatI would advise against wasting your money on this and go else where .
 I was very excited to purchase the hat . Upon opening the box , I realized my error . Cheap , flimsy plastic hat . It feels as though its made of the same plastic as those red SOLO cups . Poor choice . Keep looking or at least do n't spend anything more than the bare minimum on the hat and shipping .
 I paid 59.99 for this piece of junk !!!! What the heck ? I thought for that much money i would be getting something of better qaulity . I was not pleased with this product at all !
 For the $ 20 dollars I paid , the material was disappointing as well as the fit . I would not recommend this item .
 It is made of very thin plastic . I think it was overpriced for the quality of the product .
 You can get it cheaper on here for $ 9.99 ! do n't be a sucker !
 Bought this hat for my young son . . opted for this rather than the more expensive one from the Devo website . It 's absolute crap . It 's so flimsy you can see through it . Remember , you get what you pay for , or a lot less . Shipping was quite high too . And the return policy of the seller prohibits me from returning it . : -LRB-
 I purchased this one rather than the $ 19.99 version THINKING it would be better quality . No , it 's not any different . The hat is very thin plastic ; nothing worth $ 25.00 ! Look elsewhere .
 Cheap.Flimsy.Thin.I returned it!cheers.w .
 Just really cheap plastic but a really big price tag . They were a joke but we needed them for a ski show so we put foam in them so we could actually use them . They were ridiculous and anyone who saw them felt the same way .
 This is a very flimsy hat it looks like heavy plastic but it is not . Really is not worth the price .
 This hat should be $ 5 with shipping ! It 's made so cheaply that I 'm certain I will not get through the night without breaking it . Very disappointing .
 It may be the thinnest , cheapest piece of plastic out there . I needed for the costume and once I got it , I feel like I 've been conned . It is a fifty cent piece of plastic at the most .
 Simply very cheap item ! My neighborhood TARGET store carry this product which more cheaper than AMAZON offer -LRB- 11.49 $ -RRB- . and quality is far better than this , well made and cushioned.These are really thin and looks wo n't last long ! Not recommended !
 The weave was so loose , it was like wearing cheesecloth on my feet . No cushion either . My advice ? Do n't buy them , or go buy cheesecloth and wrap it around your feet -LRB- it 's cheaper -RRB- .
 Way too small for a scarf , can not be used neither as a scarf nor as an ascot . The material is okay .
 I bought this scarf as a gift for a friend but had to return it . The photograph does not show how bad and uneven the stitching is . In addition to that the scarf had creases all over , most likely from already having been returned and repackaged . I contacted the seller but received no reply in over a week .
 I ordered a 45 inch Mens scarf . It arrived in a plain envelope . It may or may not be one hundred percent silk , but is quite thin in any event . The seams are the usual mass produced Asian import seams

 This is a really cute Tinkerbell costume ! The problem is the size . On the package it says that it will fit up to size 16 , however it does not . I could barely squeeze into it . While trying to get out of the costume some of the sheer material ripped , so now I 'm stuck with a costume that does n't fit . My friend bought another costume by Disguise and it said it would fit up to a size 14 and it fit me with plenty of room for breathing and some more . I would not advise anyone over a size 6 to buy this one . Also , it is very short . I could n't find any reviews or more info on the costume before I bought it , so I hope this helps others looking for costumes .
 Do n't trust the sizing on this costume . I 'm a 10 and squeezed into it , but it 's much better suited to about a size 6 .

 I just purchased these double knee along with 2 regular pair of Dickie workpants . All three pair were 32 x 30 , but the pair of double knee were more like a 34 '' waist . So I am returning that pair and will try again . After reading all reviews , it seems as though the problem with fit isnt new to this company .
 Not even kidding ... brand new they are stiff as cardboard and extremely uncomfortable , especially when you walk or sit/crouch . Washing them a dozen times may help slightly , otherwise wear them everyday for a couple years without washing them.Unbelievable .
 Got my work pants and found they sent the completely wrong size . The slip with the correct size was sitting in the bag . Laziness is what I call it . Unacceptable .
 I want to order these but there is no sizing information . What does small mean ? What size shoe do they fit ?
 This seller , `` In the Mood Intimates , '' is disreputable . I bought a matched bra and panty set , same color , as a gift . The bra was at a great sale price , the matching panty was at full price . The total , in excess of $ 100 , qualified me for a $ 10 discount and free shipping.Twelve -LRB- 12 -RRB- days after receiving my credit card remittance , they shipped the panty only to me , with no explanation as to the missing bra . I left eleven -LRB- 11 -RRB- detailed voice mail messages with In the Mood Intimates over the next three days , with no response . Finally , another nine -LRB- 9 -RRB- days later , I received an e-Mail asserting that they no longer had the bra in stock , and refusing to accept a return -LRB- even though the panty packaging is unopened -RRB- owing to the nature of the item.Meanwhile , they have charged me for shipping and taken away the $ 10 discount.These people are disreputable . Stay away from them .

 This hat was too big -- in fact it was the same size as the medium . I returned it and received a refund . I sure wish it was n't so big . My old one is coming apart after 5 years .

 Nothing like finding the perfect item for my husband and then finding that the sizes available are for men sizes 1x or larger . Unfair when all he wants is a pair of jeans he can wear again without having to worry about zippers and buttons . Disappointing !

 I bought 5 shirts and ordered all XL size . Two looked about the size of medium and the other three were the size of large -LRB- none fit -RRB- and yet all 5 had the XL tag in the back . I ordered 5 more shirts from another manufacturer and the xl sizes fit perfectly . Buyer beware of the sizes when you order , they are not common sizes and you will have to pay shipping costs to return them .
 I am totally agreeing with another poster about the size problem . I ordered a XL and it is more like a Medium . Very unhappy . Do n't go by the sizing chart , it does n't hold true . I doubt I will order a Reebok item again . A customer should n't have to pay shipping an item back that is not as descibed ...
 I ordered 2 XL Tshirts , one black and one gray . I got 1 gray and 1 pink , both said XL on them , but one was 2 sizes smaller .

 Did not like this polo because it was not long enough . Even the xtra large was too short -- basically the large but wider/looser/baggier . I am 6ft1 , and I like clothes that fit . If you are not that tall and slightly rotund , or like clothes that just hang on you but do n't fit , then this shirt might be ok for you . Good assortment of colors though .

 they do not answer the phone , have called to say glasses cracked after 2 months , they have no phone service to talk to customer service-pissed

 Customer service is worse than awful , especially a gal called Kim . I did n't get a 2nd chance to give purchaser 's name & she refused to talk to me further , no matter how much purchase information I gave to show I 'm the actual purchaser . The irony is that it was they who got my records wrong ! So , do n't sigh , nor cough , nor say `` what ? '' . She 'll count these as buyer 's name misquoted too . The consolation is that the product is of good quality for the discounted price .

 this shirt looks like i , ve made it myself.very simple printing and the quality of the shirt is not so nice either .
 If you need to do anything other than order with this company , make sure and CALL them . I sent them an e-mail within three minutes of my order accidentally being submitted . I was informed , four days later when I called after receiving a notice my item was sent , that they `` do n't have time to answer all their e-mails . '' Clearly they do n't even read them .

 4/13/07 Product used to come from Vietnam -LRB- or may still ? -RRB- but this batch came from Honduras - totally different product , different color , different material . So money spent for nothing . I will have to look harder in order to get the Vietnam manufacturer 's product . Oh , also , the Vietnam manufacture says Size 7 but the Honduras Size 7 is really Size 8 -- a whole inch larger around the waist !
 i too have been searching for the panty in the picture.i ordered 3 of these and the main difference is the amount of fabric at the highest part of the leg . there should only be a 1/2 inch of fabric , but there is more like 3 inches ... yuk ! ; bhas anyone been able to locate the panties that are pictured ? -LRB- the ones that we all seem to love and want -RRB- ? please email me personally if u have found them!sheemna@yahoo.com
 The item that is PICTURED is the item that I wanted and ordered . However , the item that is described and that I received -LRB- Halfpant -RRB- , is NOT what is pictured . What is pictured is a hi-cut pant . I did not realize this until I received the order , and was greatly disappointed . I had to send everything back . You are misrepresenting what you are selling by having the incorrect picture of the item . I actually would give this 0 stars , but the computer would not allow that .
 Like every review before mine , my order was wrong as well . The picture is incorrect and needs to be updated . I waited a long time for these items and was disappointed to find a misleading design ... yes it 's a real hassle to send them back and wait for a refund . I strongly feel that if Amazon was really concerned with customer satisfaction then they would have taken care of this issue sooner . Is this just another big uncaring corporation ? This experience has tainted my shopping experience and leads me to not wanting to shop with Amazon for anything again .
 My wife has purchased and worn this style for many years ; however , the items received were nothing like the picture . The pictured item was exactly what she wanted , lace waistband AT -LRB- not below -RRB- her waist and high-cut leg openings ; the delivered item was an entirely different style with an entirely different -LRB- and unsatisfactory -RRB- fit . She 'd opened all the items to check them individually before discovering that items had to be unopened and in the original shipping packaging in order to be accepted for return .
 I ordered these based on the picture -- a high cut brief . These are not the ones they sent me and now I have to pay to return them ! Rip off !!! Zero stars .
 i have worn olga scoop underwear for 20 years . i will keep buying them . however , when i bought 9 pair last november from herroom , i noticed over the months that the little elastic strings were coming out of the underwear , short ones and long ones . they get all tangled up in the wash . in short , they are falling apart . i contacted herroom customer service and they told me that they would not be able to exchange as their policy is that the product must be unworn and unused and within 30 days . i wonder how one is supposed to find out that they are defective without washing and wearing them . so keep buying these underwear , but do n't buy from herroom
 Very pretty . Ordered my normal size , but this product runs big . Very little elastic in the lace and creeps as you wear it .
 I waited for months only to find out my order was not available . Would have loved to have received it !
 While this rifle looks really authentic ... it was totally disappointing . The rifle came with no instructions on how to load the tiny plastic balls . The durability seemed really cheap considering that it cost $ 30 . I would not recommend this to someone else .

 Did n't fit me very well . The back of the neck bunches up and the collar should be tighter . Otherwise it 's not a bad value for the low price though the stitching should be better too . So if my main complaint is the fit I should give more detail.I bought a size Medium and have a 15 1/2 '' neck . Normally medium sized shirts , sweaters , mocks and jackets work really well for me . Occasionally the chest is too tight but I do n't like that Large sized items are so wide in the waist . I 've gotten many other medium-sized mocks that fit better , especially in the back of the neck .
 The list price for this product is 9.99 but they will charge you 3.50 shpping per shirt even when they ball them up and send them all in the same package that cost less than 3.50 to ship . With the shipping added in to the price of the shirt , you could go to Land 's End and get a far superior shirt , for the same price . Do n't waste your money - Keep shopping .
 I ordered the 3 pack of Gold Toe anklets based on the size description in the listing , i.e. ` Size
 These are basically sunglasses lined with foam , which makes them very large and akward on your face .
 It was too small . I sent it back , still waiting the return of our money . Displeased .
 Everything was ok except the measurement . Way too big for my head , definitely not a 7 1/4 like I ordered .
 i purchased this had for my husband and when it arrived it did not fit . it is oversized .
 It was too small . I sent it back , still waiting the return of our money . Displeased .
 I bought a pair of Revo sunglasses from Lenscrafters , on 10/31/2007 . The left lens fell out many times and was replaced by Lenscrafters several times . i suspect that because of the design , that the frames had too little rigidity , offering less support to the lens than needed.The real problem and one that could not be resolved were two cracks in the innner layer of the lens -LRB- you can see the cracks , they are annoying , yet ca n't be felt-requiring that the lens be replaced.Lenscrafters referred me to Revo , who also owns Oakley , Ray Ban , and other brands , under the Luxoticca Umbrella.I sent the glasses back to Revo for their opinion , and was told that I was out of warranty , and that they would do nothing for me , except to offer a credit of $ 40.00 toward a new pair of glasses . I told the Customer Service rep that I had paid $ 275.99 for the original pair and that $ 40.00 was not going to help me too much ... he responded that maybe they would go another $ 60.00 , for a total of $ 100.00 dollars.Since my sunglass model had been discontinued -LRB- for design problems ? -RRB- a replacement pair was not an option.So , bottom line , it cost me $ 175.00 for one year plus to own these glasses , they are still broken , and Revo could care less.Stay away from these brands 'cause they do n't back up their quality claims , and exhibit poor customer service attitude .
 There are no pockets on these stupid shorts ! I need pockets ... everyone does . What a waste . How hard would it be to sew in some pockets under armour ?
 I love the material of this short , its much bigger than normal S size to me but I can live with that , without any pockets drives me nuts . I have to carry my cell phone and keys all the time . When I go to the store , I got to carry my back pack for my keys and phones . I 'm 5.11 , not a short guy , but the short is as long as a skirt , I had no choice to buy a Small size still looking like wearing a skirt . I 'm not those basketball player slim giant .

 Amazon 's Service is excellent . However , the item was honestly not worth the money paid . The material is extremely sheer and flimsy - it snags extremely easily . There are no seams - the material is simply cut . We purchased the costume for a school play and had to make our own surcoat . The costume was simply not of such quality as to stand up to the most minimal movement and activity .
 I wanted a long flannel nightgown , and I liked this style . I was disappointed after the first washing , however . It shrank so much , I could not wear it . It does run small , anyway , but the length became too short to keep me warm . More like a ballerina length after washing . It was pretty , just shrunk too badly .
 Due to lack of long flannel nightgowns available in thelocal business community , I ordered this nightgown on-linethrough Amazon.com . I knew most flannel nightgowns are n'twhat you call sexy , but expect them to be cozy , warm and durable . The ordering process was great , received theitem within 10 days . The gown was plain , but true to thepicture . The problem I found was the item began to frayat a shoulder seam within 3 washings . Durable it is not.I am required to send the item back for a refund . Because of the experience , I will think twice before ordering clothing over the internet.Long Striped Flannel Gown by Carole
 The striped flannel nightgown was cut way too small for the size I ordered , and the fabric looked different than the sample on line . Overall , it was not worth the price I paid . Very Disappointing !
 its really cheap material like paper ! you can get one better in the dollar store !
 This bra is shaped oddly ; it creates the pointy breast style of the 1950s . I did not like it at all . Also it is very significantly padded , and the top of the bra does not make for a smooth transition from bra to chest .

 The shirt is great looking and well made ; however , it is so very long . I ordered the shirt in regular size , but it 's much longer than those in most tall sizes . I 'm over six feet and the shirt hem hangs down almost to my knees . What 's not mentioned in the shirt description , is that it is almost three feet long .
 Apparently this was old stock from someones window that got sunshine . The parts that were exposed to the sun were faded.I mean FADED . It makes a great work shirt if you are sure to get grease on it , other than that Its a rip-off .
 Eagle looks animated so not happy with this one at all but did not return . I will cut the sleeves off and wear it around the house only . Of all things to look phoney the eagle should not be one of them . I would not reccomend this design .
 I have been buying `` THE MOUNTAIN '' T-shirts for years , and I will no longer continue to purchase this product as the quality of `` THE MOUNTAIN '' T-shirts has severly deminished to the point it offends me . On reciept of my order , these shirts look nothing like what is posted on amazon , the colors are completely different-of low quality , and the quality of the material is nothing short of a cheap shirt out of mexico .
 Was led to believe in description that the pajamas were ankle length when we received them come to find out they were knee length , and when the shipping was half of what the item had cost we found it to be more of a hassle . . will not order again
 poorly made and not true to size ! Gave it to a friend who was shorter -LRB- since it was also short -RRB- and smaller -LRB- she usually wears medium -RRB-

 Did not like this polo because it was not long enough . Even the xtra large was too short -- basically the large but wider/looser/baggier . I am 6ft1 , and I like clothes that fit . If you are not that tall and slightly rotund , or like clothes that just hang on you but do n't fit , then this shirt might be ok for you . Good assortment of colors though .

 This is SO small and tight and it is awful . Do NOT purchase this product - you will be disappointed .

 I 'm the 42 year old son of a 1x mother and I 'm a little embarassed to give her a sheer gown for Christmas . The write up did n't say sheer and the pictures do n't depict this as being sheer or see through . I confess , I tried it on for my wife to see how revealing it truly is and in the right light it 's revealing . I like the style , quality and color -LRB- although it is n't my style -RRB- . I would have given this 5 stars if not for the sheerness .
 The gown in the picture is not what you will receive . I was so excited to get this for Christmas and was very disappointed . The gown I received was sleeveless and the top part was completely see through sine it was completely lace . Unfortunately I could n't wear it and tried to find a way to return it but no paperwork was in the box . I will never order from this company again .
 The fabric is too flimsy , you can see right through the gown . Perhaps someone would want that in a gown , I did not . Not worth the price .
 Returned this nightgown because it did not look like the picture . It is shown with a cap sleeve , but it is sleeveless .
 For the price , the quality was very poor . I was extremely disappointed and would not buy another or recommend this product to anyone .
 The amount of money paid for the item was far past it 's worth . The material was very thin . I expected thick luxurious material as it looked on the advertsiment and instead I received something that could have been purchased at the local kmart . Very disappointing .
 the quality of the fabric is extreamly poor , it hasshoddy stiching . The style looks like something a grandmother would wear with foam curlers and cold cream .

 Great shirt but I gave it two stars for the fact that the shirt was manufactured in El Salvador . Considering the shirts importance I 'd be happy to spend a couple of bucks more for one made in the USA . At least it was n't made in China .

 I bought three pairs of jeans in two separate orders and only one pair was right . The other two were smaller than advertised , even though the tags displayed the dimensions I ordered . I measured the waistline myself and found that one pair was just under 2 inches smaller than I ordered and the other was four inches smaller . One of them came with several belt loops torn away from the waistline . The first order had paid for my return shipping and a full refund because they were torn , but the second return was at my expense and a restocking fee is to be applied since they were not damaged.The pair that I kept were perfect in every way , so no complaints there .

 Sorry to say , while the features of this travel clock seemed to be exactly what I wanted , it died after just a couple of weeks into an extended vacation . I suppose I could have sent it back , but rather than drag it around with me the rest of the trip , I simply threw it away . It stopped keeping time and made a horrible , constant clicking sound . Changing batteries did n't help either .

 The shirt is great looking and well made ; however , it is so very long . I ordered the shirt in regular size , but it 's much longer than those in most tall sizes . I 'm over six feet and the shirt hem hangs down almost to my knees . What 's not mentioned in the shirt description , is that it is almost three feet long .
 Apparently this was old stock from someones window that got sunshine . The parts that were exposed to the sun were faded.I mean FADED . It makes a great work shirt if you are sure to get grease on it , other than that Its a rip-off .

 Purchased this for my husband for Christmas last year - it needed to be replaced by August after 8 months of use . It does get used almost daily , but still ... expected better shelf life than this .

 Did not like this polo because it was not long enough . Even the xtra large was too short -- basically the large but wider/looser/baggier . I am 6ft1 , and I like clothes that fit . If you are not that tall and slightly rotund , or like clothes that just hang on you but do n't fit , then this shirt might be ok for you . Good assortment of colors though .
 I bought three pairs of jeans in two separate orders and only one pair was right . The other two were smaller than advertised , even though the tags displayed the dimensions I ordered . I measured the waistline myself and found that one pair was just under 2 inches smaller than I ordered and the other was four inches smaller . One of them came with several belt loops torn away from the waistline . The first order had paid for my return shipping and a full refund because they were torn , but the second return was at my expense and a restocking fee is to be applied since they were not damaged.The pair that I kept were perfect in every way , so no complaints there .

 The owl head lays much flatter to the head than in the picture . It just looks like a hoodie from the front-you ca n't see the owl face/head unless you look down at the topof my daughters head . Not as pictured-is sits way above the head in the picture . Returned it .

 Customer service is worse than awful , especially a gal called Kim . I did n't get a 2nd chance to give purchaser 's name & she refused to talk to me further , no matter how much purchase information I gave to show I 'm the actual purchaser . The irony is that it was they who got my records wrong ! So , do n't sigh , nor cough , nor say `` what ? '' . She 'll count these as buyer 's name misquoted too .
 I had the same experience as the previous poster . The belt is too thin to work with my buckle . I 'll use the belts I got , but I wo n't buy from these folks again .
 I had a genuine web belt like this in the army , it worked like a charm , and stuck in my mind for years as being a great belt . I ordered this one and found out very quickly that the canvas belt is not thick enough for the buckle to grip . It simply does not work . You put in and tighten it and it just comes loose . Get a real one , not this chinese copy .
 I purchased an Under Armour compression tee at a local store in a size Large . The shirt fit fantastic . I wanted a back up so I purchased this one online size Large , different color . The shirt arrives on time , open the package and it is a Large but does not even fit over my shoulders ... . I contacted the vendor for an exchange . They do not do exchanges but will allow me to return the shirt . If the shirt was worn it has to be washed before returning it ... no problem for I could not get the shirt on anyway so tags etc were all in place . If you pass 30 days , there is a restocking fee of 20 % which I was unaware of.When I questioned the vendor why I have a Large and ordered the same size it did not fit . The vendor stated that Under Armour has different sizing charts for different shirts . That just did not make sense . How are you to buy a product with `` floating '' sizes.So , I went online to Nordstrum to find the same exact heat guard compression tee . There was a size chart that could be pulled up to check size before ordering ... . only 1 chart for Under Armour . I did all the measurements correctly to find that I was to order a Large.I know the shirt fits tight but since I already HAD a large that fits , and the chart from Under Armor at Nordstrum confirmed that I had ordered the correct shirt size , the statement that there are different size charts for different Under Armour shirts '' just does n't fit ! '' . I personally will visit a store and actually try it on to avoid the hassle and disappointment of waiting for a product that does not fit , seemingly was ordered correctly , and then had to be mailed back .
 I did not expect this top to be skin tight . The other Armour exercise shirt I have is a comfortable fit . It is partly my own fault because I did not realize the significance of &#34; compression &#34; fit .
 Nice shirt but runs really small . I understand they are to be worn tight , but my 14 year old could n't get it over his head . Have to return it .
 The picture and description is of a shirt , what was sent was a sleeveless tank-top , open at the arm pits . Do n't order this if you expect a shirt or plan to use it for submission grappling .
 Great shirt in most respects , but way too small . I bought the Adult Small for my 12-year-old son , who is 5 ft even , 115 lbs , and it is so skin-tight he could barely breathe in it . I 'm exchanging it for the non-compression version .
 This is the first thing I 've ever gotten from under armour . Everyone on my football team has good luck with their products but mine seems to be defective . After one wash the logo starts cracking and the second time worn the logo starts peeling ... wishing for a refund , bad luck I guess .
 Great fabric and tight fit . Problem is that if you are over 6ft tall , then all Under Armour products will be too short in the torso . This company does not listen to the customer .
 This is the first time I 've had anything negative to say about Under Armour , and my complain is not really about the product , but the company , as the 2 shirts I ordered was to be short sleeved , and they arrived as sleeveless , It was a birthday gift to my grandson , and he assured me it was OK . I went along with him , but when I received this letter asking if I would rate the transaction , I had to tell you.I will think twice before I order again , this was a plain and simple order , and you messed it up.If I had had time I would have returned them for the right kind , but they were delivered on the birthday so I gave the package to him as it arrived , ibg1105
 thought the product worked great ... only problem had was first time was too small ... second was that not happy with cost to ship ... way overpriced
 I purchased one of these shirts from Sport Check and paid $ 30 for it . It was comfortable and I had no problems with it until 1 day I noticed some white flakes on the front of it . When I tried to wipe them off I saw that it was the material that was flaking off in a perfect circle . The more I brushed the bigger the hole grew . Now you can see through the center of my shirt like some nylon stockings , which looks pretty girly . For a $ 30 shirt I sure expected to get a lot more wear out of it .
 The shirt is great looking and well made ; however , it is so very long . I ordered the shirt in regular size , but it 's much longer than those in most tall sizes . I 'm over six feet and the shirt hem hangs down almost to my knees . What 's not mentioned in the shirt description , is that it is almost three feet long .

I 'm over six feet and the shirt hem hangs down almost to my knees . What 's not mentioned in the shirt description , is that it is almost three feet long .

 I bought three pairs of jeans in two separate orders and only one pair was right . The other two were smaller than advertised , even though the tags displayed the dimensions I ordered . I measured the waistline myself and found that one pair was just under 2 inches smaller than I ordered and the other was four inches smaller . One of them came with several belt loops torn away from the waistline . The first order had paid for my return shipping and a full refund because they were torn , but the second return was at my expense and a restocking fee is to be applied since they were not damaged.The pair that I kept were perfect in every way , so no complaints there .

 I purchased this as a gift for my younger brother for Christmas . He opened it and was wildly excited because he 's been wanting one for awhile . We were much dismayed then when we put the batteries in and the light did not work . We were able to determine , using some electrical equipment his grandfather had , that it was the lightbulb that was defective not the whole piece . However , we 've now gone to three stores and have been unable to locate the correct bulb . We are trying one more store before returning the product . VERY inconvenient for something that should have worked from the start .

 Nice shirt , quick delivery . However , the shirt was not true to size . It was too small for my son and he did n't get to wear it except twice . Therefore , if you want to order this shirt order a larger size than you need and do n't dry it .

 The outside of this robe is very soft , but the inside is rough and scratchy . I do n't understand ! You can turn it inside out , but then you ca n't use the belt loops . It does have belt loops at two different heights , which is nice to make it fit right . It 's a good length -- I 'm 5 ' 6 , and it hits at mid calf . But the point of a robe is for it to be soft and comfortable , which it is n't . The seams on the belt are also unraveling after about 10 washes .

 I had a event to attend and needed a 50 's top . I found a poodle top and had it shipped over night.That was Thursday and my event was Saturday . I paid $ 37.00 to get it shipped over night and it did not get here until Tuesday afternoon . I am very unhappy . If you ca n't get it here do n't have overnite as an option.Mary McMahon
 Poor Quality . Poodle did not look like a poodle , fabric very poor quality cotton and was styled as a bowling shirt . No problem with return and money was promptly refunded .
 I was really dissapointed with this purchase . There is no conversion table for measurements so I ordered a 2X and the shirt came in the size of a blanket -- so order small . The shipping was really expensive and I ended up having to get a refund because it costs over $ 20 in shipping to get a exchange since you -LRB- the customer -RRB- has to pay for all shipping . I was not happy because I ended up spending $ 14 on shipping for nothing -- by the time the company got the shirt back and called me for my credit card number for more shipping to send a smaller size , I was already tired of dealing with the high shipping . It is better to order the individual poodle patches from their site and hot glue them to a black shirt -- it is not worth the $ 40 buying the shirt online if you have to anticipate your size because there is not clear measurement table online .

 The tank itself was very nice but the sizes are misleading . I ordered an extra large -LRB- 10-12 -RRB- and it did n't fit my sisterinlaw who came all the way up from Texas to NJ for her wedding . I wanted it to be special and ended up paying $ 55.00 including an overnight fee for her to get it on time . The shirt fit like a medium -LRB- 6-8 -RRB- . I contacted the seller Sandy Keller at Advantage Bridal and she only offered me an exchange . Not only was there not a larger size but at this point it was too late . The bacholorette party had come and gone and Sandy never got back to me having tried contacting her several times as to a credit/refund . I have contacted Amazon on this seller already . Do n't order from this site . I just got ta hope now that I have a really skinny anorexic friend getting married soon so I can give her the shirt and not waste my hard earned money .

 Even though this is a cheap wig ... it wo n't look good on anyone . The hair shed everywhere and it was basically disgusting . Do not buy !
 well , you get what you pay for . i have many synthetic hair wigs that are more in the $ 40-90 range and the difference is 180 degrees . this wig showed up in it 's plastic bag , bunched up , entire sections of the hair had already come out and the hair sheds off the wig like crazy when you try to brush down the bedhead look -LRB- not as in the the picture , but as in a bag that 'd been smashed against things during shipping and had lumps of hair facing in all the wrong directions -RRB- you lose more clumps of hair and volume . you get what you pay for , and i wo n't settle for this ever again.digging deep down for a positive point ... it 'll be good to give away to someone who wants to have matching pink hair on at a costume event where wigs are assumed , rather than hoping it looks real .
 I should have payed attention to the other review for this wig . Granted , it 's not HORRIBLE but it 's definitely cheap . Because of prolonged packaging , it does n't look a thing like it does in the picture -LRB- style wise -RRB- . I 'm going to see if I can restyle it somehow , but it will probably be a fail since you ca n't really restyle a synthetic wig . Do n't buy this . Spend some extra cash and get a better quality wig .
 What a piece of garbage . The top was chopped and clumpy and trying to brush it was a nightmare . Very disappointed . The shipping was fast , but cost too much .

 These glasses are heavy and the wrap around ear piece hurt behind the ears.i ended up giving them to my son who also did n't like them , gave to his brother who also wo n't wear them . I am now wearing a nice looking pair of sunglasses that I bought for $ 7.00 at a flea market

 this seller charged my credit card and never sent the lunch box . i ordered it on may 30 . in july i began emailing and calling . after several weeks they emailed and said they would look into it . that was the last i heard from them . they wont return emails or answer phone calls.BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE !
 I 've never ever received this item that I ordered . Although the seller -LRB- `` Back to Nature Gifts -RRB- notified me that the product would be slightly delayed , I never heard from them since then , and never received the package . It was terrible experience with this seller !

 My normally sized 5 year old can barely squeeze her hands into these gloves . Word of advice by the bigger size .
 the gloves came with a hole in them . I think the wife just got a new pair locally since she needed to use them that week , and will probably not deal with returning them

 This bra is shaped oddly ; it creates the pointy breast style of the 1950s . I did not like it at all . Also it is very significantly padded , and the top of the bra does not make for a smooth transition from bra to chest .

 AS SOON AS I PUT THESE ON I BEGAN DEVISING A PLAN TO RETURN THEM TO OUR LOCAL KMART FOR AN EXCHANGE ... TOOK TWO TRIES BUT I GOT THEM SWITCHED FOR A KMART BRAND THAT WAS MUCH BETTER ... AND YOU COULD SIT DOWN IN THEM .
 Im not sure if this review will link to the seller at all , but this seller is ridiculous . For one pair of pants , it took them 12 days to ship it and THEN another 12 days to arrive once they were marked as shipped , and I paid over 8 $ in shipping costs . bogus . The specific seller that i suggest avoiding is Silberman 's .
 I just purchased these double knee along with 2 regular pair of Dickie workpants . All three pair were 32 x 30 , but the pair of double knee were more like a 34 '' waist . So I am returning that pair and will try again . After reading all reviews , it seems as though the problem with fit isnt new to this company .
 Not even kidding ... brand new they are stiff as cardboard and extremely uncomfortable , especially when you walk or sit/crouch . Washing them a dozen times may help slightly , otherwise wear them everyday for a couple years without washing them.Unbelievable .
 Got my work pants and found they sent the completely wrong size . The slip with the correct size was sitting in the bag . Laziness is what I call it . Unacceptable .
 I recently purchased my first pair of these work PANTS . Size 30 x 32 . I have been happy with OTHER Dickies pants ... namely the workhorse jean with double knee . But if you are on your knees at all with these work PANTS , the lower seam of the double panel falls directly under your kneecap , making it almost impossible to kneel down on a hard surface without pain . Note that on their double knee JEANS , the reinforcement panel starts 10 inches above the bottom of the pant leg and works like it should . On these work PANTS , the panel starts 13 inches above the bottom of the pant leg . Why would they change it up like that ? I assumed when I bought them , the positioning of the knee reinforcement panel , within the same manufacturer , would be the same . When kneeling down , they ride up just enough to be too high for knee reinforcement . More like thigh reinforcement.When Dickies Customer Service was contacted for explanation , and refund , I got just the standard , non-personal form letter , not signed by anyone -LRB- but still saying to `` just call me '' if you have questions -RRB- They want me to pay shipping , handling , and insurance to send them back , and all they can do is send me another pair of the same style , size etc. . Very disappointed in this product and their customer service .
 This bra is shaped oddly ; it creates the pointy breast style of the 1950s . I did not like it at all . Also it is very significantly padded , and the top of the bra does not make for a smooth transition from bra to chest .
 I bought three pairs of jeans in two separate orders and only one pair was right . The other two were smaller than advertised , even though the tags displayed the dimensions I ordered . I measured the waistline myself and found that one pair was just under 2 inches smaller than I ordered and the other was four inches smaller . One of them came with several belt loops torn away from the waistline . The first order had paid for my return shipping and a full refund because they were torn , but the second return was at my expense and a restocking fee is to be applied since they were not damaged.The pair that I kept were perfect in every way , so no complaints there .

 I broke through the toe on the second wearing . Lousy product .
 These socks do n't stay up and that 's simply unacceptable , especially in a work situation . I 'm very disappointed and will be less inclined to buy Hue footwear in the future .

 These shirts are clearly far from wrinkle-free . I was surprised at how much ironing my white shirt needed . Further , the stain on the collar from sweating did not come off too well . The only reason this shirt does not get 1 star is because it was cheap and that the white color looked good - not a dull white like bad quality or older shirts .
 I was warned by the reviews I read before I bought this shirt , but I thought it might be worth a try because of the price . If they had n't said it was wrinkle free and stain free I would n't think too much of the shirt , but I would n't buy it again . However , it has to be ironed each time and there is no way anyone would wear it without ironing it .

 As a customer , I have to ask , why , if there is an `` assortment of colors '' available , none of which are listed , I should pay money for a pot luck color that the seller chooses ? From a customer perspective , I simply can not understand the reasoning behind this . Although I like the product and the idea , sorry , I will not be purchasing a product from a company that will dictate to me a choice that should be mine . In my book , this is not a level of customer service I will tolerate .

 I did not receive my blouse . After contacting the company twice , I never received and answer from them . VERY disappointed ...
 In the past , the DKNY tights I 've purchased would last forever . However , the pair I purchased from Amazon got runs in them almost immediately . I was very disappointed - and I guess I will switch to another brand .

 Please do some research . Your product does not fit the foto you are selling . See my cap 's differences in color and quality .

 These are very cute little lightweight socks , but they do n't stay up . I hate it when socks crawl down your foot and end up bunched around your instep . Such a disappointment .

 I bought these pajamas because it was a hassel to deal with a nursing bra and top at night in bed . However , if you are going to wear these pajamas in front of anyone , you will still need to wear a bra because you can see right through it .
 I decided to order this set as the majority of the reviews were positive . When I received it and tried it on , I did not like the fabric at all . It is not soft as you would expect for this price . The set looks and feelsmuch cheaper than what it sells for .
 The fabric was not what I expected , too low quality for the price . Garnet Hill had a cheaper pair with better fabric . Not soft enough .
 I have purchased Japanese Weekend in the past - both loungewear and clothing , and had an excellent experience . The fabric was fabulous . For one specific PJ nursing/maternity set the fabric was so buttery soft that I bought another color as well , and for both I got a baby blanket each equally soft and buttery . I purchased this one in Eggplant thinking JW would not fail me . I was am very disappointed . The fabric feels very cheap , like rough cotton , and is not soft at all . The cotton is actually rough , which I do n't expect for something that costs $ 60 + . However , I will still keep it because its so hard to find nursing tops where you can feed two at the same time - I am expecting twins - this one allows me to pull down enough to be able to feed two . It does show cleavage though . I am still feeling very disappointed with JW and the fabric - I can not believe the reviews here are so positive .
