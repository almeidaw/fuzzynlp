 fits great , the blue is amazing , its warm but not too warm , I simply love this one . also got the black one and this a great product .
 I received just what I had ordered , which was the same brand I 've always worn and it was received very quickly before the expected date was even close to being up . I love my Columbia vests .
 Estoy muy contento de haber encargado &eacute;sta prenda . El color es muy suave y elegante . La prenda es muy c&oacute;moda .
 i liked this vest , , , the texture of the fabric is ideal for all season with style the thing is there is not enough pockets , , , , , , but it really serve my life style , , , , ill going to buy two more , , , i love it.i recommend this vest for all walks of life in style .
 Just the right weight to be outside in the Fall or Spring doing things . Keeps you warm without restricting mobility . Looks good and is very functional .
 I ordered several of these in different colors . The quality is great and the sizing is true . Furthermore , they have come out of the washer & dryer looking like new each and every time . If additional colors become available , I wo n't hesitate to order more .
 Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas . Beautiful red shade , and fits extremely well . He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition .
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He is very fussy and almost always finds something -LRB- even if it is really minor -RRB- wrong with anything he either buys or receives . He has worn this vest 3 times and has only had it for 6 days ! The fit was on target a large is a large . The craftsmanship above average . The price very good . This large fit nicely over a bit more belly than desired but would still fit well minus the extra pounds .
 I bought this vest for my husband for Christmas . It was perfect . He 's 6 ' 2 '' and about 220lbs and the XL fits him perfectly . He loves wearing it . It 's great for Southern winters were it does n't get too cold .
 This vest is very warm . It fits snug to your body keeping in your core body heat.The pockets are large . . perfect for someone who likes to carry a lot of things with them.The collar can be flipped up to cover more of your neck , or folded down when it 's not as cold.The fleece is very soft , and the vest overall is made well . I recommend this vest if you ` relooking to keep warm this winter . . either worn solo or as part of your winter layered clothing .
 I have been wearing this vest everyday since i got it . the color is great and the warmth is perfect . its not cold enough to wear heavy down jacket but this is just right for the cool days and nights here is S. Calif. thank you
 I ordered this one night , and had it in my hands within 3 business days - with regular shipping . It is a very good layer to add to any winter gear . It has two side zip-up pockets , and the collar zips all the way up if you need . It is super lightweight , and very warm -LRB- for a vest -RRB- . This vest does stop a tiny bit of wind , but not much . On a cool rainy day , wear this underneath a non-insulated rain jacket -LRB- shell -RRB- , and it 's perfect ! -- Very nice !
 This vest was exactly what I wanted . It has a furry texture -LRB- not all fleeces have that same texture -RRB- ; it has pockets that completely sewn into the garment -LRB- some sew it only on one edge -RRB- ; it has room in the pockets all the way to the side edge -LRB- and not just to the edge of the zipper -RRB- . The fit was good ; the sizes run large , so a L fits an XL person . I am very please and will probably purchase another .
 Bought this vest for my brother and he loves it . I really liked the color of it because its so different .
 The fit , number of zippered pockets , and quality of fabric are all in keeping with a fleece vest that might have cost $ 15 or so more .
 Got this as a present for my dad . He loved it . Ordered an xl should have gone smaller product runs big
 Fits great and what a great price -- medium weight - true to size for mens large . Priced locally at $ 65 dollars
 love columbia products , it helps keep my chest warm so I can lower the heat in the house during the daytime .
 This vest is exactly what I wanted , lightweight yet warm , does n't hinder arm and shoulder motion ; very soft comfortable material .
 I chose thie vest because of the brand and color . It is good quality and stylish . Shipping was fast . I 'm happy , happy , happy !
 Fits just right , material is a nice weight . very warm . Columbia products are always nice . ca n't go wrong with this vest .
 Vest is a nice weight , not too heavy or too lightweight . Great over a long sleeve t-shirt or henley . The charcoal color is really nice . It holds up well through repeated washings . He got this vest last year for Christmas and recently lost it but he loves it so much he asked for a replacement . So if your husband is forgetful like mine you might want to get two . : -RRB-
 I bought this as soon as the Winter cold hit NM and love it . The XL I first purchased was a bit short -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 5 &#34; -RRB- so I then bought an XLT which I put in the morning and wear till I retire at night . Excellent warmth and comfort . Excellent value for money .
 These vests are the most comfortable and great lookingAnd are very affordable and go great with any causual outfit
 My wife bought a couple of these first . I saw them and liked what I saw . Then I learned that she had bought a men 's vest , so I was pretty sure I could have one , too ! The zipper on the pockets is necessary , since the bottom of the opening is about even with the bottom of the pocket and things can fall out . I found one that fits my chest but it is loose at the waist . I will probably take a seam in a bit to correct that . The material is pleasingly soft and warm . They clean up in the washing machine.My wife 's two vests are the same size , but the waistband is larger on one than the other . They were manufactured in different countries .
 Great extra layer for the winter.Very good quality . Generous pockets.Extremely comfortable.Logo over the breast is pleasantly inconspicuous .
 Most of my winter gear is from Columbia and I 've never had any complaints about it . It 's about half the price of a comparable North Face garment and works just as well .
 Like all Columbia products , this item arrived true to fit and size . I purchased this item for my husband and he wears it all the time . It washes well and is very durable . We have had this product for two years and it still looks and feels brand new .
 I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing . It 's comfortable , soft , and keeps me warm . I also like the blue color . Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies . I 'm 6 ' 1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there 's a lot of extra fabric in the middle .
 Nice color and Im wanting to buy another vest different color . I highly reccomend to buy , columbia has great cloths .
 I wear this nearly every day in the office to stay warm . It 's fleece is perfect , and I love the freedom to move my arms . Size is perfect . No complaints .
 Great extra layer to add during the winter months for a fair price . Looks great too around the office or at home .
 My son and my husband loved their new vests . They love the feel and fit and the colors . I will have to remember to get them some more .
 Very nicely made Vest.Columbia has great products.Like the texture of the material.Pictures on amazon page could be better .
 The fit is not too loose and the cypress color is a gray-green cross . Nice neutral color for men . This was purchased for use in winter time , but it 's rather thin to wear alone . It 's better suited for use in spring-time or under a jacket since it 's not bulky .
 Great ! The fabric felt very gentle , and it 's very light . My husband love it very much . I also introduced it to our friends , one of them placed an order , so I bought it again . The size is a little bit bigger .
 The product was made well . It looks good has a lining but I found that it was not as warm as a similar product purchased over 10 years ago . I did not return it as when the weather gets warmer or when I will wear it inside .
 He likes it . A basic black vest . Seems well made unlike some brands whose zippers are not the best quality . If you are not broad shouldered though the sleeve area in the large size is a bit &#34; wingy &#34; looking . My husband is tall but not bulky so it is a little too big in that respect .
 Second of the same type for me . Perfect for cool weather . Yes indeed . comfy warm not restrictive . All one could ask .
 This was a great purchase for my husbands birthday . Very well cut and designed using quality materials that wear well . I purchsed the navy color and it is a very nice shade more of a navy/grey that goes well with everything . My husband wears a size 42 jacket so I purchased the large since the medium I bought him before fit a little too close for his liking , the large is a little roomier . Columbia is always a good product and the price was good too .
 This is a beautifully made vest and my husband loves the color -LRB- bark -RRB- . From another review I was tipped off that the vest runs large , so I got a size smaller than my husband 's usual size -LRB- XL to L -RRB- . It fits perfectly .
 Absolutely a fine purchase . I really like this vest -- the fit , the breathability , the warmth . Excellent quality . I recommend it highly .
 My wife wanted one for Traveling , got it , Love 's it , She is very Happy and i am very Happy . Thanks
 We are very pleased with the Vest that we purchased and are looking forward to giving it to my Father in Law for the holiday . I am sure he will be happy . Sizing looks accurate as does fabric and style . It will be a great gift for him
 This is a great vest . I ordered a medium , I am a 38 &#34; in chest , yet the medium was too big for me really -LRB- if you want a close to the body fit -RRB- . I will get this vest again in a smaller size and other color .
 This vest is of decent quality , not quite as good as the previous Columbia fleece vest as it is thinner . The color is more of a faded black or dark grey than black . I think I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price but for $ 25 it is worth it . I would buy it again .
 everything in order , very good quality product , service stock.came charging according to the agreement.excellent , recommended to all users .
 I ordered this as something to layer underneath my work jackets . It fits well , so it should be comfortable when layering . Even if this just lasts through this winter , it was a great deal at this price.I have a lot of Colombia jackets -LRB- fleece , rain shell , omni-heat jacket , etc. -RRB- , and I have never been disappointed .
 This vest is just right when a jacket is too much , or when a less bulky additional layer is needed . It is true to size and is well constructed . I plan to add other colors to my collection .
 Quality is good , not as thin as some said . Fit is small than usual . I wear a medium usually but was glad I got a small .
 The vest is comfortable and is made well . The size is my only reason for giving 4 stars . The vest runs on the large side . If you want a tighter fit you will have to order at least one size smaller than what you normally wear . It would be better with an elastic draw string too .
 I bought this for my husband last year , for Christmas . At this point in time , no complaints at all from him . Washes well and wears well , and its light color does n't show white dog hair , which was a must for a new vest !
 Quality is good but I need Longs and they dont seem to have many longs
 Bought this for my son in college after he asked for a black fleece vest for his birthday ... He thought it was perfect .
 Got my Columbia Cathedral Vest yesterday . Fits great and does it 's job perfectly.Paid 36 $ for it and its worth the money . It 's also much cheaper than similar products from North Face.Great for a run !
 First off - I am very happy with this purchase as it is exactly what I expected . And for the price , it 's hard to complain.The vest fits very nicely , i got the green large . I 'm a male 5 ' 11 '' and about 190 lbs . It fits me very nicely . Sometimes these vests bunch up around the gut looking dumpy but not this one.I have washed it a few times and it seems to be holding its colour , shape and stretch . It blocks the wind nicely and is perfect for cool autumn weather/early winter when it 's not too brutal but a t-shirt just does n't cut it.The collar is one it 's best features - it folds down nicely to keep your neck warm or you can turn it up to avoid the wind . The material is very soft and feels great on your skin.As for complaints , I find that i really miss having a breast pocket and I wish the pocket zippers went up to open as opposed to down.Since neither of these features were advertised , obviously i ca n't complain about their absence - i just prefer them and will be looking for both on my next vest purchase.One thing that I will knock off a star for is the depth of the pockets . They are quite shallow causing things to fall out easily - especially if you are sitting . If you are going to make a jacket with shallow pockets i think the pocket zips should go the other way ... Just make sure you remember to close the zips ! you can fit your entire hand in if you are trying to stay warm , but there is almost no downward angle to make a good pocket for holding your keys , phone or wallet.While we 're on the topic of zippers i will say that the quality of the zips on this jacket is top-notch . it will open or close from almost any angle and i would be very surprised if they stopped working.At $ 20 it 's hard to imagine a better purchase !
 Columbia fleece vests are the best I 've ever owned -LRB- it 's the third Columbia fleece I 've purchased -RRB- . They 're warm and very durable without being too bulky , making for a good fit and a nice appearance .
 My Significant Other needed something easy to get into because of shoulder surgery ... Perfect for him ! The warmth is wonderful ; the sizing worked out great . He did n't have a vest like this , but now he 's talking about getting another one , in another color . Pricing is perfect too . Ca n't think of any negative !
 Definitely get one size smaller than what you normally wear . I almost always wear an XL and when I tried this on it was baggy and roomy and with an item like this you want it to be snugger .
 Lightweight . I wear it mostly at night in my hammock to keep warm throughout the night . Layers well . Added a drawstring at the waist . Easy to do but would have preferred it was included .
 Although the product is great . It was not the exact color as published . It does not have a different color on the neck
 It was wright for what I was looking for . It arrived in good conditions but the coulor is a bit different that in the picture anyway it fits well , thanks .
 As it usually happens , Columbia makes the best and tis vest is not an exception . comfortable , nice and well made .
 All I wanted was a basic vest for cool summer days . Does the job perfectly . Will not stop the wind or keep you very warm - but if you are a guy needing pockets for your wallet - this works well .
 I have wide shoulders -LRB- 50 Regular suit jacket -RRB- , and the XL fit me perfect . I was especially pleased with the collar - which was shorter when popped than the previous Columbia vest I had owned . My previous fleece vest from Columbia lasted me about 2 years , so I have high hopes for this one as well . Very soft , great fit , extremely comfortable and versatile .
 Purchased this vest as a team vest for our local biathlon team . The fit was slightly large , but that is good for winter wear . The length was just below belt line . This is ideal for keeping the lower back warm while skiing and also shooting . Everyone that got a vest on our team was very pleased with the fit and the look . Great for training and looks good too !
 Dumb me , I ordered the wrong size . No problem with this purchase . It was easy to return and reorder the correct size . Credit came through for this purchase with days of me shipping wrong size back . This firm is `` On he Ball '' when it comes to handling a situation like this .
 While I do n't get too excited by clothing , and this is no exception , I do find this is a well made , comfortably warm vest , that I am glad I purchased .
 I wear this as an insulating layering or by itself over a shirt . It looks much better than my Columbia fleece which does n't have much shape . I like that it is super light and moderately warm .
 I like Columbia garments for myself . So I bought one for My Dad for Christmas . It fits well in the XL and is nicely made.Washable too !!
 Quick service , good price and no complaints after wearing this for a month . Considering ordering another in a different color .
 Great vest for cool sunny days . Vest is a little on the thin side . It looks great and feels great . The only problem occurs is that it lets wind in and out very easily . I would recommend this to a friend , but do n't look for a whole lot of warmth from it .
 Awesome vest . Better than expected , well packed and arrived quickly ! I give it 2 thumbs up and my highest recommendation !
 A gift for my Grandson , quality and craftsmanship excellent , could not ask for a better product , or reliability . Thank you for a great fitting product , my Grandson absolutely loves it .
 I gave my husband this for Christmas and he is pleased , so I am too . Looks good , is comfortable . Have only had it less than 1 week .
 Honestly do n't know what 's all the hype about the North Face is . The good old Columbia looks great , feels comfortable and is well made . Navy color is very pleasant to the eye . I am very happy with the vest .
 My husband absolutely loved his vest I got him . We have even bought these in different colors . We would recommend this to anyone looking for a vest to wear as a casual attire or even a dressy attire .
 Wonderful vest at retail price , the Amazon has outdone itself.For $ 12 + tax , it seems like a steal to me.The material is very soft and of good craftmanship.thank you , Amazon and Columbia
 This product is a good value . Nothing spectacular , but a good deal . I use it as a good layer for skiing to provide warmth for my core without restricting shoulder and elbow movement . It more than adequately provides what I need .
 Every piece of Columbia clothing that I own is top quality and this is no different . It 's a lightweight , and yet warm vest perfect for those crisp fall days .
 Not a whole lot to say other than it 's well built , the fabric is very comfortable and strong feeling and the vest looks great . I 'd buy it again if I had the need .
 this is a very nice vest . looks good on and fabric is great . color stays true when washed as well
 Good light weight Vest.Material soft and flexible.Deep pockets . The fit was great . I wear mine in the office . I would recommend .
 This vest is similar to my Columbia Fleece jacket -- both are excellent and perform very well , especially at this price point . Fast delivery too .
 Was just what i was looking for . Brand new with tags and shipped very quickly . My husband loves it . Color looks exactly same as shown in the pic as well .
 very nice vest . light yet warm enough and not too hot during warmer days . the run a little big , I ordered a Large and had to exchange it for a M and I run on the larger side ... in all great buy I would recommend to a friend hands down ...
 I lost a vest that I previously owned , so I was looking for one to replace it . I am very satisfied with the fit and color of the one I purchased .
 Not the first vest of this type from Columbia that I 've purchased . Exactly what I wanted , soft , light weight but provides the warmth I want . Seems easy to mantian , wears good over time , easy to fold and carry if not needed . Satisfied .
 Have several different brands . . this is the best value of all ... fits great quality stitching and best price of all seen
 Extremely pleased with this purchase . After having ordered the wrong color by mistake , i quickly ordered again . Came exactly as described and within given time . No disappointments here !
 The vest is great -- second one I 've purchased ; however , the zipper , as the vest ages , has a tendency to pull apart at the bottom . The reason is the very short insert piece . Increase the depth of the insert and this vest would rate 5 stars . I bought my first vest at Mervins and when they went out of business I never found this make of vest again until I checked Amazon.com -- a great source and great products .
 I bought this vest for a casual look around the office and not at all disappointed . The sizing is about average , the look is great , and as it is Columbia , the material is of good quality . It will keep one warm in the winter months .
 This was a Christmas gift for my husband that he actually loved . Thanks for a great buy . Will be back !
 I 've had this vest for about a month now & I really do enjoy it.I 've had similar vests in the past , but I needed something newer to wear around the office and under my winter coat when a sweater or hoody just does n't work.The vest is very soft & does n't get caught on much . I bought the dark grey hoping that it would `` hide '' my dogs hair unlike the black vest . And it does . I have a beagle , and I can barely notice when -LRB- a few/decent amount -RRB- of his white & black hairs get on it . Some fleece seems to attract dog hair & never let go - this does NOT.The only negative I have about this vest , as others noted , is that there is n't a pull string around the waist . This has n't really bothered me , but I would like to tighten it up just a little bit.I work outdoors so this is perfect for helping me layer up but allowing me something to wear that wo n't bulk up & slow down my arm movement which happens if you wear too many sweaters or hoody 's . I plan on buying another in a few months so I do n't wear this one out too much . Awesome price too . I checked a couple of stores online and no one had the same price as Amazon .
 I just want to say that is the best way to keep you warm , high quality product and very comfortable .
 Fleece is fleece , but this vest is surprisingly well put-together . The only thing is it missing is a third pocket -LRB- the small vertical one near the left center that most other vests have -RRB- .
 I was very satisfied with the vest . I would get a size smaller than your usual size , they run big .
 Works for what I wanted . Something to wear while walking in cooler temps , where I did n't want a full coat .
 This product was first class -LRB- not a second -RRB- and was as ordered and on time . Ca n't get any better than that .
 This vest is soft yet rugged , true to size and just right for my son for Christmas .
 It 's hard for me to find some shirt with right size sleeve and collar . But that would be a problem for a vest , :-RRB- . I do n't like the zippers on the pockets , i never put any stuff in the pockets . Overall , this is a good vest for me , I wish it a little bit warmer .
 Columbia sizes are really big so just be a little conservative in ordering for sizes . Buy is for less than 20 bucks for getting value .
 I was satified with the product my only concern is that the color was off black insteadof black .
 My experience with this Columbia vest made me feel it was spot on for size . The side pockets a bonus for a mid-layer piece . The vest itself let me wanting a little more . The collar is double the weight of the main body of the vest . It is a nice vest but thin for use as a mid-layer . I myself would have preferred if the body was equal to the collar in weight , but for the price I paid I 'd have to say it matches the quality . I guess I expected a little more from Columbia , as I own other products from them that always went beyond my expectations . Guess I 'll just have to be a little creative in my layering to get the best use out of this purchase . The style and color are nice , but I also got the `` bunching '' effect during active use , maybe better as a low activity use item , walking around town and such . It really comes down to what you 'll be using it for , activity level and quality of other layering items .
 Ordered the Large in Green color and was a great value . Quality was excellent as you would expect from Columbia .
 These vests are well made , stylish and fullfill their purpose exceptionally . They provide a little extra warmth at home when the thermostat is set down low to save energy . But being sleveless they do n't make you sweat . The sizes are exactly as specified . I normally wear large in shirts and jackets , and the large vest fits perfectly .
 Warm and made well and comfortable . Husband wears a large but had to order in medium size . He loves it but beware it runs large . Price was great too !
 Bought this at half the price to replace an old Columbia vest in which the zipper fell apart after a year . Wore it 5 days a week for work so I got my monies worth although I paid full price for that one .
 Columbia Men 's Cathedral Peak VestAmple sizing for stout waste . Soft , good feeling fabric with good zippers and warm comfort.Good color and value for a casual look.It can be worn most of the time for a light jacket or coat . Easy to maintain .
 Like the columbia fleece product they are soft . I got the same product from a discount store and it was cheaper even after tax . I have to rate it as 4 because of the product quality .
 This is my second Columbia vest and I really like them . I would recommend this vest to anyone . I like to wear it to work with my dress shirts and ties . Looks sharp .
 I have received this Vest , It is according the picture and it is beautiful , I like the color and I recommend to the people buy this product .
 This vest is the best value in a fleece vest that I 've found , hands down -- for quality , comfort , durability ... I travel constantly and I like the charcoal color because it shows no lint , hair etc. . I lost one of these and replaced it immediately . It 's perfect for layering in cool or cold weather ... but also for that little extra warmth I need in a refrigerated movie theater . -- When I replaced my lost vest I looked at other brands again and was reminded that this Columbia vest is the best thing out there for the money ... by far .
 One of the better purchases I 've made , in terms of satisfaction and value.The product is well-made and durable , which you come to expect from Columbia . It can be had for a good price and should last for a long time . Fits true to size , zipper works fine , and it does its job
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He finds them to be warm yet keeps his arms free at work . This Columbia vest is very nice and thick . Very nicely made and of good quality .
 Bought this for my husband , and he really liked it . The vest is generously cut and well sewn . It 's also very soft and the color is true and pleasing.Just right for those chilly nights when a long sleeved sweater would be `` too much . ''
 Ca n't beat this vest especially for the price ! I have purchased 3 of them !
 My son was very pleased with this vest . I liked the price for a name like Columbia Sportwear . I also liked how fast it was sent to me .
 The vest is comfortable and roomy , though not the very best of materials .
 This was a gift for someone . From what I saw , he was very pleased with it . The item arrived in a very timely manner .
 Purchased two of these for Christmas gifts . Was very impressed with the quality . Would definitely buy again !
 Columbia gear seems to be priced much lower than other companies like Patagonia and North Face but I feel like the quality of Columbia 's clothes stands up.This vest is exceptionally warm and comfortable .
 The most important factors for me when purchasing a vest were warmth and comfort . This vest is just what I wanted in both categories . It gives me just the right amount of warmth when I go for my morning run without getting too hot once I get warmed up . It 's also comfortable and soft . The pockets have zippers so I can put my keys etc in there and do n't have to worry about them falling out . The only fault I can find is the zippers jingle a bit as I move . Overall I 'm happy with my purchase .
 I got two of these , the blue and the Cattail , which is just brown . They are nice and warm . They look good . They run a little bit big . I got an XL , and I usually wear an XL in everything . I 'm probably right in between a L and an XL . I 'm 6 ' and 240 lbs , if that helps you order yours correctly .
 My son really loves this vest . We ordered two in different colors . It looked very nice on him and he wore it every other day with jeans . A great vest !
 Bought this for my dad for Christmas . He really llikes it . Fits really well and was just as promised and described .
 Perfect fit - this was purchased for an elderly person for indoor wear . It 's not black and it 's not grey - more like graphite . It is very lightweight and keeps him cozy and warm in these cold months .
 We 've been wearing our own Columbia vests for quite some time here in Wisconsin , but it only recently occurred to me that it was just the thing for my 93-year-old dad in Florida , who 's often cold , despite fairly warm temperatures . He loves the vest 's softness and is enjoying having something more youthful and &#34; cool &#34; to wear . I 'm happy to know that it 's easily machine wash and dryable .
 I picked this up to use as a stand-alone or extra layering depending on the temperature . This vest is great - it 's like wearing a soft fleece blanket.It fits easily under all my jackets or sweatshirts . A nice bonus is the zip pockets - they 're great for my phone or warming up my hands very fast .
 What 's to review ? It is fleece , warm , I picked the color and got what I wanted . I did get a better price than I expected.Here is something review-worthy
 This is a good vest and I enjoy the heck out of mine . I actually own two in different colours , since I was given another one several years ago for my birthday . There are already a lot of reviews and opinions here so I will not be too redundant.The vest is Polartec fleece -LRB- 200 mid-weight -RRB- so it keeps the core warm and comfortable down to about 40 degrees F. Any colder and I must go to a higher tech solution . It works wet or dry , and drys pretty quickly if soaked.It 's a cozy piece of gear and I think a perfect gift item for a loved one since they will think of you in the comfort and warmth of it . I actually LIKE that short fuzzy fibres starts to clump and pill like a snuggly , familiar stuffed teddy bear after only a few washings . I often use it as a throw blanket or a pillow -LRB- esp on airline flights -RRB- . It is also very easy to maintain and as I have two , I often have one in the wash as I 'm wearing the other one.I like the roomy sizing as I use this for layering , and this is an intermediate layer . When zipped all the way up , it practically serves as it 's own Polartec scarf around the neck . Being a taller/larger human , I appreciate that this vest is available in extended sizes too.The design of the vest is simple with a stand up/fold down collar , 2 zippered side slash pockets at the waist , and the Columbia logo on the chest.Herein lies , my first minor criticism ... value . For a simple , unlined vest without any `` extras '' -LRB- like chest pocket , map pocket , interior pockets , drawstring at the bottom or the waist , throat abrasion guard , dbl access zipper , uppers shell , back hook loop , even zipper pulls with whistles , compasses and LED lights -RRB- I would expect a basic level price . If you shop around even online you should quickly get a feel for what the no frills model vs. the all the bells and whistles model are comparatively worth.The two pockets that it does have utilizes this elastized sateen material as the interior . Not only is this pocket lining not very warm , but I find that it snags uncomfortably on little dry skin flakes , hangnails , and tiny dry skin spurs on my hands . It might be just me , but it makes it unpleasant to put my hands in the pockets -LRB- for warmth -RRB- . On both of my Columbia vests , I have replaced the pocket liners with nice non-snagging flat mesh -LRB- like that found in luggage pockets -RRB- . Well the world is what you make of it , so of course I have made some heavy mods to my vests , which have made them my favourites and practically daily wear for me.Columbia makes consistently high quality products -LRB- overseas -RRB- geared toward the outdoor person , so paying a little bit extra for the brand name logo is not that painful I guess .
 This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear . Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts . When zipped , it 's just right for those 45-50 degree days -LRB- as long as you 're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store , or short walks -RRB- . It 's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs . My only disappointment is the main zipper . Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started , and it often sticks mid-zip -LRB- as if there was grit or something in it -RRB- . It always ends up working , but not always smoothly . I 'd definitely recommend the vest , and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw , but rather a production glitch , which would not likely affect other buyers .
 I have purchased Columbia products I have liked in the past . So this was not a difficult choice form me . It is sized correctly for the big guys . I ordered a xxlt and it fits just the way it should . I nice way to add a bit of extra warmth under a jacket that need a little help . Good price and a quality product that was shipped fast .
 Ca n't beat the price , but the vest is larger than I thought a large would be - should 've got a medium .
 This Columbia vest is a quality product and is equipped with a durable zipper , style and feel .
 good material and cover . needed to cut of most of the part behind the neck to make it comfortable .
 When you are my size , finding the right clothing is a challenge and buying it on line a bit of a risk . I was happy when they arrived and fit perfectly . They are comfortable and well made . A great value .

 I purchased this to combat allergy attacks when I was doing my lawn work . The effect was amazing . No more sneezing or runny noses ! I could n't be more happy with this product . It is comfortable to wear and has held up well .
 Great Product ; Fits very comfortably and it filters perfectly . I am affected by airborne dust allergies and laundry room particles and lint . Doing my laundry is now allergy and headache free with the easy slip on mask . Provides cool air while breathing as compared to cheap masks . This is a mask you will like wearing for the dusty jobs .
 This product works GREAT , the ONLY problem , for me personally , was that it was a little hard for me to breath easily , without some effort , through the mask .
 I have been plagued by allergies and asthma attacks since my daughter brought home a puppy about a year ago . I had childhood asthma and suffered terrible bouts of bronchitis but had not had an attack in over 25 years until I began living with a pet in the house . I began sleeping in a sealed room with an air filtration system and actually dreaded 3-day weekends where I would be in the house for 3 days without a break from the pet dander . The doctor put me on advair and that helps alot , but I still have random asthma attacks . I bought the 3M HEPA Mask last week and it is a life changer . Sure , I feel silly walking around with a mask and pink `` Princess Leah '' filters -LRB- Why do they have to be pink ? -RRB- . But the mask has me breathing normal again even after the 3-day Thanksgiving weekend . As soon as I feel my lungs beginning to strain , I put on the mask for a few hours and am able to breathe easy without having to leave the house or lock myself in my sealed room . You may ask , `` Why did n't you just get rid of the dog '' ? Well , she has beautiful brown eyes and I fell in love with her the moment I saw her . I get to play with her alot more now that I have the 3M HEPA Mask . Also , the mask is easy to use , and the straps are very comfortable . The only drawback is the mask tends to stick to your face if you sweat . But hey ! Who cares ? I can breathe again !
 Bought this because hay fever kept me out of my garden and pasture . It works well at filtering pollen and allowing me to breath . Much better than a hospital type mask . Once in a while the exhalation valve gets stuck , but blowing out hard will clear it . Very nice fit around the nose , mouth and chin . As comfortable as it can be and still keep allergens out . I can work in the garden and even in the hay fields without feeling like I 'm going to die ! Have no idea how it might work to keep out poison gas .
 bought this product to relieve seasonal allergies . looks silly in public , but as a sufferer of severe seasonal allergies , it prevents almost all of my symptoms!Cons - condensation after prolonged use ; some discomfort round the nose for a good fit .
 This mask is awesome ! I suffer from life-threatening allergies . Wearing this mask has actually reduced the number of visits I have to make to the hospital . Great buy for the money !
 I am using the respirator as a pollen mask , and this product seems to be working to my satisfaction .
 My husband is undergoing a Bone Marrow Transplant at Stanford Medical Center in Palo Alto , CA . These face masks are givien to patients that have a compromised immune system . Dust can be deadly to these patients .
 Due to severe allergy conditions currently , my wife is wearing this mask around the clock . We can say with the mask and medications she has been stable and out of the hospital . Grateful for this product
 I Ordered this right after I took the tour of the Pig Farm in Mexico City while I was on vacation . I think It is working , cause only my Uncle got sick , cause he refused to wear one .
 When you are my size , finding the right clothing is a challenge and buying it on line a bit of a risk . I was happy when they arrived and fit perfectly . They are comfortable and well made . A great value .
 I ordered this as a Christmas present for a friend . For anyone that wears a lot of hats and likes to keep them in good condition ; this is the perfect gift . Especially if they do not have a hat rack or another safe place to keep them . You ca n't fit too many hats inside , I am not sure how many because I have n't tried . But at least 6 can fit it looks like . A must have for hat lovers especially Rocawear fans !!!
 Absolutely a fine purchase . I really like this vest -- the fit , the breathability , the warmth . Excellent quality . I recommend it highly .
 My wife wanted one for Traveling , got it , Love 's it , She is very Happy and i am very Happy . Thanks
 We are very pleased with the Vest that we purchased and are looking forward to giving it to my Father in Law for the holiday . I am sure he will be happy . Sizing looks accurate as does fabric and style . It will be a great gift for him
 This is a great vest . I ordered a medium , I am a 38 &#34; in chest , yet the medium was too big for me really -LRB- if you want a close to the body fit -RRB- . I will get this vest again in a smaller size and other color .
 This vest is of decent quality , not quite as good as the previous Columbia fleece vest as it is thinner . The color is more of a faded black or dark grey than black . I think I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price but for $ 25 it is worth it . I would buy it again .
 everything in order , very good quality product , service stock.came charging according to the agreement.excellent , recommended to all users .
 I ordered this as something to layer underneath my work jackets . It fits well , so it should be comfortable when layering . Even if this just lasts through this winter , it was a great deal at this price.I have a lot of Colombia jackets -LRB- fleece , rain shell , omni-heat jacket , etc. -RRB- , and I have never been disappointed .
 This vest is just right when a jacket is too much , or when a less bulky additional layer is needed . It is true to size and is well constructed . I plan to add other colors to my collection .
 Quality is good , not as thin as some said . Fit is small than usual . I wear a medium usually but was glad I got a small .
 The vest is comfortable and is made well . The size is my only reason for giving 4 stars . The vest runs on the large side . If you want a tighter fit you will have to order at least one size smaller than what you normally wear . It would be better with an elastic draw string too .
 My experience with this Columbia vest made me feel it was spot on for size . The side pockets a bonus for a mid-layer piece . The vest itself let me wanting a little more . The collar is double the weight of the main body of the vest . It is a nice vest but thin for use as a mid-layer . I myself would have preferred if the body was equal to the collar in weight , but for the price I paid I 'd have to say it matches the quality . I guess I expected a little more from Columbia , as I own other products from them that always went beyond my expectations . Guess I 'll just have to be a little creative in my layering to get the best use out of this purchase . The style and color are nice , but I also got the `` bunching '' effect during active use , maybe better as a low activity use item , walking around town and such . It really comes down to what you 'll be using it for , activity level and quality of other layering items .
 Ordered the Large in Green color and was a great value . Quality was excellent as you would expect from Columbia .
 These vests are well made , stylish and fullfill their purpose exceptionally . They provide a little extra warmth at home when the thermostat is set down low to save energy . But being sleveless they do n't make you sweat . The sizes are exactly as specified . I normally wear large in shirts and jackets , and the large vest fits perfectly .
 Warm and made well and comfortable . Husband wears a large but had to order in medium size . He loves it but beware it runs large . Price was great too !
 Bought this at half the price to replace an old Columbia vest in which the zipper fell apart after a year . Wore it 5 days a week for work so I got my monies worth although I paid full price for that one .
 Columbia Men 's Cathedral Peak VestAmple sizing for stout waste . Soft , good feeling fabric with good zippers and warm comfort.Good color and value for a casual look.It can be worn most of the time for a light jacket or coat . Easy to maintain .
 Like the columbia fleece product they are soft . I got the same product from a discount store and it was cheaper even after tax . I have to rate it as 4 because of the product quality .
 This is my second Columbia vest and I really like them . I would recommend this vest to anyone . I like to wear it to work with my dress shirts and ties . Looks sharp .
 I have received this Vest , It is according the picture and it is beautiful , I like the color and I recommend to the people buy this product .
 This vest is the best value in a fleece vest that I 've found , hands down -- for quality , comfort , durability ... I travel constantly and I like the charcoal color because it shows no lint , hair etc. . I lost one of these and replaced it immediately . It 's perfect for layering in cool or cold weather ... but also for that little extra warmth I need in a refrigerated movie theater . -- When I replaced my lost vest I looked at other brands again and was reminded that this Columbia vest is the best thing out there for the money ... by far .
 This was a great purchase for my husbands birthday . Very well cut and designed using quality materials that wear well . I purchsed the navy color and it is a very nice shade more of a navy/grey that goes well with everything . My husband wears a size 42 jacket so I purchased the large since the medium I bought him before fit a little too close for his liking , the large is a little roomier . Columbia is always a good product and the price was good too .
 This is a beautifully made vest and my husband loves the color -LRB- bark -RRB- . From another review I was tipped off that the vest runs large , so I got a size smaller than my husband 's usual size -LRB- XL to L -RRB- . It fits perfectly .
 One of the better purchases I 've made , in terms of satisfaction and value.The product is well-made and durable , which you come to expect from Columbia . It can be had for a good price and should last for a long time . Fits true to size , zipper works fine , and it does its job
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He finds them to be warm yet keeps his arms free at work . This Columbia vest is very nice and thick . Very nicely made and of good quality .
 Bought this for my husband , and he really liked it . The vest is generously cut and well sewn . It 's also very soft and the color is true and pleasing.Just right for those chilly nights when a long sleeved sweater would be `` too much . ''
 Ca n't beat this vest especially for the price ! I have purchased 3 of them !
 My son was very pleased with this vest . I liked the price for a name like Columbia Sportwear . I also liked how fast it was sent to me .
 The vest is comfortable and roomy , though not the very best of materials .
 This was a gift for someone . From what I saw , he was very pleased with it . The item arrived in a very timely manner .
 Purchased two of these for Christmas gifts . Was very impressed with the quality . Would definitely buy again !
 I wear this nearly every day in the office to stay warm . It 's fleece is perfect , and I love the freedom to move my arms . Size is perfect . No complaints .
 Great extra layer to add during the winter months for a fair price . Looks great too around the office or at home .
 My son and my husband loved their new vests . They love the feel and fit and the colors . I will have to remember to get them some more .
 Very nicely made Vest.Columbia has great products.Like the texture of the material.Pictures on amazon page could be better .
 The fit is not too loose and the cypress color is a gray-green cross . Nice neutral color for men . This was purchased for use in winter time , but it 's rather thin to wear alone . It 's better suited for use in spring-time or under a jacket since it 's not bulky .
 Great ! The fabric felt very gentle , and it 's very light . My husband love it very much . I also introduced it to our friends , one of them placed an order , so I bought it again . The size is a little bit bigger .
 The product was made well . It looks good has a lining but I found that it was not as warm as a similar product purchased over 10 years ago . I did not return it as when the weather gets warmer or when I will wear it inside .
 He likes it . A basic black vest . Seems well made unlike some brands whose zippers are not the best quality . If you are not broad shouldered though the sleeve area in the large size is a bit &#34; wingy &#34; looking . My husband is tall but not bulky so it is a little too big in that respect .
 Second of the same type for me . Perfect for cool weather . Yes indeed . comfy warm not restrictive . All one could ask .
 very nice vest . light yet warm enough and not too hot during warmer days . the run a little big , I ordered a Large and had to exchange it for a M and I run on the larger side ... in all great buy I would recommend to a friend hands down ...
 I lost a vest that I previously owned , so I was looking for one to replace it . I am very satisfied with the fit and color of the one I purchased .
 Not the first vest of this type from Columbia that I 've purchased . Exactly what I wanted , soft , light weight but provides the warmth I want . Seems easy to mantian , wears good over time , easy to fold and carry if not needed . Satisfied .
 Have several different brands . . this is the best value of all ... fits great quality stitching and best price of all seen
 Extremely pleased with this purchase . After having ordered the wrong color by mistake , i quickly ordered again . Came exactly as described and within given time . No disappointments here !
 The vest is great -- second one I 've purchased ; however , the zipper , as the vest ages , has a tendency to pull apart at the bottom . The reason is the very short insert piece . Increase the depth of the insert and this vest would rate 5 stars . I bought my first vest at Mervins and when they went out of business I never found this make of vest again until I checked Amazon.com -- a great source and great products .
 I bought this vest for a casual look around the office and not at all disappointed . The sizing is about average , the look is great , and as it is Columbia , the material is of good quality . It will keep one warm in the winter months .
 This was a Christmas gift for my husband that he actually loved . Thanks for a great buy . Will be back !
 I 've had this vest for about a month now & I really do enjoy it.I 've had similar vests in the past , but I needed something newer to wear around the office and under my winter coat when a sweater or hoody just does n't work.The vest is very soft & does n't get caught on much . I bought the dark grey hoping that it would `` hide '' my dogs hair unlike the black vest . And it does . I have a beagle , and I can barely notice when -LRB- a few/decent amount -RRB- of his white & black hairs get on it . Some fleece seems to attract dog hair & never let go - this does NOT.The only negative I have about this vest , as others noted , is that there is n't a pull string around the waist . This has n't really bothered me , but I would like to tighten it up just a little bit.I work outdoors so this is perfect for helping me layer up but allowing me something to wear that wo n't bulk up & slow down my arm movement which happens if you wear too many sweaters or hoody 's . I plan on buying another in a few months so I do n't wear this one out too much . Awesome price too . I checked a couple of stores online and no one had the same price as Amazon .
 I just want to say that is the best way to keep you warm , high quality product and very comfortable .
 Fleece is fleece , but this vest is surprisingly well put-together . The only thing is it missing is a third pocket -LRB- the small vertical one near the left center that most other vests have -RRB- .
 I was very satisfied with the vest . I would get a size smaller than your usual size , they run big .
 Works for what I wanted . Something to wear while walking in cooler temps , where I did n't want a full coat .
 This product was first class -LRB- not a second -RRB- and was as ordered and on time . Ca n't get any better than that .
 This vest is soft yet rugged , true to size and just right for my son for Christmas .
 It 's hard for me to find some shirt with right size sleeve and collar . But that would be a problem for a vest , :-RRB- . I do n't like the zippers on the pockets , i never put any stuff in the pockets . Overall , this is a good vest for me , I wish it a little bit warmer .
 Columbia sizes are really big so just be a little conservative in ordering for sizes . Buy is for less than 20 bucks for getting value .
 I was satified with the product my only concern is that the color was off black insteadof black .
 I bought this as soon as the Winter cold hit NM and love it . The XL I first purchased was a bit short -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 5 &#34; -RRB- so I then bought an XLT which I put in the morning and wear till I retire at night . Excellent warmth and comfort . Excellent value for money .
 These vests are the most comfortable and great lookingAnd are very affordable and go great with any causual outfit
 My wife bought a couple of these first . I saw them and liked what I saw . Then I learned that she had bought a men 's vest , so I was pretty sure I could have one , too ! The zipper on the pockets is necessary , since the bottom of the opening is about even with the bottom of the pocket and things can fall out . I found one that fits my chest but it is loose at the waist . I will probably take a seam in a bit to correct that . The material is pleasingly soft and warm . They clean up in the washing machine.My wife 's two vests are the same size , but the waistband is larger on one than the other . They were manufactured in different countries .
 Great extra layer for the winter.Very good quality . Generous pockets.Extremely comfortable.Logo over the breast is pleasantly inconspicuous .
 Most of my winter gear is from Columbia and I 've never had any complaints about it . It 's about half the price of a comparable North Face garment and works just as well .
 Like all Columbia products , this item arrived true to fit and size . I purchased this item for my husband and he wears it all the time . It washes well and is very durable . We have had this product for two years and it still looks and feels brand new .
 I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing . It 's comfortable , soft , and keeps me warm . I also like the blue color . Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies . I 'm 6 ' 1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there 's a lot of extra fabric in the middle .
 Nice color and Im wanting to buy another vest different color . I highly reccomend to buy , columbia has great cloths .
 Bought this vest for my brother and he loves it . I really liked the color of it because its so different .
 The fit , number of zippered pockets , and quality of fabric are all in keeping with a fleece vest that might have cost $ 15 or so more .
 Got this as a present for my dad . He loved it . Ordered an xl should have gone smaller product runs big
 Fits great and what a great price -- medium weight - true to size for mens large . Priced locally at $ 65 dollars
 love columbia products , it helps keep my chest warm so I can lower the heat in the house during the daytime .
 This vest is exactly what I wanted , lightweight yet warm , does n't hinder arm and shoulder motion ; very soft comfortable material .
 I chose thie vest because of the brand and color . It is good quality and stylish . Shipping was fast . I 'm happy , happy , happy !
 Fits just right , material is a nice weight . very warm . Columbia products are always nice . ca n't go wrong with this vest .
 Vest is a nice weight , not too heavy or too lightweight . Great over a long sleeve t-shirt or henley . The charcoal color is really nice . It holds up well through repeated washings . He got this vest last year for Christmas and recently lost it but he loves it so much he asked for a replacement . So if your husband is forgetful like mine you might want to get two . : -RRB-
 What 's to review ? It is fleece , warm , I picked the color and got what I wanted . I did get a better price than I expected.Here is something review-worthy
 This is a good vest and I enjoy the heck out of mine . I actually own two in different colours , since I was given another one several years ago for my birthday . There are already a lot of reviews and opinions here so I will not be too redundant.The vest is Polartec fleece -LRB- 200 mid-weight -RRB- so it keeps the core warm and comfortable down to about 40 degrees F. Any colder and I must go to a higher tech solution . It works wet or dry , and drys pretty quickly if soaked.It 's a cozy piece of gear and I think a perfect gift item for a loved one since they will think of you in the comfort and warmth of it . I actually LIKE that short fuzzy fibres starts to clump and pill like a snuggly , familiar stuffed teddy bear after only a few washings . I often use it as a throw blanket or a pillow -LRB- esp on airline flights -RRB- . It is also very easy to maintain and as I have two , I often have one in the wash as I 'm wearing the other one.I like the roomy sizing as I use this for layering , and this is an intermediate layer . When zipped all the way up , it practically serves as it 's own Polartec scarf around the neck . Being a taller/larger human , I appreciate that this vest is available in extended sizes too.The design of the vest is simple with a stand up/fold down collar , 2 zippered side slash pockets at the waist , and the Columbia logo on the chest.Herein lies , my first minor criticism ... value . For a simple , unlined vest without any `` extras '' -LRB- like chest pocket , map pocket , interior pockets , drawstring at the bottom or the waist , throat abrasion guard , dbl access zipper , uppers shell , back hook loop , even zipper pulls with whistles , compasses and LED lights -RRB- I would expect a basic level price . If you shop around even online you should quickly get a feel for what the no frills model vs. the all the bells and whistles model are comparatively worth.The two pockets that it does have utilizes this elastized sateen material as the interior . Not only is this pocket lining not very warm , but I find that it snags uncomfortably on little dry skin flakes , hangnails , and tiny dry skin spurs on my hands . It might be just me , but it makes it unpleasant to put my hands in the pockets -LRB- for warmth -RRB- . On both of my Columbia vests , I have replaced the pocket liners with nice non-snagging flat mesh -LRB- like that found in luggage pockets -RRB- . Well the world is what you make of it , so of course I have made some heavy mods to my vests , which have made them my favourites and practically daily wear for me.Columbia makes consistently high quality products -LRB- overseas -RRB- geared toward the outdoor person , so paying a little bit extra for the brand name logo is not that painful I guess .
 This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear . Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts . When zipped , it 's just right for those 45-50 degree days -LRB- as long as you 're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store , or short walks -RRB- . It 's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs . My only disappointment is the main zipper . Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started , and it often sticks mid-zip -LRB- as if there was grit or something in it -RRB- . It always ends up working , but not always smoothly . I 'd definitely recommend the vest , and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw , but rather a production glitch , which would not likely affect other buyers .
 I have purchased Columbia products I have liked in the past . So this was not a difficult choice form me . It is sized correctly for the big guys . I ordered a xxlt and it fits just the way it should . I nice way to add a bit of extra warmth under a jacket that need a little help . Good price and a quality product that was shipped fast .
 Ca n't beat the price , but the vest is larger than I thought a large would be - should 've got a medium .
 This Columbia vest is a quality product and is equipped with a durable zipper , style and feel .
 Bought this for my son in college after he asked for a black fleece vest for his birthday ... He thought it was perfect .
 Got my Columbia Cathedral Vest yesterday . Fits great and does it 's job perfectly.Paid 36 $ for it and its worth the money . It 's also much cheaper than similar products from North Face.Great for a run !
 First off - I am very happy with this purchase as it is exactly what I expected . And for the price , it 's hard to complain.The vest fits very nicely , i got the green large . I 'm a male 5 ' 11 '' and about 190 lbs . It fits me very nicely . Sometimes these vests bunch up around the gut looking dumpy but not this one.I have washed it a few times and it seems to be holding its colour , shape and stretch . It blocks the wind nicely and is perfect for cool autumn weather/early winter when it 's not too brutal but a t-shirt just does n't cut it.The collar is one it 's best features - it folds down nicely to keep your neck warm or you can turn it up to avoid the wind . The material is very soft and feels great on your skin.As for complaints , I find that i really miss having a breast pocket and I wish the pocket zippers went up to open as opposed to down.Since neither of these features were advertised , obviously i ca n't complain about their absence - i just prefer them and will be looking for both on my next vest purchase.One thing that I will knock off a star for is the depth of the pockets . They are quite shallow causing things to fall out easily - especially if you are sitting . If you are going to make a jacket with shallow pockets i think the pocket zips should go the other way ... Just make sure you remember to close the zips ! you can fit your entire hand in if you are trying to stay warm , but there is almost no downward angle to make a good pocket for holding your keys , phone or wallet.While we 're on the topic of zippers i will say that the quality of the zips on this jacket is top-notch . it will open or close from almost any angle and i would be very surprised if they stopped working.At $ 20 it 's hard to imagine a better purchase !
 Columbia fleece vests are the best I 've ever owned -LRB- it 's the third Columbia fleece I 've purchased -RRB- . They 're warm and very durable without being too bulky , making for a good fit and a nice appearance .
 My Significant Other needed something easy to get into because of shoulder surgery ... Perfect for him ! The warmth is wonderful ; the sizing worked out great . He did n't have a vest like this , but now he 's talking about getting another one , in another color . Pricing is perfect too . Ca n't think of any negative !
 Definitely get one size smaller than what you normally wear . I almost always wear an XL and when I tried this on it was baggy and roomy and with an item like this you want it to be snugger .
 Columbia gear seems to be priced much lower than other companies like Patagonia and North Face but I feel like the quality of Columbia 's clothes stands up.This vest is exceptionally warm and comfortable .
 The most important factors for me when purchasing a vest were warmth and comfort . This vest is just what I wanted in both categories . It gives me just the right amount of warmth when I go for my morning run without getting too hot once I get warmed up . It 's also comfortable and soft . The pockets have zippers so I can put my keys etc in there and do n't have to worry about them falling out . The only fault I can find is the zippers jingle a bit as I move . Overall I 'm happy with my purchase .
 I got two of these , the blue and the Cattail , which is just brown . They are nice and warm . They look good . They run a little bit big . I got an XL , and I usually wear an XL in everything . I 'm probably right in between a L and an XL . I 'm 6 ' and 240 lbs , if that helps you order yours correctly .
 My son really loves this vest . We ordered two in different colors . It looked very nice on him and he wore it every other day with jeans . A great vest !
 Bought this for my dad for Christmas . He really llikes it . Fits really well and was just as promised and described .
 Perfect fit - this was purchased for an elderly person for indoor wear . It 's not black and it 's not grey - more like graphite . It is very lightweight and keeps him cozy and warm in these cold months .
 We 've been wearing our own Columbia vests for quite some time here in Wisconsin , but it only recently occurred to me that it was just the thing for my 93-year-old dad in Florida , who 's often cold , despite fairly warm temperatures . He loves the vest 's softness and is enjoying having something more youthful and &#34; cool &#34; to wear . I 'm happy to know that it 's easily machine wash and dryable .
 I picked this up to use as a stand-alone or extra layering depending on the temperature . This vest is great - it 's like wearing a soft fleece blanket.It fits easily under all my jackets or sweatshirts . A nice bonus is the zip pockets - they 're great for my phone or warming up my hands very fast .
 Lightweight . I wear it mostly at night in my hammock to keep warm throughout the night . Layers well . Added a drawstring at the waist . Easy to do but would have preferred it was included .
 Although the product is great . It was not the exact color as published . It does not have a different color on the neck
 It was wright for what I was looking for . It arrived in good conditions but the coulor is a bit different that in the picture anyway it fits well , thanks .
 As it usually happens , Columbia makes the best and tis vest is not an exception . comfortable , nice and well made .
 All I wanted was a basic vest for cool summer days . Does the job perfectly . Will not stop the wind or keep you very warm - but if you are a guy needing pockets for your wallet - this works well .
 I have wide shoulders -LRB- 50 Regular suit jacket -RRB- , and the XL fit me perfect . I was especially pleased with the collar - which was shorter when popped than the previous Columbia vest I had owned . My previous fleece vest from Columbia lasted me about 2 years , so I have high hopes for this one as well . Very soft , great fit , extremely comfortable and versatile .
 Purchased this vest as a team vest for our local biathlon team . The fit was slightly large , but that is good for winter wear . The length was just below belt line . This is ideal for keeping the lower back warm while skiing and also shooting . Everyone that got a vest on our team was very pleased with the fit and the look . Great for training and looks good too !
 Dumb me , I ordered the wrong size . No problem with this purchase . It was easy to return and reorder the correct size . Credit came through for this purchase with days of me shipping wrong size back . This firm is `` On he Ball '' when it comes to handling a situation like this .
 While I do n't get too excited by clothing , and this is no exception , I do find this is a well made , comfortably warm vest , that I am glad I purchased .
 I wear this as an insulating layering or by itself over a shirt . It looks much better than my Columbia fleece which does n't have much shape . I like that it is super light and moderately warm .
 I bought this for my husband last year , for Christmas . At this point in time , no complaints at all from him . Washes well and wears well , and its light color does n't show white dog hair , which was a must for a new vest !
 Quality is good but I need Longs and they dont seem to have many longs
 Wonderful vest at retail price , the Amazon has outdone itself.For $ 12 + tax , it seems like a steal to me.The material is very soft and of good craftmanship.thank you , Amazon and Columbia
 This product is a good value . Nothing spectacular , but a good deal . I use it as a good layer for skiing to provide warmth for my core without restricting shoulder and elbow movement . It more than adequately provides what I need .
 Every piece of Columbia clothing that I own is top quality and this is no different . It 's a lightweight , and yet warm vest perfect for those crisp fall days .
 Not a whole lot to say other than it 's well built , the fabric is very comfortable and strong feeling and the vest looks great . I 'd buy it again if I had the need .
 this is a very nice vest . looks good on and fabric is great . color stays true when washed as well
 Good light weight Vest.Material soft and flexible.Deep pockets . The fit was great . I wear mine in the office . I would recommend .
 This vest is similar to my Columbia Fleece jacket -- both are excellent and perform very well , especially at this price point . Fast delivery too .
 Was just what i was looking for . Brand new with tags and shipped very quickly . My husband loves it . Color looks exactly same as shown in the pic as well .
 I bought this for my husband because he likes a fleece vest with a collar . He is very pleased and the vest looks great . The collar is big enough to really keep the wind off your neck .
 Its comfortable , warm , a little short in length but overall a really nice vest for me to wear in all types of weather . If I had to complain about one thing it would be that it is not fleece like I thought it would be so make sure you know what you 're buying . Other then that a nice product though !
 The vest fits well and is well made . If it had a zippered breast pocket it would be ideal and would get 5 stars . I would order it again .
 I had to replace a vest the job gave me because it was wearing out . I decided to order these vest in different colors . They go great with whatever I wear at the job . The quality is good for the money . I 'm known as the vest guy now .
 fits great , the blue is amazing , its warm but not too warm , I simply love this one . also got the black one and this a great product .
 I received just what I had ordered , which was the same brand I 've always worn and it was received very quickly before the expected date was even close to being up . I love my Columbia vests .
 Estoy muy contento de haber encargado &eacute;sta prenda . El color es muy suave y elegante . La prenda es muy c&oacute;moda .
 i liked this vest , , , the texture of the fabric is ideal for all season with style the thing is there is not enough pockets , , , , , , but it really serve my life style , , , , ill going to buy two more , , , i love it.i recommend this vest for all walks of life in style .
 Just the right weight to be outside in the Fall or Spring doing things . Keeps you warm without restricting mobility . Looks good and is very functional .
 I like Columbia garments for myself . So I bought one for My Dad for Christmas . It fits well in the XL and is nicely made.Washable too !!
 Quick service , good price and no complaints after wearing this for a month . Considering ordering another in a different color .
 Great vest for cool sunny days . Vest is a little on the thin side . It looks great and feels great . The only problem occurs is that it lets wind in and out very easily . I would recommend this to a friend , but do n't look for a whole lot of warmth from it .
 Awesome vest . Better than expected , well packed and arrived quickly ! I give it 2 thumbs up and my highest recommendation !
 A gift for my Grandson , quality and craftsmanship excellent , could not ask for a better product , or reliability . Thank you for a great fitting product , my Grandson absolutely loves it .
 I gave my husband this for Christmas and he is pleased , so I am too . Looks good , is comfortable . Have only had it less than 1 week .
 Honestly do n't know what 's all the hype about the North Face is . The good old Columbia looks great , feels comfortable and is well made . Navy color is very pleasant to the eye . I am very happy with the vest .
 My husband absolutely loved his vest I got him . We have even bought these in different colors . We would recommend this to anyone looking for a vest to wear as a casual attire or even a dressy attire .
 I ordered several of these in different colors . The quality is great and the sizing is true . Furthermore , they have come out of the washer & dryer looking like new each and every time . If additional colors become available , I wo n't hesitate to order more .
 Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas . Beautiful red shade , and fits extremely well . He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition .
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He is very fussy and almost always finds something -LRB- even if it is really minor -RRB- wrong with anything he either buys or receives . He has worn this vest 3 times and has only had it for 6 days ! The fit was on target a large is a large . The craftsmanship above average . The price very good . This large fit nicely over a bit more belly than desired but would still fit well minus the extra pounds .
 I bought this vest for my husband for Christmas . It was perfect . He 's 6 ' 2 '' and about 220lbs and the XL fits him perfectly . He loves wearing it . It 's great for Southern winters were it does n't get too cold .
 This vest is very warm . It fits snug to your body keeping in your core body heat.The pockets are large . . perfect for someone who likes to carry a lot of things with them.The collar can be flipped up to cover more of your neck , or folded down when it 's not as cold.The fleece is very soft , and the vest overall is made well . I recommend this vest if you ` relooking to keep warm this winter . . either worn solo or as part of your winter layered clothing .
 I have been wearing this vest everyday since i got it . the color is great and the warmth is perfect . its not cold enough to wear heavy down jacket but this is just right for the cool days and nights here is S. Calif. thank you
 I ordered this one night , and had it in my hands within 3 business days - with regular shipping . It is a very good layer to add to any winter gear . It has two side zip-up pockets , and the collar zips all the way up if you need . It is super lightweight , and very warm -LRB- for a vest -RRB- . This vest does stop a tiny bit of wind , but not much . On a cool rainy day , wear this underneath a non-insulated rain jacket -LRB- shell -RRB- , and it 's perfect ! -- Very nice !
 This vest was exactly what I wanted . It has a furry texture -LRB- not all fleeces have that same texture -RRB- ; it has pockets that completely sewn into the garment -LRB- some sew it only on one edge -RRB- ; it has room in the pockets all the way to the side edge -LRB- and not just to the edge of the zipper -RRB- . The fit was good ; the sizes run large , so a L fits an XL person . I am very please and will probably purchase another .
 When you are my size , finding the right clothing is a challenge and buying it on line a bit of a risk . I was happy when they arrived and fit perfectly . They are comfortable and well made . A great value .

 IMO this is way better than the V-necks from Calvin Klein and Polo . I bought all three kinds and then bought more Lofteez.The material is stronger and holds up better and the shirts are slightly LESS long . The Polo is thinnest -LRB- stretches after a few wears -RRB- and longest -LRB- probably good if you 're over 6 ' 2 '' -RRB- . Much better thicker cotton in this shirt than the competition .
 I bought these for my husband because larger sizes are so hard to find in stores . It fits him great .
 Husbands never like to shop ! Mine however was happy when we used a gift card he got to buy his favorite underwear on line because it is what he always gets and likes and he could do it in minutes and it shipped right away . He was happy and I did not have to endure grumpy man in the store . He has worn this brand for many years but he wants to pick it out himself -LRB- like it will be different if I do it -RRB- , so he was confident buying it . Good product .
 These v-neck shirts are very nice , and a plus for anyone who wears open collared shirts frequently . FOTL makes good undershirts .
 I bought these for my dad , along with a variety color pack , and they 're alright . They 're more of undershirts . We were looking for something with a little better fabric and would look casual . This did n't meet what we were looking for . We still kept them and he wears them around the house or as under shirts .
 Hubby has been needing these for a while , but local supplies of correct size are not always available . So , here they were on Amazon ! Just the same as previously purchased ones
 As a expected by Fruit of the Loom , this Men 's V-Neck Tee is well constructed , perfect comfort fit especially around the neck and of course with the tagless feature that simply has the required sizing info printed in place of those pesky itchy scratchy tags of days of old !
 I like those undertops . . They R rich of 100 % cotton . . Once i tried them when i was living in canada , i became addicted to them . I have requested them from amazon to be shipped to Kuwait , where i have recently moved .
 Fruit of the Loom Men 's V-Neck shirts are good quality . They are comfortable to wear . I had washed and dried them for about month now and they did n't shrink . For drying , I set medium temperature to avoid shrinking . I do n't expect them to last very long time . The last time I bought Fruit of the Loom V-Neck shirt was 2006 . I weared them for four years before I have to buy new shirts . Thus , I expect these new shirts to last about four to five years .
 Fruit of the Loom Men 's V-Neck Tee 3 Pack , White , XXX-LargeGood quality undershirts that are sized properly . Material appears to be a good quality weight and weave . Very satisfied .
 Fruit of the Loom has done it for me again . My v-neck tee is not only very comfortable but also very inconspicuous when I wear my shirts without a tie . Also , I wish the company would create a cologne with the huggable fragrance of its brand new tees .
 I 've been wearing these non-elastic-top socks for decades , and they are the only really comfortable socks I 've found , and I 've tried many . Somehow they stay in place without making groves on your leg . My only minor complaint is that they do n't come in many colors , but I 'm still totally sold on them for a dress sock .
 Gold Toe is probably my favourite brand of sock . They 're comfortabcotton , with no elastic , and they last . I highly recommend them .
 It is very hard to find nice white socks , they are all the workout short type . They fit him great and he said they were very soft - I probably should have ordered more .
 I this bra for work and I get the support I need through my hectic schedule .
 I purchased this bra on a special for 6.50 . Well worth that price . i am thinking of purchasing more at the current price . very comfortable and great fit -- great everyday bra for larger chests -LRB- I am a 38D -RRB-
 Has very good support , is n't padded or molded , affordable , comes in three different colors . I did n't give it five stars because the material used for the lining pills a lot .
 I bought these bras for $ 7 each , which was a true bargain . They fit well and are well made . My only negative comment is that the exterior fabric is shiny nylon just like a nylon slip and most of my other bras are made out of different materials . Recommend
 i LOVE these bras and DO N'T wear any other but these ... in the passed , i brought so many other types of bras and they NEVER seems to fit right or comfortable.when i saw these onsale at kohl 's , i purchased one and tried it ... and LOVED it , it feels so comfy on and stays in place , so i purchased more ... and when i saw it for $ 6.50 at amazon , what a BARGAIN , i purchased a few more ... i paid double the amount for them at stores ...
 My husband bought one of these shirts last year to try it out . I was very skeptical of the `` no ironing '' claim . I could n't believe my eyes when I took it out of the dryer the first time -- not a wrinkle to be seen . The material is truly miraculous . We both love this product and plan to buy more . Thank you , Jos. Banks !
 I own three of these shirts and they are great . I get my shirts cleaned and pressed and here is an example of what great shirts they are
 I own two of these Traveler non-wrinkle shirts and they are absolutely the best shirts I have ever owned . They are of high quality material and the size I bought was right on the money . The colors offered are very versatile with just about anything a person would own and can be worn formally or casually . I am going to stick with buying more of these shirts .
 I bought 2 to begin with and now own seven and I ca n't see myself buying other dress shirts
 I received this shirt as a gift over Christmas . Since then I have bought two more . The fit is outstanding and I have never felt a finer material in a dress shirt - it is soft yet sturdy and always appears pressed . The iron free is for real . I hate ironing and will pay the extra 20 dollars per shirt to never have to dry clean or iron again . I will never buy another shirt and I almost want to throw away my non-iron free dress shirts . I highly recommend this shirt . You will enjoy it and probably buy more of them .
 These dress shirts are the best ! Wrinkle-Free , Breathable , Durable Material , Plus lots of styles , sizes and color options . Compare side-by-side to other dress shirts and you 'll see and feel the difference .
 Great Quality Product ! Authentic and Great Colors ! Shirt was larger than expected though . I ordered a Large and it was unnecessarily wide . I wish I would have knew or I would have ordered a Medium . So you might want to try a size smaller than you usually buy unless you are a wide person or have worn Puma Brand Shirts before . But it 's definitely a nice shirt !
 Great service and was quick arriving to our APO address . The shirt is great just the colors are reverse of what we thought we bought !
 When you are my size , finding the right clothing is a challenge and buying it on line a bit of a risk . I was happy when they arrived and fit perfectly . They are comfortable and well made . A great value .
 I own about seven of these!Great all weather hats , very cool in the summer , and I like the fact that they can be washed on a gentle cycle .
 got here just in the nick of time for me to wrap it for the bday party it was very cute looked exactly as the picture looked and gave it as a gift the little boy loved it and so did his mommy .
 I bought two sets of this outfit for my two boys . Only the tops came at first , but when I called to find out why that was Dave was EXTREMELY HELPFUL ! He right away helped me and sent out the pants . I recieved them quickly ! THANK YOU for the adorable outfits :-RRB- I would definately buy from this company again .

 Fleece is fleece , but this vest is surprisingly well put-together . The only thing is it missing is a third pocket -LRB- the small vertical one near the left center that most other vests have -RRB- .
 I was very satisfied with the vest . I would get a size smaller than your usual size , they run big .
 I had to replace a vest the job gave me because it was wearing out . I decided to order these vest in different colors . They go great with whatever I wear at the job . The quality is good for the money . I 'm known as the vest guy now .

 very nice vest . light yet warm enough and not too hot during warmer days . the run a little big , I ordered a Large and had to exchange it for a M and I run on the larger side ... in all great buy I would recommend to a friend hands down ...
 I lost a vest that I previously owned , so I was looking for one to replace it . I am very satisfied with the fit and color of the one I purchased .
 Not the first vest of this type from Columbia that I 've purchased . Exactly what I wanted , soft , light weight but provides the warmth I want . Seems easy to mantian , wears good over time , easy to fold and carry if not needed . Satisfied .
 Awesome vest . Better than expected , well packed and arrived quickly ! I give it 2 thumbs up and my highest recommendation !
 A gift for my Grandson , quality and craftsmanship excellent , could not ask for a better product , or reliability . Thank you for a great fitting product , my Grandson absolutely loves it .

 Bought this vest for my brother and he loves it . I really liked the color of it because its so different .
 The fit , number of zippered pockets , and quality of fabric are all in keeping with a fleece vest that might have cost $ 15 or so more .
 Got this as a present for my dad . He loved it . Ordered an xl should have gone smaller product runs big
 Wonderful vest at retail price , the Amazon has outdone itself.For $ 12 + tax , it seems like a steal to me.The material is very soft and of good craftmanship.thank you , Amazon and Columbia
 This product is a good value . Nothing spectacular , but a good deal . I use it as a good layer for skiing to provide warmth for my core without restricting shoulder and elbow movement . It more than adequately provides what I need .
 Every piece of Columbia clothing that I own is top quality and this is no different . It 's a lightweight , and yet warm vest perfect for those crisp fall days .
 Good light weight Vest.Material soft and flexible.Deep pockets . The fit was great . I wear mine in the office . I would recommend .
 This vest is similar to my Columbia Fleece jacket -- both are excellent and perform very well , especially at this price point . Fast delivery too .
 Was just what i was looking for . Brand new with tags and shipped very quickly . My husband loves it . Color looks exactly same as shown in the pic as well .
 I bought this as soon as the Winter cold hit NM and love it . The XL I first purchased was a bit short -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 5 &#34; -RRB- so I then bought an XLT which I put in the morning and wear till I retire at night . Excellent warmth and comfort . Excellent value for money .
 These vests are the most comfortable and great lookingAnd are very affordable and go great with any causual outfit
 My wife bought a couple of these first . I saw them and liked what I saw . Then I learned that she had bought a men 's vest , so I was pretty sure I could have one , too ! The zipper on the pockets is necessary , since the bottom of the opening is about even with the bottom of the pocket and things can fall out . I found one that fits my chest but it is loose at the waist . I will probably take a seam in a bit to correct that . The material is pleasingly soft and warm . They clean up in the washing machine.My wife 's two vests are the same size , but the waistband is larger on one than the other . They were manufactured in different countries .
 As it usually happens , Columbia makes the best and tis vest is not an exception . comfortable , nice and well made .
 All I wanted was a basic vest for cool summer days . Does the job perfectly . Will not stop the wind or keep you very warm - but if you are a guy needing pockets for your wallet - this works well .
 I have wide shoulders -LRB- 50 Regular suit jacket -RRB- , and the XL fit me perfect . I was especially pleased with the collar - which was shorter when popped than the previous Columbia vest I had owned . My previous fleece vest from Columbia lasted me about 2 years , so I have high hopes for this one as well . Very soft , great fit , extremely comfortable and versatile .
 Purchased this vest as a team vest for our local biathlon team . The fit was slightly large , but that is good for winter wear . The length was just below belt line . This is ideal for keeping the lower back warm while skiing and also shooting . Everyone that got a vest on our team was very pleased with the fit and the look . Great for training and looks good too !
 Dumb me , I ordered the wrong size . No problem with this purchase . It was easy to return and reorder the correct size . Credit came through for this purchase with days of me shipping wrong size back . This firm is `` On he Ball '' when it comes to handling a situation like this .
 While I do n't get too excited by clothing , and this is no exception , I do find this is a well made , comfortably warm vest , that I am glad I purchased .
 I wear this as an insulating layering or by itself over a shirt . It looks much better than my Columbia fleece which does n't have much shape . I like that it is super light and moderately warm .
 I ordered several of these in different colors . The quality is great and the sizing is true . Furthermore , they have come out of the washer & dryer looking like new each and every time . If additional colors become available , I wo n't hesitate to order more .
 Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas . Beautiful red shade , and fits extremely well . He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition .
 First off - I am very happy with this purchase as it is exactly what I expected . And for the price , it 's hard to complain.The vest fits very nicely , i got the green large . I 'm a male 5 ' 11 '' and about 190 lbs . It fits me very nicely . Sometimes these vests bunch up around the gut looking dumpy but not this one.I have washed it a few times and it seems to be holding its colour , shape and stretch . It blocks the wind nicely and is perfect for cool autumn weather/early winter when it 's not too brutal but a t-shirt just does n't cut it.The collar is one it 's best features - it folds down nicely to keep your neck warm or you can turn it up to avoid the wind . The material is very soft and feels great on your skin.As for complaints , I find that i really miss having a breast pocket and I wish the pocket zippers went up to open as opposed to down.Since neither of these features were advertised , obviously i ca n't complain about their absence - i just prefer them and will be looking for both on my next vest purchase.One thing that I will knock off a star for is the depth of the pockets . They are quite shallow causing things to fall out easily - especially if you are sitting . If you are going to make a jacket with shallow pockets i think the pocket zips should go the other way ... Just make sure you remember to close the zips ! you can fit your entire hand in if you are trying to stay warm , but there is almost no downward angle to make a good pocket for holding your keys , phone or wallet.While we 're on the topic of zippers i will say that the quality of the zips on this jacket is top-notch . it will open or close from almost any angle and i would be very surprised if they stopped working.At $ 20 it 's hard to imagine a better purchase !
 Columbia fleece vests are the best I 've ever owned -LRB- it 's the third Columbia fleece I 've purchased -RRB- . They 're warm and very durable without being too bulky , making for a good fit and a nice appearance .
 My Significant Other needed something easy to get into because of shoulder surgery ... Perfect for him ! The warmth is wonderful ; the sizing worked out great . He did n't have a vest like this , but now he 's talking about getting another one , in another color . Pricing is perfect too . Ca n't think of any negative !
 Definitely get one size smaller than what you normally wear . I almost always wear an XL and when I tried this on it was baggy and roomy and with an item like this you want it to be snugger .
 I bought this for my husband because he likes a fleece vest with a collar . He is very pleased and the vest looks great . The collar is big enough to really keep the wind off your neck .
 Its comfortable , warm , a little short in length but overall a really nice vest for me to wear in all types of weather . If I had to complain about one thing it would be that it is not fleece like I thought it would be so make sure you know what you 're buying . Other then that a nice product though !
 The vest fits well and is well made . If it had a zippered breast pocket it would be ideal and would get 5 stars . I would order it again .
 I got two of these , the blue and the Cattail , which is just brown . They are nice and warm . They look good . They run a little bit big . I got an XL , and I usually wear an XL in everything . I 'm probably right in between a L and an XL . I 'm 6 ' and 240 lbs , if that helps you order yours correctly .
 My son really loves this vest . We ordered two in different colors . It looked very nice on him and he wore it every other day with jeans . A great vest !
 Bought this for my dad for Christmas . He really llikes it . Fits really well and was just as promised and described .
 Perfect fit - this was purchased for an elderly person for indoor wear . It 's not black and it 's not grey - more like graphite . It is very lightweight and keeps him cozy and warm in these cold months .
 We 've been wearing our own Columbia vests for quite some time here in Wisconsin , but it only recently occurred to me that it was just the thing for my 93-year-old dad in Florida , who 's often cold , despite fairly warm temperatures . He loves the vest 's softness and is enjoying having something more youthful and &#34; cool &#34; to wear . I 'm happy to know that it 's easily machine wash and dryable .
 I picked this up to use as a stand-alone or extra layering depending on the temperature . This vest is great - it 's like wearing a soft fleece blanket.It fits easily under all my jackets or sweatshirts . A nice bonus is the zip pockets - they 're great for my phone or warming up my hands very fast .
 I like Columbia garments for myself . So I bought one for My Dad for Christmas . It fits well in the XL and is nicely made.Washable too !!
 Quick service , good price and no complaints after wearing this for a month . Considering ordering another in a different color .
 Great vest for cool sunny days . Vest is a little on the thin side . It looks great and feels great . The only problem occurs is that it lets wind in and out very easily . I would recommend this to a friend , but do n't look for a whole lot of warmth from it .
 What 's to review ? It is fleece , warm , I picked the color and got what I wanted . I did get a better price than I expected.Here is something review-worthy
 This is a good vest and I enjoy the heck out of mine . I actually own two in different colours , since I was given another one several years ago for my birthday . There are already a lot of reviews and opinions here so I will not be too redundant.The vest is Polartec fleece -LRB- 200 mid-weight -RRB- so it keeps the core warm and comfortable down to about 40 degrees F. Any colder and I must go to a higher tech solution . It works wet or dry , and drys pretty quickly if soaked.It 's a cozy piece of gear and I think a perfect gift item for a loved one since they will think of you in the comfort and warmth of it . I actually LIKE that short fuzzy fibres starts to clump and pill like a snuggly , familiar stuffed teddy bear after only a few washings . I often use it as a throw blanket or a pillow -LRB- esp on airline flights -RRB- . It is also very easy to maintain and as I have two , I often have one in the wash as I 'm wearing the other one.I like the roomy sizing as I use this for layering , and this is an intermediate layer . When zipped all the way up , it practically serves as it 's own Polartec scarf around the neck . Being a taller/larger human , I appreciate that this vest is available in extended sizes too.The design of the vest is simple with a stand up/fold down collar , 2 zippered side slash pockets at the waist , and the Columbia logo on the chest.Herein lies , my first minor criticism ... value . For a simple , unlined vest without any `` extras '' -LRB- like chest pocket , map pocket , interior pockets , drawstring at the bottom or the waist , throat abrasion guard , dbl access zipper , uppers shell , back hook loop , even zipper pulls with whistles , compasses and LED lights -RRB- I would expect a basic level price . If you shop around even online you should quickly get a feel for what the no frills model vs. the all the bells and whistles model are comparatively worth.The two pockets that it does have utilizes this elastized sateen material as the interior . Not only is this pocket lining not very warm , but I find that it snags uncomfortably on little dry skin flakes , hangnails , and tiny dry skin spurs on my hands . It might be just me , but it makes it unpleasant to put my hands in the pockets -LRB- for warmth -RRB- . On both of my Columbia vests , I have replaced the pocket liners with nice non-snagging flat mesh -LRB- like that found in luggage pockets -RRB- . Well the world is what you make of it , so of course I have made some heavy mods to my vests , which have made them my favourites and practically daily wear for me.Columbia makes consistently high quality products -LRB- overseas -RRB- geared toward the outdoor person , so paying a little bit extra for the brand name logo is not that painful I guess .
 This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear . Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts . When zipped , it 's just right for those 45-50 degree days -LRB- as long as you 're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store , or short walks -RRB- . It 's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs . My only disappointment is the main zipper . Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started , and it often sticks mid-zip -LRB- as if there was grit or something in it -RRB- . It always ends up working , but not always smoothly . I 'd definitely recommend the vest , and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw , but rather a production glitch , which would not likely affect other buyers .
 I have purchased Columbia products I have liked in the past . So this was not a difficult choice form me . It is sized correctly for the big guys . I ordered a xxlt and it fits just the way it should . I nice way to add a bit of extra warmth under a jacket that need a little help . Good price and a quality product that was shipped fast .
 Ca n't beat the price , but the vest is larger than I thought a large would be - should 've got a medium .
 This Columbia vest is a quality product and is equipped with a durable zipper , style and feel .
 Works for what I wanted . Something to wear while walking in cooler temps , where I did n't want a full coat .
 This product was first class -LRB- not a second -RRB- and was as ordered and on time . Ca n't get any better than that .
 This vest is soft yet rugged , true to size and just right for my son for Christmas .
 It 's hard for me to find some shirt with right size sleeve and collar . But that would be a problem for a vest , :-RRB- . I do n't like the zippers on the pockets , i never put any stuff in the pockets . Overall , this is a good vest for me , I wish it a little bit warmer .
 Columbia sizes are really big so just be a little conservative in ordering for sizes . Buy is for less than 20 bucks for getting value .
 I was satified with the product my only concern is that the color was off black insteadof black .
 One of the better purchases I 've made , in terms of satisfaction and value.The product is well-made and durable , which you come to expect from Columbia . It can be had for a good price and should last for a long time . Fits true to size , zipper works fine , and it does its job
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He finds them to be warm yet keeps his arms free at work . This Columbia vest is very nice and thick . Very nicely made and of good quality .
 Bought this for my husband , and he really liked it . The vest is generously cut and well sewn . It 's also very soft and the color is true and pleasing.Just right for those chilly nights when a long sleeved sweater would be `` too much . ''
 Have several different brands . . this is the best value of all ... fits great quality stitching and best price of all seen
 Extremely pleased with this purchase . After having ordered the wrong color by mistake , i quickly ordered again . Came exactly as described and within given time . No disappointments here !
 The vest is great -- second one I 've purchased ; however , the zipper , as the vest ages , has a tendency to pull apart at the bottom . The reason is the very short insert piece . Increase the depth of the insert and this vest would rate 5 stars . I bought my first vest at Mervins and when they went out of business I never found this make of vest again until I checked Amazon.com -- a great source and great products .
 I bought this vest for a casual look around the office and not at all disappointed . The sizing is about average , the look is great , and as it is Columbia , the material is of good quality . It will keep one warm in the winter months .
 This was a Christmas gift for my husband that he actually loved . Thanks for a great buy . Will be back !
 I 've had this vest for about a month now & I really do enjoy it.I 've had similar vests in the past , but I needed something newer to wear around the office and under my winter coat when a sweater or hoody just does n't work.The vest is very soft & does n't get caught on much . I bought the dark grey hoping that it would `` hide '' my dogs hair unlike the black vest . And it does . I have a beagle , and I can barely notice when -LRB- a few/decent amount -RRB- of his white & black hairs get on it . Some fleece seems to attract dog hair & never let go - this does NOT.The only negative I have about this vest , as others noted , is that there is n't a pull string around the waist . This has n't really bothered me , but I would like to tighten it up just a little bit.I work outdoors so this is perfect for helping me layer up but allowing me something to wear that wo n't bulk up & slow down my arm movement which happens if you wear too many sweaters or hoody 's . I plan on buying another in a few months so I do n't wear this one out too much . Awesome price too . I checked a couple of stores online and no one had the same price as Amazon .
 I just want to say that is the best way to keep you warm , high quality product and very comfortable .
 My experience with this Columbia vest made me feel it was spot on for size . The side pockets a bonus for a mid-layer piece . The vest itself let me wanting a little more . The collar is double the weight of the main body of the vest . It is a nice vest but thin for use as a mid-layer . I myself would have preferred if the body was equal to the collar in weight , but for the price I paid I 'd have to say it matches the quality . I guess I expected a little more from Columbia , as I own other products from them that always went beyond my expectations . Guess I 'll just have to be a little creative in my layering to get the best use out of this purchase . The style and color are nice , but I also got the `` bunching '' effect during active use , maybe better as a low activity use item , walking around town and such . It really comes down to what you 'll be using it for , activity level and quality of other layering items .
 Ordered the Large in Green color and was a great value . Quality was excellent as you would expect from Columbia .
 These vests are well made , stylish and fullfill their purpose exceptionally . They provide a little extra warmth at home when the thermostat is set down low to save energy . But being sleveless they do n't make you sweat . The sizes are exactly as specified . I normally wear large in shirts and jackets , and the large vest fits perfectly .
 Fits great and what a great price -- medium weight - true to size for mens large . Priced locally at $ 65 dollars
 love columbia products , it helps keep my chest warm so I can lower the heat in the house during the daytime .
 This vest is exactly what I wanted , lightweight yet warm , does n't hinder arm and shoulder motion ; very soft comfortable material .
 I chose thie vest because of the brand and color . It is good quality and stylish . Shipping was fast . I 'm happy , happy , happy !
 Fits just right , material is a nice weight . very warm . Columbia products are always nice . ca n't go wrong with this vest .
 Vest is a nice weight , not too heavy or too lightweight . Great over a long sleeve t-shirt or henley . The charcoal color is really nice . It holds up well through repeated washings . He got this vest last year for Christmas and recently lost it but he loves it so much he asked for a replacement . So if your husband is forgetful like mine you might want to get two . : -RRB-
 Absolutely a fine purchase . I really like this vest -- the fit , the breathability , the warmth . Excellent quality . I recommend it highly .
 My wife wanted one for Traveling , got it , Love 's it , She is very Happy and i am very Happy . Thanks
 We are very pleased with the Vest that we purchased and are looking forward to giving it to my Father in Law for the holiday . I am sure he will be happy . Sizing looks accurate as does fabric and style . It will be a great gift for him
 Great extra layer for the winter.Very good quality . Generous pockets.Extremely comfortable.Logo over the breast is pleasantly inconspicuous .
 Most of my winter gear is from Columbia and I 've never had any complaints about it . It 's about half the price of a comparable North Face garment and works just as well .
 Like all Columbia products , this item arrived true to fit and size . I purchased this item for my husband and he wears it all the time . It washes well and is very durable . We have had this product for two years and it still looks and feels brand new .
 I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing . It 's comfortable , soft , and keeps me warm . I also like the blue color . Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies . I 'm 6 ' 1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there 's a lot of extra fabric in the middle .
 Nice color and Im wanting to buy another vest different color . I highly reccomend to buy , columbia has great cloths .
 I wear this nearly every day in the office to stay warm . It 's fleece is perfect , and I love the freedom to move my arms . Size is perfect . No complaints .
 Great extra layer to add during the winter months for a fair price . Looks great too around the office or at home .
 My son and my husband loved their new vests . They love the feel and fit and the colors . I will have to remember to get them some more .
 Ca n't beat this vest especially for the price ! I have purchased 3 of them !
 My son was very pleased with this vest . I liked the price for a name like Columbia Sportwear . I also liked how fast it was sent to me .
 The vest is comfortable and roomy , though not the very best of materials .
 This was a gift for someone . From what I saw , he was very pleased with it . The item arrived in a very timely manner .
 Purchased two of these for Christmas gifts . Was very impressed with the quality . Would definitely buy again !
 I bought this for my husband last year , for Christmas . At this point in time , no complaints at all from him . Washes well and wears well , and its light color does n't show white dog hair , which was a must for a new vest !
 Quality is good but I need Longs and they dont seem to have many longs
 Warm and made well and comfortable . Husband wears a large but had to order in medium size . He loves it but beware it runs large . Price was great too !
 Bought this at half the price to replace an old Columbia vest in which the zipper fell apart after a year . Wore it 5 days a week for work so I got my monies worth although I paid full price for that one .
 Columbia Men 's Cathedral Peak VestAmple sizing for stout waste . Soft , good feeling fabric with good zippers and warm comfort.Good color and value for a casual look.It can be worn most of the time for a light jacket or coat . Easy to maintain .
 Like the columbia fleece product they are soft . I got the same product from a discount store and it was cheaper even after tax . I have to rate it as 4 because of the product quality .
 This is my second Columbia vest and I really like them . I would recommend this vest to anyone . I like to wear it to work with my dress shirts and ties . Looks sharp .
 I have received this Vest , It is according the picture and it is beautiful , I like the color and I recommend to the people buy this product .
 This vest is the best value in a fleece vest that I 've found , hands down -- for quality , comfort , durability ... I travel constantly and I like the charcoal color because it shows no lint , hair etc. . I lost one of these and replaced it immediately . It 's perfect for layering in cool or cold weather ... but also for that little extra warmth I need in a refrigerated movie theater . -- When I replaced my lost vest I looked at other brands again and was reminded that this Columbia vest is the best thing out there for the money ... by far .
 Lightweight . I wear it mostly at night in my hammock to keep warm throughout the night . Layers well . Added a drawstring at the waist . Easy to do but would have preferred it was included .
 Although the product is great . It was not the exact color as published . It does not have a different color on the neck
 It was wright for what I was looking for . It arrived in good conditions but the coulor is a bit different that in the picture anyway it fits well , thanks .
 Very nicely made Vest.Columbia has great products.Like the texture of the material.Pictures on amazon page could be better .
 The fit is not too loose and the cypress color is a gray-green cross . Nice neutral color for men . This was purchased for use in winter time , but it 's rather thin to wear alone . It 's better suited for use in spring-time or under a jacket since it 's not bulky .
 Great ! The fabric felt very gentle , and it 's very light . My husband love it very much . I also introduced it to our friends , one of them placed an order , so I bought it again . The size is a little bit bigger .
 The product was made well . It looks good has a lining but I found that it was not as warm as a similar product purchased over 10 years ago . I did not return it as when the weather gets warmer or when I will wear it inside .
 He likes it . A basic black vest . Seems well made unlike some brands whose zippers are not the best quality . If you are not broad shouldered though the sleeve area in the large size is a bit &#34; wingy &#34; looking . My husband is tall but not bulky so it is a little too big in that respect .
 Second of the same type for me . Perfect for cool weather . Yes indeed . comfy warm not restrictive . All one could ask .
 Columbia gear seems to be priced much lower than other companies like Patagonia and North Face but I feel like the quality of Columbia 's clothes stands up.This vest is exceptionally warm and comfortable .
 The most important factors for me when purchasing a vest were warmth and comfort . This vest is just what I wanted in both categories . It gives me just the right amount of warmth when I go for my morning run without getting too hot once I get warmed up . It 's also comfortable and soft . The pockets have zippers so I can put my keys etc in there and do n't have to worry about them falling out . The only fault I can find is the zippers jingle a bit as I move . Overall I 'm happy with my purchase .
 This was a great purchase for my husbands birthday . Very well cut and designed using quality materials that wear well . I purchsed the navy color and it is a very nice shade more of a navy/grey that goes well with everything . My husband wears a size 42 jacket so I purchased the large since the medium I bought him before fit a little too close for his liking , the large is a little roomier . Columbia is always a good product and the price was good too .
 This is a beautifully made vest and my husband loves the color -LRB- bark -RRB- . From another review I was tipped off that the vest runs large , so I got a size smaller than my husband 's usual size -LRB- XL to L -RRB- . It fits perfectly .
 This is a great vest . I ordered a medium , I am a 38 &#34; in chest , yet the medium was too big for me really -LRB- if you want a close to the body fit -RRB- . I will get this vest again in a smaller size and other color .
 This vest is of decent quality , not quite as good as the previous Columbia fleece vest as it is thinner . The color is more of a faded black or dark grey than black . I think I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price but for $ 25 it is worth it . I would buy it again .
 everything in order , very good quality product , service stock.came charging according to the agreement.excellent , recommended to all users .
 I ordered this as something to layer underneath my work jackets . It fits well , so it should be comfortable when layering . Even if this just lasts through this winter , it was a great deal at this price.I have a lot of Colombia jackets -LRB- fleece , rain shell , omni-heat jacket , etc. -RRB- , and I have never been disappointed .
 This vest is just right when a jacket is too much , or when a less bulky additional layer is needed . It is true to size and is well constructed . I plan to add other colors to my collection .
 Quality is good , not as thin as some said . Fit is small than usual . I wear a medium usually but was glad I got a small .
 The vest is comfortable and is made well . The size is my only reason for giving 4 stars . The vest runs on the large side . If you want a tighter fit you will have to order at least one size smaller than what you normally wear . It would be better with an elastic draw string too .
 Bought this for my son in college after he asked for a black fleece vest for his birthday ... He thought it was perfect .
 Got my Columbia Cathedral Vest yesterday . Fits great and does it 's job perfectly.Paid 36 $ for it and its worth the money . It 's also much cheaper than similar products from North Face.Great for a run !
 I ordered a 173rd Abn Baseball cap on 2/7/09 , received confirmation on 2/8 and package arrived as promised on 2/11 . Produce was excellent . I 'm pleased & would use/recommend seller again . WJH
 When you are my size , finding the right clothing is a challenge and buying it on line a bit of a risk . I was happy when they arrived and fit perfectly . They are comfortable and well made . A great value .

 The fabrics are top quality and the tailoring is fine . The flannel lining is particularly pleasing . The hood is well-designed and has a good snug fit . The weight of the jacket is substantial , adding warmth . If the jacket had a couple of interior pockets , this would be a five-star review .
 My husband bought one of these shirts last year to try it out . I was very skeptical of the `` no ironing '' claim . I could n't believe my eyes when I took it out of the dryer the first time -- not a wrinkle to be seen . The material is truly miraculous . We both love this product and plan to buy more . Thank you , Jos. Banks !
 I own three of these shirts and they are great . I get my shirts cleaned and pressed and here is an example of what great shirts they are
 I own two of these Traveler non-wrinkle shirts and they are absolutely the best shirts I have ever owned . They are of high quality material and the size I bought was right on the money . The colors offered are very versatile with just about anything a person would own and can be worn formally or casually . I am going to stick with buying more of these shirts .
 I bought 2 to begin with and now own seven and I ca n't see myself buying other dress shirts
 I received this shirt as a gift over Christmas . Since then I have bought two more . The fit is outstanding and I have never felt a finer material in a dress shirt - it is soft yet sturdy and always appears pressed . The iron free is for real . I hate ironing and will pay the extra 20 dollars per shirt to never have to dry clean or iron again . I will never buy another shirt and I almost want to throw away my non-iron free dress shirts . I highly recommend this shirt . You will enjoy it and probably buy more of them .
 These dress shirts are the best ! Wrinkle-Free , Breathable , Durable Material , Plus lots of styles , sizes and color options . Compare side-by-side to other dress shirts and you 'll see and feel the difference .
 I purchased a black wrap before Christmas to wear to a dinner and ended up changing my mind on the outfit ; just took it out of the plastic this morning . It 's gorgeous ! Just the right size for wrapping around you with a sweater and slacks at the office , or over jeans and a lightweight t-shirt . I bought black and came back this morning to puchase another -- I was sorry to see only two colors left . It is a bit on the thin side -LRB- I can hold it up and see a bit of light coming through it -RRB- but is buttery soft . You ca n't beat the price for 100 percent cashmere .
 Love this wrap thing . It is so versatile because it can be a shawl typoe thing or a scarf . It is a beautiful color and super soft . Love it .
 I had no idea what to buy my sister for a gift . My girlfriend picked this out . It is super super SUPER soft , and very light pink . She wears it when she walks around in the cold . Tied in the perfect knot it will probably keep someone warm -LRB- I dont know I am a guy and wouldnt wear this -RRB- , but my sister definately enjoys it . She said she likes it !
 Love the red wrap - soft and pretty and warm
 I expected them to be a bit thicker , anyhow , I like them . Pink is very pale , Red is beautiful , blue is very nice , white is just ok .
 The shawl is lovely and well worth the price . It is a beautiful deep black and thin soft texture .
 I bought this scarf for my mother-in-law for Christmas and she loves it ! It 's a lot wider than I previously thought and the material is very light-weight . She wears it both as a scarf and a shawl and has received a number of compliments on it . I would purchase it again .
 This shawl is perfect for a cool summer day , & you can ' beat the price !
 I just LOVE this cashmere wrap . First of all I got a great deal -LRB- less than $ 20 -RRB- on a Friday sale . After buying one wrap on Amazon from another vendor , and a few on Ebay , I 've seen quite a few , but none of them compares to the quality of the MIR wrap . This wrap is extremely soft , and a nice weight . Not so lightweight that light shines through , but not too heavy to wear in the Spring . It is perfect for the moderate weather we have in the Southwest . I do n't feel silly taking it with me to wear indoors . I always get cold , and this wrap is a lovely and stylish way to stay warm . My only criticism is that it seems to shed a bit of black lint while wearing . Hopefully after washing , this will stop . I love . I love . I love it !!!
 ... not as good as I thought it would be , but I was n't exactly dissapointed either . It has a very nice pink , much like the picture shown . It is soft and decorative . It IS still made in China ... I 'm sorry , I just get paranoid about safety/materials when something is made in China after watching the news about different things happening there.Overall , I would recommend it if it 's priced somewhere around $ 9.99 , not $ 16.99 . It would be a wonderful gift for someone who does n't mind made in China items .
 It was just what walked seeking , the color is beautiful , him flavor a lot to my mother-in-law .
 Absolutely a fine purchase . I really like this vest -- the fit , the breathability , the warmth . Excellent quality . I recommend it highly .
 My wife wanted one for Traveling , got it , Love 's it , She is very Happy and i am very Happy . Thanks
 We are very pleased with the Vest that we purchased and are looking forward to giving it to my Father in Law for the holiday . I am sure he will be happy . Sizing looks accurate as does fabric and style . It will be a great gift for him

 As it usually happens , Columbia makes the best and tis vest is not an exception . comfortable , nice and well made .
 All I wanted was a basic vest for cool summer days . Does the job perfectly . Will not stop the wind or keep you very warm - but if you are a guy needing pockets for your wallet - this works well .
 I have wide shoulders -LRB- 50 Regular suit jacket -RRB- , and the XL fit me perfect . I was especially pleased with the collar - which was shorter when popped than the previous Columbia vest I had owned . My previous fleece vest from Columbia lasted me about 2 years , so I have high hopes for this one as well . Very soft , great fit , extremely comfortable and versatile .
 Purchased this vest as a team vest for our local biathlon team . The fit was slightly large , but that is good for winter wear . The length was just below belt line . This is ideal for keeping the lower back warm while skiing and also shooting . Everyone that got a vest on our team was very pleased with the fit and the look . Great for training and looks good too !
 Dumb me , I ordered the wrong size . No problem with this purchase . It was easy to return and reorder the correct size . Credit came through for this purchase with days of me shipping wrong size back . This firm is `` On he Ball '' when it comes to handling a situation like this .
 While I do n't get too excited by clothing , and this is no exception , I do find this is a well made , comfortably warm vest , that I am glad I purchased .
 I wear this as an insulating layering or by itself over a shirt . It looks much better than my Columbia fleece which does n't have much shape . I like that it is super light and moderately warm .
 Bought this for my son in college after he asked for a black fleece vest for his birthday ... He thought it was perfect .
 Got my Columbia Cathedral Vest yesterday . Fits great and does it 's job perfectly.Paid 36 $ for it and its worth the money . It 's also much cheaper than similar products from North Face.Great for a run !
 First off - I am very happy with this purchase as it is exactly what I expected . And for the price , it 's hard to complain.The vest fits very nicely , i got the green large . I 'm a male 5 ' 11 '' and about 190 lbs . It fits me very nicely . Sometimes these vests bunch up around the gut looking dumpy but not this one.I have washed it a few times and it seems to be holding its colour , shape and stretch . It blocks the wind nicely and is perfect for cool autumn weather/early winter when it 's not too brutal but a t-shirt just does n't cut it.The collar is one it 's best features - it folds down nicely to keep your neck warm or you can turn it up to avoid the wind . The material is very soft and feels great on your skin.As for complaints , I find that i really miss having a breast pocket and I wish the pocket zippers went up to open as opposed to down.Since neither of these features were advertised , obviously i ca n't complain about their absence - i just prefer them and will be looking for both on my next vest purchase.One thing that I will knock off a star for is the depth of the pockets . They are quite shallow causing things to fall out easily - especially if you are sitting . If you are going to make a jacket with shallow pockets i think the pocket zips should go the other way ... Just make sure you remember to close the zips ! you can fit your entire hand in if you are trying to stay warm , but there is almost no downward angle to make a good pocket for holding your keys , phone or wallet.While we 're on the topic of zippers i will say that the quality of the zips on this jacket is top-notch . it will open or close from almost any angle and i would be very surprised if they stopped working.At $ 20 it 's hard to imagine a better purchase !
 Columbia fleece vests are the best I 've ever owned -LRB- it 's the third Columbia fleece I 've purchased -RRB- . They 're warm and very durable without being too bulky , making for a good fit and a nice appearance .
 My Significant Other needed something easy to get into because of shoulder surgery ... Perfect for him ! The warmth is wonderful ; the sizing worked out great . He did n't have a vest like this , but now he 's talking about getting another one , in another color . Pricing is perfect too . Ca n't think of any negative !
 Definitely get one size smaller than what you normally wear . I almost always wear an XL and when I tried this on it was baggy and roomy and with an item like this you want it to be snugger .
 I bought this for my husband last year , for Christmas . At this point in time , no complaints at all from him . Washes well and wears well , and its light color does n't show white dog hair , which was a must for a new vest !
 Quality is good but I need Longs and they dont seem to have many longs
 I ordered several of these in different colors . The quality is great and the sizing is true . Furthermore , they have come out of the washer & dryer looking like new each and every time . If additional colors become available , I wo n't hesitate to order more .
 Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas . Beautiful red shade , and fits extremely well . He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition .
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He is very fussy and almost always finds something -LRB- even if it is really minor -RRB- wrong with anything he either buys or receives . He has worn this vest 3 times and has only had it for 6 days ! The fit was on target a large is a large . The craftsmanship above average . The price very good . This large fit nicely over a bit more belly than desired but would still fit well minus the extra pounds .
 I bought this vest for my husband for Christmas . It was perfect . He 's 6 ' 2 '' and about 220lbs and the XL fits him perfectly . He loves wearing it . It 's great for Southern winters were it does n't get too cold .
 This vest is very warm . It fits snug to your body keeping in your core body heat.The pockets are large . . perfect for someone who likes to carry a lot of things with them.The collar can be flipped up to cover more of your neck , or folded down when it 's not as cold.The fleece is very soft , and the vest overall is made well . I recommend this vest if you ` relooking to keep warm this winter . . either worn solo or as part of your winter layered clothing .
 I have been wearing this vest everyday since i got it . the color is great and the warmth is perfect . its not cold enough to wear heavy down jacket but this is just right for the cool days and nights here is S. Calif. thank you
 I ordered this one night , and had it in my hands within 3 business days - with regular shipping . It is a very good layer to add to any winter gear . It has two side zip-up pockets , and the collar zips all the way up if you need . It is super lightweight , and very warm -LRB- for a vest -RRB- . This vest does stop a tiny bit of wind , but not much . On a cool rainy day , wear this underneath a non-insulated rain jacket -LRB- shell -RRB- , and it 's perfect ! -- Very nice !
 This vest was exactly what I wanted . It has a furry texture -LRB- not all fleeces have that same texture -RRB- ; it has pockets that completely sewn into the garment -LRB- some sew it only on one edge -RRB- ; it has room in the pockets all the way to the side edge -LRB- and not just to the edge of the zipper -RRB- . The fit was good ; the sizes run large , so a L fits an XL person . I am very please and will probably purchase another .
 I bought this for my husband because he likes a fleece vest with a collar . He is very pleased and the vest looks great . The collar is big enough to really keep the wind off your neck .
 Its comfortable , warm , a little short in length but overall a really nice vest for me to wear in all types of weather . If I had to complain about one thing it would be that it is not fleece like I thought it would be so make sure you know what you 're buying . Other then that a nice product though !
 The vest fits well and is well made . If it had a zippered breast pocket it would be ideal and would get 5 stars . I would order it again .
 I had to replace a vest the job gave me because it was wearing out . I decided to order these vest in different colors . They go great with whatever I wear at the job . The quality is good for the money . I 'm known as the vest guy now .
 fits great , the blue is amazing , its warm but not too warm , I simply love this one . also got the black one and this a great product .
 I received just what I had ordered , which was the same brand I 've always worn and it was received very quickly before the expected date was even close to being up . I love my Columbia vests .
 Estoy muy contento de haber encargado &eacute;sta prenda . El color es muy suave y elegante . La prenda es muy c&oacute;moda .
 i liked this vest , , , the texture of the fabric is ideal for all season with style the thing is there is not enough pockets , , , , , , but it really serve my life style , , , , ill going to buy two more , , , i love it.i recommend this vest for all walks of life in style .
 Just the right weight to be outside in the Fall or Spring doing things . Keeps you warm without restricting mobility . Looks good and is very functional .
 I bought this as soon as the Winter cold hit NM and love it . The XL I first purchased was a bit short -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 5 &#34; -RRB- so I then bought an XLT which I put in the morning and wear till I retire at night . Excellent warmth and comfort . Excellent value for money .
 These vests are the most comfortable and great lookingAnd are very affordable and go great with any causual outfit
 My wife bought a couple of these first . I saw them and liked what I saw . Then I learned that she had bought a men 's vest , so I was pretty sure I could have one , too ! The zipper on the pockets is necessary , since the bottom of the opening is about even with the bottom of the pocket and things can fall out . I found one that fits my chest but it is loose at the waist . I will probably take a seam in a bit to correct that . The material is pleasingly soft and warm . They clean up in the washing machine.My wife 's two vests are the same size , but the waistband is larger on one than the other . They were manufactured in different countries .
 Great extra layer for the winter.Very good quality . Generous pockets.Extremely comfortable.Logo over the breast is pleasantly inconspicuous .
 Most of my winter gear is from Columbia and I 've never had any complaints about it . It 's about half the price of a comparable North Face garment and works just as well .
 Like all Columbia products , this item arrived true to fit and size . I purchased this item for my husband and he wears it all the time . It washes well and is very durable . We have had this product for two years and it still looks and feels brand new .
 I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing . It 's comfortable , soft , and keeps me warm . I also like the blue color . Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies . I 'm 6 ' 1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there 's a lot of extra fabric in the middle .
 Nice color and Im wanting to buy another vest different color . I highly reccomend to buy , columbia has great cloths .
 Bought this vest for my brother and he loves it . I really liked the color of it because its so different .
 The fit , number of zippered pockets , and quality of fabric are all in keeping with a fleece vest that might have cost $ 15 or so more .
 Got this as a present for my dad . He loved it . Ordered an xl should have gone smaller product runs big
 Fits great and what a great price -- medium weight - true to size for mens large . Priced locally at $ 65 dollars
 love columbia products , it helps keep my chest warm so I can lower the heat in the house during the daytime .
 This vest is exactly what I wanted , lightweight yet warm , does n't hinder arm and shoulder motion ; very soft comfortable material .
 I chose thie vest because of the brand and color . It is good quality and stylish . Shipping was fast . I 'm happy , happy , happy !
 Fits just right , material is a nice weight . very warm . Columbia products are always nice . ca n't go wrong with this vest .
 Vest is a nice weight , not too heavy or too lightweight . Great over a long sleeve t-shirt or henley . The charcoal color is really nice . It holds up well through repeated washings . He got this vest last year for Christmas and recently lost it but he loves it so much he asked for a replacement . So if your husband is forgetful like mine you might want to get two . : -RRB-
 One of the better purchases I 've made , in terms of satisfaction and value.The product is well-made and durable , which you come to expect from Columbia . It can be had for a good price and should last for a long time . Fits true to size , zipper works fine , and it does its job
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He finds them to be warm yet keeps his arms free at work . This Columbia vest is very nice and thick . Very nicely made and of good quality .
 Bought this for my husband , and he really liked it . The vest is generously cut and well sewn . It 's also very soft and the color is true and pleasing.Just right for those chilly nights when a long sleeved sweater would be `` too much . ''
 Ca n't beat this vest especially for the price ! I have purchased 3 of them !
 My son was very pleased with this vest . I liked the price for a name like Columbia Sportwear . I also liked how fast it was sent to me .
 The vest is comfortable and roomy , though not the very best of materials .
 This was a gift for someone . From what I saw , he was very pleased with it . The item arrived in a very timely manner .
 Purchased two of these for Christmas gifts . Was very impressed with the quality . Would definitely buy again !
 My experience with this Columbia vest made me feel it was spot on for size . The side pockets a bonus for a mid-layer piece . The vest itself let me wanting a little more . The collar is double the weight of the main body of the vest . It is a nice vest but thin for use as a mid-layer . I myself would have preferred if the body was equal to the collar in weight , but for the price I paid I 'd have to say it matches the quality . I guess I expected a little more from Columbia , as I own other products from them that always went beyond my expectations . Guess I 'll just have to be a little creative in my layering to get the best use out of this purchase . The style and color are nice , but I also got the `` bunching '' effect during active use , maybe better as a low activity use item , walking around town and such . It really comes down to what you 'll be using it for , activity level and quality of other layering items .
 Ordered the Large in Green color and was a great value . Quality was excellent as you would expect from Columbia .
 These vests are well made , stylish and fullfill their purpose exceptionally . They provide a little extra warmth at home when the thermostat is set down low to save energy . But being sleveless they do n't make you sweat . The sizes are exactly as specified . I normally wear large in shirts and jackets , and the large vest fits perfectly .
 Warm and made well and comfortable . Husband wears a large but had to order in medium size . He loves it but beware it runs large . Price was great too !
 Bought this at half the price to replace an old Columbia vest in which the zipper fell apart after a year . Wore it 5 days a week for work so I got my monies worth although I paid full price for that one .
 Columbia Men 's Cathedral Peak VestAmple sizing for stout waste . Soft , good feeling fabric with good zippers and warm comfort.Good color and value for a casual look.It can be worn most of the time for a light jacket or coat . Easy to maintain .
 Like the columbia fleece product they are soft . I got the same product from a discount store and it was cheaper even after tax . I have to rate it as 4 because of the product quality .
 This is my second Columbia vest and I really like them . I would recommend this vest to anyone . I like to wear it to work with my dress shirts and ties . Looks sharp .
 I have received this Vest , It is according the picture and it is beautiful , I like the color and I recommend to the people buy this product .
 This vest is the best value in a fleece vest that I 've found , hands down -- for quality , comfort , durability ... I travel constantly and I like the charcoal color because it shows no lint , hair etc. . I lost one of these and replaced it immediately . It 's perfect for layering in cool or cold weather ... but also for that little extra warmth I need in a refrigerated movie theater . -- When I replaced my lost vest I looked at other brands again and was reminded that this Columbia vest is the best thing out there for the money ... by far .
 Columbia gear seems to be priced much lower than other companies like Patagonia and North Face but I feel like the quality of Columbia 's clothes stands up.This vest is exceptionally warm and comfortable .
 The most important factors for me when purchasing a vest were warmth and comfort . This vest is just what I wanted in both categories . It gives me just the right amount of warmth when I go for my morning run without getting too hot once I get warmed up . It 's also comfortable and soft . The pockets have zippers so I can put my keys etc in there and do n't have to worry about them falling out . The only fault I can find is the zippers jingle a bit as I move . Overall I 'm happy with my purchase .
 I got two of these , the blue and the Cattail , which is just brown . They are nice and warm . They look good . They run a little bit big . I got an XL , and I usually wear an XL in everything . I 'm probably right in between a L and an XL . I 'm 6 ' and 240 lbs , if that helps you order yours correctly .
 My son really loves this vest . We ordered two in different colors . It looked very nice on him and he wore it every other day with jeans . A great vest !
 Bought this for my dad for Christmas . He really llikes it . Fits really well and was just as promised and described .
 Perfect fit - this was purchased for an elderly person for indoor wear . It 's not black and it 's not grey - more like graphite . It is very lightweight and keeps him cozy and warm in these cold months .
 We 've been wearing our own Columbia vests for quite some time here in Wisconsin , but it only recently occurred to me that it was just the thing for my 93-year-old dad in Florida , who 's often cold , despite fairly warm temperatures . He loves the vest 's softness and is enjoying having something more youthful and &#34; cool &#34; to wear . I 'm happy to know that it 's easily machine wash and dryable .
 I picked this up to use as a stand-alone or extra layering depending on the temperature . This vest is great - it 's like wearing a soft fleece blanket.It fits easily under all my jackets or sweatshirts . A nice bonus is the zip pockets - they 're great for my phone or warming up my hands very fast .
 What 's to review ? It is fleece , warm , I picked the color and got what I wanted . I did get a better price than I expected.Here is something review-worthy
 This is a good vest and I enjoy the heck out of mine . I actually own two in different colours , since I was given another one several years ago for my birthday . There are already a lot of reviews and opinions here so I will not be too redundant.The vest is Polartec fleece -LRB- 200 mid-weight -RRB- so it keeps the core warm and comfortable down to about 40 degrees F. Any colder and I must go to a higher tech solution . It works wet or dry , and drys pretty quickly if soaked.It 's a cozy piece of gear and I think a perfect gift item for a loved one since they will think of you in the comfort and warmth of it . I actually LIKE that short fuzzy fibres starts to clump and pill like a snuggly , familiar stuffed teddy bear after only a few washings . I often use it as a throw blanket or a pillow -LRB- esp on airline flights -RRB- . It is also very easy to maintain and as I have two , I often have one in the wash as I 'm wearing the other one.I like the roomy sizing as I use this for layering , and this is an intermediate layer . When zipped all the way up , it practically serves as it 's own Polartec scarf around the neck . Being a taller/larger human , I appreciate that this vest is available in extended sizes too.The design of the vest is simple with a stand up/fold down collar , 2 zippered side slash pockets at the waist , and the Columbia logo on the chest.Herein lies , my first minor criticism ... value . For a simple , unlined vest without any `` extras '' -LRB- like chest pocket , map pocket , interior pockets , drawstring at the bottom or the waist , throat abrasion guard , dbl access zipper , uppers shell , back hook loop , even zipper pulls with whistles , compasses and LED lights -RRB- I would expect a basic level price . If you shop around even online you should quickly get a feel for what the no frills model vs. the all the bells and whistles model are comparatively worth.The two pockets that it does have utilizes this elastized sateen material as the interior . Not only is this pocket lining not very warm , but I find that it snags uncomfortably on little dry skin flakes , hangnails , and tiny dry skin spurs on my hands . It might be just me , but it makes it unpleasant to put my hands in the pockets -LRB- for warmth -RRB- . On both of my Columbia vests , I have replaced the pocket liners with nice non-snagging flat mesh -LRB- like that found in luggage pockets -RRB- . Well the world is what you make of it , so of course I have made some heavy mods to my vests , which have made them my favourites and practically daily wear for me.Columbia makes consistently high quality products -LRB- overseas -RRB- geared toward the outdoor person , so paying a little bit extra for the brand name logo is not that painful I guess .
 This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear . Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts . When zipped , it 's just right for those 45-50 degree days -LRB- as long as you 're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store , or short walks -RRB- . It 's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs . My only disappointment is the main zipper . Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started , and it often sticks mid-zip -LRB- as if there was grit or something in it -RRB- . It always ends up working , but not always smoothly . I 'd definitely recommend the vest , and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw , but rather a production glitch , which would not likely affect other buyers .
 I have purchased Columbia products I have liked in the past . So this was not a difficult choice form me . It is sized correctly for the big guys . I ordered a xxlt and it fits just the way it should . I nice way to add a bit of extra warmth under a jacket that need a little help . Good price and a quality product that was shipped fast .
 Ca n't beat the price , but the vest is larger than I thought a large would be - should 've got a medium .
 This Columbia vest is a quality product and is equipped with a durable zipper , style and feel .
 I like Columbia garments for myself . So I bought one for My Dad for Christmas . It fits well in the XL and is nicely made.Washable too !!
 Quick service , good price and no complaints after wearing this for a month . Considering ordering another in a different color .
 Great vest for cool sunny days . Vest is a little on the thin side . It looks great and feels great . The only problem occurs is that it lets wind in and out very easily . I would recommend this to a friend , but do n't look for a whole lot of warmth from it .
 Awesome vest . Better than expected , well packed and arrived quickly ! I give it 2 thumbs up and my highest recommendation !
 A gift for my Grandson , quality and craftsmanship excellent , could not ask for a better product , or reliability . Thank you for a great fitting product , my Grandson absolutely loves it .
 I gave my husband this for Christmas and he is pleased , so I am too . Looks good , is comfortable . Have only had it less than 1 week .
 Honestly do n't know what 's all the hype about the North Face is . The good old Columbia looks great , feels comfortable and is well made . Navy color is very pleasant to the eye . I am very happy with the vest .
 My husband absolutely loved his vest I got him . We have even bought these in different colors . We would recommend this to anyone looking for a vest to wear as a casual attire or even a dressy attire .
 Wonderful vest at retail price , the Amazon has outdone itself.For $ 12 + tax , it seems like a steal to me.The material is very soft and of good craftmanship.thank you , Amazon and Columbia
 This product is a good value . Nothing spectacular , but a good deal . I use it as a good layer for skiing to provide warmth for my core without restricting shoulder and elbow movement . It more than adequately provides what I need .
 Every piece of Columbia clothing that I own is top quality and this is no different . It 's a lightweight , and yet warm vest perfect for those crisp fall days .
 Not a whole lot to say other than it 's well built , the fabric is very comfortable and strong feeling and the vest looks great . I 'd buy it again if I had the need .
 this is a very nice vest . looks good on and fabric is great . color stays true when washed as well
 Good light weight Vest.Material soft and flexible.Deep pockets . The fit was great . I wear mine in the office . I would recommend .
 This vest is similar to my Columbia Fleece jacket -- both are excellent and perform very well , especially at this price point . Fast delivery too .
 Was just what i was looking for . Brand new with tags and shipped very quickly . My husband loves it . Color looks exactly same as shown in the pic as well .
 Fleece is fleece , but this vest is surprisingly well put-together . The only thing is it missing is a third pocket -LRB- the small vertical one near the left center that most other vests have -RRB- .
 I was very satisfied with the vest . I would get a size smaller than your usual size , they run big .
 Works for what I wanted . Something to wear while walking in cooler temps , where I did n't want a full coat .
 This product was first class -LRB- not a second -RRB- and was as ordered and on time . Ca n't get any better than that .
 This vest is soft yet rugged , true to size and just right for my son for Christmas .
 It 's hard for me to find some shirt with right size sleeve and collar . But that would be a problem for a vest , :-RRB- . I do n't like the zippers on the pockets , i never put any stuff in the pockets . Overall , this is a good vest for me , I wish it a little bit warmer .
 Columbia sizes are really big so just be a little conservative in ordering for sizes . Buy is for less than 20 bucks for getting value .
 I was satified with the product my only concern is that the color was off black insteadof black .
 very nice vest . light yet warm enough and not too hot during warmer days . the run a little big , I ordered a Large and had to exchange it for a M and I run on the larger side ... in all great buy I would recommend to a friend hands down ...
 I lost a vest that I previously owned , so I was looking for one to replace it . I am very satisfied with the fit and color of the one I purchased .
 Not the first vest of this type from Columbia that I 've purchased . Exactly what I wanted , soft , light weight but provides the warmth I want . Seems easy to mantian , wears good over time , easy to fold and carry if not needed . Satisfied .
 Have several different brands . . this is the best value of all ... fits great quality stitching and best price of all seen
 Extremely pleased with this purchase . After having ordered the wrong color by mistake , i quickly ordered again . Came exactly as described and within given time . No disappointments here !
 The vest is great -- second one I 've purchased ; however , the zipper , as the vest ages , has a tendency to pull apart at the bottom . The reason is the very short insert piece . Increase the depth of the insert and this vest would rate 5 stars . I bought my first vest at Mervins and when they went out of business I never found this make of vest again until I checked Amazon.com -- a great source and great products .
 I bought this vest for a casual look around the office and not at all disappointed . The sizing is about average , the look is great , and as it is Columbia , the material is of good quality . It will keep one warm in the winter months .
 This was a Christmas gift for my husband that he actually loved . Thanks for a great buy . Will be back !
 I 've had this vest for about a month now & I really do enjoy it.I 've had similar vests in the past , but I needed something newer to wear around the office and under my winter coat when a sweater or hoody just does n't work.The vest is very soft & does n't get caught on much . I bought the dark grey hoping that it would `` hide '' my dogs hair unlike the black vest . And it does . I have a beagle , and I can barely notice when -LRB- a few/decent amount -RRB- of his white & black hairs get on it . Some fleece seems to attract dog hair & never let go - this does NOT.The only negative I have about this vest , as others noted , is that there is n't a pull string around the waist . This has n't really bothered me , but I would like to tighten it up just a little bit.I work outdoors so this is perfect for helping me layer up but allowing me something to wear that wo n't bulk up & slow down my arm movement which happens if you wear too many sweaters or hoody 's . I plan on buying another in a few months so I do n't wear this one out too much . Awesome price too . I checked a couple of stores online and no one had the same price as Amazon .
 I just want to say that is the best way to keep you warm , high quality product and very comfortable .
 I am an Earth Science teacher -LRB- geologist/nerd -RRB- . This shirt is well constructed , made in Hawaaii and washes well -LRB- cold water -RRB- . I am very pleased with the product and it arrived in a timely manner .
 When you are my size , finding the right clothing is a challenge and buying it on line a bit of a risk . I was happy when they arrived and fit perfectly . They are comfortable and well made . A great value .

 This jacket is fabulous ! I purchased one for my husband for Xmas . It 's warm , rugged , and very durable . It 's wonderfully comfortable - so nice in fact , that I went back online in January and bought one for myself :-RRB- I would definitely buy this product again !
 This bag is great for so many uses . Bringing to work with files and such , bringing on a plane with personal belongings , a picnic with a packed lunch ! It 's just the right size ! Also , importantly for me , it 's perfect for riding a bike .
 I have had this bag for a few month 's now . I try not to go anywhere without it . The medium is perfect size for books and a laptop . I also use it for an overnight bag filled with clothes , alcohol , and still room for a netbook . Timbuk2 also has some cool accessories to go along with it like a bottle opener or an external pouch that goes on that strap that can hold most electronics .
 Got a bag in June of 2007 , use it for my gym gear and commute duties . Ride a motorcycle and the bag is great . I have a wide back and back packs do n't work very well , this bag perfect . After two years of hauling stuff back and forth from work and the gym , it still looks great.Would most definitely buy another one if something happened to this one . But at this point , the bag still looks new , except for some marks on the liner .
 This is definitely a solid versatile bag . I have 2 classic messenger bags and 1 commute laptop messenger bag . The large size classic messenger bag makes a perfect beach bag ; easily fits 2 large beach towels , a tarp for shade , sun screen , extra clothes , sandals , hat , frisbee etc. . . and is has those small pockets for your cell phone , wallet , and a key string ... and its water proof -LRB- so do n't have to worry about that big wave soaking all of your stuff when your not paying attention ! -RRB- . The medium size bag is great all around city bag ; on the bus , art fairs , concerts , college books etc. . . and the cross strap is perfect when your on your bike -LRB- that 's what this bag is made for . -RRB- The medium messenger bag easily fits everything you could ever need for a day in the city with room to spare.However , if you are looking to carry a laptop I would recommend going with the commute laptop messenger bag or any other timbuk2 bag that is laptop specific . The classic messenger bag has no structure as others reviewers have mentioned , and thus its not really made to hold a lap top . The commute laptop messenger bag is the way to go if your looking to haul your laptop and business papers ... it has a very nice protective laptop sleeve and more pockets for your school or business stuff .

 My son carries so many books and his binder and other stuff back and forth to school each day . It 's February and already I 've been through a backpack , another messenger bag , and a giant binder that is supposed to hold everything . First - three ring binders are a nightmare . I 'll never do that again . Second - a messenger bag or backpack you buy when all the school supplies are for sale in July and August just are n't going to cut it any more . The messenger bag worked but it was just too big . I did n't think it could be but his stuff just never `` fit '' and just moved around in that bag and it was just a mess . -LRB- NOTE
 I used to bike to work and this bag was great for that . It held my change of clothes -LRB- I biked hard -RRB- , my work laptop , and other various things . It also held up perfectly in the rain.Now I commute to work and the bag is great for that too . I keep my gym clothes and shoes in there and all my other normal work stuff . It 's kinda like a man purse ...
 Bag is quality ... you can tell it 's made well and with quality material . I only regret that I did n't go with a smaller size for my needs
 This bag is amazing . Yes , it 's definitely on the expensive side , but totally worth it to save the money . I doubt I will need to buy another bag of this type for a many , many years , if at all . I do n't use it for bike riding . I got it more because I live in the Seattle area and bus everywhere so I needed something that 's totally waterproof , can hold EVERYTHING -LRB- I got the medium size and yeah , it holds everything . As in , all my text books , a change of clothes for work , some food for work , and maybe toiletries if I decide to stay at my boyfriends that night -RRB- , and hold up to the wear and tear of life and heavy college text books . It does all of these things perfectly . I 've been using it everyday for the past month or so and have no gripes about it what-so-ever . I am a poor college kid but saving up for this bag was well worth it .
 WOW ! This bag was large . It was actually so large that I had to send it back . I later got the medium sized bag , and so far , it 's worked well for my uses .
 Here 's the series of reactions I had when I opened the box containing my Timbuk2 : : : open box to find a ` medium ' sized Covert Timbuk2 : : I think to myself , `` WOW , this thing is massive '' : : unwrap plastic wrapping to reveal external fabric : : `` This bag is huge ! Nice `` covert '' fabric . Pretty cool . '' : : Open the Timbuk2 to see the inside of the bag . The velcro releases a loud `` belch '' and the plastic fabric crinkles : : `` Jesus , this thing is loud . So `` plasticy ! '' This is like a tarp sewn into a bag . But , look at how spacious this is , and there 's pockets for pens , my phone , and miscellaneous stuff . Pretty cool . '' : : Toss it onto my shoulder : : `` Feels like plastic too . A bit awkward on my shoulders without anything in it . '' ... I have n't had the chance to use it . The bag looks tremendously useful ; I could easily put my four cats into the bag and ride around town . Unfortunately , part of it 's usefullnes is that it 's made of 99.9 % plastic , which feels cheep .
 This is a awesome bag . It 's my second one and the size is perfect from commuting to work.Javapie3
 I got the large size at first , and once I realized that it was way too big . The material feels nice and durable . I do n't think that I 'll get any damage to this unless I do something excessive to it .
 My son is very particular about his possessions and this bag was one he requested for Christmas and he really loves it . He researchs important possessions he purchases and he undoubtly did the same in this case . Service was prompt ant this had the look and feel of a quality product .
 This bag is AWESOME ! I love it ! It is big enough to carry about 5 textbooks , or a computer with about 3 books . There are only a few slightly negative aspects -LRB- that really are n't that big of a deal , but a slight surprise nonetheless -RRB- ... the bag 's over the shoulder strap does not lengthen as far as some other messenger bags , meaning for those who like to have the bag trailing behind their ankles , I suggest another style of bag . Also , it has no padding in the inside . Absolutely none . The fabric is very durable , and that makes up for the lack of cushion . This is not a problem unless you need to use it to carry a laptop ... I just wrap my computer in a piece of fleece , which adds a little comfort and ease to my mind and computer , and it is fine
 Every feature of this bag is practical and efficient . While some bags and full of pockets and key rings and flaps that serve only to confuse , tangle and annoy , the Timbuk2 Messenger Bag was clearly designed by someone who actually USES this bag.The front flap is big enough to safely cover the contents , yet flexible enough to quickly retrieve something . The key ring is on a red cord , making it easy to find , and the cord is attached to the opening of the large zip pocket so you can keep it in or out of the pocket but always find and access your keys even when the bag is full . Pockets within pockets make for sensible organization , and there 's a great cell phone pocket and ID or security card pocket . The side of the bag with the pockets is the one that 's AWAY from your body as you wear the bag , which at first seems strange . You then realize it is far easier to get in the pockets when you can see them!I ca n't say enough about this great bag . Oh yes I can ... It looks great too !
 This review is for the medium , solid black , made in the Philippines Timbuk2 messenger bag . I have been using it for about a month now , mostly going back and forth to school.As the title states , I am left-handed . One of the great features of the Timbuk2 is its easily adjustable cam belt . If you have the money to spare , I highly , highly recommend spending the extra money and getting the lefty model if you plan on wearing this over your right shoulder . I have only seen the lefty model available directly from Timbuk2 , but it may be available elsewhere . However , if you are like me and want to save a few bucks by shopping through Amazon , the `` right-handed '' model works just fine over the right shoulder . It just means that you have to take the bag off or flip it around front to adjust the strap instead of adjusting it while it 's still on the shoulder.This is a messenger bag not only in name , but in practice . I only suggest getting it if you plan on using it on a bicycle , as this is where it excels . The cross-strap helps it stay in place even when pedaling hard or leaning over . It is pretty bare bones
 I 've only recently heard of the Timbuk2 brand , but I am quickly sold . Their messenger bags are top-quality products . Sturdy material , spacious compartments , and efficient design -LRB- e.g. the sturdy snap-on latches , secure velcro , etc -RRB- . And best of all , these messenger bags come in a wide array of sizes and design/colors . The only caveat I would give to first-time customers is to really LOOK at the dimensions -LRB- inches centimeters -RRB- of the bag before you choose a particular size . I purchased the `` extra small '' and trust me there is nothing smallish about it . It is surprisingly spacious for an item labeled as `` extra small '' . I can only imagine that the `` Small '' bag would be adequate for the majority of people . And the `` Medium '' and `` Large '' bags would be immensely roomy that you can probably store your 10-pound pet poodle there , with plenty of room to spare !
 I wanted a small , lightweight , strong , and moderately versatile bag in which to tote my thinkpad about , suitable for cycling , but not limited to that alone.just right for these requirements . do n't expect to store much more than your laptop , a kindle , and maybe a book . but hey , this bag makes you feel better looking!tlt -
 I bought this bag for a trip to Barcelona . I needed something that would carry my guide books , Spanish-English dictionary , water bottle , camera , and anything else that might come along . The bag did an excellent job . And it 's huge -- I bought the small one and I could fit my 17 inch laptop in there , with room for extra books . The bag is durable , practically indestructable , and is comfortable against your side as you carry it . When my trip is over , I will still carry this bag with me everywhere I go .
 I 've had this bag for about a year of daily use and I 'm very pleased with it . I just cleaned the inside with a damp sponge and except for a few pen-marks it looks like it is brand new.Large is very large . I recently put 16 hard-back books in it and it had room for a little more . If I were buying again , medium would be my choice .
 4 months ago I got the black and gray medium classic messenger bag.Though I gave it a 5 , its more like a 4.5 Thus far I have been very satisfied with it . It is very durable , quite spacious and looks good . I would warn against getting a larger bag , if you are planning to use this as any every day commuter item . It works really well while biking to work ; except when I have a large coat on , the chest strap is a little too short . Also , the Velcro is rather annoying when trying to open my bag quietly , the buckle latches are usually enough , to keep everything together . All together a great bag , but I got my marked down , and to me the starting price seems a little high .
 Great bag , great price since it was on sale . I was looking for a small messenger bag and had looked at the Chrome series but found that a little out of budget . The material of this bag is amazing , super heavy duty ballistic nylon and a waterproof lining that seems impervious to tears . I 'm only worried about water/snow being able to creep in through the sldes beacuse the top flap doesnt cover it most of the time , which wasnt a problem with the Chrome bags . But for the price , size and material , it does the job .
 This bag has made such a difference . It is comfortable , spacious , and organized so that I am not constantly digging around looking for things . It is great for everyday and if I get tired of carrying it , my husband does n't mind holding my `` purse '' for me . There have been a couple of instances where I was a little embarrassed by the loud velcro sound of opening my bag , but that is far outweighed by the benefits . I even got a complement on how nice it looked , but this is no fashion purse . Thanks Timbuk2 !
 I was worried this bag would be too small , but there are enough pockets for everything , one big space for lunch , books , fits a regular size folder or notebook . If I could afford it , I 'd get a few in different colors because it was hard to choose just one . The only thing I would change is to remove the Velcro from the front flap - just not a fan of the noise . Sometimes you just need to grab a mint in a quiet place .
 I Love Timbuk2 ! This is my second bag . I have the medium size which I put my laptop and my work essentials in . I recently purchased the extra small to use for day trips and to run errands . I ordered the small but had to return it as the size difference between the medium and the small where not that significant . These bags are durable and sturdy . The quality surpasses any messenger back that I have ever owned . Amazon was great ! I purchased many things through them and the delivery time is pretty accurate . I hope to buy more Timbuk2 's soon !
 The bag is O.k. . It seems to be durable and is water-proof from rain splatters . Im sure that on a bike in a rainstorm water would get in from the top corners . One thing I dont like about the bag is that it should have a zippered pocket along the back of the inside . It does have a small one in the front inside . I saw another Timbuk 2 classic messenger bag with the zip pocket on the back inside for files etc. . I would definatly of prefered that model . As far as the color goes all black is kind of plain and boring . I should of got one with some colors . I was thinking about all black being able to hide stains , which im sure after a few years of use ill be glad I got the all black . Overall the bag is good for what it is . I use it for college and it is working well . I will definatly be using it to go to the lake this summer and on my boat .
 I got this bag on sale for thirty dollars . It looks sharp , it is comfortable , it is the perfect size . I just do n't know what else I could ask for . I knew it was going to last me a looooooong time just from seeing the fabric it was made out of up close . The dudes at timbuk2 have obviously been at this for awhile and know a lot about what a good bag needs and what serious cyclists demand . Sure it might not be as hip as Chrome or other brands , but seriously , they make some slick colorways , and at prices like these it is an undeniable steal .
 I bought for my wife because she is starting grad school . The bag is made very well and has an easily adjustable strap for comfortable over the shoulder carrying . The key holder is great because , with a purse my wife would search for hours . There is a good amount of storage and many deep pockets that are not exposed to the world . Great bag .
 this bag is really nice for traveling . i used it in place of a purse . it held all of the things i bought plus all of my personal items . the only thing that i was disappointed about was that it was the xs size , and the over the shoulder strap could be a tad bit longer . when i was ordering it i was n't aware there were different sizes and could n't find anywhere that said what size this bag was , when i got it , the bag was the extra small size , which i was concerned about , but in the end it all worked out .
 I have the XS size and I love it . It fits my personal essentials , a bottle of water and a book . It 's also light enough that it does n't strain my shoulder . I can access my things easily by swinging it around vs using a backpack . I just wish it had a pocket on the back of the outside -LRB- for mail -RRB- , a big open pocket on the inside and a handle on the top . The padded strap that came along with it kept sliding around so I took it off . It worked much better for me that way . It retains it 's shape with a bottle or a book inside it unlike the bigger models .
 I was very pleased with my purchase . It was exactly what I ordered and wanted . Price was great too .
 I just took this bag out for the first time to a 2 week trip through Brazil and the bag was even better than expected . I bought the medium-sized bag and was able to fit more than I could possibly ever need out and about on the streets . The bag is well-constructed and heavy-duty and shows no use whatsoever after using it for 12 + hours everyday for 2 weeks . The weight distribution works really well and my back never tired even with carry a lot of weight in the bag . If you are looking at buying a bag , I would seriously check out each size , because the medium was even bigger than I anticipated . This bag would be great for any traveler or person on the go .
 I used this thing for the first 2 years of grad school and it was excellent . I hauled huge quantities of books and notes around all the time and the thing is like new . And it is really waterproof . When I got a new laptop this year , I ordered the laptop version and I love that too .
 This is the best investment in a bag I have ever made . It looks brand new and I have had it for almost 8 months . Its waterproof , durable , and I can fit a lot of heavy school books into it . The strap is thick and comfortable to strap around your body . I love having it on my bike rides to the grocery store , because you can fit so much into it and not have to put plastic bags on your handle bars and hope they do n't break on the way home!LOVE IT . I plan to get a smaller one for shopping and travel .
 I was a messenger in NY , NY before I joined the Army and I used a Timbuk2 purple and green bag then and loved it . Now that I 'm in the army purple and green are out of the question but this bag will due . It is the strongest easy to use multipurpose bag you will ever need . Just be careful how you pack it for maximum comfort . On the negative side the waist band is too short.Timbuk2 Classic Messenger BagTimbuk2 Strap Pad - Grip -LRB- Black -LRB- Grip -RRB- - one size -RRB-
 This bag really amazed me when I got it . It was the perfect size with a little extra room just in case . I 'm able to take it downtown when I commute and bring a textbook and change of shoes to work , as well as carry all my textbooks , notebooks , and binders to school . It is extremely versatile and I love that it 's waterproof and very durable . This bag will also be extremely useful when I 'm able to go away for the weekend . :-RRB- This was definitely the bag for me .
 This is a great bag . Lots of room . The small is bigger than I thought it would be . I also bought a medium sized Timbuk2 bag and it would be great for traveling . I like the bag so much I bought a few for friends and family . Nicely made with lots of compartments for cell phones and PDA 's .
 This bag is great . Sturdy . Stylish . I love the quality . Works great as a purse , diaper bag , or carry-all . Highly recommend it !
 This is an awesome bag . Works great for a laptop and is easy to carry .
 I 'm using this bag to hold my 15 '' MacBook Pro . It has the right amount of padding and convenient pockets . The strap , however , just hurt my shoulder and annoyed me ! No worries , I replaced it with the SKOOBA superbungee strap , and now it 's the perfect laptop bag !
 Timbuk2 bags are awesome and nearly indestructible just like the T2 . I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it . The only thing missing is a side pocket for a water bottle . But I suppose the bike messengers did n't have time for frilly extras like that . If you can take the time to visit the company 's website to custom design your own bag or check out the cool artist designed limited ones .
 I 've been using my medium timbuk2 messenger bag for the past 2 years . Frankly , I think large is way too big . Even medium is a bit much for my 5 ' 3 '' frame . Let me give you an idea of how much a medium bag can hold
 I got the small one.Pros1 -RRB- Heavy-Duty Construction2 -RRB- Lots of pockets inside3 -RRB- Detachable Reflectors4 -RRB- Detachable Cross StrapCons1 -RRB- The velcro can be disruptive in quiet situations2 -RRB- It might not be good for protecting things that get creased easily -LRB- e.g. loose sheets paper -RRB- , esp . when it 's relatively empty -LRB- as it has no structure -RRB- I use it every day . Looks like a good investment .
 I was tired of carrying a camera bag that screams out `` expensive equipment inside ! '' After seeing a link on the Internet of another photographer that took a Tenba messenger bag insert , and placed it inside of a Medium Timbuk2 Messenger Bag , I imitated his idea . I 've now been carrying my Timbuk2 for the past month , and am amazed by the amount of equipment I can comfortable carry inside of it . It has been through both a snowstorm and a rainstorm , and my equipment stayed dry.The quality craftsmanship of the Timbuk2 is one of the first things I noted upon receiving this bag , making it obvious why this cost a bit more than the run of the mill big box store messenger bag .
 As a grad student in computer science , I take my computer with me * everywhere * . I need bags that can take a light beating every day for a long time . When my old computer bag developed a large tear at the computer pocket , I wanted something that would be large enough for me to carry my computer , its accessories , a textbook , a notebook , and my digital camera , which is an oversized point-and-shoot that 's just a little too large to fit comfortably into any bag . Needless to say I also wanted something that would n't rip open or have the clip for the shoulder strap snap and drop my computer onto the sidewalk , both unpleasant experiences I 've had with other bags.I was a little wary of carrying the laptop in a sleeve that could rattle around inside a larger bag , but many of my friends do it that way and seem to have no problems . One of them introduced me to Timbuk2 's products , and after a lot of research and agonizing I ordered the Classic Messenger Bag and Timbuk2 ` sTimbuk2 Wiki Laptop Sleeve.The CMB is great , though it is basically `` just a bag '' with a few auxiliary pockets . The medium size -- which looks big and is actually a little bigger -- holds everything I need , with just a little room to spare , and if I ever want to carry other stuff -LRB- groceries , camping supplies -RRB- I can just take the computer out and have a pretty humongous bag . It 's comfortable , the lining is waterproof , the strap has a nifty quick-release length adjustment , and it feels very , very secure . My girlfriend admired mine so much that she asked her family for one , and I got my brother one as a Christmas gift , as he frequently bikes to work.Some caveats , all of which I consider minor points a buyer might want to be aware of , rather than real issues I have with the product : - It took me a couple days of fiddling with the length of the main strap and how the bag sat on my back before it was really comfortable . I could tell when I first put it on that it was well-built and would be comfortable ; I just had to spend some time and find the sweet spot . - The top does n't really close ; it 's just the main flap of the bag flipped across the opening . Things seem to sit so that the bag pinches shut at the top naturally , and there 's a safe margin of overhang , but I 've noticed that the main strap can pull the overhanging edge of the flap up , rather than down over the side of the bag . I 've never had an actual problem with this , and neither has the friend who showed me the bags in the first place , but it seems worth mentioning . - The cross strap -- yes , it can be a little confusing at first . However , it 's not outrageously difficult either . I got it backwards the first time I tried it , reversed it , and had no further issues . Once you 've got it it 's pretty obvious , and you do n't really need it unless you 're riding a bike or something similarly athletic . - The quick-release on the main strap seems prone to a little slippage unless you really clamp it down . I assume that 's why it has a kind of double-loop system that allows you to adjust the amount of slack strap available for extending at any given time but that 's a little tedious to work with . - There are a lot of auxiliary pockets inside and a couple outside . They 're all useful sizes and pretty much perfectly hold all my stuff , but the interior pockets are built of some much lighter material than the rest of the bag , and it seems to stretch and sag with use . I 'd had a lot of pens in the pen pockets for a couple weeks until I noticed they were getting loose and slightly misshapen . I would n't rely on them to hold a lot of stuff , despite the apparent size . - You ca n't really carry anything on the outside of this bag without buying some accessories from Timbuk2 . This does n't bother me , as I keep phones in holsters and keys in my pocket , but if you put everything in your bag it might be a hindrance . - Word of caution
 I got my first Timbuk2 -LRB- large classic messenger -RRB- back in college , and it 's about 3 years old now . Still going strong and getting better with age i.e less stiff , more seasoned look and feel . Timbuk2 makes amazing bags in a wide range of designs , and the classic messenger is , in my opinion , the best of the lot.I own a large sized classic messenger , and it carries everything I need to bring around -LRB- lots of junk -RRB- and more . The only thing that you have to be careful is not to be too happy tossing stuff in , only to realise that the bag is just wayyyy to heavy to lug around without causing sore shoulders/back . A strap pad is essential if you 're carrying anything larger than a medium-sized classic messenger.These bags are sturdy , practical -LRB- very well-designed pockets , slots , keyrings etc -RRB- and look good to boot . I 've also got a small classic messenger and a large cargo tote that I bought for my mom who complained about her other bags not having enough compartments -LRB- typical women 's purses -RRB- or being too small to hold all her stuff in an organized way.While Crumpler bags are also an alternative in a similar price range , Timbuk2 bags seem more suited for serious messenger bag users , while Crumpler bags are more like casual , fashion accessories.All in all , I seriously recommend Timbuk2 bags for their design and durability . Go Timbuk2 ! -- > Updated to add that I 've added a limited edition purple retro messenger to the Timbuk2 family here : -RRB-
 A great bag for birders :1 . It 's very comfortable and rugged and holds just what I need without becoming a brush-navigation hindrance .2 . The strap is very wide , which I was put off by at first glance , but the result is a very comfortable carry when the bag is full . Unlike other bags I tried on , the strap on this bag is plenty long -LRB- although , I 'm 5 ' 2 '' , so what does that mean ? -RRB- .3 . I can carry a midsize camera , field guides , small notebook , snacks , and water in the main compartment . The internal pockets hold a LOT of little stuff -LRB- ipod , pens , jots , bug juice , memory sticks , first-aid junk -RRB- without cluttering the bottom of the bag . All this gear is right at my fingertips ... no more flushing birds while shucking a backpack in the brush .4 . It does n't have TIMBUKTU plastered across the front . The attractive logo is visible , but it does n't turn me into a human billboard .5 . I bought it for birding , but it quickly replaced the pack I -LRB- as a good Pacific Northwesterner -RRB- have long used as an everyday bag.It loses a star because I hate velcro and this bag comes with two enormous strips of that noisy % # @ ! . My usual trick of covering the scritchy side with felt fixed that problem . The bag is well balanced when loaded -LRB- does n't tip and spill -RRB- , so eliminating the velcro has n't reduced it 's performance.This model would NOT be an adequate size for use as a book bag . Try the next size up or stick with a pack to save your back .
 awesome bag . I love Timbuk2 . This is my 2nd bag , and I basically bought this one to have a smaller bag to use at different times when I do n't want to lug my laptop around . It 's made well and looks cool ... what more could you want .
 The Timbuk2 class messenger bag is great . Holds quite a bit for it 's size . Very useful and good quality .
 I bought this bag 11 years ago when I was in college . It has more than withstood the test of time - I still use this bag on a daily basis with only some mild wear on the inside vinyl waterproof lining that has affected its waterproof-ness -LRB- though based on what I read on the company website , this is covered as part of their lifetime warranty ! -RRB- . Pick your colors carefully because you 'll never need to buy a new bag .
 Girls - this is a great lingerie set ! The feel and fit are supurb ; the panties are almost like second skin . Very true fit . Very sexy , too . Highly recommended to please you and your partner .
 My husband cringes when I order items online because I 'm picky and usually end up sending the product back because I 'm not satisfied with it . I ordered this costume for my almost 3 year old daughter and I have to say that it looks just like the picture . The skirt is very full . The hat was crushed in the plastic bag however it looks fine after shaping it . My daughter normally wears a 3T/4T . Like most children 's costumes , this one runs small . Based on other reviews , I ordered up a size -LRB- child 's size small -RRB- and it fits great . The length is just right and the bodice and shoulder straps are stretchy which allow for a perfect fit . In addition , the hat fits great . Very happy with this costume . Just be sure to order the next size up .
 Adorable costume ... perfect fit I love it.hat doesnt stay on well but its ok ... y y y y y y y y
 This costume was for our almost 3 year old daughter . Based on the other reviews I went a size up and purchased the small -LRB- 4-6 -RRB- . It fit perfectly even the hat ! She loved wearing it and the price was great too !
 My husband bought one of these shirts last year to try it out . I was very skeptical of the `` no ironing '' claim . I could n't believe my eyes when I took it out of the dryer the first time -- not a wrinkle to be seen . The material is truly miraculous . We both love this product and plan to buy more . Thank you , Jos. Banks !
 I own three of these shirts and they are great . I get my shirts cleaned and pressed and here is an example of what great shirts they are
 I own two of these Traveler non-wrinkle shirts and they are absolutely the best shirts I have ever owned . They are of high quality material and the size I bought was right on the money . The colors offered are very versatile with just about anything a person would own and can be worn formally or casually . I am going to stick with buying more of these shirts .
 I bought 2 to begin with and now own seven and I ca n't see myself buying other dress shirts
 I received this shirt as a gift over Christmas . Since then I have bought two more . The fit is outstanding and I have never felt a finer material in a dress shirt - it is soft yet sturdy and always appears pressed . The iron free is for real . I hate ironing and will pay the extra 20 dollars per shirt to never have to dry clean or iron again . I will never buy another shirt and I almost want to throw away my non-iron free dress shirts . I highly recommend this shirt . You will enjoy it and probably buy more of them .
 These dress shirts are the best ! Wrinkle-Free , Breathable , Durable Material , Plus lots of styles , sizes and color options . Compare side-by-side to other dress shirts and you 'll see and feel the difference .
 Nice looking shirt !! Held color and artwork after a wash and its not hard material + + I ordered this for my 4yr old , however its way too long . The reason for 4 stars is they really need to put sizes-i.e. what is a small child ? I will keep it though , as I like the shirt , just it will be a couple years before he can wear it -LRB- probably age 6 -RRB- . I dont feel the size around the chest matches the length of the shirt . So in my opinion , if you have a longer torso lean child its true to size . However , if your child has a little bit of baby fat in the mid-section I would order the size up.I wish they made Toddler Sizes !!!!! If they did I would have ordered a couple other shirts .
 Fast shipping and great quality ! The shirt has a very nice design to it and my girlfriend likes it very much ! She wears it almost every day !
 The child 's X-large fit my son great ! He usually wears a 12H and this shirt is the perfect fit . Very vibrant design !
 In college I had a buddy who was partial to `` our ladies of girth '' . Now , this friend , lets call him `` Roy '' always used to tell me that his nickname for these said ladies was , `` Screaming Eagles . '' I never really delved into the etymology of the phrase , but I had a feeling it was moist , love-handled and ready to leverage.I recently purchased this shirt for my `` Roy '' . He was delighted . Now , along with his chivalrous attitude for his heavy nights he could be attaired in style.Truly , when you purchase this shirt and hit the night for a prowling adventure into the deep esteemless night . Just before you reach into the caverns of heavey bliss thank `` Roy '' for being a trailblazer.Remember , rock infinitely .
 I own about seven of these!Great all weather hats , very cool in the summer , and I like the fact that they can be washed on a gentle cycle .
 I ride my bike to work . some mornings I 'm riding before the sun comes up for about an hour . This balaclava is the best . It keeps my ears and nose warm and comfortable , and does not restrict my breathing . Additionally it is lightweight and easy to get my helmet on over.My only critique is that the velcro is difficult to open and close with one hand -LRB- as you have to do from time to time on a bicycle . And the color faded after washing .
 I work outside on the midnight shift and keeping warm in the icy winter wind is always a challenge . This balaclava is a major help in meeting that challenge . I wear it under my hat and manage to keep my head and face warm no matter how cold it is or how hard the wind is blowing .
 The hat is an authentic Reebok product . It is exactly what they said it would be . The price is good , but you may be able to find it cheaper if you are willing to shop around town . The shipping was fast and reasonable .
 The shorts is good . I used it for working out and to play tennis . Keeps you dry for and cool .
 I absolutely love these shorts ! The fit is perfect , the material is light and airy . Excellent for a casual runner , playing tennis -LRB- deep pockets -RRB- and even basketball . Wear these shorts and most other shorts will feel heavy and uncomfortable and you 'll only want these.Adidas should sell these shorts forever .
 I needed some shorts for tennis , and these work great . They are just the right length , do not interfere with my movements , have deep pockets for tennis balls and they were way less expensive than dedicated adidas tennis shorts .
 These shorts are mostly used for tennis . They 're really light , comfortable , and very cheap for the product . Definitely a good buy .
 I bought these for my husband . He loved them . He told me to buy him two more pairs same color because he liked them so much . He likes to do 4-5 miles running in them 2 or 3 times a week .
 very light weight and nice for running . pockets are nice for walking around . Overall very pleased .
 Great Quality Product ! Authentic and Great Colors ! Shirt was larger than expected though . I ordered a Large and it was unnecessarily wide . I wish I would have knew or I would have ordered a Medium . So you might want to try a size smaller than you usually buy unless you are a wide person or have worn Puma Brand Shirts before . But it 's definitely a nice shirt !
 Great service and was quick arriving to our APO address . The shirt is great just the colors are reverse of what we thought we bought !
 Decent Halloween costume - if you have a belly -LRB- unlike me -RRB- you should probably upsize as it fits very tight . The color of the actual items is much better than in the photo which looks faded . The only problem I had were some loose threads that appeared on the outer side of one of the seems . I was able to trim the threads and got lots of compliments on Halloween . Good value costume ! I will wear it again .
 '' Geordi give me a full inspection through trial and error of that uniform . '' `` Well Captain , It holds up great not too tight , but of course I ordered an size larger to eliminate such an probelm . '' The color is more darker and is accurate to starfleet uniform regulations . `` Is there any flaw to this uniform ? '' `` minor sir , the collar seems to have no colored pipeing around it and my visor picks up loose threads now and then . '' The main consird on my personel behalf is the pips that come with it are not pips at all , but some kind of paper which needs to be Iron on . '' `` Well what do you think Number One ? '' `` It sounds good for somthing you would wear at an party or to play around in , but if your really into the code of starfleet then I perfer else wear . ''
 I own about seven of these!Great all weather hats , very cool in the summer , and I like the fact that they can be washed on a gentle cycle .
 I bought this tie tack as a gift for my husband and I am very pleased with it ! The colors are much more vibrant than they are in the picture and the acrylic coating protects the tie tack as well as giving it a nice shine . I am sure that my husband will get many positive compliments when he wears it !
 Nice tie tack . Quite different from what I could find in local stores . Would purchase something like this in future .

 All I can say is this thing is HUGE . I 'm 6 ' 3 '' 210lbs . & I can easily stretch out under this to watch some TV.The blanket is very heavy & the stitching will last forever . Also the picture does n't do it justice , the logo is NOT just screened on , it 's actually sewn on just like the numbers on the game jerseys . I ca n't recommend this enough ... Go Blue .
 This was a huge hit in our house for Christmas . The blanket is 100 % polyester , which I was expecting more a traditional sweatshirt material . It is still very soft and large and warm . The `` M '' on the blanket is large and yellow , sewn on to the blanket out of the same type of material jerseys are made from.Overall a great product that we are quite happy with .
 I bought this as a gift for my sister . It came quickly and I had no issues . I thought the applique for the team logo was a little stiff for my taste but , she didnt seem to mind and it might soften up upon washing . I am happy with the purchase .
 Receiver of the gift said it was a great blanket , very cozy and very well made . I thought the price was great too !
 This blanket is extra big and extremely comfortable . The previous review that states the product contains lead , is either looking at the wrong product or is simply trying to prevent people from buying this one . It is 100 % polyester and feels great . Am looking at getting several more for Christmas gifts .
 Blanket was thick and just as described . Bought for a fraternity auction and was a very popular bid ! Would recommend this blanket .
 I bought this blanket and a UT blanket for christmas gifts . Awesome buy and quick service !! Would highly recommend !! The blanket is soft and cozy !!
 I bought this blanket for a christmas present and it was great . It was a lot bigger than I thought and it was so soft . Great Buy !
 I ordered this blanket as a gift for a friend . I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the blanket . The G is made of Jersey material and embroidered just like a Georgia uniform . It is very soft !
 This blanket is exactly as I hoped and expected it to be . It 's well-made , of quality sweatshirt material , and is very attractive . This promises to be a very long-lasting item .
 Ordered this blanket as a gift . Have never seen one before -- so I was hoping it would be good quality . I LOVED it ! This blanket is so soft , the letter was very neat looking -- exactly what I was hoping for . Wish I had ordered one for myself .
 Bought a couple of these blankets as graduation presents and was a little worried about the quality because they 're so inexpensive . But these blankets are good looking , soft , and well-made . And at $ 19.95 , you ca n't beat the price !
 My husband is a huge Longhorn fan and also loves big fuzzy blankets while watching ... what else ? ... FOOTBALL ! This was perfect and a great surprise for him . I searched for hours and this was the best price for the most product ... it 's just like a big fuzzy sweatshirt ! Enjoy .
 I have an odd bra size and was delighted that this bra fit so well . The package came quickly and it has been the best bra I have had in years
 I have had this one for almost 3 weeks now . Very comfortable , gives very good support , hugs to body contours without that wired bra ` bite ' . Has a near no show appearance under TsCons
 I 'm the pickiest person in the world when it comes to bras . Comfort is a must and I never care what they look like . The is the most comfortable bra I 've ever come across . Sadly the stores in my local area have quit carrying it and I hope that does n't mean they quit making it . I 've searched years for this kind of bra , I 'd hate to start over .
 I love the jeans . They were just as described and was a perfect fit . The price was excellent ! Thanks !
 Nice glasses ! Quick shipping -LRB- std -RRB- . Sunglasses may fog up time totime -LRB- they are antifog -RRB- .
 I own the Austin Reed dartmouth blazer in every color in which they make it -- it is a staple of my business wardrobe . Well made , quality fabric , nicely tailored , classic lines , appropriate for a professional woman . -LRB- something that can be hard to find at times -RRB- It should be noted , however , that the periwinkle and raspberry colors are lovely , but the fabric and buttons are slightly different than the `` classic '' colors -LRB- lighter -RRB- and the linings and interfacings are not as substantial as the brown , navy , camel , red and ivory . It 's still a good value , particularly as these are colors appropriate to warmer seasons and climates , but I was a bit surprised .
 Here 's the series of reactions I had when I opened the box containing my Timbuk2 : : : open box to find a ` medium ' sized Covert Timbuk2 : : I think to myself , `` WOW , this thing is massive '' : : unwrap plastic wrapping to reveal external fabric : : `` This bag is huge ! Nice `` covert '' fabric . Pretty cool . '' : : Open the Timbuk2 to see the inside of the bag . The velcro releases a loud `` belch '' and the plastic fabric crinkles : : `` Jesus , this thing is loud . So `` plasticy ! '' This is like a tarp sewn into a bag . But , look at how spacious this is , and there 's pockets for pens , my phone , and miscellaneous stuff . Pretty cool . '' : : Toss it onto my shoulder : : `` Feels like plastic too . A bit awkward on my shoulders without anything in it . '' ... I have n't had the chance to use it . The bag looks tremendously useful ; I could easily put my four cats into the bag and ride around town . Unfortunately , part of it 's usefullnes is that it 's made of 99.9 % plastic , which feels cheep .
 This is a awesome bag . It 's my second one and the size is perfect from commuting to work.Javapie3
 I got the large size at first , and once I realized that it was way too big . The material feels nice and durable . I do n't think that I 'll get any damage to this unless I do something excessive to it .
 My son is very particular about his possessions and this bag was one he requested for Christmas and he really loves it . He researchs important possessions he purchases and he undoubtly did the same in this case . Service was prompt ant this had the look and feel of a quality product .
 This bag is AWESOME ! I love it ! It is big enough to carry about 5 textbooks , or a computer with about 3 books . There are only a few slightly negative aspects -LRB- that really are n't that big of a deal , but a slight surprise nonetheless -RRB- ... the bag 's over the shoulder strap does not lengthen as far as some other messenger bags , meaning for those who like to have the bag trailing behind their ankles , I suggest another style of bag . Also , it has no padding in the inside . Absolutely none . The fabric is very durable , and that makes up for the lack of cushion . This is not a problem unless you need to use it to carry a laptop ... I just wrap my computer in a piece of fleece , which adds a little comfort and ease to my mind and computer , and it is fine
 Every feature of this bag is practical and efficient . While some bags and full of pockets and key rings and flaps that serve only to confuse , tangle and annoy , the Timbuk2 Messenger Bag was clearly designed by someone who actually USES this bag.The front flap is big enough to safely cover the contents , yet flexible enough to quickly retrieve something . The key ring is on a red cord , making it easy to find , and the cord is attached to the opening of the large zip pocket so you can keep it in or out of the pocket but always find and access your keys even when the bag is full . Pockets within pockets make for sensible organization , and there 's a great cell phone pocket and ID or security card pocket . The side of the bag with the pockets is the one that 's AWAY from your body as you wear the bag , which at first seems strange . You then realize it is far easier to get in the pockets when you can see them!I ca n't say enough about this great bag . Oh yes I can ... It looks great too !
 This review is for the medium , solid black , made in the Philippines Timbuk2 messenger bag . I have been using it for about a month now , mostly going back and forth to school.As the title states , I am left-handed . One of the great features of the Timbuk2 is its easily adjustable cam belt . If you have the money to spare , I highly , highly recommend spending the extra money and getting the lefty model if you plan on wearing this over your right shoulder . I have only seen the lefty model available directly from Timbuk2 , but it may be available elsewhere . However , if you are like me and want to save a few bucks by shopping through Amazon , the `` right-handed '' model works just fine over the right shoulder . It just means that you have to take the bag off or flip it around front to adjust the strap instead of adjusting it while it 's still on the shoulder.This is a messenger bag not only in name , but in practice . I only suggest getting it if you plan on using it on a bicycle , as this is where it excels . The cross-strap helps it stay in place even when pedaling hard or leaning over . It is pretty bare bones
 I 've only recently heard of the Timbuk2 brand , but I am quickly sold . Their messenger bags are top-quality products . Sturdy material , spacious compartments , and efficient design -LRB- e.g. the sturdy snap-on latches , secure velcro , etc -RRB- . And best of all , these messenger bags come in a wide array of sizes and design/colors . The only caveat I would give to first-time customers is to really LOOK at the dimensions -LRB- inches centimeters -RRB- of the bag before you choose a particular size . I purchased the `` extra small '' and trust me there is nothing smallish about it . It is surprisingly spacious for an item labeled as `` extra small '' . I can only imagine that the `` Small '' bag would be adequate for the majority of people . And the `` Medium '' and `` Large '' bags would be immensely roomy that you can probably store your 10-pound pet poodle there , with plenty of room to spare !
 I wanted a small , lightweight , strong , and moderately versatile bag in which to tote my thinkpad about , suitable for cycling , but not limited to that alone.just right for these requirements . do n't expect to store much more than your laptop , a kindle , and maybe a book . but hey , this bag makes you feel better looking!tlt -
 I bought this bag for a trip to Barcelona . I needed something that would carry my guide books , Spanish-English dictionary , water bottle , camera , and anything else that might come along . The bag did an excellent job . And it 's huge -- I bought the small one and I could fit my 17 inch laptop in there , with room for extra books . The bag is durable , practically indestructable , and is comfortable against your side as you carry it . When my trip is over , I will still carry this bag with me everywhere I go .
 I 've had this bag for about a year of daily use and I 'm very pleased with it . I just cleaned the inside with a damp sponge and except for a few pen-marks it looks like it is brand new.Large is very large . I recently put 16 hard-back books in it and it had room for a little more . If I were buying again , medium would be my choice .
 4 months ago I got the black and gray medium classic messenger bag.Though I gave it a 5 , its more like a 4.5 Thus far I have been very satisfied with it . It is very durable , quite spacious and looks good . I would warn against getting a larger bag , if you are planning to use this as any every day commuter item . It works really well while biking to work ; except when I have a large coat on , the chest strap is a little too short . Also , the Velcro is rather annoying when trying to open my bag quietly , the buckle latches are usually enough , to keep everything together . All together a great bag , but I got my marked down , and to me the starting price seems a little high .
 Great bag , great price since it was on sale . I was looking for a small messenger bag and had looked at the Chrome series but found that a little out of budget . The material of this bag is amazing , super heavy duty ballistic nylon and a waterproof lining that seems impervious to tears . I 'm only worried about water/snow being able to creep in through the sldes beacuse the top flap doesnt cover it most of the time , which wasnt a problem with the Chrome bags . But for the price , size and material , it does the job .
 This bag is great for so many uses . Bringing to work with files and such , bringing on a plane with personal belongings , a picnic with a packed lunch ! It 's just the right size ! Also , importantly for me , it 's perfect for riding a bike .
 I have had this bag for a few month 's now . I try not to go anywhere without it . The medium is perfect size for books and a laptop . I also use it for an overnight bag filled with clothes , alcohol , and still room for a netbook . Timbuk2 also has some cool accessories to go along with it like a bottle opener or an external pouch that goes on that strap that can hold most electronics .
 Got a bag in June of 2007 , use it for my gym gear and commute duties . Ride a motorcycle and the bag is great . I have a wide back and back packs do n't work very well , this bag perfect . After two years of hauling stuff back and forth from work and the gym , it still looks great.Would most definitely buy another one if something happened to this one . But at this point , the bag still looks new , except for some marks on the liner .
 This is definitely a solid versatile bag . I have 2 classic messenger bags and 1 commute laptop messenger bag . The large size classic messenger bag makes a perfect beach bag ; easily fits 2 large beach towels , a tarp for shade , sun screen , extra clothes , sandals , hat , frisbee etc. . . and is has those small pockets for your cell phone , wallet , and a key string ... and its water proof -LRB- so do n't have to worry about that big wave soaking all of your stuff when your not paying attention ! -RRB- . The medium size bag is great all around city bag ; on the bus , art fairs , concerts , college books etc. . . and the cross strap is perfect when your on your bike -LRB- that 's what this bag is made for . -RRB- The medium messenger bag easily fits everything you could ever need for a day in the city with room to spare.However , if you are looking to carry a laptop I would recommend going with the commute laptop messenger bag or any other timbuk2 bag that is laptop specific . The classic messenger bag has no structure as others reviewers have mentioned , and thus its not really made to hold a lap top . The commute laptop messenger bag is the way to go if your looking to haul your laptop and business papers ... it has a very nice protective laptop sleeve and more pockets for your school or business stuff .

 My son carries so many books and his binder and other stuff back and forth to school each day . It 's February and already I 've been through a backpack , another messenger bag , and a giant binder that is supposed to hold everything . First - three ring binders are a nightmare . I 'll never do that again . Second - a messenger bag or backpack you buy when all the school supplies are for sale in July and August just are n't going to cut it any more . The messenger bag worked but it was just too big . I did n't think it could be but his stuff just never `` fit '' and just moved around in that bag and it was just a mess . -LRB- NOTE
 I used to bike to work and this bag was great for that . It held my change of clothes -LRB- I biked hard -RRB- , my work laptop , and other various things . It also held up perfectly in the rain.Now I commute to work and the bag is great for that too . I keep my gym clothes and shoes in there and all my other normal work stuff . It 's kinda like a man purse ...
 Bag is quality ... you can tell it 's made well and with quality material . I only regret that I did n't go with a smaller size for my needs
 This bag is amazing . Yes , it 's definitely on the expensive side , but totally worth it to save the money . I doubt I will need to buy another bag of this type for a many , many years , if at all . I do n't use it for bike riding . I got it more because I live in the Seattle area and bus everywhere so I needed something that 's totally waterproof , can hold EVERYTHING -LRB- I got the medium size and yeah , it holds everything . As in , all my text books , a change of clothes for work , some food for work , and maybe toiletries if I decide to stay at my boyfriends that night -RRB- , and hold up to the wear and tear of life and heavy college text books . It does all of these things perfectly . I 've been using it everyday for the past month or so and have no gripes about it what-so-ever . I am a poor college kid but saving up for this bag was well worth it .
 WOW ! This bag was large . It was actually so large that I had to send it back . I later got the medium sized bag , and so far , it 's worked well for my uses .
 I used this thing for the first 2 years of grad school and it was excellent . I hauled huge quantities of books and notes around all the time and the thing is like new . And it is really waterproof . When I got a new laptop this year , I ordered the laptop version and I love that too .
 This is the best investment in a bag I have ever made . It looks brand new and I have had it for almost 8 months . Its waterproof , durable , and I can fit a lot of heavy school books into it . The strap is thick and comfortable to strap around your body . I love having it on my bike rides to the grocery store , because you can fit so much into it and not have to put plastic bags on your handle bars and hope they do n't break on the way home!LOVE IT . I plan to get a smaller one for shopping and travel .
 I was a messenger in NY , NY before I joined the Army and I used a Timbuk2 purple and green bag then and loved it . Now that I 'm in the army purple and green are out of the question but this bag will due . It is the strongest easy to use multipurpose bag you will ever need . Just be careful how you pack it for maximum comfort . On the negative side the waist band is too short.Timbuk2 Classic Messenger BagTimbuk2 Strap Pad - Grip -LRB- Black -LRB- Grip -RRB- - one size -RRB-
 This bag really amazed me when I got it . It was the perfect size with a little extra room just in case . I 'm able to take it downtown when I commute and bring a textbook and change of shoes to work , as well as carry all my textbooks , notebooks , and binders to school . It is extremely versatile and I love that it 's waterproof and very durable . This bag will also be extremely useful when I 'm able to go away for the weekend . :-RRB- This was definitely the bag for me .
 This is a great bag . Lots of room . The small is bigger than I thought it would be . I also bought a medium sized Timbuk2 bag and it would be great for traveling . I like the bag so much I bought a few for friends and family . Nicely made with lots of compartments for cell phones and PDA 's .
 This bag is great . Sturdy . Stylish . I love the quality . Works great as a purse , diaper bag , or carry-all . Highly recommend it !
 This is an awesome bag . Works great for a laptop and is easy to carry .
 I 'm using this bag to hold my 15 '' MacBook Pro . It has the right amount of padding and convenient pockets . The strap , however , just hurt my shoulder and annoyed me ! No worries , I replaced it with the SKOOBA superbungee strap , and now it 's the perfect laptop bag !
 Timbuk2 bags are awesome and nearly indestructible just like the T2 . I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it . The only thing missing is a side pocket for a water bottle . But I suppose the bike messengers did n't have time for frilly extras like that . If you can take the time to visit the company 's website to custom design your own bag or check out the cool artist designed limited ones .
 I 've been using my medium timbuk2 messenger bag for the past 2 years . Frankly , I think large is way too big . Even medium is a bit much for my 5 ' 3 '' frame . Let me give you an idea of how much a medium bag can hold
 I got the small one.Pros1 -RRB- Heavy-Duty Construction2 -RRB- Lots of pockets inside3 -RRB- Detachable Reflectors4 -RRB- Detachable Cross StrapCons1 -RRB- The velcro can be disruptive in quiet situations2 -RRB- It might not be good for protecting things that get creased easily -LRB- e.g. loose sheets paper -RRB- , esp . when it 's relatively empty -LRB- as it has no structure -RRB- I use it every day . Looks like a good investment .
 I was tired of carrying a camera bag that screams out `` expensive equipment inside ! '' After seeing a link on the Internet of another photographer that took a Tenba messenger bag insert , and placed it inside of a Medium Timbuk2 Messenger Bag , I imitated his idea . I 've now been carrying my Timbuk2 for the past month , and am amazed by the amount of equipment I can comfortable carry inside of it . It has been through both a snowstorm and a rainstorm , and my equipment stayed dry.The quality craftsmanship of the Timbuk2 is one of the first things I noted upon receiving this bag , making it obvious why this cost a bit more than the run of the mill big box store messenger bag .
 As a grad student in computer science , I take my computer with me * everywhere * . I need bags that can take a light beating every day for a long time . When my old computer bag developed a large tear at the computer pocket , I wanted something that would be large enough for me to carry my computer , its accessories , a textbook , a notebook , and my digital camera , which is an oversized point-and-shoot that 's just a little too large to fit comfortably into any bag . Needless to say I also wanted something that would n't rip open or have the clip for the shoulder strap snap and drop my computer onto the sidewalk , both unpleasant experiences I 've had with other bags.I was a little wary of carrying the laptop in a sleeve that could rattle around inside a larger bag , but many of my friends do it that way and seem to have no problems . One of them introduced me to Timbuk2 's products , and after a lot of research and agonizing I ordered the Classic Messenger Bag and Timbuk2 ` sTimbuk2 Wiki Laptop Sleeve.The CMB is great , though it is basically `` just a bag '' with a few auxiliary pockets . The medium size -- which looks big and is actually a little bigger -- holds everything I need , with just a little room to spare , and if I ever want to carry other stuff -LRB- groceries , camping supplies -RRB- I can just take the computer out and have a pretty humongous bag . It 's comfortable , the lining is waterproof , the strap has a nifty quick-release length adjustment , and it feels very , very secure . My girlfriend admired mine so much that she asked her family for one , and I got my brother one as a Christmas gift , as he frequently bikes to work.Some caveats , all of which I consider minor points a buyer might want to be aware of , rather than real issues I have with the product : - It took me a couple days of fiddling with the length of the main strap and how the bag sat on my back before it was really comfortable . I could tell when I first put it on that it was well-built and would be comfortable ; I just had to spend some time and find the sweet spot . - The top does n't really close ; it 's just the main flap of the bag flipped across the opening . Things seem to sit so that the bag pinches shut at the top naturally , and there 's a safe margin of overhang , but I 've noticed that the main strap can pull the overhanging edge of the flap up , rather than down over the side of the bag . I 've never had an actual problem with this , and neither has the friend who showed me the bags in the first place , but it seems worth mentioning . - The cross strap -- yes , it can be a little confusing at first . However , it 's not outrageously difficult either . I got it backwards the first time I tried it , reversed it , and had no further issues . Once you 've got it it 's pretty obvious , and you do n't really need it unless you 're riding a bike or something similarly athletic . - The quick-release on the main strap seems prone to a little slippage unless you really clamp it down . I assume that 's why it has a kind of double-loop system that allows you to adjust the amount of slack strap available for extending at any given time but that 's a little tedious to work with . - There are a lot of auxiliary pockets inside and a couple outside . They 're all useful sizes and pretty much perfectly hold all my stuff , but the interior pockets are built of some much lighter material than the rest of the bag , and it seems to stretch and sag with use . I 'd had a lot of pens in the pen pockets for a couple weeks until I noticed they were getting loose and slightly misshapen . I would n't rely on them to hold a lot of stuff , despite the apparent size . - You ca n't really carry anything on the outside of this bag without buying some accessories from Timbuk2 . This does n't bother me , as I keep phones in holsters and keys in my pocket , but if you put everything in your bag it might be a hindrance . - Word of caution
 I got my first Timbuk2 -LRB- large classic messenger -RRB- back in college , and it 's about 3 years old now . Still going strong and getting better with age i.e less stiff , more seasoned look and feel . Timbuk2 makes amazing bags in a wide range of designs , and the classic messenger is , in my opinion , the best of the lot.I own a large sized classic messenger , and it carries everything I need to bring around -LRB- lots of junk -RRB- and more . The only thing that you have to be careful is not to be too happy tossing stuff in , only to realise that the bag is just wayyyy to heavy to lug around without causing sore shoulders/back . A strap pad is essential if you 're carrying anything larger than a medium-sized classic messenger.These bags are sturdy , practical -LRB- very well-designed pockets , slots , keyrings etc -RRB- and look good to boot . I 've also got a small classic messenger and a large cargo tote that I bought for my mom who complained about her other bags not having enough compartments -LRB- typical women 's purses -RRB- or being too small to hold all her stuff in an organized way.While Crumpler bags are also an alternative in a similar price range , Timbuk2 bags seem more suited for serious messenger bag users , while Crumpler bags are more like casual , fashion accessories.All in all , I seriously recommend Timbuk2 bags for their design and durability . Go Timbuk2 ! -- > Updated to add that I 've added a limited edition purple retro messenger to the Timbuk2 family here : -RRB-
 A great bag for birders :1 . It 's very comfortable and rugged and holds just what I need without becoming a brush-navigation hindrance .2 . The strap is very wide , which I was put off by at first glance , but the result is a very comfortable carry when the bag is full . Unlike other bags I tried on , the strap on this bag is plenty long -LRB- although , I 'm 5 ' 2 '' , so what does that mean ? -RRB- .3 . I can carry a midsize camera , field guides , small notebook , snacks , and water in the main compartment . The internal pockets hold a LOT of little stuff -LRB- ipod , pens , jots , bug juice , memory sticks , first-aid junk -RRB- without cluttering the bottom of the bag . All this gear is right at my fingertips ... no more flushing birds while shucking a backpack in the brush .4 . It does n't have TIMBUKTU plastered across the front . The attractive logo is visible , but it does n't turn me into a human billboard .5 . I bought it for birding , but it quickly replaced the pack I -LRB- as a good Pacific Northwesterner -RRB- have long used as an everyday bag.It loses a star because I hate velcro and this bag comes with two enormous strips of that noisy % # @ ! . My usual trick of covering the scritchy side with felt fixed that problem . The bag is well balanced when loaded -LRB- does n't tip and spill -RRB- , so eliminating the velcro has n't reduced it 's performance.This model would NOT be an adequate size for use as a book bag . Try the next size up or stick with a pack to save your back .
 awesome bag . I love Timbuk2 . This is my 2nd bag , and I basically bought this one to have a smaller bag to use at different times when I do n't want to lug my laptop around . It 's made well and looks cool ... what more could you want .
 The Timbuk2 class messenger bag is great . Holds quite a bit for it 's size . Very useful and good quality .
 I bought this bag 11 years ago when I was in college . It has more than withstood the test of time - I still use this bag on a daily basis with only some mild wear on the inside vinyl waterproof lining that has affected its waterproof-ness -LRB- though based on what I read on the company website , this is covered as part of their lifetime warranty ! -RRB- . Pick your colors carefully because you 'll never need to buy a new bag .
 This bag has made such a difference . It is comfortable , spacious , and organized so that I am not constantly digging around looking for things . It is great for everyday and if I get tired of carrying it , my husband does n't mind holding my `` purse '' for me . There have been a couple of instances where I was a little embarrassed by the loud velcro sound of opening my bag , but that is far outweighed by the benefits . I even got a complement on how nice it looked , but this is no fashion purse . Thanks Timbuk2 !
 I was worried this bag would be too small , but there are enough pockets for everything , one big space for lunch , books , fits a regular size folder or notebook . If I could afford it , I 'd get a few in different colors because it was hard to choose just one . The only thing I would change is to remove the Velcro from the front flap - just not a fan of the noise . Sometimes you just need to grab a mint in a quiet place .
 I Love Timbuk2 ! This is my second bag . I have the medium size which I put my laptop and my work essentials in . I recently purchased the extra small to use for day trips and to run errands . I ordered the small but had to return it as the size difference between the medium and the small where not that significant . These bags are durable and sturdy . The quality surpasses any messenger back that I have ever owned . Amazon was great ! I purchased many things through them and the delivery time is pretty accurate . I hope to buy more Timbuk2 's soon !
 The bag is O.k. . It seems to be durable and is water-proof from rain splatters . Im sure that on a bike in a rainstorm water would get in from the top corners . One thing I dont like about the bag is that it should have a zippered pocket along the back of the inside . It does have a small one in the front inside . I saw another Timbuk 2 classic messenger bag with the zip pocket on the back inside for files etc. . I would definatly of prefered that model . As far as the color goes all black is kind of plain and boring . I should of got one with some colors . I was thinking about all black being able to hide stains , which im sure after a few years of use ill be glad I got the all black . Overall the bag is good for what it is . I use it for college and it is working well . I will definatly be using it to go to the lake this summer and on my boat .
 I got this bag on sale for thirty dollars . It looks sharp , it is comfortable , it is the perfect size . I just do n't know what else I could ask for . I knew it was going to last me a looooooong time just from seeing the fabric it was made out of up close . The dudes at timbuk2 have obviously been at this for awhile and know a lot about what a good bag needs and what serious cyclists demand . Sure it might not be as hip as Chrome or other brands , but seriously , they make some slick colorways , and at prices like these it is an undeniable steal .
 I bought for my wife because she is starting grad school . The bag is made very well and has an easily adjustable strap for comfortable over the shoulder carrying . The key holder is great because , with a purse my wife would search for hours . There is a good amount of storage and many deep pockets that are not exposed to the world . Great bag .
 this bag is really nice for traveling . i used it in place of a purse . it held all of the things i bought plus all of my personal items . the only thing that i was disappointed about was that it was the xs size , and the over the shoulder strap could be a tad bit longer . when i was ordering it i was n't aware there were different sizes and could n't find anywhere that said what size this bag was , when i got it , the bag was the extra small size , which i was concerned about , but in the end it all worked out .
 I have the XS size and I love it . It fits my personal essentials , a bottle of water and a book . It 's also light enough that it does n't strain my shoulder . I can access my things easily by swinging it around vs using a backpack . I just wish it had a pocket on the back of the outside -LRB- for mail -RRB- , a big open pocket on the inside and a handle on the top . The padded strap that came along with it kept sliding around so I took it off . It worked much better for me that way . It retains it 's shape with a bottle or a book inside it unlike the bigger models .
 I was very pleased with my purchase . It was exactly what I ordered and wanted . Price was great too .
 I just took this bag out for the first time to a 2 week trip through Brazil and the bag was even better than expected . I bought the medium-sized bag and was able to fit more than I could possibly ever need out and about on the streets . The bag is well-constructed and heavy-duty and shows no use whatsoever after using it for 12 + hours everyday for 2 weeks . The weight distribution works really well and my back never tired even with carry a lot of weight in the bag . If you are looking at buying a bag , I would seriously check out each size , because the medium was even bigger than I anticipated . This bag would be great for any traveler or person on the go .
 Visiting Williamsburg VA , stopped by the Outlet Malls in Toana , looking for a computer sleeve , with handle if possible , something I could use to tote my IBM ThinkPad to meetings and such , with the AC adapter , space to park some notes and a separate pocket for CDs . Wow ! Great padding , universal size -LRB- I use a T41 , we also have bulkier A30s and these pouches fit both sizes equally well -RRB- with a handle , separate efficient AC adapter and cable pouch , and TWO CD pockets , mesh , on the outside . I have had TravelPro -LRB- too expensive , not flexible -RRB- and LowenPro -LRB- still not flexible -RRB- but this Travelon Large Screen Protector -LRB- AKA Computer Pouch -RRB- is great . Want to toss a laptop in your carry-on luggage and avoid the laptop bag entirely ? This is IT .
 I got it to play marge . it did n't look as nice as in the picture and it was really hard to make it fall nicely around my face . It weighs a lot and it is difficult to move without this wig falling off . It made me look a lot more like marge especially since I wrapped a green sheet around my body and added the kids fake necklace . but it came folded in half and it never really filled out quite as nice as i hoped . still a great purchase if you are playing marge .
 This wig worked perfectly for my Marge Simpson costume . The seller shipped it quickly and it came within 4 days of ordering it on a Saturday !! It held its shape alright too , but was n't too heavy . I have a little head so it was a little loss on me . I threw on a beanie hat underneath and it worked great . I would recommend it to anyone : -RRB-
 What I liked the most about this wig is that it fits large heads -- at least it fit mine and I was very pleased as I was going to be the one that had to wear it in our skit.So thank you very much and I hope to use it again in another skit later on that calls for BLUE HAIR .
 The blue beehive wig looked great . It stayed on my head without falling off and stayed standing up on it 's own with no need to add stuffing . It was a great addition to the costume .
 Bought this wig for Halloween costume , to be Marge simpson . This wig kept it 's shape all night long , stood straight up the entire time . i was worried it might droop after a while ... but no problems whatsoever ! It fit perfectly , and was not itchy . I would def reccomend this to anyone who needs a blue beehive wig : -RRB-
 I bought this bag to take with me on a four week vacation , it is exactly what I wanted.I usually end up taking at least four small toiletary bags with me when I go anywhere , even on short visits . Now I can have everything in one place.It is exactly as it says in the product description , it really does take full size bottles and even my family size shampoo fits into it no problem.It 's well made , and looks like it will last for years . I am very pleased .
 Very pleased when this arrived . Way exceeded expectations . Seller communication was great and item arrived quickly . I got the 2-3 and it does seem large for my 2 year old , but he just barely met the weight requirements for the size . The item is very well made and not thin .
 I ordered this costume for my daughter 's presentation . She was doing a biography of Buzz Aldrin for school and it was a hit !
 My grandson loves his Astronaut Suit . I think he has only gotten out of it to sleep but it is not far from him . It is also the only time his mom gets a chance to wash it . He just turned 4 and the size is perfect . He will be able to wear it for a while .
 this is durable ! not cheap in ANY WAY !!!!! It is made of a strong fabric , all the patches look neat , everything is sewed properly . I could not be more thrilled !
 I purchased this for my 3 year old . The material is heavy weight and not cheap at all . I 'm very pleased with the quality of the costume .
 Good product , exactly as I expected it to function . Fits well and seems to work well . My kids have worn them to the beach a few times and they have n't faded or had any problems . No shrinking or discoloration with washing . I would recommend to others .
 My son loves this shirt and I love the long sleeves . He does n't care for the `` feel '' of sunscreen and I don ; t have to put as much on him .
 My husband bought one of these shirts last year to try it out . I was very skeptical of the `` no ironing '' claim . I could n't believe my eyes when I took it out of the dryer the first time -- not a wrinkle to be seen . The material is truly miraculous . We both love this product and plan to buy more . Thank you , Jos. Banks !
 I own three of these shirts and they are great . I get my shirts cleaned and pressed and here is an example of what great shirts they are
 I own two of these Traveler non-wrinkle shirts and they are absolutely the best shirts I have ever owned . They are of high quality material and the size I bought was right on the money . The colors offered are very versatile with just about anything a person would own and can be worn formally or casually . I am going to stick with buying more of these shirts .
 I bought 2 to begin with and now own seven and I ca n't see myself buying other dress shirts
 I received this shirt as a gift over Christmas . Since then I have bought two more . The fit is outstanding and I have never felt a finer material in a dress shirt - it is soft yet sturdy and always appears pressed . The iron free is for real . I hate ironing and will pay the extra 20 dollars per shirt to never have to dry clean or iron again . I will never buy another shirt and I almost want to throw away my non-iron free dress shirts . I highly recommend this shirt . You will enjoy it and probably buy more of them .
 These dress shirts are the best ! Wrinkle-Free , Breathable , Durable Material , Plus lots of styles , sizes and color options . Compare side-by-side to other dress shirts and you 'll see and feel the difference .
 Shipping was quick and the price reasonable . There is quality in the construction however this is one of the new hats made with as little material as possible . It will fit snugly on your head with no air space between your hair and the inside top of the hat . Kind of like wearing a shower cap . It is a trend I have seen from cap manufacturers like Eagle Crest lately . While it may help reduce the cost it will also keep me from buying another .
 This was a gift for my father for Christmas . I was very happy with the baseball cap - American made and a lot sturdier than most . They did a nice job with the SAC patch as well . My dad was thrilled with it .
 I ordered this baseball cap as a Christmas gift about a week before Christmas . The day after I ordered it I received an e-mail stating that I would not receive until after Christmas . I was extremely happy when it arrived two days before Christmas . The cap was a gift for my father who used to fly in B-52 's -LRB- tail gunner -RRB- . The B-52 was part of Strategic Air Command -LRB- SAC -RRB- so he was absolutely thrilled to receive it . He wears the cap just about every day . The cap is very well made and I would not hesitate to order something else from this company . The quality of the product and the speed at which they get it to you is top notch .
 Same quality as old ones . It is gift so do not know what they will think until after Christmas . Carhartt never fails the test .

 This passport holder is everything I hoped for and it was delivered in a quick and timely manner . It is 5 stars plus .
 These sunglasses have a great design , they protect you from the sun really good , the sun doesnt come in thourgh the edges PLUS you get good looks.They are great for driving , hiking , etc. . . butthey are fragilelook at the design.i had mine for a long time , but they broke , the lenses are pressurized with the screws , they look cool , but a small amount of pressure on the lens and bang , buh bye lens .
 If you 've flown since Sept 11th , you know how many times you are asked to present your boarding pass and driver 's license . If you 've flown overseas , you add your PassPort too . This simple wallet is brilliant.What 's best about this brand is the fact that it SNAPS CLOSED . So , if you 're like me , and not too thrilled with your drivers license photo , you do n't have to walk around with it in plain sight . And the fact that this hangs comfortably around your neck means no fumbling for these documents at each security checkpoint.I can not recommend this highly enough . I 've purchased several more for friends and family . Once you 've used it , you 'll never fly without it .
 I always find myself placing my tickets and boarding passes in various pieces of carry on luggage or my purse and fumbling to find them at security and the gate.I also carry a laptop , so there is more fumbling more placing it and out of the bag.This definately helps keep things easier to manage , flip the ID open and closed , quickly take it off for screening after getting my boarding pass out , then quickly be able to slip it back on andd get the boarding pass back in a spot where I remember to put it .
 These jeans come washed so they are soft , supple and ready to wear . They are pre-shrunk so order the size you wear . I choose boot-cut jeans because I wear 12 '' - shaft western boots . Levies are the only jeans I wear because they fit well , look good , and get better with age .
 These jeans are perfect for the guy who wants to wear boots and not look like a geek or a thug . Just the right combination of loose and fitted .
 This is my first pair of Levi 517 's and I have to say I am very impressed . They sit on my natural waist -LRB- not low-rise like the 527 's -RRB- , and are fitted in the seat and thigh , and then flare out below the knee to fall on the boot . I 'm 6 ' 3 '' 190lbs and have a 36 waist and 34 inseam and it fit perfectly . Hard to find jeans these days that sit on the waist ... I 'm not a fan of the low-rise look or feel , so these jeans were a great find .
 Came to Amazon to order these jeans for my husband since no one ever has his size , 36x36 . I was pleasantly surprised because I did order two of these in different colors , Rancher Light and Rinse , both of which were the perfect colors . Perfect light colored jean and perfect dark colored jean . My husband and I are very hard to fit in jeans and tops so when something works we often get multiples , the problem however is that sometimes we buy the exact same thing in a different color and they fit totally different . Not these ! These jeans were great and the same fit ! Some people might not be able to appreciate that as much as I , but I was very grateful . It was a risk I had to take since his size is so common , but with free returns I had to take advantage . The boot leg is also very subtle but incredibly flattering . He does wear boots but of course they are n't necessary . I would say they are very true to size and great quality . They are currently his `` good jeans '' ... . that is until he `` accidentally '' wears them to go work in the garage . But when that happens , because it will , I will be back to purchase more ! By the way he is just over 6 ' 3 '' about 230-240lbs .
 i traveled 80 miles one day looking for the jeans i like with no luck , it did make for a nice bike ride though ! then i went online looking and i found what i was looking for at amozon these jeans are hard to get in my hometown!Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut JeansWhat a nice pair of rugged jeans . And I got them so FAST !! Thanks again.Roxann Hill
 Good product , on time and as shown in Amazon.But ... years ago , ordering the same # jean and the same size always brought the exact same fit and look . Lately , the same length , for instance , some times is a bit too long -LRB- can be fixed -RRB- or a bit too short -LRB- bad news -RRB- . The price to be paid for savings by manufacturing offshore . Lets see if with the crisis we return to the memorable `` MADE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ''
 What can I say ? They are Levis . Perfect fit , excellent quality , and the most impressive thing was the price . Unbelievable !
 517 's are the best fit for me -LRB- I 'm a bit older and looking for just a little more comfort -RRB- . I wear boots most of the time , and these do a great job of dropping over the boot and still maintaining a nice line on the leg . Plus , the little red tag says you are a real Texan and not one of those $ 150.00 / pair wannabe 's .
 a la medida , tabla de medidas excelente ...
 todo salio perfecto , tanto el envio como el paquete recibido , estan esplendidas , la hora de llegada fue la establecida por el vendedor
 Quality jeans , but not made in the USA.Arrived quickly and each pair were individually bagged in plastic.Good fit , for me .
 Fit well at the waist and look good . Last a lot longer than most most jeans and seem to get more and more comfortable the more you wear them .
 These are great jeans , they do tend to run a little big , both on length and waist . The color was a lot more bluer then it looks in the picture , so be weary of that it . It was too country , and I needed more rock and roll , if you know what I mean.Pros
 I was a bit concerned about this purchase . My husband likes the boot cut style and that was an excellent choice for my purchase . I have zero compliants other then I wish I 'd bought more !
 they were exactly what we were looking for . the orginal 517 , these are my hubby 's most favoritie , they also hold up better than the other styles seem to
 Will have to wash several times for them to fit . I buy this size all the time from other retailers and they are n't this big . Like the color and the style . They just run big I guess . Mainly in the length . Would buy again , just a smaller size .
 The fit is nice , the color is holding up through the wash . I am glad they have different sizes then the stores . Very hard to find 33 x 36 !
 I like the way these jeans fit.The are also comfortable.The ones I have purchased previously have been durable .
 It 's very good ! 100 % cottonThe higher rise sits comfortably at the waist.A fit you want from a brand you trustFit width & length ; !
 non common size request was delivered promply before Christmas . My son was very happy with the fit and color .
 Great product ... my dad was very pleased . He had not been able to find the 517 .
 These were a birthday gift for my son and I had them sent directly to him at college . He loved them and they fit great ! Good quality for the price . He liked the fit of the boot cut .
 These are great jeans for us gals , too , especially if you like to wear a true black color . I dress them up with a feminine camisole and heels , and have got many compliments on them .
 Exactly what my hubby wants . It 's difficult to find his size in our local stores . Very happy Amazon now has Levi 's in his size .
 I love my new bootcuts . I received them quickly , They fit perfectly . Thank you .
 I 've grown frustrated by the lack of good quality/reasonably priced jeans in the market today . At some point , the Levis brand started to suffer in terms of quality/value for the dollar . Do n't remember exactly when that happened , but I started to buy my jeans from Banana Republic . Over time , they stopped making the style I grew to rely on . This created a 7-10 stretch where I could n't seem to find a good pair of jeans . Most recently , I purchased a pair of Lucky jeans - ridiculously over priced . When those began to fail , I tried Levis again and bought these . For a third of the price of Lucky Jeans , these Levis boot-cut jeans are really nice . They have a really substantial feel/weight to them and I could n't be happier with the purchase . I was so pleased , I ended up buying a second pair .
 My husband 's body type includes slight pot belly and skinny hips and thighs . Almost impossible to find pants that fit well without being either too tight in the belly or looking baggy in the seat and thighs . He used to wear Levi 's Action Jeans which were boot cut jeans with slight stretch in fabric and a slight crease in the legs . These jeans always looked and fit great ; real snappy . Unfortunately they 're no longer available . Then went to wearing David Taylor Flexjeans from Sears which were almost as good . However , he now find that although Sears still sells jeans by this name , they are no longer the same . They are now made in China and are made from a crappy fabric and no longer fit the same . In desperation , he started looking thru available Levis products and found Levi 's 517 . Advertised as slim in seat and thighs . He did not expect much but was pleasantly surprised to find that they are indeed somewhat slim in the seat and thighs , even though the pants he bought had a waist size slightly larger than minimally necessary , thankfully allowing him to breathe . Bottom line was that he was very happy that these pants are not so tight in the waist that its hard to breathe , but still slim enough in the seat and thighs that they do n't look like old man 's jeans . Just wish they had the snappy look of the old Levi 's Action Jeans .
 I bought a pair of these in 29X34 and they are great . Fit perfect , really like the cut , lighter weight material but not too light , should hold up well . Just wish they would reduce the size of the internal tag -- I 've actually had to tuck it back into the pants a few times after putting them on !
 Finally figured out what cut and size I like , but the only place I can find them is the internet . Great pants .
 These were ordered off Amazon when I could not find them locally . I found the pants and they are describer perfectly and fit exactly as I had wanted them to . I will buy more in the future because they were perfect .
 Completamente satisfecha con el producto , exactamente igual a lo que ofrecieron . LLego en el tiempo estimado que prometieron . Ninguna queja , volveria a comprar de nuevo .
 The Levi jeans were just like I expected . The fit was perfect and received them in just a few days . Thanks !!
 The quality of the denim is lighter , so the good fit disappears by the end of the day . Otherwise , I like 'em !
 Hubby dearest was so happy to find boot cut Levi jeans at Amazon as it seems most stores have quit carrying this style of jean . He likes to wear boot cut jeans and Levi jeans are his favorite brand.No complaints about the fit or wearability either . Ordered two more pairs of jeans today as he 's a happy camper.Recommend .
 Good deal on the jeans and speedy shipping . My first pair of boot cut jeans . My girl friend really likes them on me . I got the dark blue -LRB- rinse -RRB- . Fit good and comfortable .
 Great fit for my long legs ! Hard to find jeans my size but Levi 's always comes through for me ! a
 Ordered these for my boyfriend , they run extremely small , he regularly wears a 32/34 had to send back and get a 36/34 . Other than that they 're great jeans .
 Finally a pair of Levi 's not only affordable , but a pair that is the real deal . . not seconds or blemished . . but cut perfectly . . The best I have bought in years . . Thanks . . and `` I 'll be back for more ''
 They fit just perfectly and I am very happy to not only get the bestdeal around but beat the sales tax . Good old Levi 's rigid , bootcut jeans have been my all-time favorite jeans my whole life , andI just turned 60 . Got 'em within a week , free shipping faster thanexpected , so that was cool , too . Amazon rules !
 The pants are great . I can not seem to find them in stores like Kohls or Target where I usually shop . I 'm not skinny as far as a skinny person goes but I have thinner legs than a lot of guys . These seem to be not as loose in the butt and thighs . I usually get the 505 's but they are cut a little bigger assuming tree trunk size legs . I have runners legs and these work . If you have big footballer legs , forget about it .
 Finally jeans that fit like the old Levis , these are the old quality heavy denim stuff not that wimpy pre-wash thin as paper junk denim . I would highly recommend these jeans to anyone who 's familiar with real Levis .
 Very easy shopping . I 'm familiar with the pants so it 's just a matter of price and convenience.Sitting at the desk for a few second beats driving to the store , finding out they do n't have the 517 in my size and driving back home . I 've always had trouble just finding the 517 at stores and shopping online sure makes things easier . The pants themselves are everything they 've always been , good fitting and tough.It 's nice to add the stonewash to my collection of darker denim so I do n't look the same every day.I was upprised how fast they came and that 's a big plus too .
 These jeans fit to size perfectly -LRB- for me -RRB- , are comfortable to wear , and have adequate material to reach a guy 's waist ... not hip-huggers . I 'll buy more of these ! Not a deal-breaker by any means but I would prefer them to not have the size label outside ... it seems Levi 's always does this .
 Amazon did not mentioned in the description that this pair of jeans is a Shrink-to-Fit fabric . No question on the quality . . it 's still an amazing jeans , the great Levi 's jeans , never goes out of style ... Take 31 '' waistline x 30 '' inseam if your size is 30 x 30 .
 Jeans are a little tight in the thighs for my husband . It did n't come with packing slip so I 'm hoping I can return them !
 Good quality but I wish I had done more research on the colors . Ordered rigid because of the look online however the denim itself is rigid .
 Yes , these Levi 's are everything I had hoped they would be and More . Perfect fit , and I 'm very pleased tofinally have a BLACK pair ! Amazon 's got another winner !
 My wife thinks it 's funny that I rate my jeans with numbers , but , as a former 505 's man , I now prefer the 517 's 'cause ride my horses more and were my boots more ... plus , they just , plain feel good when they 're on me ...
 Who does n't love Levis ? These are great ! My son was happy on Christmas day and so were we . Happy Holidays !
 It is great to find the exact size , color , and fit you want in a Levi 's jean , and also get it on time .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean , Medium Stonewash , 38x29They fit perfectly . Will probably order more in a couple months .
 Needed a size that few brick & mortar stores keep in stock . Amazon had style I wanted in the size that I wanted at a good price !
 These blue jeans where a great color and a perfect fit . Glad I ordered them . They were a present for my son
 Levi 's are always the best jeans around . Levi 's Boot Cut are the only kind my husband will wear . Always a good fit .
 Very high quality . Several pairs have consistent fit . Have bought and worn these 517 boot cut jeans for several years .
 My husband LOVES these jeans . They are a GREAT FIT , especially in the seat . The legs are n't too wide in the thighs and the bootcut bottom make a terrific silhouette . I like how he looks in them and he says they are REALLY COMFORTABLE . They look best in the darker color and are a good pair of `` dress jeans '' as well as versatile . We are ordering more . Ladies , get him these jeans !
 I 've worn Levi 's for over 50 years . From the days when you had to roll up the cuffs because they only had one length to super bells in the 70 's and now my favorite 517 's . They are always true to size and the workmanship is always excellent . The service at Amazon is always great too . What more can I say , I am one satisfied customer .
 These boot cut Levis have always been my favorite jeans . I had not had any in a while , so when my order arrived I immediately tried them on . I forgot how well they fit , and they are really stylish . Awesome . Will be ordering more .
 Authentic , just as described . Fast delivery . I am very satisfied with purchase . Smooth , one stop purchase . Husband will be very happy on Christmas day ! Thank you .
 I 've been wearing these for years.They do tend to fade easily so wash them inside out and use a detergent product for black fabrics .
 I bought these as a gift for a friend who has worn this style for years . Good quality , good fit , good style .
 Great jeans.Classical style.Low price.Wearing only jeans , levis always loved.Happy New Year!Amazon Forever!I love it .
 This hard to find style arrived on time . These classic jeans fit just the way they should . Going back for more colors .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Slim Fit Jean is leg looks like so long , . . but lap so tight but leg looks like so long . .
 My husband like it . . although I have to cut the length a little bit . . He said he may buy more in the future . . Hopefully they have shorter length then .
 They are Levis what more needs to be said ? Theyre the only jeans im buying from now on . They fit great and last 2-5 times longer than any other jeans ive bought .
 I use to wear the Levis low boot cut , but they discontinue to sell the color I want . After I give this one a try , I like it so much .
 If you know your size they fit . I do n't understand the reviews that say the sizes are wrong . Will buy again .
 was just what i expected ... very pleased with purchase . I like the fact that you can get 29 inseam . You can not get that in the store . No need to get them hemmed !
 Bought these jeans for my husband . They fit very well and look nice . The shipment arrived on time . I was happy with my purchase .
 I ordered these jeans an exrta size longer becaause I wanted a high cuff . Got exactally that . Perfect !!! Now I 'm looking for a white pair
 Well , they 're Levi 's . There you go . Best jeans on the market . Last forever and fit great . The black does fade to gray quicker than I would like , but that 's probably because I wear only black , all the time . So ...
 I have worn Levi jenas for the last 16years , i am relatively tall guy and seldom get my size in the store , Amazon provides me my size and then quality as well .
 Purchased two pairs of Levi 's Boot Cut Jeans for my husband , the Jeans are very hard to find in the stores . Since my husband is tall , it is hard to find 36x36 .
 These pants are very well put together and I am a big fan of Levi 's pants durability which is what prompted me to purchase these .
 I am a woman but men 's jeans fit me better . These are very comfortable . My jeans do NOT get hung up on my boots as they do with jeans that are not boot cut .
 I like this style and they are getting very hard to find . The price here was the best I found , got in a timely manner . I 'm happy with my purchase .
 Purchased these jeans for my husband . They have a nice fit and look very good on . No baggy butt like the relaxed fit jeans .
 I usually have a hard time finding good bootcut jeans with the right fit in the retail stores . If the color/wash/fabric is right , the size isnt . If the size is right , the fit is too loose at the seat and thighs . Now that my favorite pair of jeans is past its prime , I started looking for a new pair to replace it . After hunting all stores in and around my area and trying all available bootcuts in my size , I was very disappointed . That is , until I found a pair of Levi 's 517 Blue Ox in the local Macy 's store . This was the first bootcut I found in the last 3 years that fit me perfectly . Since I already had a pair of jeans that was of a very similar color , I came online and started looking for the correct color in that fit . Unfortunately , it wasnt that easy finding one online . Kohls , Dillards and others had Levi 's 517s , but they werent the same ones I saw in the store . Apart from Macys and Amazon , no other site -LRB- including Levi 's own site -RRB- had the same fit in Rancher Light color I was looking for . I could have ordered at Macys website , but my past experience with Amazon was stellar and so it my first choice . Even then I was a little skeptical if the photos were close to how the jeans looked in reality . Since amazon had a free returns on this one , I went ahead with the order . The product , as always with Amazon , came 6 days ahead of their estimated delivery date . The jeans is , in fact , very close to the pictures on the website and the fit is PERFECT !! Thanks to Levi 's for the perfect color and fit and KUDOS to amazon for the perfect shopping experience !
 Finally Levi went back to 7 belt loops instead of the five . Makes a big difference for those of us that work for a living .
 I bought the 517 as I prefer this cut to any other one of the Levi 's catalog , I place it even above the so famous 501 . I 'm fully satisfied
 I love these jeans . The wash and fit are great . That being said , they did arrive with a hole in the seat and the seam is a little crooked on the inside left leg . I really do n't care though because they fit so good .
 It is hard to find male , black , slim fit , boot cut jeans . Believe me I searched many places both on-line and local retail outlets . Finally I found these on Amazon and they were just right . Great fit , looks good , and the price was reasonable . I highly recommend them .
 We will take these to alterations but they were about 5 inches too long . Otherwise they are very nice .
 True to size , did n't shrink , and minimal wrinkling . Love the variety of sizing - son is tall and thin , and hard to fit , but Levis 517 made it happen !
 Levis 517 Boot Cut Jeans are just as advertized . Good fit and a perfect boot cut . I highly recommend them for anyone who needs boot cut jeans .
 It 's a very good pant for my husband . Nothing too special or fancy ; he is very satisfied because he got what he expected
 execelente producto muy buena calidad , el pantalon vino en un excelente empaque y llego super rapido deverdad no tengo quejas lo recomiendo
 He looks hot in them , thanks ! What more can I say ? They did n't stay on for very long ... ca n't share any more details .
 I was somewhat hesitant to order Levi 's online but I could n't be happier with this order ! The jeans are exactly as described and fit perfectly . They are genuine Levi 's and are of the highest quality - not seconds . I ca n't recommend this seller highly enough .
 They 're good sellers and the product is very good , I like so much this jean . Ellos son muy buenos vendedores , el producto llego rapido a mis manos y era el esperado , los recomiendo ampliamente .
 I wear Levi jeans every day . Levi 's are the only jeans I will wear.I have worn Levi jeans for the past twenty -LRB- 20 -RRB- years ... or longer.Levi jeans are great ... in fact , i 'm wearin 'em right now ...
 My skinny son is 54 years old and will not wear any other jeans - only 517 , boot cut Levi 's so I know what to buy for Christmas and Birthdays . I found a perfect fit for my skinny husband also .
 I ordered these jeansLevi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jeanfor a Christmas gift a short time before Christmas . I knew the size . I was somewhat concerned that I would not get them on time for Christmas The package came just before Christmas , and the jeans were exactly as pictured , nicely packaged -LRB- each pair separately enclosed in plastic bag -RRB- , the right size and color . I was very pleased , as was the recipient of the gift !
 The jeans were a Christmas gift and a style regularly worn by the recipient . They were a perfect fit . They are hard to find locally so we ordered from the Internet . The red tag on the back pocket did not say `` Levis '' and I have never seen this before . Is it significant ?
 Wow . These are great blue jeans , and they come in 38 long which is what he wears . HE wanted the boot cut , and a 34 waist was large enough . Usually he wears a 36 , , but I ordered 34 and they fit just right . Great looking , great price .
 I bought two pairs in two orders - both were perfect - exactly as I expected . On time . Good buy at a decent price .
 These jeans are tough but good looking and fit well . Amazon 's price is great , they are a good value for the money , and we always get prompt delivery and easy return if size is not right .
 the product is excellente , but needs to be taggedcorrectly , I order 34x30 tag say so , but real size was36x32 try buying them from differet source , and same thing never can get athe right size until i took a mesuring tape to the store and mesure before buing them !!
 I love those Jeans . . nice shape and denim . I ordered different colors from this pant and I love them all . it is comfortable , and have a nice leg openning that falls around the boot .
 I have been wearing 517 's for as long as I can remember . They fit perfectly and have remained unchanged for years .
 The fit and look are great and I saved a few dollars . Will purchase more when the price is right
 love this jeans , the fabric is really good and the cut is impecable . it is original and the communication was really easy , i recieved really fast .
 I 've always wanted a ` black 527 ' but found out I could only get that in rigid black.I decided to try 517 n whao I might just decide to continue with 517 even with other colors.Just the perfect fit I love .
 Is exactly what i was looking for . . i being using this model for years , and this pair of pant are excellent
 I am a creature of habit . Being of slim build I have found the 517 Boot cut to be the perfect jean for me . I also know my size so the fit was great as received . This is not always the case when ordering over the Internet . Service was great delivered on time as expected .
 These are the best jeans Levis has to offer in my opinion . They are not light and flimsy like some jeans Levis are making these days . The medium stonewash is a great even color . They do n't look faded on the seat and thighs or dingly and dirty like so many jeans do . These jeans are rugged , comfortable and last a long , long time . On top of that they look great . These are the only jeans I will buy .
 These jeans are everything they say they are . We will definately order these jeans again when the time comes . Thanks !
 100 % recomended , i have no doubt that i am going to buy another , it is really regular fit and boot cut
 This is the only jean my husband wears . He has the hardest time finding 36x29 . This is a perfect fit for him . When he needs more I will return to amazon .
 I finally found a pear of jeans that my wife said they look good on me and after being washed still fits great
 This pair of Levi 's fits perfectly and the indigo color is the same as the Levi 's I wore back in the day !
 I gave these Jeans to my daughter 's friend for Christmas and he really likes them.He is real thin and wears motorcycle boots.He likes how they fit and loves the boot cut.He especially likes the rugged material .
 My order arrived in a timely fashion , they fit good and look great ... I 'm gon na get a couple more pairs .
 Levi 's 517 ` sThese Levi 's were the perfect fit . I like the fact that they are pre rinsed , which makes the fabric softer .
 Many of us do n't want to wear our Levi 's half way up our bellies . 517s are the best answer for that !
 A well tried and true blue jean that I 've been wearing for decades . The fit , finish , and quality is a good as or better than ever .
 These seemed a bit darker in person than pictured but they were a great pair of jeans for my husband . This is his favorite style of jeans and he needed a new pair of &#34; dressy jeans . &#34; Same great jeans as in the past .
 All the Levi 's I purchased for my 16 year old son were ` made to fit ' ! From the straight to boot cut , they all were a perfect fit for his personal taste . They are well made and very stylish .
 Great jeans , great price , speedy delivery as promised ! Will definitely be ordering them again since my son is so tall and slim and this is one of the only places I can find his size .
 Great basic jeans in hard to find sizes . Not much to say otherwise . They have washed up well and held up well for my long and lanky teen .
 These jeans fit me very well and look good . One thing I noticed however is that the denim has a more coarse feeling compared to other Levi 's jeans . I would buy these again .
 IL TELL YOU I HAVE BEEN WEARING LEVI 'S FOR YEARS ON END AND THE BEST DEAL I GOT ON THESE GREAT JEANS WAS FROM MY FAVORITE STORE AMAZON
 I love these jeans . For me they are perfect . Long enough to wear with or without boots and the fit is not too tight . How can you go wrong with Levi 's ?
 I got what I ordered promptly . I wish I had ordered a different color but -- my bad . No complaints . What else can I say ?
 The jeans was just perfect , the material , size and colour , nothing to complain about , and great timing too.They fit really well , and amazon 's size chart was very helpfull .
 Style & size stayed true since the last time I bought a pair , after gettingLevi 's Men 's 527 Low Rise Boot Cut Jeanthat are nothing like they used to be that 's all a shopper can ask .
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut . Black 42 waist / 30 length . If you are short , stocky and have a big butt . These pants are perfect . They wo n't bunch up at your fat knees and they will last a long time before the zipper explodes . I suggest you buy the next size up because they will shrink after 6 months of washing , drying and severe stretching in the seat area . Great pants .
 MY FAVORITE JEANS FOR 25 YEARS . I HAVE WORN MAINLY 501 MODEL , SO I READ MANY REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING THESE 517 JEANS.AFTER THINKING FOR A LONG TIME I DECIDED TO BUY ONE SIZE BIGGER THAN USUAL . IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE.THEY ARE JUST FINE , BLACK COLOR AND ZIPPER FLY WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DETAIL FOR ME !
 I am happy with the jeans and how they fit , but usually when I get 517 's , they are really stiff and then I get to break them in . This pair was already like pre-washed , just differnt than what I am used to , but I still like them and will wear them . Maybe I have to look into differnt types and find exactly what I am looking for next time . Thank you
 I 've been wearing 517 's for a good , long time now , and I love 'em ! The problem is that most of my local stores that sell them -- and very few of them do -- price them highly and also drastically limit the selection compared to the more popular 501 's and 550 's . Additionally , these jeans are often skipped over when it comes to the big sales . Well , shopping for them on Amazon is a decision I should have made long ago . The price here is hard to beat.As for the jeans themselves , they are of the rugged quality that Levi 's is known for . They fit like the product photo shows
 Have had these jeans for a few weeks now & am very satisfied.The flair from the knee down is discrete and does not look like the 70 's bell-bottoms . The fit on top was precisely as marked . The length seems about 1/2 inch longer than sized on the 501 's . Was formerly utilizing 501 slim fit jeans but found that could not place them over motorcyle boots . The 501s were great for rainy rides , but look too much like a cowboy , when tucked into the boots .
 As always , good shopping at amazon.com . Its always a problem finding the right length jeans for me . I found that in this levi 517 Boot cut jean , it feels good to finally find a jean that is not too short . A fact that i would have loved to know before i bought this jeans , is the leg opening size . This jean is very tight around the thigh area . I would just like a bit more details on the product a next time round . Other than that , it always a good shopping experience on Amazon .
 The length and waist were perfect . The quality of Levi jeans was the same as they had always been , good
 I always had to keep pulling up my previous pairs of Levi 's -LRB- any model -RRB- because they only had FIVE belt loops . A key ring and cell phone are not that heavy . I remember growing up with Levi 's having SEVEN belt loops and a heavier canvas . I was pleasantly surprised to see the ` new ' Levi 's 517 now have seven belt loops again . I started to buy a different model , but they still only have the five loops.I just bought a couple of these pairs from Amazon . I did check online at Kohls and their current batch of 517 's still show 5 loops . I will have to wait until I go to the store to see if their stock has been updated . Kohls prices are higher than Amazon , but I will recheck when they go on sale . I still check Amazon first for almost all my purchases.Overall , I like my new Levi 's jeans . I will compare them with older ones to see if the canvas really is slightly thinner . Outsourcing manufacturing almost always results in poorer quality and non-standard sizing . It has 100 % results in putting Americans out of work . I try to buy American whenever I can -- hopefully it will catch on.There is another issue appearing after I washed my new jeans with my old ones . It should n't have made a difference , but the new ones are now covered with fine fluffy hairs . I will have to use a lint brush when I take them out of the dryer for now . Although it may just be a ` break in -- first washings ' issue.Overall , I rate these jeans 4 stars . I will have to wait for a few machine washings to see how the color holds up . I may be old fashioned , but buying jeans looking like they are 1/2 wore out or have holes in them is ` less than optimal ' .
 I ran around town to find my husband Levi 517 's in size 35x32 for Christmas . In the stores , there were stacks of all different sorts of Levi 's to go through . Finally I came home and ordered them through Amazon and received exactly what he wanted . These Levi 's fit perfectly and look great . Very happy they come in off size waists . Thank you for making my job easier and receiving nice fitting jeans .
 I 've grown up wearing Levi 's and in particular 517 's in my adult life . I do like that Levi has added additional belt loops in the past year or so . Over the years Levi has cut some corners in manufacturing , but not enough to discourage me from continuing to buy their stonewashed 517 's . I like the stonewashed jeans since they are ready to wear , unlike the rigid indigo Levi 's that have to be washed several times to soften them up.I am buying more and more items from Amazon for the free shipping and competitive prices . It just saves a lot of time going to a retailer only to find out they do n't have my size or what I want . Even with Amazon collecting California sales tax , I figure the time and gas saved from having to go to a retailer is well worth it .
 The only problem was I had was that I had to have them hemmed 2 &#34; so as not to walk on the cuff . I would have ordered them shorter but they were not offered in the waist size I needed . The waist fit perfect and having them hemmed was not that big of a deal . It coast me $ 12.00 to have them hemmed .
 I love being able to find the 517 's on line and not having to run all over town for the style and size I need .
 If you promise not to tell anybody , I wear lined jeans from eddie bauer or llbean when it gets cooler . I wear these when it gets warmer . True to size , do n't shrink too much .
 These were a secret gift for my brother-in-law . He keeps complaining that he must do laundry every other day because he only has one pair of work pants , but then he just will not go get more or let anyone buy him any ! So , I got the size off of the one pair of jeans he owns -LRB- laundry is at my house -RRB- and I bought several other pairs that were similarly worn . I sneak in a new pair about once a week and so far he has n't noticed that he now has three pair of work pants . When I slip in the new ones , I put them in the dirty clothes hamper he uses . I wonder if he knows his pants are multiplying yet ?
 They arived bfore time , APO adress , in Afghanistan ,1 week took it to arive here , im suprised , and they fit good , i dont hawe no words
 I bought 2 of these and man they are nice . I 'll admit the guy wearing the jean in the picture sold me . Like I went and look for all the style of Levi 's , and these attracted me the most . Although I would n't tuck in my shirt like that . But they sure look good with some chucks and or casual boots and a dress shirt , with a silver wrist watch , and a pair of shades . They are heavy , and for me kinda tight even though jean of a different brand and style with the same size , fit me perfectly . I do n't know I guess it the way they are made . But for the look , I 'll take the pain any day , yes these jean are so tight mostly in my thigh area and waist , that I do get a little discomfort pain in my lower back . I guess it the way they are design and the heaviness of the jean . Of course I am in the process of getting in shape again . So with time , these will be perfect . I do like to sag a little , but as of right now I ca n't with these . Until I lose some of that belly fat I accumulated over the years .
 These are the jeans I always buy , they are a great comfortable fit . It is also great that Amazon stocks the size I need , it 's impossible to get from the shops .
 My body was made for Levi 's brand jeans , and I 'd worn through a couple of pairs . I bought duplicate black 517s - soft but not washed out , dark , with a predictable fit . They are my new favorites . The process went smoothly . Who knew I 'd be buying clothes online ?
 I ordered these for Christmas for my 6 ' 2 '' grandson who had grown out of all his pants after checking stores and finding his size is almost impossible to find . They were perfect and he loved them .
 The Levi 's 517 Boot Cut were purchused as a replacement of the wrong ones bought at a local store , These ordered & delivered ; I was told fit greatly before & after ; washThe price for my buying , totaled out a nuff less even with shipping to come fromamazon , rather than a store , even on sale after my tax & shipping ; -LRB- as a late gift -RRB- Theonly guestion I got was about , they did not have the Levi 's cardboard shelf tagswe see on Jean 's in store .
 I love my levis . I was unaware they came in black . I bought a blue pair and black pair , Ilove them
 Just as described ! Fit & look exactly what he needed and wanted . And he said I could n't find this product ... LOLThanks !!! The Wife wrote the review ...
 These jeans fit great . The boot cut gives a good look without being sloppy . My husband looks hot in them .
 Got these as a gift for my brother , and they are the true blue classic with a great slim shape . Perfect `` date night '' jeans .
 These are the only jeans my husband will wear and we could not find them ANYWHERE . When i found them here i was happily suprised with the discount price and they look great . Would buy again from this seller .
 Great black on black bootcut jeans . They have even gone back to adding two additional belt loops a feature that went away several years ago .
 Fits well , my husband loves them , quality control met , consistent sizing , and look good on . Will order more as needed
 My son wears a 36 Waist x 36 lenght which is very hard to find . The Levi 's Men 's 517 are about the only jeans he likes and these fit him perfectly . They were shipped very quickly and the price was excellent . They were a birthday gift and he loves them .
 The jeans were pre washed and fit just like I wanted . They were really softer than I expected . I would buy this product again .
 I was so happy with the quality and fit ; I ordered 3 more pairs ! I will be good on jeans for awhile . The price was good too .
 Great quality and a lower price , for me is like a tailored jean , I 'm happy with this product . No more to say thanks to all
 After numerous failed attempts at the 527 's on amazon I finally got a clue and got these jeans . They are PERFECT ... great fit ... weight ... etc. ... just like the jeans I wore in high school 20 years ago ... . I 'm already thinking about a second pair . The light rancher is the perfect color ... . As for the 527 's MADE IN BANGLADESH ... amazing they could ever bear the levis name ... perhaps they were counterfeit . Thanks amazon for my true and needed exchange . The original pair of jeans I ordered ... yes the 527 ... was complete trash . These 517 's are real jeans for real cowboys ... and I 'm not one ... but I do wear a ton of boots ...
 Exellent product
 36 &#34; inseam jeans at a reasonable price are hard to find . I really like the fit of these jeans just wish there were other kinds in the same length .
 Just what I expected . After soaking and drying , the fit and feel was as anticipated ... just like the good , old days !!! -LRB- I would estimate that length and waist both shrunk by about one inch ... as Mama warned , some 50 years ago -RRB-
 i got two pairs for my husband . levis are the only thing that fit him right . They make him look like he has a butt !
 I like this product because it fits very well and is comfortable . I recommend it to others . Good for those who like to wear boots .
 Finally found levis that were the correct size , if they are still available I will order more in the future
 Great pants . I wish there was a size 33 by 35 . I always have a hard time with pants size . I can get a length 34 , which shrink after a wash or a 36 that drags because there too long . But there is no length 35 in pants , so I do n't have much of choice .
 Excellent product the product I come very well and it is what was waiting of , I come in time , good
 I bought they for my boyfriend who had lost a bit of weight and all his pants were falling down , but these fit and stay up -LRB- Thank God -RRB-
 My husband loves the fit and the price.Great deal.You can dress them up or down!Look no further.Great looking jean , for the price .
 Sent me what I wanted . 15 more 12 more 11 more 9 more 7 more 5 more 3 more done
 This is a very good price for this product , it 's the second one I 've ordered for my son .
 If you have a problem with jeans bagging in the rear , then these jeans are for you ! They are a great fit and very comfortable ! My husband loves them !
 Well , its a good jean , everybody know the levi 's quality , the item arive in perfect conditions . . so nothing more to say . .
 Perfect fit , every time . 517 's are difficult for me to find locally , but buying on line thru Amazon is best for me .
 These are like they used to make them ! More belt loops , great fabric - love them ! Ca n't wait to order more of these !
 I was having a really hard time finding the boot cut Levis - no one seems to carry them anymore . These are just what I wanted . They look and fit good .
 Bought these for my husband and they fit true to size , maybe a little bit long but not so much that he wo n't wear them . He love them , they look good so I love them ! Great Pants !
 I ordered these jeans for my 16yo son & he really liked them . The only thing he would have preferred was a lower rise , but he 's wearing them without complaints . : -RRB-

 These are the jeans I always buy , they are a great comfortable fit . It is also great that Amazon stocks the size I need , it 's impossible to get from the shops .
 My grandson loves these jeans , since he 's rather tall we were glad to find Levi 's makes great jeans in his size . Strange as it may seem , many brands of jeans do not come in a 34in length .
 As an active equestrian rider , and a woman of 59 years , I 'm ALWAYS looking for comfortable jeans that sit at my waist -- I do n't like women 's jeans at all - the fabric in women 's jeans seems flimsy , and the low-rise , hip-hugging jeans for riding or leisure wear feels uncomfortable . The men 's Levis and men 's Lee jeans are very comfortable , and they can handle my active life -- for me , men 's Levis 517 bootcut jeans have best variety for colors , and toughest quality in fabric .
 Nice one . . Boot Cut with nice fit.Ordered the Jeans with 29L but got it 3inch longer . So I had to do alteration , usually I order my pants with 29L and it fits perfect on me .
 Levis 517 's fit me better than any other jeans that I 've bought . Gon na stick with them . I wear a 38 waist , 36 inseam . Have bought several pair over the past six months from various places and they all fit the same . Good quality control !
 BASTANTE BIEN . BUENA CALIDAD DEL PANTALON . ME QUEDO MUY BIEN . TANTO EL LARGO COMO EN CINTURA . EXCELENTE COMPRA A UDS . GRACIAS .
 The jeans are a good deep color . Wish they were n't quite as thin as jean material seems to be getting , but seems they are all like that now . Overall a good pair of jeans.These are hard to find in 36x36 , so I 'm glad Amazon carries them .
 Perfect fit right out of the box . Started wearing immediately , stitches , pockets , zipper perfectly in place . Survived several washes good as new .
 Good price , perfect quality . Very good model for young and old-aged people . Gorgeous color . Classic zipper . I 'm satisfied ! I recommend to buy it .
 If you know your size they fit . I do n't understand the reviews that say the sizes are wrong . Will buy again .
 was just what i expected ... very pleased with purchase . I like the fact that you can get 29 inseam . You can not get that in the store . No need to get them hemmed !
 his pants in overall line is still very good , sturdy , feels soft to the touch on the skin , the profile legendary cutting adds a touch of elegance , and even after several washings the fabric remains the same and does not shrink , the only thing I did not like the pants is that they have deteriorated the quality of the clips and metal buttons , formerly of copper and bronze , and now this are of aluminum and does not look good , however I recommend buying them are very good at the price .
 These came a little long , maybe an inch or two . Seeing as many others have noticed this is a problem with this fit , I suggest going one inseam size lower . I ordered a 30 '' and they fit more like a 31-32 '' . Other than the sizing , they are great jeans , and still look great on me . The boot cut allows the extra length to bunch up a little around the shoes , so you do n't really notice it . It actually looks good.I wish they sold these in a low rise version , as I do n't like hiking them up to where you might put dress pants or khakis . They stopped selling the 517 in a low rise though , so I 'm happy to wear them as is , great fit .
 I have always appreciated the fit and quality of Levi jeans . The boot cut has a closer fit around the knee with comfortable room in the hips and waist . What Levi Strauss needs to understand is that there is a huge population of men out there that has a 31 inch inseam . Men between 5 ' 9 &#34; and 6 ' fall into this size range . My growth did not stop at 30 &#34; inseam , and did not make it to 32 &#34; . So I either buy high water jeans that show my socks , or I let the cuffs drag the floor which signicantly reduces the life of the jeans . I liked the fit enough that I spent an additional $ 10 to get them hemmed to 31 .
 product arrived as expected on time , the product was as expected and the quality was as you 'd expect to find in a brick & mortar store .
 Great fitting . I usually buy the 527 style but they did n't have black in that style . Ordered a 517 instead and love the fitting .
 d e m a r a v i l l a e s t e m o d e l o muy bueno
 These are the first jeans in a while that actually fit my waist size , inseam and the leg openings are perfect .
 These jeans fit well but the denim seems less hefty than the denim of the same 517s from 5 years ago .
 I received my pants very quickly . I was concerned that my size would be too short for boots . I was pleasantly surprised that the designer was thoughtful about the shape and length for this item &#34; after &#34; several washings . Pants are about 1/2 inch longer than the average pants which make them perfect for cowboy boots . Pants are also very comfortable . JCD
 Noticed that they even have an extra pair of belt loops compared to my previous order . They are sturdy & dependable .
 The jeans were great ! The price was right , they were delivered in a timely fashion , and I lost a few lbs to get in them and I look good . lol . I recommend this company .
 These are the only jeans my son likes . He is tall and I have trouble finding his size in local stores and I could not find a better price .
 The jean came very quickly . They were the proper color , size , and cut . The packaging was excellent , and so was the quality of the jeans .
 Perfect price and fit for my husband . I would recommend this jean to any &#34; baby boomer &#34; who loves boot cut jeans.The jean has not changed at all good quality material and the right color . Thank you .
 I have an odd bra size and was delighted that this bra fit so well . The package came quickly and it has been the best bra I have had in years
 I have had this one for almost 3 weeks now . Very comfortable , gives very good support , hugs to body contours without that wired bra ` bite ' . Has a near no show appearance under TsCons
 I 'm the pickiest person in the world when it comes to bras . Comfort is a must and I never care what they look like . The is the most comfortable bra I 've ever come across . Sadly the stores in my local area have quit carrying it and I hope that does n't mean they quit making it . I 've searched years for this kind of bra , I 'd hate to start over .
 I own the Austin Reed dartmouth blazer in every color in which they make it -- it is a staple of my business wardrobe . Well made , quality fabric , nicely tailored , classic lines , appropriate for a professional woman . -LRB- something that can be hard to find at times -RRB- It should be noted , however , that the periwinkle and raspberry colors are lovely , but the fabric and buttons are slightly different than the `` classic '' colors -LRB- lighter -RRB- and the linings and interfacings are not as substantial as the brown , navy , camel , red and ivory . It 's still a good value , particularly as these are colors appropriate to warmer seasons and climates , but I was a bit surprised .
 These T shirts are the best around , I 'm serious , they are very strong and very soft . A couple friends of mine work in the silkscreening business and told me that the `` Hanes Beefy T '' was THE best out there , so I ordered 6 of them on their advice . I 've never seen T shirts this nice , they are the most comfortable , strongest , and they feel like they will last forever . I 'm so happy with these shirts , they are awesome .
 Same quality as old ones . It is gift so do not know what they will think until after Christmas . Carhartt never fails the test .

 These are great t-shirts and my boys love them . They are active in sports and there is nothing better than having these shirts to wear . They take the wear and tear and come back for more ! I highly recommend them !

 My husband bought one of these shirts last year to try it out . I was very skeptical of the `` no ironing '' claim . I could n't believe my eyes when I took it out of the dryer the first time -- not a wrinkle to be seen . The material is truly miraculous . We both love this product and plan to buy more . Thank you , Jos. Banks !
 I own three of these shirts and they are great . I get my shirts cleaned and pressed and here is an example of what great shirts they are
 I own two of these Traveler non-wrinkle shirts and they are absolutely the best shirts I have ever owned . They are of high quality material and the size I bought was right on the money . The colors offered are very versatile with just about anything a person would own and can be worn formally or casually . I am going to stick with buying more of these shirts .
 I bought 2 to begin with and now own seven and I ca n't see myself buying other dress shirts
 I received this shirt as a gift over Christmas . Since then I have bought two more . The fit is outstanding and I have never felt a finer material in a dress shirt - it is soft yet sturdy and always appears pressed . The iron free is for real . I hate ironing and will pay the extra 20 dollars per shirt to never have to dry clean or iron again . I will never buy another shirt and I almost want to throw away my non-iron free dress shirts . I highly recommend this shirt . You will enjoy it and probably buy more of them .
 These dress shirts are the best ! Wrinkle-Free , Breathable , Durable Material , Plus lots of styles , sizes and color options . Compare side-by-side to other dress shirts and you 'll see and feel the difference .
 I have worn Levi jenas for the last 16years , i am relatively tall guy and seldom get my size in the store , Amazon provides me my size and then quality as well .
 Purchased two pairs of Levi 's Boot Cut Jeans for my husband , the Jeans are very hard to find in the stores . Since my husband is tall , it is hard to find 36x36 .
 These pants are very well put together and I am a big fan of Levi 's pants durability which is what prompted me to purchase these .
 I am a woman but men 's jeans fit me better . These are very comfortable . My jeans do NOT get hung up on my boots as they do with jeans that are not boot cut .
 todo salio perfecto , tanto el envio como el paquete recibido , estan esplendidas , la hora de llegada fue la establecida por el vendedor
 Quality jeans , but not made in the USA.Arrived quickly and each pair were individually bagged in plastic.Good fit , for me .
 Fit well at the waist and look good . Last a lot longer than most most jeans and seem to get more and more comfortable the more you wear them .
 These are great jeans , they do tend to run a little big , both on length and waist . The color was a lot more bluer then it looks in the picture , so be weary of that it . It was too country , and I needed more rock and roll , if you know what I mean.Pros
 I was a bit concerned about this purchase . My husband likes the boot cut style and that was an excellent choice for my purchase . I have zero compliants other then I wish I 'd bought more !
 I like this style and they are getting very hard to find . The price here was the best I found , got in a timely manner . I 'm happy with my purchase .
 Purchased these jeans for my husband . They have a nice fit and look very good on . No baggy butt like the relaxed fit jeans .
 I usually have a hard time finding good bootcut jeans with the right fit in the retail stores . If the color/wash/fabric is right , the size isnt . If the size is right , the fit is too loose at the seat and thighs . Now that my favorite pair of jeans is past its prime , I started looking for a new pair to replace it . After hunting all stores in and around my area and trying all available bootcuts in my size , I was very disappointed . That is , until I found a pair of Levi 's 517 Blue Ox in the local Macy 's store . This was the first bootcut I found in the last 3 years that fit me perfectly . Since I already had a pair of jeans that was of a very similar color , I came online and started looking for the correct color in that fit . Unfortunately , it wasnt that easy finding one online . Kohls , Dillards and others had Levi 's 517s , but they werent the same ones I saw in the store . Apart from Macys and Amazon , no other site -LRB- including Levi 's own site -RRB- had the same fit in Rancher Light color I was looking for . I could have ordered at Macys website , but my past experience with Amazon was stellar and so it my first choice . Even then I was a little skeptical if the photos were close to how the jeans looked in reality . Since amazon had a free returns on this one , I went ahead with the order . The product , as always with Amazon , came 6 days ahead of their estimated delivery date . The jeans is , in fact , very close to the pictures on the website and the fit is PERFECT !! Thanks to Levi 's for the perfect color and fit and KUDOS to amazon for the perfect shopping experience !
 Finally Levi went back to 7 belt loops instead of the five . Makes a big difference for those of us that work for a living .
 I bought the 517 as I prefer this cut to any other one of the Levi 's catalog , I place it even above the so famous 501 . I 'm fully satisfied
 I love these jeans . The wash and fit are great . That being said , they did arrive with a hole in the seat and the seam is a little crooked on the inside left leg . I really do n't care though because they fit so good .
 It is hard to find male , black , slim fit , boot cut jeans . Believe me I searched many places both on-line and local retail outlets . Finally I found these on Amazon and they were just right . Great fit , looks good , and the price was reasonable . I highly recommend them .
 We will take these to alterations but they were about 5 inches too long . Otherwise they are very nice .
 True to size , did n't shrink , and minimal wrinkling . Love the variety of sizing - son is tall and thin , and hard to fit , but Levis 517 made it happen !
 The Levi jeans were just like I expected . The fit was perfect and received them in just a few days . Thanks !!
 The quality of the denim is lighter , so the good fit disappears by the end of the day . Otherwise , I like 'em !
 Hubby dearest was so happy to find boot cut Levi jeans at Amazon as it seems most stores have quit carrying this style of jean . He likes to wear boot cut jeans and Levi jeans are his favorite brand.No complaints about the fit or wearability either . Ordered two more pairs of jeans today as he 's a happy camper.Recommend .
 Good deal on the jeans and speedy shipping . My first pair of boot cut jeans . My girl friend really likes them on me . I got the dark blue -LRB- rinse -RRB- . Fit good and comfortable .
 My skinny son is 54 years old and will not wear any other jeans - only 517 , boot cut Levi 's so I know what to buy for Christmas and Birthdays . I found a perfect fit for my skinny husband also .
 I ordered these jeansLevi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jeanfor a Christmas gift a short time before Christmas . I knew the size . I was somewhat concerned that I would not get them on time for Christmas The package came just before Christmas , and the jeans were exactly as pictured , nicely packaged -LRB- each pair separately enclosed in plastic bag -RRB- , the right size and color . I was very pleased , as was the recipient of the gift !
 The jeans were a Christmas gift and a style regularly worn by the recipient . They were a perfect fit . They are hard to find locally so we ordered from the Internet . The red tag on the back pocket did not say `` Levis '' and I have never seen this before . Is it significant ?
 Wow . These are great blue jeans , and they come in 38 long which is what he wears . HE wanted the boot cut , and a 34 waist was large enough . Usually he wears a 36 , , but I ordered 34 and they fit just right . Great looking , great price .
 I bought two pairs in two orders - both were perfect - exactly as I expected . On time . Good buy at a decent price .
 These jeans are tough but good looking and fit well . Amazon 's price is great , they are a good value for the money , and we always get prompt delivery and easy return if size is not right .
 These are great jeans for us gals , too , especially if you like to wear a true black color . I dress them up with a feminine camisole and heels , and have got many compliments on them .
 Exactly what my hubby wants . It 's difficult to find his size in our local stores . Very happy Amazon now has Levi 's in his size .
 I love my new bootcuts . I received them quickly , They fit perfectly . Thank you .
 I 've grown frustrated by the lack of good quality/reasonably priced jeans in the market today . At some point , the Levis brand started to suffer in terms of quality/value for the dollar . Do n't remember exactly when that happened , but I started to buy my jeans from Banana Republic . Over time , they stopped making the style I grew to rely on . This created a 7-10 stretch where I could n't seem to find a good pair of jeans . Most recently , I purchased a pair of Lucky jeans - ridiculously over priced . When those began to fail , I tried Levis again and bought these . For a third of the price of Lucky Jeans , these Levis boot-cut jeans are really nice . They have a really substantial feel/weight to them and I could n't be happier with the purchase . I was so pleased , I ended up buying a second pair .
 Levis 517 Boot Cut Jeans are just as advertized . Good fit and a perfect boot cut . I highly recommend them for anyone who needs boot cut jeans .
 It 's a very good pant for my husband . Nothing too special or fancy ; he is very satisfied because he got what he expected
 execelente producto muy buena calidad , el pantalon vino en un excelente empaque y llego super rapido deverdad no tengo quejas lo recomiendo
 It is great to find the exact size , color , and fit you want in a Levi 's jean , and also get it on time .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean , Medium Stonewash , 38x29They fit perfectly . Will probably order more in a couple months .
 Needed a size that few brick & mortar stores keep in stock . Amazon had style I wanted in the size that I wanted at a good price !
 These blue jeans where a great color and a perfect fit . Glad I ordered them . They were a present for my son
 My husband has been wearing Levi 's since he was a teenager . They are the most durable jeans and he loves the boot cut .
 I 've been wearing these for years.They do tend to fade easily so wash them inside out and use a detergent product for black fabrics .
 I bought these as a gift for a friend who has worn this style for years . Good quality , good fit , good style .
 Great jeans.Classical style.Low price.Wearing only jeans , levis always loved.Happy New Year!Amazon Forever!I love it .
 This hard to find style arrived on time . These classic jeans fit just the way they should . Going back for more colors .
 Finally jeans that fit like the old Levis , these are the old quality heavy denim stuff not that wimpy pre-wash thin as paper junk denim . I would highly recommend these jeans to anyone who 's familiar with real Levis .
 Very easy shopping . I 'm familiar with the pants so it 's just a matter of price and convenience.Sitting at the desk for a few second beats driving to the store , finding out they do n't have the 517 in my size and driving back home . I 've always had trouble just finding the 517 at stores and shopping online sure makes things easier . The pants themselves are everything they 've always been , good fitting and tough.It 's nice to add the stonewash to my collection of darker denim so I do n't look the same every day.I was upprised how fast they came and that 's a big plus too .
 These jeans fit to size perfectly -LRB- for me -RRB- , are comfortable to wear , and have adequate material to reach a guy 's waist ... not hip-huggers . I 'll buy more of these ! Not a deal-breaker by any means but I would prefer them to not have the size label outside ... it seems Levi 's always does this .
 Amazon did not mentioned in the description that this pair of jeans is a Shrink-to-Fit fabric . No question on the quality . . it 's still an amazing jeans , the great Levi 's jeans , never goes out of style ... Take 31 '' waistline x 30 '' inseam if your size is 30 x 30 .
 Levi 's are always the best jeans around . Levi 's Boot Cut are the only kind my husband will wear . Always a good fit .
 Very high quality . Several pairs have consistent fit . Have bought and worn these 517 boot cut jeans for several years .
 My husband LOVES these jeans . They are a GREAT FIT , especially in the seat . The legs are n't too wide in the thighs and the bootcut bottom make a terrific silhouette . I like how he looks in them and he says they are REALLY COMFORTABLE . They look best in the darker color and are a good pair of `` dress jeans '' as well as versatile . We are ordering more . Ladies , get him these jeans !
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Slim Fit Jean is leg looks like so long , . . but lap so tight but leg looks like so long . .
 My husband like it . . although I have to cut the length a little bit . . He said he may buy more in the future . . Hopefully they have shorter length then .
 They are Levis what more needs to be said ? Theyre the only jeans im buying from now on . They fit great and last 2-5 times longer than any other jeans ive bought .
 I use to wear the Levis low boot cut , but they discontinue to sell the color I want . After I give this one a try , I like it so much .
 If you know your size they fit . I do n't understand the reviews that say the sizes are wrong . Will buy again .
 was just what i expected ... very pleased with purchase . I like the fact that you can get 29 inseam . You can not get that in the store . No need to get them hemmed !
 his pants in overall line is still very good , sturdy , feels soft to the touch on the skin , the profile legendary cutting adds a touch of elegance , and even after several washings the fabric remains the same and does not shrink , the only thing I did not like the pants is that they have deteriorated the quality of the clips and metal buttons , formerly of copper and bronze , and now this are of aluminum and does not look good , however I recommend buying them are very good at the price .
 These came a little long , maybe an inch or two . Seeing as many others have noticed this is a problem with this fit , I suggest going one inseam size lower . I ordered a 30 '' and they fit more like a 31-32 '' . Other than the sizing , they are great jeans , and still look great on me . The boot cut allows the extra length to bunch up a little around the shoes , so you do n't really notice it . It actually looks good.I wish they sold these in a low rise version , as I do n't like hiking them up to where you might put dress pants or khakis . They stopped selling the 517 in a low rise though , so I 'm happy to wear them as is , great fit .
 I have always appreciated the fit and quality of Levi jeans . The boot cut has a closer fit around the knee with comfortable room in the hips and waist . What Levi Strauss needs to understand is that there is a huge population of men out there that has a 31 inch inseam . Men between 5 ' 9 &#34; and 6 ' fall into this size range . My growth did not stop at 30 &#34; inseam , and did not make it to 32 &#34; . So I either buy high water jeans that show my socks , or I let the cuffs drag the floor which signicantly reduces the life of the jeans . I liked the fit enough that I spent an additional $ 10 to get them hemmed to 31 .
 I 've worn Levi 's for over 50 years . From the days when you had to roll up the cuffs because they only had one length to super bells in the 70 's and now my favorite 517 's . They are always true to size and the workmanship is always excellent . The service at Amazon is always great too . What more can I say , I am one satisfied customer .
 These boot cut Levis have always been my favorite jeans . I had not had any in a while , so when my order arrived I immediately tried them on . I forgot how well they fit , and they are really stylish . Awesome . Will be ordering more .
 Authentic , just as described . Fast delivery . I am very satisfied with purchase . Smooth , one stop purchase . Husband will be very happy on Christmas day ! Thank you .
 My grandson loves these jeans , since he 's rather tall we were glad to find Levi 's makes great jeans in his size . Strange as it may seem , many brands of jeans do not come in a 34in length .
 As an active equestrian rider , and a woman of 59 years , I 'm ALWAYS looking for comfortable jeans that sit at my waist -- I do n't like women 's jeans at all - the fabric in women 's jeans seems flimsy , and the low-rise , hip-hugging jeans for riding or leisure wear feels uncomfortable . The men 's Levis and men 's Lee jeans are very comfortable , and they can handle my active life -- for me , men 's Levis 517 bootcut jeans have best variety for colors , and toughest quality in fabric .
 Nice one . . Boot Cut with nice fit.Ordered the Jeans with 29L but got it 3inch longer . So I had to do alteration , usually I order my pants with 29L and it fits perfect on me .
 Levis 517 's fit me better than any other jeans that I 've bought . Gon na stick with them . I wear a 38 waist , 36 inseam . Have bought several pair over the past six months from various places and they all fit the same . Good quality control !
 BASTANTE BIEN . BUENA CALIDAD DEL PANTALON . ME QUEDO MUY BIEN . TANTO EL LARGO COMO EN CINTURA . EXCELENTE COMPRA A UDS . GRACIAS .
 The jeans are a good deep color . Wish they were n't quite as thin as jean material seems to be getting , but seems they are all like that now . Overall a good pair of jeans.These are hard to find in 36x36 , so I 'm glad Amazon carries them .
 i traveled 80 miles one day looking for the jeans i like with no luck , it did make for a nice bike ride though ! then i went online looking and i found what i was looking for at amozon these jeans are hard to get in my hometown!Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut JeansWhat a nice pair of rugged jeans . And I got them so FAST !! Thanks again.Roxann Hill
 Good product , on time and as shown in Amazon.But ... years ago , ordering the same # jean and the same size always brought the exact same fit and look . Lately , the same length , for instance , some times is a bit too long -LRB- can be fixed -RRB- or a bit too short -LRB- bad news -RRB- . The price to be paid for savings by manufacturing offshore . Lets see if with the crisis we return to the memorable `` MADE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ''
 What can I say ? They are Levis . Perfect fit , excellent quality , and the most impressive thing was the price . Unbelievable !
 If you promise not to tell anybody , I wear lined jeans from eddie bauer or llbean when it gets cooler . I wear these when it gets warmer . True to size , do n't shrink too much .
 These jeans come washed so they are soft , supple and ready to wear . They are pre-shrunk so order the size you wear . I choose boot-cut jeans because I wear 12 '' - shaft western boots . Levies are the only jeans I wear because they fit well , look good , and get better with age .
 These jeans are perfect for the guy who wants to wear boots and not look like a geek or a thug . Just the right combination of loose and fitted .
 This is my first pair of Levi 517 's and I have to say I am very impressed . They sit on my natural waist -LRB- not low-rise like the 527 's -RRB- , and are fitted in the seat and thigh , and then flare out below the knee to fall on the boot . I 'm 6 ' 3 '' 190lbs and have a 36 waist and 34 inseam and it fit perfectly . Hard to find jeans these days that sit on the waist ... I 'm not a fan of the low-rise look or feel , so these jeans were a great find .
 Came to Amazon to order these jeans for my husband since no one ever has his size , 36x36 . I was pleasantly surprised because I did order two of these in different colors , Rancher Light and Rinse , both of which were the perfect colors . Perfect light colored jean and perfect dark colored jean . My husband and I are very hard to fit in jeans and tops so when something works we often get multiples , the problem however is that sometimes we buy the exact same thing in a different color and they fit totally different . Not these ! These jeans were great and the same fit ! Some people might not be able to appreciate that as much as I , but I was very grateful . It was a risk I had to take since his size is so common , but with free returns I had to take advantage . The boot leg is also very subtle but incredibly flattering . He does wear boots but of course they are n't necessary . I would say they are very true to size and great quality . They are currently his `` good jeans '' ... . that is until he `` accidentally '' wears them to go work in the garage . But when that happens , because it will , I will be back to purchase more ! By the way he is just over 6 ' 3 '' about 230-240lbs .
 they were exactly what we were looking for . the orginal 517 , these are my hubby 's most favoritie , they also hold up better than the other styles seem to
 Will have to wash several times for them to fit . I buy this size all the time from other retailers and they are n't this big . Like the color and the style . They just run big I guess . Mainly in the length . Would buy again , just a smaller size .
 The fit is nice , the color is holding up through the wash . I am glad they have different sizes then the stores . Very hard to find 33 x 36 !
 I like the way these jeans fit.The are also comfortable.The ones I have purchased previously have been durable .
 d e m a r a v i l l a e s t e m o d e l o muy bueno
 These are the first jeans in a while that actually fit my waist size , inseam and the leg openings are perfect .
 These jeans fit well but the denim seems less hefty than the denim of the same 517s from 5 years ago .
 I received my pants very quickly . I was concerned that my size would be too short for boots . I was pleasantly surprised that the designer was thoughtful about the shape and length for this item &#34; after &#34; several washings . Pants are about 1/2 inch longer than the average pants which make them perfect for cowboy boots . Pants are also very comfortable . JCD
 Noticed that they even have an extra pair of belt loops compared to my previous order . They are sturdy & dependable .
 the product is excellente , but needs to be taggedcorrectly , I order 34x30 tag say so , but real size was36x32 try buying them from differet source , and same thing never can get athe right size until i took a mesuring tape to the store and mesure before buing them !!
 I love those Jeans . . nice shape and denim . I ordered different colors from this pant and I love them all . it is comfortable , and have a nice leg openning that falls around the boot .
 I have been wearing 517 's for as long as I can remember . They fit perfectly and have remained unchanged for years .
 These boot cut jeans by my favorite jeans maker are exactly what I needed.When I ordered my Harley Davidson boots , I needed pants for when I wear them and these ones are the only ones that fit on the outside where others ca n't . Shopping local yields nothing like these , just junk not worth the money.Quality is what I 've come to expect from Levi 's , outstanding with fit absolutely perfect.More orders coming soon for these.Shipping was prompt , making this buyer very happy.Thank you to everyone for helping this lonely guy that hardly can get out to shop by bringing them to me.Again , THANK YOU VERY MUCH !!
 I thought these were more on the casual side , but after putting them on , they can pull off a nice look . Very comfy , one day to break in . No frays , quality zipper . Dimensions were perfect . Overall color is a shade or two darker than in the picture . Awesome , new favorite pair .
 If you have a problem with jeans bagging in the rear , then these jeans are for you ! They are a great fit and very comfortable ! My husband loves them !
 Well , its a good jean , everybody know the levi 's quality , the item arive in perfect conditions . . so nothing more to say . .
 Perfect fit , every time . 517 's are difficult for me to find locally , but buying on line thru Amazon is best for me .
 He looks hot in them , thanks ! What more can I say ? They did n't stay on for very long ... ca n't share any more details .
 I was somewhat hesitant to order Levi 's online but I could n't be happier with this order ! The jeans are exactly as described and fit perfectly . They are genuine Levi 's and are of the highest quality - not seconds . I ca n't recommend this seller highly enough .
 They 're good sellers and the product is very good , I like so much this jean . Ellos son muy buenos vendedores , el producto llego rapido a mis manos y era el esperado , los recomiendo ampliamente .
 I wear Levi jeans every day . Levi 's are the only jeans I will wear.I have worn Levi jeans for the past twenty -LRB- 20 -RRB- years ... or longer.Levi jeans are great ... in fact , i 'm wearin 'em right now ...
 Sent me what I wanted . 15 more 12 more 11 more 9 more 7 more 5 more 3 more done
 This is a very good price for this product , it 's the second one I 've ordered for my son .
 Style & size stayed true since the last time I bought a pair , after gettingLevi 's Men 's 527 Low Rise Boot Cut Jeanthat are nothing like they used to be that 's all a shopper can ask .
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut . Black 42 waist / 30 length . If you are short , stocky and have a big butt . These pants are perfect . They wo n't bunch up at your fat knees and they will last a long time before the zipper explodes . I suggest you buy the next size up because they will shrink after 6 months of washing , drying and severe stretching in the seat area . Great pants .
 MY FAVORITE JEANS FOR 25 YEARS . I HAVE WORN MAINLY 501 MODEL , SO I READ MANY REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING THESE 517 JEANS.AFTER THINKING FOR A LONG TIME I DECIDED TO BUY ONE SIZE BIGGER THAN USUAL . IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE.THEY ARE JUST FINE , BLACK COLOR AND ZIPPER FLY WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DETAIL FOR ME !
 My husband 's body type includes slight pot belly and skinny hips and thighs . Almost impossible to find pants that fit well without being either too tight in the belly or looking baggy in the seat and thighs . He used to wear Levi 's Action Jeans which were boot cut jeans with slight stretch in fabric and a slight crease in the legs . These jeans always looked and fit great ; real snappy . Unfortunately they 're no longer available . Then went to wearing David Taylor Flexjeans from Sears which were almost as good . However , he now find that although Sears still sells jeans by this name , they are no longer the same . They are now made in China and are made from a crappy fabric and no longer fit the same . In desperation , he started looking thru available Levis products and found Levi 's 517 . Advertised as slim in seat and thighs . He did not expect much but was pleasantly surprised to find that they are indeed somewhat slim in the seat and thighs , even though the pants he bought had a waist size slightly larger than minimally necessary , thankfully allowing him to breathe . Bottom line was that he was very happy that these pants are not so tight in the waist that its hard to breathe , but still slim enough in the seat and thighs that they do n't look like old man 's jeans . Just wish they had the snappy look of the old Levi 's Action Jeans .
 I bought a pair of these in 29X34 and they are great . Fit perfect , really like the cut , lighter weight material but not too light , should hold up well . Just wish they would reduce the size of the internal tag -- I 've actually had to tuck it back into the pants a few times after putting them on !
 Finally figured out what cut and size I like , but the only place I can find them is the internet . Great pants .
 These were ordered off Amazon when I could not find them locally . I found the pants and they are describer perfectly and fit exactly as I had wanted them to . I will buy more in the future because they were perfect .
 Completamente satisfecha con el producto , exactamente igual a lo que ofrecieron . LLego en el tiempo estimado que prometieron . Ninguna queja , volveria a comprar de nuevo .
 These seemed a bit darker in person than pictured but they were a great pair of jeans for my husband . This is his favorite style of jeans and he needed a new pair of &#34; dressy jeans . &#34; Same great jeans as in the past .
 All the Levi 's I purchased for my 16 year old son were ` made to fit ' ! From the straight to boot cut , they all were a perfect fit for his personal taste . They are well made and very stylish .
 Great jeans , great price , speedy delivery as promised ! Will definitely be ordering them again since my son is so tall and slim and this is one of the only places I can find his size .
 Great basic jeans in hard to find sizes . Not much to say otherwise . They have washed up well and held up well for my long and lanky teen .
 Jeans are a little tight in the thighs for my husband . It did n't come with packing slip so I 'm hoping I can return them !
 Good quality but I wish I had done more research on the colors . Ordered rigid because of the look online however the denim itself is rigid .
 Yes , these Levi 's are everything I had hoped they would be and More . Perfect fit , and I 'm very pleased tofinally have a BLACK pair ! Amazon 's got another winner !
 My wife thinks it 's funny that I rate my jeans with numbers , but , as a former 505 's man , I now prefer the 517 's 'cause ride my horses more and were my boots more ... plus , they just , plain feel good when they 're on me ...
 Who does n't love Levis ? These are great ! My son was happy on Christmas day and so were we . Happy Holidays !
 These jeans are everything they say they are . We will definately order these jeans again when the time comes . Thanks !
 100 % recomended , i have no doubt that i am going to buy another , it is really regular fit and boot cut
 This is the only jean my husband wears . He has the hardest time finding 36x29 . This is a perfect fit for him . When he needs more I will return to amazon .
 I finally found a pear of jeans that my wife said they look good on me and after being washed still fits great
 Great fit for my long legs ! Hard to find jeans my size but Levi 's always comes through for me ! a
 Ordered these for my boyfriend , they run extremely small , he regularly wears a 32/34 had to send back and get a 36/34 . Other than that they 're great jeans .
 Finally a pair of Levi 's not only affordable , but a pair that is the real deal . . not seconds or blemished . . but cut perfectly . . The best I have bought in years . . Thanks . . and `` I 'll be back for more ''
 They fit just perfectly and I am very happy to not only get the bestdeal around but beat the sales tax . Good old Levi 's rigid , bootcut jeans have been my all-time favorite jeans my whole life , andI just turned 60 . Got 'em within a week , free shipping faster thanexpected , so that was cool , too . Amazon rules !
 The pants are great . I can not seem to find them in stores like Kohls or Target where I usually shop . I 'm not skinny as far as a skinny person goes but I have thinner legs than a lot of guys . These seem to be not as loose in the butt and thighs . I usually get the 505 's but they are cut a little bigger assuming tree trunk size legs . I have runners legs and these work . If you have big footballer legs , forget about it .
 Just as described ! Fit & look exactly what he needed and wanted . And he said I could n't find this product ... LOLThanks !!! The Wife wrote the review ...
 These jeans fit great . The boot cut gives a good look without being sloppy . My husband looks hot in them .
 Got these as a gift for my brother , and they are the true blue classic with a great slim shape . Perfect `` date night '' jeans .
 These are the only jeans my husband will wear and we could not find them ANYWHERE . When i found them here i was happily suprised with the discount price and they look great . Would buy again from this seller .
 Excellent transaction on hard to find size and style Levi Jeans.Reasonable price and quick shipping.I 'm very pleased with this purchase !
 jeans were shipped quick , arrived in good shape the medium stonewash has that worn look most people want , I am pleased with the purchase .
 It 's very good ! 100 % cottonThe higher rise sits comfortably at the waist.A fit you want from a brand you trustFit width & length ; !
 non common size request was delivered promply before Christmas . My son was very happy with the fit and color .
 Great product ... my dad was very pleased . He had not been able to find the 517 .
 These were a birthday gift for my son and I had them sent directly to him at college . He loved them and they fit great ! Good quality for the price . He liked the fit of the boot cut .
 Excellent product the product I come very well and it is what was waiting of , I come in time , good
 I bought they for my boyfriend who had lost a bit of weight and all his pants were falling down , but these fit and stay up -LRB- Thank God -RRB-
 My husband loves the fit and the price.Great deal.You can dress them up or down!Look no further.Great looking jean , for the price .
 Bought these jeans for my husband . They fit very well and look nice . The shipment arrived on time . I was happy with my purchase .
 I ordered these jeans an exrta size longer becaause I wanted a high cuff . Got exactally that . Perfect !!! Now I 'm looking for a white pair
 Well , they 're Levi 's . There you go . Best jeans on the market . Last forever and fit great . The black does fade to gray quicker than I would like , but that 's probably because I wear only black , all the time . So ...
 Great black on black bootcut jeans . They have even gone back to adding two additional belt loops a feature that went away several years ago .
 Fits well , my husband loves them , quality control met , consistent sizing , and look good on . Will order more as needed
 My son wears a 36 Waist x 36 lenght which is very hard to find . The Levi 's Men 's 517 are about the only jeans he likes and these fit him perfectly . They were shipped very quickly and the price was excellent . They were a birthday gift and he loves them .
 The jeans were pre washed and fit just like I wanted . They were really softer than I expected . I would buy this product again .
 I was so happy with the quality and fit ; I ordered 3 more pairs ! I will be good on jeans for awhile . The price was good too .
 Great quality and a lower price , for me is like a tailored jean , I 'm happy with this product . No more to say thanks to all
 After numerous failed attempts at the 527 's on amazon I finally got a clue and got these jeans . They are PERFECT ... great fit ... weight ... etc. ... just like the jeans I wore in high school 20 years ago ... . I 'm already thinking about a second pair . The light rancher is the perfect color ... . As for the 527 's MADE IN BANGLADESH ... amazing they could ever bear the levis name ... perhaps they were counterfeit . Thanks amazon for my true and needed exchange . The original pair of jeans I ordered ... yes the 527 ... was complete trash . These 517 's are real jeans for real cowboys ... and I 'm not one ... but I do wear a ton of boots ...
 Exellent product
 These are like they used to make them ! More belt loops , great fabric - love them ! Ca n't wait to order more of these !
 I was having a really hard time finding the boot cut Levis - no one seems to carry them anymore . These are just what I wanted . They look and fit good .
 Bought these for my husband and they fit true to size , maybe a little bit long but not so much that he wo n't wear them . He love them , they look good so I love them ! Great Pants !
 I ordered these jeans for my 16yo son & he really liked them . The only thing he would have preferred was a lower rise , but he 's wearing them without complaints . : -RRB-
 I bought 2 of these and man they are nice . I 'll admit the guy wearing the jean in the picture sold me . Like I went and look for all the style of Levi 's , and these attracted me the most . Although I would n't tuck in my shirt like that . But they sure look good with some chucks and or casual boots and a dress shirt , with a silver wrist watch , and a pair of shades . They are heavy , and for me kinda tight even though jean of a different brand and style with the same size , fit me perfectly . I do n't know I guess it the way they are made . But for the look , I 'll take the pain any day , yes these jean are so tight mostly in my thigh area and waist , that I do get a little discomfort pain in my lower back . I guess it the way they are design and the heaviness of the jean . Of course I am in the process of getting in shape again . So with time , these will be perfect . I do like to sag a little , but as of right now I ca n't with these . Until I lose some of that belly fat I accumulated over the years .
 These are the jeans I always buy , they are a great comfortable fit . It is also great that Amazon stocks the size I need , it 's impossible to get from the shops .
 My body was made for Levi 's brand jeans , and I 'd worn through a couple of pairs . I bought duplicate black 517s - soft but not washed out , dark , with a predictable fit . They are my new favorites . The process went smoothly . Who knew I 'd be buying clothes online ?
 I ordered these for Christmas for my 6 ' 2 '' grandson who had grown out of all his pants after checking stores and finding his size is almost impossible to find . They were perfect and he loved them .
 The Levi 's 517 Boot Cut were purchused as a replacement of the wrong ones bought at a local store , These ordered & delivered ; I was told fit greatly before & after ; washThe price for my buying , totaled out a nuff less even with shipping to come fromamazon , rather than a store , even on sale after my tax & shipping ; -LRB- as a late gift -RRB- Theonly guestion I got was about , they did not have the Levi 's cardboard shelf tagswe see on Jean 's in store .
 I love my levis . I was unaware they came in black . I bought a blue pair and black pair , Ilove them
 These were a secret gift for my brother-in-law . He keeps complaining that he must do laundry every other day because he only has one pair of work pants , but then he just will not go get more or let anyone buy him any ! So , I got the size off of the one pair of jeans he owns -LRB- laundry is at my house -RRB- and I bought several other pairs that were similarly worn . I sneak in a new pair about once a week and so far he has n't noticed that he now has three pair of work pants . When I slip in the new ones , I put them in the dirty clothes hamper he uses . I wonder if he knows his pants are multiplying yet ?
 They arived bfore time , APO adress , in Afghanistan ,1 week took it to arive here , im suprised , and they fit good , i dont hawe no words
 36 &#34; inseam jeans at a reasonable price are hard to find . I really like the fit of these jeans just wish there were other kinds in the same length .
 Just what I expected . After soaking and drying , the fit and feel was as anticipated ... just like the good , old days !!! -LRB- I would estimate that length and waist both shrunk by about one inch ... as Mama warned , some 50 years ago -RRB-
 i got two pairs for my husband . levis are the only thing that fit him right . They make him look like he has a butt !
 I like this product because it fits very well and is comfortable . I recommend it to others . Good for those who like to wear boots .
 Finally found levis that were the correct size , if they are still available I will order more in the future
 Great pants . I wish there was a size 33 by 35 . I always have a hard time with pants size . I can get a length 34 , which shrink after a wash or a 36 that drags because there too long . But there is no length 35 in pants , so I do n't have much of choice .
 I am happy with the jeans and how they fit , but usually when I get 517 's , they are really stiff and then I get to break them in . This pair was already like pre-washed , just differnt than what I am used to , but I still like them and will wear them . Maybe I have to look into differnt types and find exactly what I am looking for next time . Thank you
 I 've been wearing 517 's for a good , long time now , and I love 'em ! The problem is that most of my local stores that sell them -- and very few of them do -- price them highly and also drastically limit the selection compared to the more popular 501 's and 550 's . Additionally , these jeans are often skipped over when it comes to the big sales . Well , shopping for them on Amazon is a decision I should have made long ago . The price here is hard to beat.As for the jeans themselves , they are of the rugged quality that Levi 's is known for . They fit like the product photo shows
 Have had these jeans for a few weeks now & am very satisfied.The flair from the knee down is discrete and does not look like the 70 's bell-bottoms . The fit on top was precisely as marked . The length seems about 1/2 inch longer than sized on the 501 's . Was formerly utilizing 501 slim fit jeans but found that could not place them over motorcyle boots . The 501s were great for rainy rides , but look too much like a cowboy , when tucked into the boots .
 As always , good shopping at amazon.com . Its always a problem finding the right length jeans for me . I found that in this levi 517 Boot cut jean , it feels good to finally find a jean that is not too short . A fact that i would have loved to know before i bought this jeans , is the leg opening size . This jean is very tight around the thigh area . I would just like a bit more details on the product a next time round . Other than that , it always a good shopping experience on Amazon .
 The length and waist were perfect . The quality of Levi jeans was the same as they had always been , good
 I always had to keep pulling up my previous pairs of Levi 's -LRB- any model -RRB- because they only had FIVE belt loops . A key ring and cell phone are not that heavy . I remember growing up with Levi 's having SEVEN belt loops and a heavier canvas . I was pleasantly surprised to see the ` new ' Levi 's 517 now have seven belt loops again . I started to buy a different model , but they still only have the five loops.I just bought a couple of these pairs from Amazon . I did check online at Kohls and their current batch of 517 's still show 5 loops . I will have to wait until I go to the store to see if their stock has been updated . Kohls prices are higher than Amazon , but I will recheck when they go on sale . I still check Amazon first for almost all my purchases.Overall , I like my new Levi 's jeans . I will compare them with older ones to see if the canvas really is slightly thinner . Outsourcing manufacturing almost always results in poorer quality and non-standard sizing . It has 100 % results in putting Americans out of work . I try to buy American whenever I can -- hopefully it will catch on.There is another issue appearing after I washed my new jeans with my old ones . It should n't have made a difference , but the new ones are now covered with fine fluffy hairs . I will have to use a lint brush when I take them out of the dryer for now . Although it may just be a ` break in -- first washings ' issue.Overall , I rate these jeans 4 stars . I will have to wait for a few machine washings to see how the color holds up . I may be old fashioned , but buying jeans looking like they are 1/2 wore out or have holes in them is ` less than optimal ' .
 I ran around town to find my husband Levi 517 's in size 35x32 for Christmas . In the stores , there were stacks of all different sorts of Levi 's to go through . Finally I came home and ordered them through Amazon and received exactly what he wanted . These Levi 's fit perfectly and look great . Very happy they come in off size waists . Thank you for making my job easier and receiving nice fitting jeans .
 I 've grown up wearing Levi 's and in particular 517 's in my adult life . I do like that Levi has added additional belt loops in the past year or so . Over the years Levi has cut some corners in manufacturing , but not enough to discourage me from continuing to buy their stonewashed 517 's . I like the stonewashed jeans since they are ready to wear , unlike the rigid indigo Levi 's that have to be washed several times to soften them up.I am buying more and more items from Amazon for the free shipping and competitive prices . It just saves a lot of time going to a retailer only to find out they do n't have my size or what I want . Even with Amazon collecting California sales tax , I figure the time and gas saved from having to go to a retailer is well worth it .
 The jeans were great ! The price was right , they were delivered in a timely fashion , and I lost a few lbs to get in them and I look good . lol . I recommend this company .
 These are the only jeans my son likes . He is tall and I have trouble finding his size in local stores and I could not find a better price .
 The jean came very quickly . They were the proper color , size , and cut . The packaging was excellent , and so was the quality of the jeans .
 Perfect price and fit for my husband . I would recommend this jean to any &#34; baby boomer &#34; who loves boot cut jeans.The jean has not changed at all good quality material and the right color . Thank you .
 This pair of Levi 's fits perfectly and the indigo color is the same as the Levi 's I wore back in the day !
 I gave these Jeans to my daughter 's friend for Christmas and he really likes them.He is real thin and wears motorcycle boots.He likes how they fit and loves the boot cut.He especially likes the rugged material .
 My order arrived in a timely fashion , they fit good and look great ... I 'm gon na get a couple more pairs .
 Levi 's 517 ` sThese Levi 's were the perfect fit . I like the fact that they are pre rinsed , which makes the fabric softer .
 Many of us do n't want to wear our Levi 's half way up our bellies . 517s are the best answer for that !
 A well tried and true blue jean that I 've been wearing for decades . The fit , finish , and quality is a good as or better than ever .
 product arrived as expected on time , the product was as expected and the quality was as you 'd expect to find in a brick & mortar store .
 Great fitting . I usually buy the 527 style but they did n't have black in that style . Ordered a 517 instead and love the fitting .
 The fit and look are great and I saved a few dollars . Will purchase more when the price is right
 love this jeans , the fabric is really good and the cut is impecable . it is original and the communication was really easy , i recieved really fast .
 I 've always wanted a ` black 527 ' but found out I could only get that in rigid black.I decided to try 517 n whao I might just decide to continue with 517 even with other colors.Just the perfect fit I love .
 Is exactly what i was looking for . . i being using this model for years , and this pair of pant are excellent
 I am a creature of habit . Being of slim build I have found the 517 Boot cut to be the perfect jean for me . I also know my size so the fit was great as received . This is not always the case when ordering over the Internet . Service was great delivered on time as expected .
 These are the best jeans Levis has to offer in my opinion . They are not light and flimsy like some jeans Levis are making these days . The medium stonewash is a great even color . They do n't look faded on the seat and thighs or dingly and dirty like so many jeans do . These jeans are rugged , comfortable and last a long , long time . On top of that they look great . These are the only jeans I will buy .
 Perfect fit right out of the box . Started wearing immediately , stitches , pockets , zipper perfectly in place . Survived several washes good as new .
 Good price , perfect quality . Very good model for young and old-aged people . Gorgeous color . Classic zipper . I 'm satisfied ! I recommend to buy it .
 These jeans fit me very well and look good . One thing I noticed however is that the denim has a more coarse feeling compared to other Levi 's jeans . I would buy these again .
 IL TELL YOU I HAVE BEEN WEARING LEVI 'S FOR YEARS ON END AND THE BEST DEAL I GOT ON THESE GREAT JEANS WAS FROM MY FAVORITE STORE AMAZON
 I love these jeans . For me they are perfect . Long enough to wear with or without boots and the fit is not too tight . How can you go wrong with Levi 's ?
 I got what I ordered promptly . I wish I had ordered a different color but -- my bad . No complaints . What else can I say ?
 The jeans was just perfect , the material , size and colour , nothing to complain about , and great timing too.They fit really well , and amazon 's size chart was very helpfull .
 My husband bought one of these shirts last year to try it out . I was very skeptical of the `` no ironing '' claim . I could n't believe my eyes when I took it out of the dryer the first time -- not a wrinkle to be seen . The material is truly miraculous . We both love this product and plan to buy more . Thank you , Jos. Banks !
 I own three of these shirts and they are great . I get my shirts cleaned and pressed and here is an example of what great shirts they are
 I own two of these Traveler non-wrinkle shirts and they are absolutely the best shirts I have ever owned . They are of high quality material and the size I bought was right on the money . The colors offered are very versatile with just about anything a person would own and can be worn formally or casually . I am going to stick with buying more of these shirts .
 I bought 2 to begin with and now own seven and I ca n't see myself buying other dress shirts
 I received this shirt as a gift over Christmas . Since then I have bought two more . The fit is outstanding and I have never felt a finer material in a dress shirt - it is soft yet sturdy and always appears pressed . The iron free is for real . I hate ironing and will pay the extra 20 dollars per shirt to never have to dry clean or iron again . I will never buy another shirt and I almost want to throw away my non-iron free dress shirts . I highly recommend this shirt . You will enjoy it and probably buy more of them .
 These dress shirts are the best ! Wrinkle-Free , Breathable , Durable Material , Plus lots of styles , sizes and color options . Compare side-by-side to other dress shirts and you 'll see and feel the difference .
 Same quality as old ones . It is gift so do not know what they will think until after Christmas . Carhartt never fails the test .
 Great pair of tights . They tend to get runs in them but are comfortable and wash well .
 Good at night ... Looks cool in the day time ... But better for night ... . because it magnifies light ... : -RRB- DANNY ...
 These pants turned out as I expected . They seemed of good quality for the price , and fit my husband well .
 my son loves his chef 's pants . he says he is going to be famous one day ... and I am sure that wearing professional chef 's wear makes him feel great !
 the shirt fits well and did n't shrink after washingexcellent service and fast delivery
 I own the Austin Reed dartmouth blazer in every color in which they make it -- it is a staple of my business wardrobe . Well made , quality fabric , nicely tailored , classic lines , appropriate for a professional woman . -LRB- something that can be hard to find at times -RRB- It should be noted , however , that the periwinkle and raspberry colors are lovely , but the fabric and buttons are slightly different than the `` classic '' colors -LRB- lighter -RRB- and the linings and interfacings are not as substantial as the brown , navy , camel , red and ivory . It 's still a good value , particularly as these are colors appropriate to warmer seasons and climates , but I was a bit surprised .
 I received my pants very quickly . I was concerned that my size would be too short for boots . I was pleasantly surprised that the designer was thoughtful about the shape and length for this item &#34; after &#34; several washings . Pants are about 1/2 inch longer than the average pants which make them perfect for cowboy boots . Pants are also very comfortable . JCD
 Noticed that they even have an extra pair of belt loops compared to my previous order . They are sturdy & dependable .
 The jeans were great ! The price was right , they were delivered in a timely fashion , and I lost a few lbs to get in them and I look good . lol . I recommend this company .

 Levi 's 517 ` sThese Levi 's were the perfect fit . I like the fact that they are pre rinsed , which makes the fabric softer .
 I have always appreciated the fit and quality of Levi jeans . The boot cut has a closer fit around the knee with comfortable room in the hips and waist . What Levi Strauss needs to understand is that there is a huge population of men out there that has a 31 inch inseam . Men between 5 ' 9 &#34; and 6 ' fall into this size range . My growth did not stop at 30 &#34; inseam , and did not make it to 32 &#34; . So I either buy high water jeans that show my socks , or I let the cuffs drag the floor which signicantly reduces the life of the jeans . I liked the fit enough that I spent an additional $ 10 to get them hemmed to 31 .

 BASTANTE BIEN . BUENA CALIDAD DEL PANTALON . ME QUEDO MUY BIEN . TANTO EL LARGO COMO EN CINTURA . EXCELENTE COMPRA A UDS . GRACIAS .
 The jeans are a good deep color . Wish they were n't quite as thin as jean material seems to be getting , but seems they are all like that now . Overall a good pair of jeans.These are hard to find in 36x36 , so I 'm glad Amazon carries them .
 Perfect fit right out of the box . Started wearing immediately , stitches , pockets , zipper perfectly in place . Survived several washes good as new .

 I love these jeans . For me they are perfect . Long enough to wear with or without boots and the fit is not too tight . How can you go wrong with Levi 's ?
 Well , they 're Levi 's . There you go . Best jeans on the market . Last forever and fit great . The black does fade to gray quicker than I would like , but that 's probably because I wear only black , all the time . So ...
 I have worn Levi jenas for the last 16years , i am relatively tall guy and seldom get my size in the store , Amazon provides me my size and then quality as well .
 Purchased two pairs of Levi 's Boot Cut Jeans for my husband , the Jeans are very hard to find in the stores . Since my husband is tall , it is hard to find 36x36 .
 These pants are very well put together and I am a big fan of Levi 's pants durability which is what prompted me to purchase these .
 I am a woman but men 's jeans fit me better . These are very comfortable . My jeans do NOT get hung up on my boots as they do with jeans that are not boot cut .
 todo salio perfecto , tanto el envio como el paquete recibido , estan esplendidas , la hora de llegada fue la establecida por el vendedor
 Quality jeans , but not made in the USA.Arrived quickly and each pair were individually bagged in plastic.Good fit , for me .
 Fit well at the waist and look good . Last a lot longer than most most jeans and seem to get more and more comfortable the more you wear them .
 I like this style and they are getting very hard to find . The price here was the best I found , got in a timely manner . I 'm happy with my purchase .
 Purchased these jeans for my husband . They have a nice fit and look very good on . No baggy butt like the relaxed fit jeans .
 I usually have a hard time finding good bootcut jeans with the right fit in the retail stores . If the color/wash/fabric is right , the size isnt . If the size is right , the fit is too loose at the seat and thighs . Now that my favorite pair of jeans is past its prime , I started looking for a new pair to replace it . After hunting all stores in and around my area and trying all available bootcuts in my size , I was very disappointed . That is , until I found a pair of Levi 's 517 Blue Ox in the local Macy 's store . This was the first bootcut I found in the last 3 years that fit me perfectly . Since I already had a pair of jeans that was of a very similar color , I came online and started looking for the correct color in that fit . Unfortunately , it wasnt that easy finding one online . Kohls , Dillards and others had Levi 's 517s , but they werent the same ones I saw in the store . Apart from Macys and Amazon , no other site -LRB- including Levi 's own site -RRB- had the same fit in Rancher Light color I was looking for . I could have ordered at Macys website , but my past experience with Amazon was stellar and so it my first choice . Even then I was a little skeptical if the photos were close to how the jeans looked in reality . Since amazon had a free returns on this one , I went ahead with the order . The product , as always with Amazon , came 6 days ahead of their estimated delivery date . The jeans is , in fact , very close to the pictures on the website and the fit is PERFECT !! Thanks to Levi 's for the perfect color and fit and KUDOS to amazon for the perfect shopping experience !
 Finally Levi went back to 7 belt loops instead of the five . Makes a big difference for those of us that work for a living .
 I bought the 517 as I prefer this cut to any other one of the Levi 's catalog , I place it even above the so famous 501 . I 'm fully satisfied
 I love these jeans . The wash and fit are great . That being said , they did arrive with a hole in the seat and the seam is a little crooked on the inside left leg . I really do n't care though because they fit so good .
 It is hard to find male , black , slim fit , boot cut jeans . Believe me I searched many places both on-line and local retail outlets . Finally I found these on Amazon and they were just right . Great fit , looks good , and the price was reasonable . I highly recommend them .
 We will take these to alterations but they were about 5 inches too long . Otherwise they are very nice .
 True to size , did n't shrink , and minimal wrinkling . Love the variety of sizing - son is tall and thin , and hard to fit , but Levis 517 made it happen !
 Well , its a good jean , everybody know the levi 's quality , the item arive in perfect conditions . . so nothing more to say . .
 Perfect fit , every time . 517 's are difficult for me to find locally , but buying on line thru Amazon is best for me .
 These are like they used to make them ! More belt loops , great fabric - love them ! Ca n't wait to order more of these !
 I was having a really hard time finding the boot cut Levis - no one seems to carry them anymore . These are just what I wanted . They look and fit good .
 Bought these for my husband and they fit true to size , maybe a little bit long but not so much that he wo n't wear them . He love them , they look good so I love them ! Great Pants !
 I ordered these jeans for my 16yo son & he really liked them . The only thing he would have preferred was a lower rise , but he 's wearing them without complaints . : -RRB-
 I bought 2 of these and man they are nice . I 'll admit the guy wearing the jean in the picture sold me . Like I went and look for all the style of Levi 's , and these attracted me the most . Although I would n't tuck in my shirt like that . But they sure look good with some chucks and or casual boots and a dress shirt , with a silver wrist watch , and a pair of shades . They are heavy , and for me kinda tight even though jean of a different brand and style with the same size , fit me perfectly . I do n't know I guess it the way they are made . But for the look , I 'll take the pain any day , yes these jean are so tight mostly in my thigh area and waist , that I do get a little discomfort pain in my lower back . I guess it the way they are design and the heaviness of the jean . Of course I am in the process of getting in shape again . So with time , these will be perfect . I do like to sag a little , but as of right now I ca n't with these . Until I lose some of that belly fat I accumulated over the years .
 These are the jeans I always buy , they are a great comfortable fit . It is also great that Amazon stocks the size I need , it 's impossible to get from the shops .

 I love my levis . I was unaware they came in black . I bought a blue pair and black pair , Ilove them
 Just as described ! Fit & look exactly what he needed and wanted . And he said I could n't find this product ... LOLThanks !!! The Wife wrote the review ...
 These jeans fit great . The boot cut gives a good look without being sloppy . My husband looks hot in them .
 Got these as a gift for my brother , and they are the true blue classic with a great slim shape . Perfect `` date night '' jeans .
 These are the only jeans my husband will wear and we could not find them ANYWHERE . When i found them here i was happily suprised with the discount price and they look great . Would buy again from this seller .
 Excellent transaction on hard to find size and style Levi Jeans.Reasonable price and quick shipping.I 'm very pleased with this purchase !
 jeans were shipped quick , arrived in good shape the medium stonewash has that worn look most people want , I am pleased with the purchase .
 It 's very good ! 100 % cottonThe higher rise sits comfortably at the waist.A fit you want from a brand you trustFit width & length ; !
 non common size request was delivered promply before Christmas . My son was very happy with the fit and color .
 I got what I ordered promptly . I wish I had ordered a different color but -- my bad . No complaints . What else can I say ?
 The jeans was just perfect , the material , size and colour , nothing to complain about , and great timing too.They fit really well , and amazon 's size chart was very helpfull .
 Style & size stayed true since the last time I bought a pair , after gettingLevi 's Men 's 527 Low Rise Boot Cut Jeanthat are nothing like they used to be that 's all a shopper can ask .
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut . Black 42 waist / 30 length . If you are short , stocky and have a big butt . These pants are perfect . They wo n't bunch up at your fat knees and they will last a long time before the zipper explodes . I suggest you buy the next size up because they will shrink after 6 months of washing , drying and severe stretching in the seat area . Great pants .
 MY FAVORITE JEANS FOR 25 YEARS . I HAVE WORN MAINLY 501 MODEL , SO I READ MANY REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING THESE 517 JEANS.AFTER THINKING FOR A LONG TIME I DECIDED TO BUY ONE SIZE BIGGER THAN USUAL . IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE.THEY ARE JUST FINE , BLACK COLOR AND ZIPPER FLY WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DETAIL FOR ME !
 My husband 's body type includes slight pot belly and skinny hips and thighs . Almost impossible to find pants that fit well without being either too tight in the belly or looking baggy in the seat and thighs . He used to wear Levi 's Action Jeans which were boot cut jeans with slight stretch in fabric and a slight crease in the legs . These jeans always looked and fit great ; real snappy . Unfortunately they 're no longer available . Then went to wearing David Taylor Flexjeans from Sears which were almost as good . However , he now find that although Sears still sells jeans by this name , they are no longer the same . They are now made in China and are made from a crappy fabric and no longer fit the same . In desperation , he started looking thru available Levis products and found Levi 's 517 . Advertised as slim in seat and thighs . He did not expect much but was pleasantly surprised to find that they are indeed somewhat slim in the seat and thighs , even though the pants he bought had a waist size slightly larger than minimally necessary , thankfully allowing him to breathe . Bottom line was that he was very happy that these pants are not so tight in the waist that its hard to breathe , but still slim enough in the seat and thighs that they do n't look like old man 's jeans . Just wish they had the snappy look of the old Levi 's Action Jeans .
 I bought a pair of these in 29X34 and they are great . Fit perfect , really like the cut , lighter weight material but not too light , should hold up well . Just wish they would reduce the size of the internal tag -- I 've actually had to tuck it back into the pants a few times after putting them on !
 Finally figured out what cut and size I like , but the only place I can find them is the internet . Great pants .
 Many of us do n't want to wear our Levi 's half way up our bellies . 517s are the best answer for that !
 A well tried and true blue jean that I 've been wearing for decades . The fit , finish , and quality is a good as or better than ever .
 These seemed a bit darker in person than pictured but they were a great pair of jeans for my husband . This is his favorite style of jeans and he needed a new pair of &#34; dressy jeans . &#34; Same great jeans as in the past .
 All the Levi 's I purchased for my 16 year old son were ` made to fit ' ! From the straight to boot cut , they all were a perfect fit for his personal taste . They are well made and very stylish .
 Great jeans , great price , speedy delivery as promised ! Will definitely be ordering them again since my son is so tall and slim and this is one of the only places I can find his size .
 Great basic jeans in hard to find sizes . Not much to say otherwise . They have washed up well and held up well for my long and lanky teen .
 Jeans are a little tight in the thighs for my husband . It did n't come with packing slip so I 'm hoping I can return them !
 Good quality but I wish I had done more research on the colors . Ordered rigid because of the look online however the denim itself is rigid .
 Yes , these Levi 's are everything I had hoped they would be and More . Perfect fit , and I 'm very pleased tofinally have a BLACK pair ! Amazon 's got another winner !
 I am a creature of habit . Being of slim build I have found the 517 Boot cut to be the perfect jean for me . I also know my size so the fit was great as received . This is not always the case when ordering over the Internet . Service was great delivered on time as expected .
 These are the best jeans Levis has to offer in my opinion . They are not light and flimsy like some jeans Levis are making these days . The medium stonewash is a great even color . They do n't look faded on the seat and thighs or dingly and dirty like so many jeans do . These jeans are rugged , comfortable and last a long , long time . On top of that they look great . These are the only jeans I will buy .
 These jeans are everything they say they are . We will definately order these jeans again when the time comes . Thanks !
 100 % recomended , i have no doubt that i am going to buy another , it is really regular fit and boot cut
 This is the only jean my husband wears . He has the hardest time finding 36x29 . This is a perfect fit for him . When he needs more I will return to amazon .
 I finally found a pear of jeans that my wife said they look good on me and after being washed still fits great
 Great fit for my long legs ! Hard to find jeans my size but Levi 's always comes through for me ! a
 Ordered these for my boyfriend , they run extremely small , he regularly wears a 32/34 had to send back and get a 36/34 . Other than that they 're great jeans .
 Finally a pair of Levi 's not only affordable , but a pair that is the real deal . . not seconds or blemished . . but cut perfectly . . The best I have bought in years . . Thanks . . and `` I 'll be back for more ''
 i traveled 80 miles one day looking for the jeans i like with no luck , it did make for a nice bike ride though ! then i went online looking and i found what i was looking for at amozon these jeans are hard to get in my hometown!Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut JeansWhat a nice pair of rugged jeans . And I got them so FAST !! Thanks again.Roxann Hill
 Good product , on time and as shown in Amazon.But ... years ago , ordering the same # jean and the same size always brought the exact same fit and look . Lately , the same length , for instance , some times is a bit too long -LRB- can be fixed -RRB- or a bit too short -LRB- bad news -RRB- . The price to be paid for savings by manufacturing offshore . Lets see if with the crisis we return to the memorable `` MADE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ''
 What can I say ? They are Levis . Perfect fit , excellent quality , and the most impressive thing was the price . Unbelievable !
 The only problem was I had was that I had to have them hemmed 2 &#34; so as not to walk on the cuff . I would have ordered them shorter but they were not offered in the waist size I needed . The waist fit perfect and having them hemmed was not that big of a deal . It coast me $ 12.00 to have them hemmed .
 I love being able to find the 517 's on line and not having to run all over town for the style and size I need .
 If you promise not to tell anybody , I wear lined jeans from eddie bauer or llbean when it gets cooler . I wear these when it gets warmer . True to size , do n't shrink too much .
 These jeans come washed so they are soft , supple and ready to wear . They are pre-shrunk so order the size you wear . I choose boot-cut jeans because I wear 12 '' - shaft western boots . Levies are the only jeans I wear because they fit well , look good , and get better with age .
 These jeans are perfect for the guy who wants to wear boots and not look like a geek or a thug . Just the right combination of loose and fitted .
 This is my first pair of Levi 517 's and I have to say I am very impressed . They sit on my natural waist -LRB- not low-rise like the 527 's -RRB- , and are fitted in the seat and thigh , and then flare out below the knee to fall on the boot . I 'm 6 ' 3 '' 190lbs and have a 36 waist and 34 inseam and it fit perfectly . Hard to find jeans these days that sit on the waist ... I 'm not a fan of the low-rise look or feel , so these jeans were a great find .
 Came to Amazon to order these jeans for my husband since no one ever has his size , 36x36 . I was pleasantly surprised because I did order two of these in different colors , Rancher Light and Rinse , both of which were the perfect colors . Perfect light colored jean and perfect dark colored jean . My husband and I are very hard to fit in jeans and tops so when something works we often get multiples , the problem however is that sometimes we buy the exact same thing in a different color and they fit totally different . Not these ! These jeans were great and the same fit ! Some people might not be able to appreciate that as much as I , but I was very grateful . It was a risk I had to take since his size is so common , but with free returns I had to take advantage . The boot leg is also very subtle but incredibly flattering . He does wear boots but of course they are n't necessary . I would say they are very true to size and great quality . They are currently his `` good jeans '' ... . that is until he `` accidentally '' wears them to go work in the garage . But when that happens , because it will , I will be back to purchase more ! By the way he is just over 6 ' 3 '' about 230-240lbs .
 These are great jeans , they do tend to run a little big , both on length and waist . The color was a lot more bluer then it looks in the picture , so be weary of that it . It was too country , and I needed more rock and roll , if you know what I mean.Pros
 I was a bit concerned about this purchase . My husband likes the boot cut style and that was an excellent choice for my purchase . I have zero compliants other then I wish I 'd bought more !
 they were exactly what we were looking for . the orginal 517 , these are my hubby 's most favoritie , they also hold up better than the other styles seem to
 Will have to wash several times for them to fit . I buy this size all the time from other retailers and they are n't this big . Like the color and the style . They just run big I guess . Mainly in the length . Would buy again , just a smaller size .
 The fit is nice , the color is holding up through the wash . I am glad they have different sizes then the stores . Very hard to find 33 x 36 !
 I like the way these jeans fit.The are also comfortable.The ones I have purchased previously have been durable .
 d e m a r a v i l l a e s t e m o d e l o muy bueno
 These are the first jeans in a while that actually fit my waist size , inseam and the leg openings are perfect .
 These jeans fit well but the denim seems less hefty than the denim of the same 517s from 5 years ago .
 I bought two pairs in two orders - both were perfect - exactly as I expected . On time . Good buy at a decent price .
 These jeans are tough but good looking and fit well . Amazon 's price is great , they are a good value for the money , and we always get prompt delivery and easy return if size is not right .
 the product is excellente , but needs to be taggedcorrectly , I order 34x30 tag say so , but real size was36x32 try buying them from differet source , and same thing never can get athe right size until i took a mesuring tape to the store and mesure before buing them !!
 I love those Jeans . . nice shape and denim . I ordered different colors from this pant and I love them all . it is comfortable , and have a nice leg openning that falls around the boot .
 I have been wearing 517 's for as long as I can remember . They fit perfectly and have remained unchanged for years .
 These boot cut jeans by my favorite jeans maker are exactly what I needed.When I ordered my Harley Davidson boots , I needed pants for when I wear them and these ones are the only ones that fit on the outside where others ca n't . Shopping local yields nothing like these , just junk not worth the money.Quality is what I 've come to expect from Levi 's , outstanding with fit absolutely perfect.More orders coming soon for these.Shipping was prompt , making this buyer very happy.Thank you to everyone for helping this lonely guy that hardly can get out to shop by bringing them to me.Again , THANK YOU VERY MUCH !!
 I thought these were more on the casual side , but after putting them on , they can pull off a nice look . Very comfy , one day to break in . No frays , quality zipper . Dimensions were perfect . Overall color is a shade or two darker than in the picture . Awesome , new favorite pair .
 If you have a problem with jeans bagging in the rear , then these jeans are for you ! They are a great fit and very comfortable ! My husband loves them !
 It 's a very good pant for my husband . Nothing too special or fancy ; he is very satisfied because he got what he expected
 execelente producto muy buena calidad , el pantalon vino en un excelente empaque y llego super rapido deverdad no tengo quejas lo recomiendo
 He looks hot in them , thanks ! What more can I say ? They did n't stay on for very long ... ca n't share any more details .
 I was somewhat hesitant to order Levi 's online but I could n't be happier with this order ! The jeans are exactly as described and fit perfectly . They are genuine Levi 's and are of the highest quality - not seconds . I ca n't recommend this seller highly enough .
 They 're good sellers and the product is very good , I like so much this jean . Ellos son muy buenos vendedores , el producto llego rapido a mis manos y era el esperado , los recomiendo ampliamente .
 I wear Levi jeans every day . Levi 's are the only jeans I will wear.I have worn Levi jeans for the past twenty -LRB- 20 -RRB- years ... or longer.Levi jeans are great ... in fact , i 'm wearin 'em right now ...
 Sent me what I wanted . 15 more 12 more 11 more 9 more 7 more 5 more 3 more done
 Finally found levis that were the correct size , if they are still available I will order more in the future
 Great pants . I wish there was a size 33 by 35 . I always have a hard time with pants size . I can get a length 34 , which shrink after a wash or a 36 that drags because there too long . But there is no length 35 in pants , so I do n't have much of choice .
 Excellent product the product I come very well and it is what was waiting of , I come in time , good
 I bought they for my boyfriend who had lost a bit of weight and all his pants were falling down , but these fit and stay up -LRB- Thank God -RRB-
 My husband loves the fit and the price.Great deal.You can dress them up or down!Look no further.Great looking jean , for the price .
 Bought these jeans for my husband . They fit very well and look nice . The shipment arrived on time . I was happy with my purchase .
 I ordered these jeans an exrta size longer becaause I wanted a high cuff . Got exactally that . Perfect !!! Now I 'm looking for a white pair
 Great black on black bootcut jeans . They have even gone back to adding two additional belt loops a feature that went away several years ago .
 Fits well , my husband loves them , quality control met , consistent sizing , and look good on . Will order more as needed
 My son wears a 36 Waist x 36 lenght which is very hard to find . The Levi 's Men 's 517 are about the only jeans he likes and these fit him perfectly . They were shipped very quickly and the price was excellent . They were a birthday gift and he loves them .
 The jeans were pre washed and fit just like I wanted . They were really softer than I expected . I would buy this product again .
 I was so happy with the quality and fit ; I ordered 3 more pairs ! I will be good on jeans for awhile . The price was good too .
 Great quality and a lower price , for me is like a tailored jean , I 'm happy with this product . No more to say thanks to all
 After numerous failed attempts at the 527 's on amazon I finally got a clue and got these jeans . They are PERFECT ... great fit ... weight ... etc. ... just like the jeans I wore in high school 20 years ago ... . I 'm already thinking about a second pair . The light rancher is the perfect color ... . As for the 527 's MADE IN BANGLADESH ... amazing they could ever bear the levis name ... perhaps they were counterfeit . Thanks amazon for my true and needed exchange . The original pair of jeans I ordered ... yes the 527 ... was complete trash . These 517 's are real jeans for real cowboys ... and I 'm not one ... but I do wear a ton of boots ...
 Exellent product
 Great jeans.Classical style.Low price.Wearing only jeans , levis always loved.Happy New Year!Amazon Forever!I love it .
 This hard to find style arrived on time . These classic jeans fit just the way they should . Going back for more colors .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Slim Fit Jean is leg looks like so long , . . but lap so tight but leg looks like so long . .
 My husband like it . . although I have to cut the length a little bit . . He said he may buy more in the future . . Hopefully they have shorter length then .
 They are Levis what more needs to be said ? Theyre the only jeans im buying from now on . They fit great and last 2-5 times longer than any other jeans ive bought .
 I use to wear the Levis low boot cut , but they discontinue to sell the color I want . After I give this one a try , I like it so much .
 If you know your size they fit . I do n't understand the reviews that say the sizes are wrong . Will buy again .
 was just what i expected ... very pleased with purchase . I like the fact that you can get 29 inseam . You can not get that in the store . No need to get them hemmed !
 his pants in overall line is still very good , sturdy , feels soft to the touch on the skin , the profile legendary cutting adds a touch of elegance , and even after several washings the fabric remains the same and does not shrink , the only thing I did not like the pants is that they have deteriorated the quality of the clips and metal buttons , formerly of copper and bronze , and now this are of aluminum and does not look good , however I recommend buying them are very good at the price .
 These came a little long , maybe an inch or two . Seeing as many others have noticed this is a problem with this fit , I suggest going one inseam size lower . I ordered a 30 '' and they fit more like a 31-32 '' . Other than the sizing , they are great jeans , and still look great on me . The boot cut allows the extra length to bunch up a little around the shoes , so you do n't really notice it . It actually looks good.I wish they sold these in a low rise version , as I do n't like hiking them up to where you might put dress pants or khakis . They stopped selling the 517 in a low rise though , so I 'm happy to wear them as is , great fit .
 My husband LOVES these jeans . They are a GREAT FIT , especially in the seat . The legs are n't too wide in the thighs and the bootcut bottom make a terrific silhouette . I like how he looks in them and he says they are REALLY COMFORTABLE . They look best in the darker color and are a good pair of `` dress jeans '' as well as versatile . We are ordering more . Ladies , get him these jeans !
 I 've worn Levi 's for over 50 years . From the days when you had to roll up the cuffs because they only had one length to super bells in the 70 's and now my favorite 517 's . They are always true to size and the workmanship is always excellent . The service at Amazon is always great too . What more can I say , I am one satisfied customer .
 These boot cut Levis have always been my favorite jeans . I had not had any in a while , so when my order arrived I immediately tried them on . I forgot how well they fit , and they are really stylish . Awesome . Will be ordering more .
 Authentic , just as described . Fast delivery . I am very satisfied with purchase . Smooth , one stop purchase . Husband will be very happy on Christmas day ! Thank you .
 My grandson loves these jeans , since he 's rather tall we were glad to find Levi 's makes great jeans in his size . Strange as it may seem , many brands of jeans do not come in a 34in length .
 As an active equestrian rider , and a woman of 59 years , I 'm ALWAYS looking for comfortable jeans that sit at my waist -- I do n't like women 's jeans at all - the fabric in women 's jeans seems flimsy , and the low-rise , hip-hugging jeans for riding or leisure wear feels uncomfortable . The men 's Levis and men 's Lee jeans are very comfortable , and they can handle my active life -- for me , men 's Levis 517 bootcut jeans have best variety for colors , and toughest quality in fabric .
 Nice one . . Boot Cut with nice fit.Ordered the Jeans with 29L but got it 3inch longer . So I had to do alteration , usually I order my pants with 29L and it fits perfect on me .
 Levis 517 's fit me better than any other jeans that I 've bought . Gon na stick with them . I wear a 38 waist , 36 inseam . Have bought several pair over the past six months from various places and they all fit the same . Good quality control !
 These were a secret gift for my brother-in-law . He keeps complaining that he must do laundry every other day because he only has one pair of work pants , but then he just will not go get more or let anyone buy him any ! So , I got the size off of the one pair of jeans he owns -LRB- laundry is at my house -RRB- and I bought several other pairs that were similarly worn . I sneak in a new pair about once a week and so far he has n't noticed that he now has three pair of work pants . When I slip in the new ones , I put them in the dirty clothes hamper he uses . I wonder if he knows his pants are multiplying yet ?
 They arived bfore time , APO adress , in Afghanistan ,1 week took it to arive here , im suprised , and they fit good , i dont hawe no words
 36 &#34; inseam jeans at a reasonable price are hard to find . I really like the fit of these jeans just wish there were other kinds in the same length .
 Just what I expected . After soaking and drying , the fit and feel was as anticipated ... just like the good , old days !!! -LRB- I would estimate that length and waist both shrunk by about one inch ... as Mama warned , some 50 years ago -RRB-
 i got two pairs for my husband . levis are the only thing that fit him right . They make him look like he has a butt !
 I like this product because it fits very well and is comfortable . I recommend it to others . Good for those who like to wear boots .
 I am happy with the jeans and how they fit , but usually when I get 517 's , they are really stiff and then I get to break them in . This pair was already like pre-washed , just differnt than what I am used to , but I still like them and will wear them . Maybe I have to look into differnt types and find exactly what I am looking for next time . Thank you
 I 've been wearing 517 's for a good , long time now , and I love 'em ! The problem is that most of my local stores that sell them -- and very few of them do -- price them highly and also drastically limit the selection compared to the more popular 501 's and 550 's . Additionally , these jeans are often skipped over when it comes to the big sales . Well , shopping for them on Amazon is a decision I should have made long ago . The price here is hard to beat.As for the jeans themselves , they are of the rugged quality that Levi 's is known for . They fit like the product photo shows
 Have had these jeans for a few weeks now & am very satisfied.The flair from the knee down is discrete and does not look like the 70 's bell-bottoms . The fit on top was precisely as marked . The length seems about 1/2 inch longer than sized on the 501 's . Was formerly utilizing 501 slim fit jeans but found that could not place them over motorcyle boots . The 501s were great for rainy rides , but look too much like a cowboy , when tucked into the boots .
 As always , good shopping at amazon.com . Its always a problem finding the right length jeans for me . I found that in this levi 517 Boot cut jean , it feels good to finally find a jean that is not too short . A fact that i would have loved to know before i bought this jeans , is the leg opening size . This jean is very tight around the thigh area . I would just like a bit more details on the product a next time round . Other than that , it always a good shopping experience on Amazon .
 The length and waist were perfect . The quality of Levi jeans was the same as they had always been , good
 I always had to keep pulling up my previous pairs of Levi 's -LRB- any model -RRB- because they only had FIVE belt loops . A key ring and cell phone are not that heavy . I remember growing up with Levi 's having SEVEN belt loops and a heavier canvas . I was pleasantly surprised to see the ` new ' Levi 's 517 now have seven belt loops again . I started to buy a different model , but they still only have the five loops.I just bought a couple of these pairs from Amazon . I did check online at Kohls and their current batch of 517 's still show 5 loops . I will have to wait until I go to the store to see if their stock has been updated . Kohls prices are higher than Amazon , but I will recheck when they go on sale . I still check Amazon first for almost all my purchases.Overall , I like my new Levi 's jeans . I will compare them with older ones to see if the canvas really is slightly thinner . Outsourcing manufacturing almost always results in poorer quality and non-standard sizing . It has 100 % results in putting Americans out of work . I try to buy American whenever I can -- hopefully it will catch on.There is another issue appearing after I washed my new jeans with my old ones . It should n't have made a difference , but the new ones are now covered with fine fluffy hairs . I will have to use a lint brush when I take them out of the dryer for now . Although it may just be a ` break in -- first washings ' issue.Overall , I rate these jeans 4 stars . I will have to wait for a few machine washings to see how the color holds up . I may be old fashioned , but buying jeans looking like they are 1/2 wore out or have holes in them is ` less than optimal ' .
 I ran around town to find my husband Levi 517 's in size 35x32 for Christmas . In the stores , there were stacks of all different sorts of Levi 's to go through . Finally I came home and ordered them through Amazon and received exactly what he wanted . These Levi 's fit perfectly and look great . Very happy they come in off size waists . Thank you for making my job easier and receiving nice fitting jeans .
 I 've grown up wearing Levi 's and in particular 517 's in my adult life . I do like that Levi has added additional belt loops in the past year or so . Over the years Levi has cut some corners in manufacturing , but not enough to discourage me from continuing to buy their stonewashed 517 's . I like the stonewashed jeans since they are ready to wear , unlike the rigid indigo Levi 's that have to be washed several times to soften them up.I am buying more and more items from Amazon for the free shipping and competitive prices . It just saves a lot of time going to a retailer only to find out they do n't have my size or what I want . Even with Amazon collecting California sales tax , I figure the time and gas saved from having to go to a retailer is well worth it .
 My wife thinks it 's funny that I rate my jeans with numbers , but , as a former 505 's man , I now prefer the 517 's 'cause ride my horses more and were my boots more ... plus , they just , plain feel good when they 're on me ...
 Who does n't love Levis ? These are great ! My son was happy on Christmas day and so were we . Happy Holidays !
 It is great to find the exact size , color , and fit you want in a Levi 's jean , and also get it on time .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean , Medium Stonewash , 38x29They fit perfectly . Will probably order more in a couple months .
 Needed a size that few brick & mortar stores keep in stock . Amazon had style I wanted in the size that I wanted at a good price !
 These blue jeans where a great color and a perfect fit . Glad I ordered them . They were a present for my son
 My husband has been wearing Levi 's since he was a teenager . They are the most durable jeans and he loves the boot cut .
 I 've been wearing these for years.They do tend to fade easily so wash them inside out and use a detergent product for black fabrics .
 I bought these as a gift for a friend who has worn this style for years . Good quality , good fit , good style .
 They fit just perfectly and I am very happy to not only get the bestdeal around but beat the sales tax . Good old Levi 's rigid , bootcut jeans have been my all-time favorite jeans my whole life , andI just turned 60 . Got 'em within a week , free shipping faster thanexpected , so that was cool , too . Amazon rules !
 The pants are great . I can not seem to find them in stores like Kohls or Target where I usually shop . I 'm not skinny as far as a skinny person goes but I have thinner legs than a lot of guys . These seem to be not as loose in the butt and thighs . I usually get the 505 's but they are cut a little bigger assuming tree trunk size legs . I have runners legs and these work . If you have big footballer legs , forget about it .
 Finally jeans that fit like the old Levis , these are the old quality heavy denim stuff not that wimpy pre-wash thin as paper junk denim . I would highly recommend these jeans to anyone who 's familiar with real Levis .
 Very easy shopping . I 'm familiar with the pants so it 's just a matter of price and convenience.Sitting at the desk for a few second beats driving to the store , finding out they do n't have the 517 in my size and driving back home . I 've always had trouble just finding the 517 at stores and shopping online sure makes things easier . The pants themselves are everything they 've always been , good fitting and tough.It 's nice to add the stonewash to my collection of darker denim so I do n't look the same every day.I was upprised how fast they came and that 's a big plus too .
 These jeans fit to size perfectly -LRB- for me -RRB- , are comfortable to wear , and have adequate material to reach a guy 's waist ... not hip-huggers . I 'll buy more of these ! Not a deal-breaker by any means but I would prefer them to not have the size label outside ... it seems Levi 's always does this .
 Amazon did not mentioned in the description that this pair of jeans is a Shrink-to-Fit fabric . No question on the quality . . it 's still an amazing jeans , the great Levi 's jeans , never goes out of style ... Take 31 '' waistline x 30 '' inseam if your size is 30 x 30 .
 Levi 's are always the best jeans around . Levi 's Boot Cut are the only kind my husband will wear . Always a good fit .
 Very high quality . Several pairs have consistent fit . Have bought and worn these 517 boot cut jeans for several years .
 These were ordered off Amazon when I could not find them locally . I found the pants and they are describer perfectly and fit exactly as I had wanted them to . I will buy more in the future because they were perfect .
 Completamente satisfecha con el producto , exactamente igual a lo que ofrecieron . LLego en el tiempo estimado que prometieron . Ninguna queja , volveria a comprar de nuevo .
 The Levi jeans were just like I expected . The fit was perfect and received them in just a few days . Thanks !!
 The quality of the denim is lighter , so the good fit disappears by the end of the day . Otherwise , I like 'em !
 Hubby dearest was so happy to find boot cut Levi jeans at Amazon as it seems most stores have quit carrying this style of jean . He likes to wear boot cut jeans and Levi jeans are his favorite brand.No complaints about the fit or wearability either . Ordered two more pairs of jeans today as he 's a happy camper.Recommend .
 Good deal on the jeans and speedy shipping . My first pair of boot cut jeans . My girl friend really likes them on me . I got the dark blue -LRB- rinse -RRB- . Fit good and comfortable .
 My skinny son is 54 years old and will not wear any other jeans - only 517 , boot cut Levi 's so I know what to buy for Christmas and Birthdays . I found a perfect fit for my skinny husband also .
 I ordered these jeansLevi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jeanfor a Christmas gift a short time before Christmas . I knew the size . I was somewhat concerned that I would not get them on time for Christmas The package came just before Christmas , and the jeans were exactly as pictured , nicely packaged -LRB- each pair separately enclosed in plastic bag -RRB- , the right size and color . I was very pleased , as was the recipient of the gift !
 The jeans were a Christmas gift and a style regularly worn by the recipient . They were a perfect fit . They are hard to find locally so we ordered from the Internet . The red tag on the back pocket did not say `` Levis '' and I have never seen this before . Is it significant ?
 Wow . These are great blue jeans , and they come in 38 long which is what he wears . HE wanted the boot cut , and a 34 waist was large enough . Usually he wears a 36 , , but I ordered 34 and they fit just right . Great looking , great price .
 Great product ... my dad was very pleased . He had not been able to find the 517 .
 These were a birthday gift for my son and I had them sent directly to him at college . He loved them and they fit great ! Good quality for the price . He liked the fit of the boot cut .
 These are great jeans for us gals , too , especially if you like to wear a true black color . I dress them up with a feminine camisole and heels , and have got many compliments on them .
 Exactly what my hubby wants . It 's difficult to find his size in our local stores . Very happy Amazon now has Levi 's in his size .
 I love my new bootcuts . I received them quickly , They fit perfectly . Thank you .
 I 've grown frustrated by the lack of good quality/reasonably priced jeans in the market today . At some point , the Levis brand started to suffer in terms of quality/value for the dollar . Do n't remember exactly when that happened , but I started to buy my jeans from Banana Republic . Over time , they stopped making the style I grew to rely on . This created a 7-10 stretch where I could n't seem to find a good pair of jeans . Most recently , I purchased a pair of Lucky jeans - ridiculously over priced . When those began to fail , I tried Levis again and bought these . For a third of the price of Lucky Jeans , these Levis boot-cut jeans are really nice . They have a really substantial feel/weight to them and I could n't be happier with the purchase . I was so pleased , I ended up buying a second pair .
 Levis 517 Boot Cut Jeans are just as advertized . Good fit and a perfect boot cut . I highly recommend them for anyone who needs boot cut jeans .
 If you have a problem with jeans bagging in the rear , then these jeans are for you ! They are a great fit and very comfortable ! My husband loves them !
 Well , its a good jean , everybody know the levi 's quality , the item arive in perfect conditions . . so nothing more to say . .
 Perfect fit , every time . 517 's are difficult for me to find locally , but buying on line thru Amazon is best for me .
 These are like they used to make them ! More belt loops , great fabric - love them ! Ca n't wait to order more of these !
 I was having a really hard time finding the boot cut Levis - no one seems to carry them anymore . These are just what I wanted . They look and fit good .
 Bought these for my husband and they fit true to size , maybe a little bit long but not so much that he wo n't wear them . He love them , they look good so I love them ! Great Pants !
 I ordered these jeans for my 16yo son & he really liked them . The only thing he would have preferred was a lower rise , but he 's wearing them without complaints . : -RRB-
 I bought 2 of these and man they are nice . I 'll admit the guy wearing the jean in the picture sold me . Like I went and look for all the style of Levi 's , and these attracted me the most . Although I would n't tuck in my shirt like that . But they sure look good with some chucks and or casual boots and a dress shirt , with a silver wrist watch , and a pair of shades . They are heavy , and for me kinda tight even though jean of a different brand and style with the same size , fit me perfectly . I do n't know I guess it the way they are made . But for the look , I 'll take the pain any day , yes these jean are so tight mostly in my thigh area and waist , that I do get a little discomfort pain in my lower back . I guess it the way they are design and the heaviness of the jean . Of course I am in the process of getting in shape again . So with time , these will be perfect . I do like to sag a little , but as of right now I ca n't with these . Until I lose some of that belly fat I accumulated over the years .
 These are the jeans I always buy , they are a great comfortable fit . It is also great that Amazon stocks the size I need , it 's impossible to get from the shops .
 Sent me what I wanted . 15 more 12 more 11 more 9 more 7 more 5 more 3 more done
 This is a very good price for this product , it 's the second one I 've ordered for my son .
 I love being able to find the 517 's on line and not having to run all over town for the style and size I need .
 If you promise not to tell anybody , I wear lined jeans from eddie bauer or llbean when it gets cooler . I wear these when it gets warmer . True to size , do n't shrink too much .
 These were a secret gift for my brother-in-law . He keeps complaining that he must do laundry every other day because he only has one pair of work pants , but then he just will not go get more or let anyone buy him any ! So , I got the size off of the one pair of jeans he owns -LRB- laundry is at my house -RRB- and I bought several other pairs that were similarly worn . I sneak in a new pair about once a week and so far he has n't noticed that he now has three pair of work pants . When I slip in the new ones , I put them in the dirty clothes hamper he uses . I wonder if he knows his pants are multiplying yet ?
 They arived bfore time , APO adress , in Afghanistan ,1 week took it to arive here , im suprised , and they fit good , i dont hawe no words
 36 &#34; inseam jeans at a reasonable price are hard to find . I really like the fit of these jeans just wish there were other kinds in the same length .
 Just what I expected . After soaking and drying , the fit and feel was as anticipated ... just like the good , old days !!! -LRB- I would estimate that length and waist both shrunk by about one inch ... as Mama warned , some 50 years ago -RRB-
 I am happy with the jeans and how they fit , but usually when I get 517 's , they are really stiff and then I get to break them in . This pair was already like pre-washed , just differnt than what I am used to , but I still like them and will wear them . Maybe I have to look into differnt types and find exactly what I am looking for next time . Thank you
 I 've been wearing 517 's for a good , long time now , and I love 'em ! The problem is that most of my local stores that sell them -- and very few of them do -- price them highly and also drastically limit the selection compared to the more popular 501 's and 550 's . Additionally , these jeans are often skipped over when it comes to the big sales . Well , shopping for them on Amazon is a decision I should have made long ago . The price here is hard to beat.As for the jeans themselves , they are of the rugged quality that Levi 's is known for . They fit like the product photo shows
 Have had these jeans for a few weeks now & am very satisfied.The flair from the knee down is discrete and does not look like the 70 's bell-bottoms . The fit on top was precisely as marked . The length seems about 1/2 inch longer than sized on the 501 's . Was formerly utilizing 501 slim fit jeans but found that could not place them over motorcyle boots . The 501s were great for rainy rides , but look too much like a cowboy , when tucked into the boots .
 As always , good shopping at amazon.com . Its always a problem finding the right length jeans for me . I found that in this levi 517 Boot cut jean , it feels good to finally find a jean that is not too short . A fact that i would have loved to know before i bought this jeans , is the leg opening size . This jean is very tight around the thigh area . I would just like a bit more details on the product a next time round . Other than that , it always a good shopping experience on Amazon .
 The length and waist were perfect . The quality of Levi jeans was the same as they had always been , good
 I always had to keep pulling up my previous pairs of Levi 's -LRB- any model -RRB- because they only had FIVE belt loops . A key ring and cell phone are not that heavy . I remember growing up with Levi 's having SEVEN belt loops and a heavier canvas . I was pleasantly surprised to see the ` new ' Levi 's 517 now have seven belt loops again . I started to buy a different model , but they still only have the five loops.I just bought a couple of these pairs from Amazon . I did check online at Kohls and their current batch of 517 's still show 5 loops . I will have to wait until I go to the store to see if their stock has been updated . Kohls prices are higher than Amazon , but I will recheck when they go on sale . I still check Amazon first for almost all my purchases.Overall , I like my new Levi 's jeans . I will compare them with older ones to see if the canvas really is slightly thinner . Outsourcing manufacturing almost always results in poorer quality and non-standard sizing . It has 100 % results in putting Americans out of work . I try to buy American whenever I can -- hopefully it will catch on.There is another issue appearing after I washed my new jeans with my old ones . It should n't have made a difference , but the new ones are now covered with fine fluffy hairs . I will have to use a lint brush when I take them out of the dryer for now . Although it may just be a ` break in -- first washings ' issue.Overall , I rate these jeans 4 stars . I will have to wait for a few machine washings to see how the color holds up . I may be old fashioned , but buying jeans looking like they are 1/2 wore out or have holes in them is ` less than optimal ' .
 I ran around town to find my husband Levi 517 's in size 35x32 for Christmas . In the stores , there were stacks of all different sorts of Levi 's to go through . Finally I came home and ordered them through Amazon and received exactly what he wanted . These Levi 's fit perfectly and look great . Very happy they come in off size waists . Thank you for making my job easier and receiving nice fitting jeans .
 I 've grown up wearing Levi 's and in particular 517 's in my adult life . I do like that Levi has added additional belt loops in the past year or so . Over the years Levi has cut some corners in manufacturing , but not enough to discourage me from continuing to buy their stonewashed 517 's . I like the stonewashed jeans since they are ready to wear , unlike the rigid indigo Levi 's that have to be washed several times to soften them up.I am buying more and more items from Amazon for the free shipping and competitive prices . It just saves a lot of time going to a retailer only to find out they do n't have my size or what I want . Even with Amazon collecting California sales tax , I figure the time and gas saved from having to go to a retailer is well worth it .
 Nice one . . Boot Cut with nice fit.Ordered the Jeans with 29L but got it 3inch longer . So I had to do alteration , usually I order my pants with 29L and it fits perfect on me .
 Levis 517 's fit me better than any other jeans that I 've bought . Gon na stick with them . I wear a 38 waist , 36 inseam . Have bought several pair over the past six months from various places and they all fit the same . Good quality control !
 BASTANTE BIEN . BUENA CALIDAD DEL PANTALON . ME QUEDO MUY BIEN . TANTO EL LARGO COMO EN CINTURA . EXCELENTE COMPRA A UDS . GRACIAS .
 The jeans are a good deep color . Wish they were n't quite as thin as jean material seems to be getting , but seems they are all like that now . Overall a good pair of jeans.These are hard to find in 36x36 , so I 'm glad Amazon carries them .
 Perfect fit right out of the box . Started wearing immediately , stitches , pockets , zipper perfectly in place . Survived several washes good as new .
 Good price , perfect quality . Very good model for young and old-aged people . Gorgeous color . Classic zipper . I 'm satisfied ! I recommend to buy it .
 These jeans fit me very well and look good . One thing I noticed however is that the denim has a more coarse feeling compared to other Levi 's jeans . I would buy these again .
 IL TELL YOU I HAVE BEEN WEARING LEVI 'S FOR YEARS ON END AND THE BEST DEAL I GOT ON THESE GREAT JEANS WAS FROM MY FAVORITE STORE AMAZON
 These are the first jeans in a while that actually fit my waist size , inseam and the leg openings are perfect .
 These jeans fit well but the denim seems less hefty than the denim of the same 517s from 5 years ago .
 I received my pants very quickly . I was concerned that my size would be too short for boots . I was pleasantly surprised that the designer was thoughtful about the shape and length for this item &#34; after &#34; several washings . Pants are about 1/2 inch longer than the average pants which make them perfect for cowboy boots . Pants are also very comfortable . JCD
 Noticed that they even have an extra pair of belt loops compared to my previous order . They are sturdy & dependable .
 The jeans were great ! The price was right , they were delivered in a timely fashion , and I lost a few lbs to get in them and I look good . lol . I recommend this company .
 These are the only jeans my son likes . He is tall and I have trouble finding his size in local stores and I could not find a better price .
 The jean came very quickly . They were the proper color , size , and cut . The packaging was excellent , and so was the quality of the jeans .
 Perfect price and fit for my husband . I would recommend this jean to any &#34; baby boomer &#34; who loves boot cut jeans.The jean has not changed at all good quality material and the right color . Thank you .
 This pair of Levi 's fits perfectly and the indigo color is the same as the Levi 's I wore back in the day !
 I gave these Jeans to my daughter 's friend for Christmas and he really likes them.He is real thin and wears motorcycle boots.He likes how they fit and loves the boot cut.He especially likes the rugged material .
 his pants in overall line is still very good , sturdy , feels soft to the touch on the skin , the profile legendary cutting adds a touch of elegance , and even after several washings the fabric remains the same and does not shrink , the only thing I did not like the pants is that they have deteriorated the quality of the clips and metal buttons , formerly of copper and bronze , and now this are of aluminum and does not look good , however I recommend buying them are very good at the price .
 These came a little long , maybe an inch or two . Seeing as many others have noticed this is a problem with this fit , I suggest going one inseam size lower . I ordered a 30 '' and they fit more like a 31-32 '' . Other than the sizing , they are great jeans , and still look great on me . The boot cut allows the extra length to bunch up a little around the shoes , so you do n't really notice it . It actually looks good.I wish they sold these in a low rise version , as I do n't like hiking them up to where you might put dress pants or khakis . They stopped selling the 517 in a low rise though , so I 'm happy to wear them as is , great fit .
 I have always appreciated the fit and quality of Levi jeans . The boot cut has a closer fit around the knee with comfortable room in the hips and waist . What Levi Strauss needs to understand is that there is a huge population of men out there that has a 31 inch inseam . Men between 5 ' 9 &#34; and 6 ' fall into this size range . My growth did not stop at 30 &#34; inseam , and did not make it to 32 &#34; . So I either buy high water jeans that show my socks , or I let the cuffs drag the floor which signicantly reduces the life of the jeans . I liked the fit enough that I spent an additional $ 10 to get them hemmed to 31 .
 product arrived as expected on time , the product was as expected and the quality was as you 'd expect to find in a brick & mortar store .
 Great fitting . I usually buy the 527 style but they did n't have black in that style . Ordered a 517 instead and love the fitting .
 The fit and look are great and I saved a few dollars . Will purchase more when the price is right
 love this jeans , the fabric is really good and the cut is impecable . it is original and the communication was really easy , i recieved really fast .
 My order arrived in a timely fashion , they fit good and look great ... I 'm gon na get a couple more pairs .
 Levi 's 517 ` sThese Levi 's were the perfect fit . I like the fact that they are pre rinsed , which makes the fabric softer .
 Many of us do n't want to wear our Levi 's half way up our bellies . 517s are the best answer for that !
 A well tried and true blue jean that I 've been wearing for decades . The fit , finish , and quality is a good as or better than ever .
 These seemed a bit darker in person than pictured but they were a great pair of jeans for my husband . This is his favorite style of jeans and he needed a new pair of &#34; dressy jeans . &#34; Same great jeans as in the past .
 All the Levi 's I purchased for my 16 year old son were ` made to fit ' ! From the straight to boot cut , they all were a perfect fit for his personal taste . They are well made and very stylish .
 Great jeans , great price , speedy delivery as promised ! Will definitely be ordering them again since my son is so tall and slim and this is one of the only places I can find his size .
 Great basic jeans in hard to find sizes . Not much to say otherwise . They have washed up well and held up well for my long and lanky teen .
 Jeans are a little tight in the thighs for my husband . It did n't come with packing slip so I 'm hoping I can return them !
 I 've always wanted a ` black 527 ' but found out I could only get that in rigid black.I decided to try 517 n whao I might just decide to continue with 517 even with other colors.Just the perfect fit I love .
 Is exactly what i was looking for . . i being using this model for years , and this pair of pant are excellent
 I am a creature of habit . Being of slim build I have found the 517 Boot cut to be the perfect jean for me . I also know my size so the fit was great as received . This is not always the case when ordering over the Internet . Service was great delivered on time as expected .
 These are the best jeans Levis has to offer in my opinion . They are not light and flimsy like some jeans Levis are making these days . The medium stonewash is a great even color . They do n't look faded on the seat and thighs or dingly and dirty like so many jeans do . These jeans are rugged , comfortable and last a long , long time . On top of that they look great . These are the only jeans I will buy .
 These jeans are everything they say they are . We will definately order these jeans again when the time comes . Thanks !
 100 % recomended , i have no doubt that i am going to buy another , it is really regular fit and boot cut
 This is the only jean my husband wears . He has the hardest time finding 36x29 . This is a perfect fit for him . When he needs more I will return to amazon .
 I finally found a pear of jeans that my wife said they look good on me and after being washed still fits great
 Great fit for my long legs ! Hard to find jeans my size but Levi 's always comes through for me ! a
 i got two pairs for my husband . levis are the only thing that fit him right . They make him look like he has a butt !
 I like this product because it fits very well and is comfortable . I recommend it to others . Good for those who like to wear boots .
 Finally found levis that were the correct size , if they are still available I will order more in the future
 Great pants . I wish there was a size 33 by 35 . I always have a hard time with pants size . I can get a length 34 , which shrink after a wash or a 36 that drags because there too long . But there is no length 35 in pants , so I do n't have much of choice .
 Excellent product the product I come very well and it is what was waiting of , I come in time , good
 I bought they for my boyfriend who had lost a bit of weight and all his pants were falling down , but these fit and stay up -LRB- Thank God -RRB-
 My husband loves the fit and the price.Great deal.You can dress them up or down!Look no further.Great looking jean , for the price .
 Bought these jeans for my husband . They fit very well and look nice . The shipment arrived on time . I was happy with my purchase .
 I love these jeans . For me they are perfect . Long enough to wear with or without boots and the fit is not too tight . How can you go wrong with Levi 's ?
 I got what I ordered promptly . I wish I had ordered a different color but -- my bad . No complaints . What else can I say ?
 The jeans was just perfect , the material , size and colour , nothing to complain about , and great timing too.They fit really well , and amazon 's size chart was very helpfull .
 Style & size stayed true since the last time I bought a pair , after gettingLevi 's Men 's 527 Low Rise Boot Cut Jeanthat are nothing like they used to be that 's all a shopper can ask .
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut . Black 42 waist / 30 length . If you are short , stocky and have a big butt . These pants are perfect . They wo n't bunch up at your fat knees and they will last a long time before the zipper explodes . I suggest you buy the next size up because they will shrink after 6 months of washing , drying and severe stretching in the seat area . Great pants .
 MY FAVORITE JEANS FOR 25 YEARS . I HAVE WORN MAINLY 501 MODEL , SO I READ MANY REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING THESE 517 JEANS.AFTER THINKING FOR A LONG TIME I DECIDED TO BUY ONE SIZE BIGGER THAN USUAL . IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE.THEY ARE JUST FINE , BLACK COLOR AND ZIPPER FLY WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DETAIL FOR ME !
 My husband 's body type includes slight pot belly and skinny hips and thighs . Almost impossible to find pants that fit well without being either too tight in the belly or looking baggy in the seat and thighs . He used to wear Levi 's Action Jeans which were boot cut jeans with slight stretch in fabric and a slight crease in the legs . These jeans always looked and fit great ; real snappy . Unfortunately they 're no longer available . Then went to wearing David Taylor Flexjeans from Sears which were almost as good . However , he now find that although Sears still sells jeans by this name , they are no longer the same . They are now made in China and are made from a crappy fabric and no longer fit the same . In desperation , he started looking thru available Levis products and found Levi 's 517 . Advertised as slim in seat and thighs . He did not expect much but was pleasantly surprised to find that they are indeed somewhat slim in the seat and thighs , even though the pants he bought had a waist size slightly larger than minimally necessary , thankfully allowing him to breathe . Bottom line was that he was very happy that these pants are not so tight in the waist that its hard to breathe , but still slim enough in the seat and thighs that they do n't look like old man 's jeans . Just wish they had the snappy look of the old Levi 's Action Jeans .
 I bought a pair of these in 29X34 and they are great . Fit perfect , really like the cut , lighter weight material but not too light , should hold up well . Just wish they would reduce the size of the internal tag -- I 've actually had to tuck it back into the pants a few times after putting them on !
 Great black on black bootcut jeans . They have even gone back to adding two additional belt loops a feature that went away several years ago .
 Fits well , my husband loves them , quality control met , consistent sizing , and look good on . Will order more as needed
 My son wears a 36 Waist x 36 lenght which is very hard to find . The Levi 's Men 's 517 are about the only jeans he likes and these fit him perfectly . They were shipped very quickly and the price was excellent . They were a birthday gift and he loves them .
 The jeans were pre washed and fit just like I wanted . They were really softer than I expected . I would buy this product again .
 I was so happy with the quality and fit ; I ordered 3 more pairs ! I will be good on jeans for awhile . The price was good too .
 Great quality and a lower price , for me is like a tailored jean , I 'm happy with this product . No more to say thanks to all
 After numerous failed attempts at the 527 's on amazon I finally got a clue and got these jeans . They are PERFECT ... great fit ... weight ... etc. ... just like the jeans I wore in high school 20 years ago ... . I 'm already thinking about a second pair . The light rancher is the perfect color ... . As for the 527 's MADE IN BANGLADESH ... amazing they could ever bear the levis name ... perhaps they were counterfeit . Thanks amazon for my true and needed exchange . The original pair of jeans I ordered ... yes the 527 ... was complete trash . These 517 's are real jeans for real cowboys ... and I 'm not one ... but I do wear a ton of boots ...
 Exellent product
 My body was made for Levi 's brand jeans , and I 'd worn through a couple of pairs . I bought duplicate black 517s - soft but not washed out , dark , with a predictable fit . They are my new favorites . The process went smoothly . Who knew I 'd be buying clothes online ?
 I ordered these for Christmas for my 6 ' 2 '' grandson who had grown out of all his pants after checking stores and finding his size is almost impossible to find . They were perfect and he loved them .
 The Levi 's 517 Boot Cut were purchused as a replacement of the wrong ones bought at a local store , These ordered & delivered ; I was told fit greatly before & after ; washThe price for my buying , totaled out a nuff less even with shipping to come fromamazon , rather than a store , even on sale after my tax & shipping ; -LRB- as a late gift -RRB- Theonly guestion I got was about , they did not have the Levi 's cardboard shelf tagswe see on Jean 's in store .
 I love my levis . I was unaware they came in black . I bought a blue pair and black pair , Ilove them
 Just as described ! Fit & look exactly what he needed and wanted . And he said I could n't find this product ... LOLThanks !!! The Wife wrote the review ...
 These jeans fit great . The boot cut gives a good look without being sloppy . My husband looks hot in them .
 Got these as a gift for my brother , and they are the true blue classic with a great slim shape . Perfect `` date night '' jeans .
 These are the only jeans my husband will wear and we could not find them ANYWHERE . When i found them here i was happily suprised with the discount price and they look great . Would buy again from this seller .
 Excellent transaction on hard to find size and style Levi Jeans.Reasonable price and quick shipping.I 'm very pleased with this purchase !
 jeans were shipped quick , arrived in good shape the medium stonewash has that worn look most people want , I am pleased with the purchase .
 I 've been wearing these for years.They do tend to fade easily so wash them inside out and use a detergent product for black fabrics .
 I bought these as a gift for a friend who has worn this style for years . Good quality , good fit , good style .
 Great jeans.Classical style.Low price.Wearing only jeans , levis always loved.Happy New Year!Amazon Forever!I love it .
 This hard to find style arrived on time . These classic jeans fit just the way they should . Going back for more colors .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Slim Fit Jean is leg looks like so long , . . but lap so tight but leg looks like so long . .
 My husband like it . . although I have to cut the length a little bit . . He said he may buy more in the future . . Hopefully they have shorter length then .
 They are Levis what more needs to be said ? Theyre the only jeans im buying from now on . They fit great and last 2-5 times longer than any other jeans ive bought .
 I use to wear the Levis low boot cut , but they discontinue to sell the color I want . After I give this one a try , I like it so much .
 If you know your size they fit . I do n't understand the reviews that say the sizes are wrong . Will buy again .
 was just what i expected ... very pleased with purchase . I like the fact that you can get 29 inseam . You can not get that in the store . No need to get them hemmed !
 Fit well at the waist and look good . Last a lot longer than most most jeans and seem to get more and more comfortable the more you wear them .
 These are great jeans , they do tend to run a little big , both on length and waist . The color was a lot more bluer then it looks in the picture , so be weary of that it . It was too country , and I needed more rock and roll , if you know what I mean.Pros
 I was a bit concerned about this purchase . My husband likes the boot cut style and that was an excellent choice for my purchase . I have zero compliants other then I wish I 'd bought more !
 they were exactly what we were looking for . the orginal 517 , these are my hubby 's most favoritie , they also hold up better than the other styles seem to
 Will have to wash several times for them to fit . I buy this size all the time from other retailers and they are n't this big . Like the color and the style . They just run big I guess . Mainly in the length . Would buy again , just a smaller size .
 The fit is nice , the color is holding up through the wash . I am glad they have different sizes then the stores . Very hard to find 33 x 36 !
 I like the way these jeans fit.The are also comfortable.The ones I have purchased previously have been durable .
 d e m a r a v i l l a e s t e m o d e l o muy bueno
 Very high quality . Several pairs have consistent fit . Have bought and worn these 517 boot cut jeans for several years .
 My husband LOVES these jeans . They are a GREAT FIT , especially in the seat . The legs are n't too wide in the thighs and the bootcut bottom make a terrific silhouette . I like how he looks in them and he says they are REALLY COMFORTABLE . They look best in the darker color and are a good pair of `` dress jeans '' as well as versatile . We are ordering more . Ladies , get him these jeans !
 I 've worn Levi 's for over 50 years . From the days when you had to roll up the cuffs because they only had one length to super bells in the 70 's and now my favorite 517 's . They are always true to size and the workmanship is always excellent . The service at Amazon is always great too . What more can I say , I am one satisfied customer .
 These boot cut Levis have always been my favorite jeans . I had not had any in a while , so when my order arrived I immediately tried them on . I forgot how well they fit , and they are really stylish . Awesome . Will be ordering more .
 Authentic , just as described . Fast delivery . I am very satisfied with purchase . Smooth , one stop purchase . Husband will be very happy on Christmas day ! Thank you .
 My grandson loves these jeans , since he 's rather tall we were glad to find Levi 's makes great jeans in his size . Strange as it may seem , many brands of jeans do not come in a 34in length .
 As an active equestrian rider , and a woman of 59 years , I 'm ALWAYS looking for comfortable jeans that sit at my waist -- I do n't like women 's jeans at all - the fabric in women 's jeans seems flimsy , and the low-rise , hip-hugging jeans for riding or leisure wear feels uncomfortable . The men 's Levis and men 's Lee jeans are very comfortable , and they can handle my active life -- for me , men 's Levis 517 bootcut jeans have best variety for colors , and toughest quality in fabric .
 i traveled 80 miles one day looking for the jeans i like with no luck , it did make for a nice bike ride though ! then i went online looking and i found what i was looking for at amozon these jeans are hard to get in my hometown!Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut JeansWhat a nice pair of rugged jeans . And I got them so FAST !! Thanks again.Roxann Hill
 Good product , on time and as shown in Amazon.But ... years ago , ordering the same # jean and the same size always brought the exact same fit and look . Lately , the same length , for instance , some times is a bit too long -LRB- can be fixed -RRB- or a bit too short -LRB- bad news -RRB- . The price to be paid for savings by manufacturing offshore . Lets see if with the crisis we return to the memorable `` MADE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ''
 What can I say ? They are Levis . Perfect fit , excellent quality , and the most impressive thing was the price . Unbelievable !
 a la medida , tabla de medidas excelente ...
 The only problem was I had was that I had to have them hemmed 2 &#34; so as not to walk on the cuff . I would have ordered them shorter but they were not offered in the waist size I needed . The waist fit perfect and having them hemmed was not that big of a deal . It coast me $ 12.00 to have them hemmed .
 These jeans come washed so they are soft , supple and ready to wear . They are pre-shrunk so order the size you wear . I choose boot-cut jeans because I wear 12 '' - shaft western boots . Levies are the only jeans I wear because they fit well , look good , and get better with age .
 These jeans are perfect for the guy who wants to wear boots and not look like a geek or a thug . Just the right combination of loose and fitted .
 This is my first pair of Levi 517 's and I have to say I am very impressed . They sit on my natural waist -LRB- not low-rise like the 527 's -RRB- , and are fitted in the seat and thigh , and then flare out below the knee to fall on the boot . I 'm 6 ' 3 '' 190lbs and have a 36 waist and 34 inseam and it fit perfectly . Hard to find jeans these days that sit on the waist ... I 'm not a fan of the low-rise look or feel , so these jeans were a great find .
 Came to Amazon to order these jeans for my husband since no one ever has his size , 36x36 . I was pleasantly surprised because I did order two of these in different colors , Rancher Light and Rinse , both of which were the perfect colors . Perfect light colored jean and perfect dark colored jean . My husband and I are very hard to fit in jeans and tops so when something works we often get multiples , the problem however is that sometimes we buy the exact same thing in a different color and they fit totally different . Not these ! These jeans were great and the same fit ! Some people might not be able to appreciate that as much as I , but I was very grateful . It was a risk I had to take since his size is so common , but with free returns I had to take advantage . The boot leg is also very subtle but incredibly flattering . He does wear boots but of course they are n't necessary . I would say they are very true to size and great quality . They are currently his `` good jeans '' ... . that is until he `` accidentally '' wears them to go work in the garage . But when that happens , because it will , I will be back to purchase more ! By the way he is just over 6 ' 3 '' about 230-240lbs .
 The jeans were a Christmas gift and a style regularly worn by the recipient . They were a perfect fit . They are hard to find locally so we ordered from the Internet . The red tag on the back pocket did not say `` Levis '' and I have never seen this before . Is it significant ?
 Wow . These are great blue jeans , and they come in 38 long which is what he wears . HE wanted the boot cut , and a 34 waist was large enough . Usually he wears a 36 , , but I ordered 34 and they fit just right . Great looking , great price .
 I bought two pairs in two orders - both were perfect - exactly as I expected . On time . Good buy at a decent price .
 These jeans are tough but good looking and fit well . Amazon 's price is great , they are a good value for the money , and we always get prompt delivery and easy return if size is not right .
 the product is excellente , but needs to be taggedcorrectly , I order 34x30 tag say so , but real size was36x32 try buying them from differet source , and same thing never can get athe right size until i took a mesuring tape to the store and mesure before buing them !!
 I love those Jeans . . nice shape and denim . I ordered different colors from this pant and I love them all . it is comfortable , and have a nice leg openning that falls around the boot .
 I have been wearing 517 's for as long as I can remember . They fit perfectly and have remained unchanged for years .
 These boot cut jeans by my favorite jeans maker are exactly what I needed.When I ordered my Harley Davidson boots , I needed pants for when I wear them and these ones are the only ones that fit on the outside where others ca n't . Shopping local yields nothing like these , just junk not worth the money.Quality is what I 've come to expect from Levi 's , outstanding with fit absolutely perfect.More orders coming soon for these.Shipping was prompt , making this buyer very happy.Thank you to everyone for helping this lonely guy that hardly can get out to shop by bringing them to me.Again , THANK YOU VERY MUCH !!
 I thought these were more on the casual side , but after putting them on , they can pull off a nice look . Very comfy , one day to break in . No frays , quality zipper . Dimensions were perfect . Overall color is a shade or two darker than in the picture . Awesome , new favorite pair .
 Levis 517 Boot Cut Jeans are just as advertized . Good fit and a perfect boot cut . I highly recommend them for anyone who needs boot cut jeans .
 It 's a very good pant for my husband . Nothing too special or fancy ; he is very satisfied because he got what he expected
 execelente producto muy buena calidad , el pantalon vino en un excelente empaque y llego super rapido deverdad no tengo quejas lo recomiendo
 He looks hot in them , thanks ! What more can I say ? They did n't stay on for very long ... ca n't share any more details .
 I was somewhat hesitant to order Levi 's online but I could n't be happier with this order ! The jeans are exactly as described and fit perfectly . They are genuine Levi 's and are of the highest quality - not seconds . I ca n't recommend this seller highly enough .
 They 're good sellers and the product is very good , I like so much this jean . Ellos son muy buenos vendedores , el producto llego rapido a mis manos y era el esperado , los recomiendo ampliamente .
 I wear Levi jeans every day . Levi 's are the only jeans I will wear.I have worn Levi jeans for the past twenty -LRB- 20 -RRB- years ... or longer.Levi jeans are great ... in fact , i 'm wearin 'em right now ...
 Finally figured out what cut and size I like , but the only place I can find them is the internet . Great pants .
 These were ordered off Amazon when I could not find them locally . I found the pants and they are describer perfectly and fit exactly as I had wanted them to . I will buy more in the future because they were perfect .
 Completamente satisfecha con el producto , exactamente igual a lo que ofrecieron . LLego en el tiempo estimado que prometieron . Ninguna queja , volveria a comprar de nuevo .
 The Levi jeans were just like I expected . The fit was perfect and received them in just a few days . Thanks !!
 The quality of the denim is lighter , so the good fit disappears by the end of the day . Otherwise , I like 'em !
 Hubby dearest was so happy to find boot cut Levi jeans at Amazon as it seems most stores have quit carrying this style of jean . He likes to wear boot cut jeans and Levi jeans are his favorite brand.No complaints about the fit or wearability either . Ordered two more pairs of jeans today as he 's a happy camper.Recommend .
 Good deal on the jeans and speedy shipping . My first pair of boot cut jeans . My girl friend really likes them on me . I got the dark blue -LRB- rinse -RRB- . Fit good and comfortable .
 My skinny son is 54 years old and will not wear any other jeans - only 517 , boot cut Levi 's so I know what to buy for Christmas and Birthdays . I found a perfect fit for my skinny husband also .
 I ordered these jeansLevi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jeanfor a Christmas gift a short time before Christmas . I knew the size . I was somewhat concerned that I would not get them on time for Christmas The package came just before Christmas , and the jeans were exactly as pictured , nicely packaged -LRB- each pair separately enclosed in plastic bag -RRB- , the right size and color . I was very pleased , as was the recipient of the gift !
 It 's very good ! 100 % cottonThe higher rise sits comfortably at the waist.A fit you want from a brand you trustFit width & length ; !
 non common size request was delivered promply before Christmas . My son was very happy with the fit and color .
 Great product ... my dad was very pleased . He had not been able to find the 517 .
 These were a birthday gift for my son and I had them sent directly to him at college . He loved them and they fit great ! Good quality for the price . He liked the fit of the boot cut .
 These are great jeans for us gals , too , especially if you like to wear a true black color . I dress them up with a feminine camisole and heels , and have got many compliments on them .
 Exactly what my hubby wants . It 's difficult to find his size in our local stores . Very happy Amazon now has Levi 's in his size .
 I love my new bootcuts . I received them quickly , They fit perfectly . Thank you .
 I 've grown frustrated by the lack of good quality/reasonably priced jeans in the market today . At some point , the Levis brand started to suffer in terms of quality/value for the dollar . Do n't remember exactly when that happened , but I started to buy my jeans from Banana Republic . Over time , they stopped making the style I grew to rely on . This created a 7-10 stretch where I could n't seem to find a good pair of jeans . Most recently , I purchased a pair of Lucky jeans - ridiculously over priced . When those began to fail , I tried Levis again and bought these . For a third of the price of Lucky Jeans , these Levis boot-cut jeans are really nice . They have a really substantial feel/weight to them and I could n't be happier with the purchase . I was so pleased , I ended up buying a second pair .
 I like this style and they are getting very hard to find . The price here was the best I found , got in a timely manner . I 'm happy with my purchase .
 Purchased these jeans for my husband . They have a nice fit and look very good on . No baggy butt like the relaxed fit jeans .
 I usually have a hard time finding good bootcut jeans with the right fit in the retail stores . If the color/wash/fabric is right , the size isnt . If the size is right , the fit is too loose at the seat and thighs . Now that my favorite pair of jeans is past its prime , I started looking for a new pair to replace it . After hunting all stores in and around my area and trying all available bootcuts in my size , I was very disappointed . That is , until I found a pair of Levi 's 517 Blue Ox in the local Macy 's store . This was the first bootcut I found in the last 3 years that fit me perfectly . Since I already had a pair of jeans that was of a very similar color , I came online and started looking for the correct color in that fit . Unfortunately , it wasnt that easy finding one online . Kohls , Dillards and others had Levi 's 517s , but they werent the same ones I saw in the store . Apart from Macys and Amazon , no other site -LRB- including Levi 's own site -RRB- had the same fit in Rancher Light color I was looking for . I could have ordered at Macys website , but my past experience with Amazon was stellar and so it my first choice . Even then I was a little skeptical if the photos were close to how the jeans looked in reality . Since amazon had a free returns on this one , I went ahead with the order . The product , as always with Amazon , came 6 days ahead of their estimated delivery date . The jeans is , in fact , very close to the pictures on the website and the fit is PERFECT !! Thanks to Levi 's for the perfect color and fit and KUDOS to amazon for the perfect shopping experience !
 Finally Levi went back to 7 belt loops instead of the five . Makes a big difference for those of us that work for a living .
 I bought the 517 as I prefer this cut to any other one of the Levi 's catalog , I place it even above the so famous 501 . I 'm fully satisfied
 I love these jeans . The wash and fit are great . That being said , they did arrive with a hole in the seat and the seam is a little crooked on the inside left leg . I really do n't care though because they fit so good .
 It is hard to find male , black , slim fit , boot cut jeans . Believe me I searched many places both on-line and local retail outlets . Finally I found these on Amazon and they were just right . Great fit , looks good , and the price was reasonable . I highly recommend them .
 We will take these to alterations but they were about 5 inches too long . Otherwise they are very nice .
 True to size , did n't shrink , and minimal wrinkling . Love the variety of sizing - son is tall and thin , and hard to fit , but Levis 517 made it happen !
 I ordered these jeans an exrta size longer becaause I wanted a high cuff . Got exactally that . Perfect !!! Now I 'm looking for a white pair
 Well , they 're Levi 's . There you go . Best jeans on the market . Last forever and fit great . The black does fade to gray quicker than I would like , but that 's probably because I wear only black , all the time . So ...
 I have worn Levi jenas for the last 16years , i am relatively tall guy and seldom get my size in the store , Amazon provides me my size and then quality as well .
 Purchased two pairs of Levi 's Boot Cut Jeans for my husband , the Jeans are very hard to find in the stores . Since my husband is tall , it is hard to find 36x36 .
 These pants are very well put together and I am a big fan of Levi 's pants durability which is what prompted me to purchase these .
 I am a woman but men 's jeans fit me better . These are very comfortable . My jeans do NOT get hung up on my boots as they do with jeans that are not boot cut .
 todo salio perfecto , tanto el envio como el paquete recibido , estan esplendidas , la hora de llegada fue la establecida por el vendedor
 Quality jeans , but not made in the USA.Arrived quickly and each pair were individually bagged in plastic.Good fit , for me .
 Good quality but I wish I had done more research on the colors . Ordered rigid because of the look online however the denim itself is rigid .
 Yes , these Levi 's are everything I had hoped they would be and More . Perfect fit , and I 'm very pleased tofinally have a BLACK pair ! Amazon 's got another winner !
 My wife thinks it 's funny that I rate my jeans with numbers , but , as a former 505 's man , I now prefer the 517 's 'cause ride my horses more and were my boots more ... plus , they just , plain feel good when they 're on me ...
 Who does n't love Levis ? These are great ! My son was happy on Christmas day and so were we . Happy Holidays !
 It is great to find the exact size , color , and fit you want in a Levi 's jean , and also get it on time .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean , Medium Stonewash , 38x29They fit perfectly . Will probably order more in a couple months .
 Needed a size that few brick & mortar stores keep in stock . Amazon had style I wanted in the size that I wanted at a good price !
 These blue jeans where a great color and a perfect fit . Glad I ordered them . They were a present for my son
 My husband has been wearing Levi 's since he was a teenager . They are the most durable jeans and he loves the boot cut .
 Ordered these for my boyfriend , they run extremely small , he regularly wears a 32/34 had to send back and get a 36/34 . Other than that they 're great jeans .
 Finally a pair of Levi 's not only affordable , but a pair that is the real deal . . not seconds or blemished . . but cut perfectly . . The best I have bought in years . . Thanks . . and `` I 'll be back for more ''
 They fit just perfectly and I am very happy to not only get the bestdeal around but beat the sales tax . Good old Levi 's rigid , bootcut jeans have been my all-time favorite jeans my whole life , andI just turned 60 . Got 'em within a week , free shipping faster thanexpected , so that was cool , too . Amazon rules !
 The pants are great . I can not seem to find them in stores like Kohls or Target where I usually shop . I 'm not skinny as far as a skinny person goes but I have thinner legs than a lot of guys . These seem to be not as loose in the butt and thighs . I usually get the 505 's but they are cut a little bigger assuming tree trunk size legs . I have runners legs and these work . If you have big footballer legs , forget about it .
 Finally jeans that fit like the old Levis , these are the old quality heavy denim stuff not that wimpy pre-wash thin as paper junk denim . I would highly recommend these jeans to anyone who 's familiar with real Levis .
 Very easy shopping . I 'm familiar with the pants so it 's just a matter of price and convenience.Sitting at the desk for a few second beats driving to the store , finding out they do n't have the 517 in my size and driving back home . I 've always had trouble just finding the 517 at stores and shopping online sure makes things easier . The pants themselves are everything they 've always been , good fitting and tough.It 's nice to add the stonewash to my collection of darker denim so I do n't look the same every day.I was upprised how fast they came and that 's a big plus too .
 These jeans fit to size perfectly -LRB- for me -RRB- , are comfortable to wear , and have adequate material to reach a guy 's waist ... not hip-huggers . I 'll buy more of these ! Not a deal-breaker by any means but I would prefer them to not have the size label outside ... it seems Levi 's always does this .
 Amazon did not mentioned in the description that this pair of jeans is a Shrink-to-Fit fabric . No question on the quality . . it 's still an amazing jeans , the great Levi 's jeans , never goes out of style ... Take 31 '' waistline x 30 '' inseam if your size is 30 x 30 .
 Levi 's are always the best jeans around . Levi 's Boot Cut are the only kind my husband will wear . Always a good fit .
 These T shirts are the best around , I 'm serious , they are very strong and very soft . A couple friends of mine work in the silkscreening business and told me that the `` Hanes Beefy T '' was THE best out there , so I ordered 6 of them on their advice . I 've never seen T shirts this nice , they are the most comfortable , strongest , and they feel like they will last forever . I 'm so happy with these shirts , they are awesome .
 These are great t-shirts and my boys love them . They are active in sports and there is nothing better than having these shirts to wear . They take the wear and tear and come back for more ! I highly recommend them !

 This is the best bra i have ever owned . I used to buy them here where i live but i couldn , t find them anymore . I found them on Amazon.com and was elated . I , m 65 years old and this bra offers perfect fit , lift with no underwires , comfort and you can wear them without worry of seeing everything through all your clothes . Highly recommened this bra .
 The above article has been my garment of choice for many years and continues to be so for comfort , durability , style , fitness and choice of color . It has been my only choice and remains satisfactory through all changes in size -- some up , some down .
 It 's getting harder and harder to find this item . glad it was available on amazon.com . Good fitting bra , lightly lined and best of all , nowires .
 Let 's face it , girls - tatas on the larger side are just not comfortable . Period . And the bras available do n't help . Now , I have n't tried every single bra - and frankly , I 'm kind of cheap . I wo n't spend $ 80 on a chest basket . It just wo n't happen . It 's a struggle because I also can not stand the fake silk stuff - ya know , the fabric that just balls up , attracts lint , and scratches after one wash . Ick ! What 's a woman to do with `` da girls '' if she wants decent quality - and comfort - on the cheap?Enter the Playtex Women 's Cross Your Heart Lightly Lined Seamless Soft Cup Bra ... aka , the bra you 're looking at now . For a very reasonable price , this bra screams comfort . -LRB- Better the bra screaming comfort than your shoulders screaming from pain because the straps are digging in ! -RRB- The band of this stop 'em floppin ' contraption sits comfortably around your body - no itchy elastic and no pinching . The cups are soft and have just a hint of lining - not enough to build any depth , but plenty to assure you wo n't experience any embarrassing `` headlight '' moments , either . The cups are seamless with equals comfort and no scratchiness . There is n't anything special about the straps - they are normal boulder holder straps - but for some reason , they do n't dig . I think it 's probably due to the way the band lies so well against the skin.I hate wearing bras . Hate it ! I will wear a heavy sweatshirt in the winter if it means I can get away without wearing one . -LRB- While on a quick trip to the store - not all day ! -RRB- The shifting , tugging , riding up , tightness ... and let 's not discuss the back fat issue many boobie bags cause . No thank you ! I have enough issues with my body to deal with without having `` help '' from some uncomfortable wirey thing!I 'm happy to report this bra causes none of those issues - it really is comfortable . I do n't mind putting it on . I 'm not sure if the fit is just really accurate , the bra is well designed , or the materials are better than average ... but this is my new bra . I wo n't purchase any other brand or style . Why ? When you find a good house in your price range , you buy it . It 's that simple .
 This is a wonderful bra . I have saved it in my Favorites folder for the future too as I order them off the Web . It is comfortable and durable . I love them . I wash mine in cold water and air dry them as I have learned in the past that my Playtex bras will shrink if I just throw them in the usual wash . Ten stars !!!!
 I received my order quickly . and the fit was perfect for me . I 'm enjoying the bras . They are exactly what I wanted .
 Was very satified , a little hard to hook -LRB- not as stretchy as other style I was wearing -RRB- but fit so much better .
 The only bra that fits me perfectly . Far better than those very expensive bras they sell in the PINK stores at the mall .
 I found this bra to be very comfortable , gives moderate support and makes you look good in clothes . Have been wearing this style for years and only others like it are a lot more money .
 This is one of the only bras that I have found to be comfortable for me to wear all of the time . I do a lot of activities and have found this particular style to fit my needs the best . I can only purchase them online and for the past several years have purchased them thru another online service , but they were more expensive and with shipping charges made them more costly than ordering them thru Amazon .
 I 've worn this type bra for many years . Great quality . Now the style seem to be disappearing and I have a hard finding one . I also like the nude color . Can not find that .
 This is the BEST bra there is for support , and the price here at Amason is unbeatable ! . I can not find this in the stores anymore and I am so happy to have found it online . I ordered 4 this Summer and 5 now . I will soon order more incase Playtex ever does discontinue it . You know how that goes ; you find something you really like and it is discontinued . But this bra has been around for a long time . However , that may make it due to be discontinued . I wish Playtex would read the reviews of it all over the net . They are all good . Amazon 's price is unreal !! So very , very pleased . I wish you could get all sizes in both colors though .
 I love these bras ! Just wish they were not discontinued and still available in other colors . The fit is so perfect and comfortable .
 Nice bra for the money - stays put without discomfort and provides appropriate support . I like being able to adjust the straps from in front .
 I purchased the playtex cross your heart bra for my wifeThis is a bra she has been happy using for many years because of comfort support and fitShe would highly recommend it to anyone who needs a natural liftThe service from Amazon was excellent
 The Playtex Women 's cross your heart lightly lined seamless soft cup bra in soft taupe was as described . They fit well . I 've worn this style before and the last ones I wore tended to have straps that began to disintegrate after only a month despite hand washing and line drying . However , because of their excellent fit , I 'm trying them again . Perhaps I just got a bad batch .
 Great bra style by Playtex . Cross Your Heart bras have been a favorite style in my family for years and this beautiful Soft Cup bra is one reason why . It gives me just the right amount of coverage and the support that I keep getting from this amazing bra -LRB- even after years of wearing it -RRB- is nothing less than what I 've always expected from a great brand by Playtex . My only wish is that this wonderful bra came in more -LRB- even though white is my favorite -RRB- colors !
 This was a gift for my grandmother . She is in a nursing home now and can not go out shopping anymore . She needed another bra and told me that she `` only wears Playtex Cross Your Heart '' bras . She did n't need to try it on and test it out . It 's the same excellent quality that has been around for decades !
 I like the fit but thought the fabric was not top quality . Perhaps it was what is to be expected for that price !!
 Good fit . Straps are wonderful . Able to move around without having something cutting into my shoulders . Wonderful product . Keep up the great work playtex .
 Bought this for my 72 yr . old mother who needed support but wanted stretchy straps . She was n't able to find Cross Your Heart bras anywhere else locally . She loves these bras and the price ca n't be beat . She says they are very comfortable . Thank you Amazon !
 The order was on time and well packed and was as discribed . I am pleased with the product . I have used this brand for years and have always liked it .
 I have a bit unusual size , 34-D . Most stores do not carry that size , or it is really ugly . I ordered this platex bra and I love it . I stands up tp many washes , many work-outs and many spills . It holds everything tightly and it does n't bounce all over the place . Love it !
 More durable than most bras . Washes well and you can throw it in the dryer with no shrinkage . I wish the elastic was a little less rigid because I find the bra is not particularly comfortable around the back . I wish someone could make a comfortable bra . This is not as comfortable as Playtex would like you to believe . Then again , most bras are uncomfortable as far as I am concerned .
 Once again the playtex brand hasnt let me down . This bra is very soft and comfortable . With excellent support I often forget I have it on .
 Comfy , attractive design , good fit ; but I gained weight over holidays and need a three-hook fastener extension.Will order same again .
 I have used this bra for years , and bought it on Amazon because the price was much lower than anywhere elseIt 's really hard to find my size without wires so this is my everyday braThey last a long time , do n't put it in the dryer , that seems to discolor the elastic , otherwise it 's a great bra
 I 've shopped around to find a bra that fit and uplift and found this Bra # 655 fit myself perfectly . I 'm a 40 + woman and want to have uplift and natural look bra . It 's been hard to find . I bought a dozen of them in the past 7 years and will continue buying it . It 's hard to find it in the store . I 'm glad to find it in Amazon . Wish this bra have a better price . Highly recommend this style .
 After looking in a store for this particular product and not being able to find it I came across it at Amazon . Their price was very very reasonable compared to the store prices . I ordered four thinking maybe it was a sale although they did not advertise it as such . I received it in a very timely manner and will go back to Amazon when there is a need .
 I have worn this product for years and can no longer find them in the stores . I do n't know why , but am very happy to get them on-line . I was very satisfied with the order and how it was sent in a timely manner . The price was also a big factor . Keep up the good work.Thank you !
 This playtex cross your heart bra is attractive and offers good support . It wears well and is a good value . The fit of the bra is better for women who are full at the front . If most of the fullness in your breasts is on the sides you may have some puckering in the nipple area of this bra.This bra does not have additional `` padding '' like so many of todays bras . It is lightly lined so you do feel like you have more support and coverage than with a thin nylon bra . It also sits high enough on the chest that you do n't see the outline of your bra through knit shirts . So many of todays bras are low cut and so enhancing that you ca n't achieve a smooth natural look when you are wearing a knit shirt .
 Playtex bras have always fit . Never had a problem with them . They wear very well . Worth the price and then some .
 I 've been a user of Playtex Cross Your Heart Lightly Lined Seamless Soft Cup Bra for years . They fit very well and are so comfortable . I 've had difficulty in finding this item in taupe . I certainly hope I can continue to find them in that color ! Amazon was a great help to me .
 The bra is true to size , the elastic is gentle on the skin , yet firm - as is true for Playtex bras . I also like the front-adjustable straps , which I always look for and want in a bra . Four stars because I am not sure just yet whether I like the `` microfiber '' material as much . It is comfortable , just the feel is slightly different from pure cotton , which I like a lot .
 This bra fits perfectly and is exactly what I wanted . Have been unable to order more . When I click on , it will not go into my cart . I assume they are no longer available .
 I have never ordered a bra online before and was rather concerned that it would fit properly . It turned out to be fine and saved me a trip to the department store -- plus it was a lot less expensive !
 I am very pleased with my Playtex Cross Your Heart Bras . My local retailers are no longer carrying this style so it was great to be able to find them on Amazon . The delivery was prompt .
 Could not find this product in any store . They are hard to find . Found them on Amazon.com . Very reliable and fast . I will shop here again .
 I ordered several Playtex Cross Your Heart Bras and I was completely satisfied . I have looked for months for this product in the stores and could not find . I am sure gald I checked Amazon ! If you are looking for this item I think you will be completely satisfied when you order it from Amazon !
 I have used this product for about 10 years and I could not find it in the stores so I looked it up on Amazon and there it was . I was very happy .
 Hard to find smaller sizes , nice to be able to find here . O Bly thing that would make it better is to have the beige color .
 OTHER THAN BEING WAY OVERPRICED IT IS OKAY I COULD OF BOUGHT THE SAME THING HALF PRICED AT OTHER STORES . IT HAS BEEN A LEARNING EXPERIENCE .
 I bought two for my travel bag because I do n't like hotel staff handling my things . One is for my bedside for chapstik , travel clock , etc. . Next a.m. I can just put the entire contents in drawer below and surface can be wiped or whatever . I have have the other so I can dump my cosmetics in the tray rather than fishing from a bag . And Ditto , I can put the tray with contents in drawer . - These trays are lightweight yet not floppy . They are a nice wine color for male or female .
 Very pleased when this arrived . Way exceeded expectations . Seller communication was great and item arrived quickly . I got the 2-3 and it does seem large for my 2 year old , but he just barely met the weight requirements for the size . The item is very well made and not thin .
 I ordered this costume for my daughter 's presentation . She was doing a biography of Buzz Aldrin for school and it was a hit !
 My grandson loves his Astronaut Suit . I think he has only gotten out of it to sleep but it is not far from him . It is also the only time his mom gets a chance to wash it . He just turned 4 and the size is perfect . He will be able to wear it for a while .
 this is durable ! not cheap in ANY WAY !!!!! It is made of a strong fabric , all the patches look neat , everything is sewed properly . I could not be more thrilled !
 I purchased this for my 3 year old . The material is heavy weight and not cheap at all . I 'm very pleased with the quality of the costume .
 This Veteran 's cap is extremely well-made and the embroidery is tight and secure . My husband is very proud to wear it . God Bless the USA and all of our military and their families !
 I 've been looking for a portfolio style briefcase for awhile , and this is perfect for me . Really well made , nice leather , not too heavy , lots of compartments , and some magnetic flaps .
 I love the dog agility socks I received from Back to Nature Gifts!They came quickly and I was delighted with the product !

 Same quality as old ones . It is gift so do not know what they will think until after Christmas . Carhartt never fails the test .

I bought a dozen of them in the past 7 years and will continue buying it . It 's hard to find it in the store . I 'm glad to find it in Amazon . Wish this bra have a better price . Highly recommend this style .
 After looking in a store for this particular product and not being able to find it I came across it at Amazon . Their price was very very reasonable compared to the store prices . I ordered four thinking maybe it was a sale although they did not advertise it as such . I received it in a very timely manner and will go back to Amazon when there is a need .
 I have worn this product for years and can no longer find them in the stores . I do n't know why , but am very happy to get them on-line . I was very satisfied with the order and how it was sent in a timely manner . The price was also a big factor . Keep up the good work.Thank you !
 This playtex cross your heart bra is attractive and offers good support . It wears well and is a good value . The fit of the bra is better for women who are full at the front . If most of the fullness in your breasts is on the sides you may have some puckering in the nipple area of this bra.This bra does not have additional `` padding '' like so many of todays bras . It is lightly lined so you do feel like you have more support and coverage than with a thin nylon bra . It also sits high enough on the chest that you do n't see the outline of your bra through knit shirts . So many of todays bras are low cut and so enhancing that you ca n't achieve a smooth natural look when you are wearing a knit shirt .
 I 've been a user of Playtex Cross Your Heart Lightly Lined Seamless Soft Cup Bra for years . They fit very well and are so comfortable . I 've had difficulty in finding this item in taupe . I certainly hope I can continue to find them in that color ! Amazon was a great help to me .
 The bra is true to size , the elastic is gentle on the skin , yet firm - as is true for Playtex bras . I also like the front-adjustable straps , which I always look for and want in a bra . Four stars because I am not sure just yet whether I like the `` microfiber '' material as much . It is comfortable , just the feel is slightly different from pure cotton , which I like a lot .
 This bra fits perfectly and is exactly what I wanted . Have been unable to order more . When I click on , it will not go into my cart . I assume they are no longer available .
 I have never ordered a bra online before and was rather concerned that it would fit properly . It turned out to be fine and saved me a trip to the department store -- plus it was a lot less expensive !
 I am very pleased with my Playtex Cross Your Heart Bras . My local retailers are no longer carrying this style so it was great to be able to find them on Amazon . The delivery was prompt .
 Could not find this product in any store . They are hard to find . Found them on Amazon.com . Very reliable and fast . I will shop here again .
 I ordered several Playtex Cross Your Heart Bras and I was completely satisfied . I have looked for months for this product in the stores and could not find . I am sure gald I checked Amazon ! If you are looking for this item I think you will be completely satisfied when you order it from Amazon !
 I have used this product for about 10 years and I could not find it in the stores so I looked it up on Amazon and there it was . I was very happy .
 Hard to find smaller sizes , nice to be able to find here . O Bly thing that would make it better is to have the beige color .
 I like the fit but thought the fabric was not top quality . Perhaps it was what is to be expected for that price !!
 OTHER THAN BEING WAY OVERPRICED IT IS OKAY I COULD OF BOUGHT THE SAME THING HALF PRICED AT OTHER STORES . IT HAS BEEN A LEARNING EXPERIENCE .
 This is the best bra i have ever owned . I used to buy them here where i live but i couldn , t find them anymore . I found them on Amazon.com and was elated . I , m 65 years old and this bra offers perfect fit , lift with no underwires , comfort and you can wear them without worry of seeing everything through all your clothes . Highly recommened this bra .
 The above article has been my garment of choice for many years and continues to be so for comfort , durability , style , fitness and choice of color . It has been my only choice and remains satisfactory through all changes in size -- some up , some down .
 It 's getting harder and harder to find this item . glad it was available on amazon.com . Good fitting bra , lightly lined and best of all , nowires .
 Let 's face it , girls - tatas on the larger side are just not comfortable . Period . And the bras available do n't help . Now , I have n't tried every single bra - and frankly , I 'm kind of cheap . I wo n't spend $ 80 on a chest basket . It just wo n't happen . It 's a struggle because I also can not stand the fake silk stuff - ya know , the fabric that just balls up , attracts lint , and scratches after one wash . Ick ! What 's a woman to do with `` da girls '' if she wants decent quality - and comfort - on the cheap?Enter the Playtex Women 's Cross Your Heart Lightly Lined Seamless Soft Cup Bra ... aka , the bra you 're looking at now . For a very reasonable price , this bra screams comfort . -LRB- Better the bra screaming comfort than your shoulders screaming from pain because the straps are digging in ! -RRB- The band of this stop 'em floppin ' contraption sits comfortably around your body - no itchy elastic and no pinching . The cups are soft and have just a hint of lining - not enough to build any depth , but plenty to assure you wo n't experience any embarrassing `` headlight '' moments , either . The cups are seamless with equals comfort and no scratchiness . There is n't anything special about the straps - they are normal boulder holder straps - but for some reason , they do n't dig . I think it 's probably due to the way the band lies so well against the skin.I hate wearing bras . Hate it ! I will wear a heavy sweatshirt in the winter if it means I can get away without wearing one . -LRB- While on a quick trip to the store - not all day ! -RRB- The shifting , tugging , riding up , tightness ... and let 's not discuss the back fat issue many boobie bags cause . No thank you ! I have enough issues with my body to deal with without having `` help '' from some uncomfortable wirey thing!I 'm happy to report this bra causes none of those issues - it really is comfortable . I do n't mind putting it on . I 'm not sure if the fit is just really accurate , the bra is well designed , or the materials are better than average ... but this is my new bra . I wo n't purchase any other brand or style . Why ? When you find a good house in your price range , you buy it . It 's that simple .
 This is a wonderful bra . I have saved it in my Favorites folder for the future too as I order them off the Web . It is comfortable and durable . I love them . I wash mine in cold water and air dry them as I have learned in the past that my Playtex bras will shrink if I just throw them in the usual wash . Ten stars !!!!
 I received my order quickly . and the fit was perfect for me . I 'm enjoying the bras . They are exactly what I wanted .
 Was very satified , a little hard to hook -LRB- not as stretchy as other style I was wearing -RRB- but fit so much better .
 The only bra that fits me perfectly . Far better than those very expensive bras they sell in the PINK stores at the mall .
 I found this bra to be very comfortable , gives moderate support and makes you look good in clothes . Have been wearing this style for years and only others like it are a lot more money .
 I 've worn this type bra for many years . Great quality . Now the style seem to be disappearing and I have a hard finding one . I also like the nude color . Can not find that .
 This is the BEST bra there is for support , and the price here at Amason is unbeatable ! . I can not find this in the stores anymore and I am so happy to have found it online . I ordered 4 this Summer and 5 now . I will soon order more incase Playtex ever does discontinue it . You know how that goes ; you find something you really like and it is discontinued . But this bra has been around for a long time . However , that may make it due to be discontinued . I wish Playtex would read the reviews of it all over the net . They are all good . Amazon 's price is unreal !! So very , very pleased . I wish you could get all sizes in both colors though .
 I love these bras ! Just wish they were not discontinued and still available in other colors . The fit is so perfect and comfortable .
 Nice bra for the money - stays put without discomfort and provides appropriate support . I like being able to adjust the straps from in front .
 I purchased the playtex cross your heart bra for my wifeThis is a bra she has been happy using for many years because of comfort support and fitShe would highly recommend it to anyone who needs a natural liftThe service from Amazon was excellent
 The Playtex Women 's cross your heart lightly lined seamless soft cup bra in soft taupe was as described . They fit well . I 've worn this style before and the last ones I wore tended to have straps that began to disintegrate after only a month despite hand washing and line drying . However , because of their excellent fit , I 'm trying them again . Perhaps I just got a bad batch .
 Great bra style by Playtex . Cross Your Heart bras have been a favorite style in my family for years and this beautiful Soft Cup bra is one reason why . It gives me just the right amount of coverage and the support that I keep getting from this amazing bra -LRB- even after years of wearing it -RRB- is nothing less than what I 've always expected from a great brand by Playtex . My only wish is that this wonderful bra came in more -LRB- even though white is my favorite -RRB- colors !
 This was a gift for my grandmother . She is in a nursing home now and can not go out shopping anymore . She needed another bra and told me that she `` only wears Playtex Cross Your Heart '' bras . She did n't need to try it on and test it out . It 's the same excellent quality that has been around for decades !
 Playtex bras have always fit . Never had a problem with them . They wear very well . Worth the price and then some .
 Good fit . Straps are wonderful . Able to move around without having something cutting into my shoulders . Wonderful product . Keep up the great work playtex .
 Bought this for my 72 yr . old mother who needed support but wanted stretchy straps . She was n't able to find Cross Your Heart bras anywhere else locally . She loves these bras and the price ca n't be beat . She says they are very comfortable . Thank you Amazon !
 The order was on time and well packed and was as discribed . I am pleased with the product . I have used this brand for years and have always liked it .
 This is one of the only bras that I have found to be comfortable for me to wear all of the time . I do a lot of activities and have found this particular style to fit my needs the best . I can only purchase them online and for the past several years have purchased them thru another online service , but they were more expensive and with shipping charges made them more costly than ordering them thru Amazon .
 This pack has all the sturdy and stylish qualities of any JanSport bag . You immediatly know why they called it `` Gizmo '' . Whatever item you may own-you will find some pocket or covey for it in the Gizmo .
 The bag is the perfect size for anything you might like to carry . The gizmo has the same magical quality of other Jansport packs in that you can fit much more into it than you thought you could . The name of the color , Mediterranean , is deceitful though . It 's not quite as bright a blue as they make it sound . It 's a much deeper , richer color .
 This plus size item fits even my 6 ' 4 '' frame and does so in a wonderfully sexy fashion . I absolutely love this item . It goes great under just about anything and it works well all by itself ! ;-RRB- I am a TrVs Male and the `` crotchless '' hole is modestly designed for a woman , which means that it covers everything from the `` back passage '' to the taint . Various devices can be used easily with this to great effect ! Enjoy!XOXO
 Like most men I have a hard time making my wife belive she looks great . Usually it ends with her asking her sister how something looks , -LRB- obviously not lingerie ! -RRB- But this item did a lot of the talking for me . She looks amazing , and felt as though she did . It was as if it highlghted every curve she has . Very sexy . Does not feel cheap , held up to appropriate washing . Look forward to the next time I see her in this for sure .
 My boyfriend loved this in the red . It 's easy to put on and seems pretty strong . I put runners in thigh highs all the time and I did n't have any problems with this stocking . The only thing i did n't like was if you are heavily endowed on top then the stocking is not tight underneath . I think I have another one that has the same problem so maybe it 's just body stockings . You ca n't beat the price . ''
 Love this item ! Very sexy , comfortable and fits great . I have the same item from Dreamgirls brand and this Leg Avenue one is much better , softer material and a better fit even though they appear to be the same thing . So get it , you and your man will love it !
 Comfortable and easy to put on . The color and style are beautiful and make the person wearing it feel the same .
 These T shirts are the best around , I 'm serious , they are very strong and very soft . A couple friends of mine work in the silkscreening business and told me that the `` Hanes Beefy T '' was THE best out there , so I ordered 6 of them on their advice . I 've never seen T shirts this nice , they are the most comfortable , strongest , and they feel like they will last forever . I 'm so happy with these shirts , they are awesome .
 These are great t-shirts and my boys love them . They are active in sports and there is nothing better than having these shirts to wear . They take the wear and tear and come back for more ! I highly recommend them !
 Incredible design , giving excellent support with comfort and beauty . Enhances everything you wear and looks great on its own , you ca n't beat that ! I 've been a Lunaire customer for about eight years and find integrity in all the products I 've purchased . Personally I have n't found a negative thing to comment on . Considering how long they last , even the price ismore than fair . ENJOY ... UPDATE ... It 's been two years since I purchased Lunaire Piccadilly and wear it most of the time . It 's still in wonderful condition and comfortable . I machine wash it but line dry . LOVE IT ! I 'm going to order a couple more .
 these bras are great , especially for small frames , imo . too bad they 're being discontinued . great fit , great lift & separation , pretty , true to size , awesome price . of course they 're discontinued : -RRB-

 it fit just right , no complains !! . The jacket was a little thicker material than i expected , which was great since it was cold that night . I would recommend this product to other consumers
 It was what we expected and what our daughter wanted . Arrived on time and in perfect condition .
 The jacket was a lil big for being small -LRB- but i was going for a real Pink ladies look -RRB- so i just kept the sleeves up to my elbows . It was Great , Everybody loved it , the Perfect touch for my 50 's Themed Party ; -RSB-
 VERY well made and nearly bullet-proof ! Very warm and comfy . Obviously , a lot of thought went into the design of these and the materials and construction are truly excellent for the money . If I could make one improvement it would be the addition of shoulder-gussets . I sometimes almost feel claustrophobic when I 'm trying to accomplish something that requires alot of shoulder movement like pruning trees or shoveling snow . Other than that they are great and you will definitely like them .
 When I looked at the sizing charts - I bought a 38 - had to return it for a 42 - that fits perfectly !!! Now he is just waiting for the weather to get cold !! He loves them !!
 My husband loves how these coveralls fit and feel . They seem true to size , but I ca n't speak about their durability yet -LRB- I have no doubts -RRB-
 Super piece of clothing for the cold of winter when you are working outside . Keeps out the cold drafts as well since it is a once piece item .
 Great jeans.Classical style.Low price.Wearing only jeans , levis always loved.Happy New Year!Amazon Forever!I love it .
 This hard to find style arrived on time . These classic jeans fit just the way they should . Going back for more colors .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Slim Fit Jean is leg looks like so long , . . but lap so tight but leg looks like so long . .
 My husband like it . . although I have to cut the length a little bit . . He said he may buy more in the future . . Hopefully they have shorter length then .
 They are Levis what more needs to be said ? Theyre the only jeans im buying from now on . They fit great and last 2-5 times longer than any other jeans ive bought .
 I use to wear the Levis low boot cut , but they discontinue to sell the color I want . After I give this one a try , I like it so much .
 If you know your size they fit . I do n't understand the reviews that say the sizes are wrong . Will buy again .
 was just what i expected ... very pleased with purchase . I like the fact that you can get 29 inseam . You can not get that in the store . No need to get them hemmed !
 his pants in overall line is still very good , sturdy , feels soft to the touch on the skin , the profile legendary cutting adds a touch of elegance , and even after several washings the fabric remains the same and does not shrink , the only thing I did not like the pants is that they have deteriorated the quality of the clips and metal buttons , formerly of copper and bronze , and now this are of aluminum and does not look good , however I recommend buying them are very good at the price .
 These came a little long , maybe an inch or two . Seeing as many others have noticed this is a problem with this fit , I suggest going one inseam size lower . I ordered a 30 '' and they fit more like a 31-32 '' . Other than the sizing , they are great jeans , and still look great on me . The boot cut allows the extra length to bunch up a little around the shoes , so you do n't really notice it . It actually looks good.I wish they sold these in a low rise version , as I do n't like hiking them up to where you might put dress pants or khakis . They stopped selling the 517 in a low rise though , so I 'm happy to wear them as is , great fit .
 My husband LOVES these jeans . They are a GREAT FIT , especially in the seat . The legs are n't too wide in the thighs and the bootcut bottom make a terrific silhouette . I like how he looks in them and he says they are REALLY COMFORTABLE . They look best in the darker color and are a good pair of `` dress jeans '' as well as versatile . We are ordering more . Ladies , get him these jeans !
 I 've worn Levi 's for over 50 years . From the days when you had to roll up the cuffs because they only had one length to super bells in the 70 's and now my favorite 517 's . They are always true to size and the workmanship is always excellent . The service at Amazon is always great too . What more can I say , I am one satisfied customer .
 These boot cut Levis have always been my favorite jeans . I had not had any in a while , so when my order arrived I immediately tried them on . I forgot how well they fit , and they are really stylish . Awesome . Will be ordering more .
 Authentic , just as described . Fast delivery . I am very satisfied with purchase . Smooth , one stop purchase . Husband will be very happy on Christmas day ! Thank you .
 My grandson loves these jeans , since he 's rather tall we were glad to find Levi 's makes great jeans in his size . Strange as it may seem , many brands of jeans do not come in a 34in length .
 As an active equestrian rider , and a woman of 59 years , I 'm ALWAYS looking for comfortable jeans that sit at my waist -- I do n't like women 's jeans at all - the fabric in women 's jeans seems flimsy , and the low-rise , hip-hugging jeans for riding or leisure wear feels uncomfortable . The men 's Levis and men 's Lee jeans are very comfortable , and they can handle my active life -- for me , men 's Levis 517 bootcut jeans have best variety for colors , and toughest quality in fabric .
 Nice one . . Boot Cut with nice fit.Ordered the Jeans with 29L but got it 3inch longer . So I had to do alteration , usually I order my pants with 29L and it fits perfect on me .
 Levis 517 's fit me better than any other jeans that I 've bought . Gon na stick with them . I wear a 38 waist , 36 inseam . Have bought several pair over the past six months from various places and they all fit the same . Good quality control !
 I bought two pairs in two orders - both were perfect - exactly as I expected . On time . Good buy at a decent price .
 These jeans are tough but good looking and fit well . Amazon 's price is great , they are a good value for the money , and we always get prompt delivery and easy return if size is not right .
 the product is excellente , but needs to be taggedcorrectly , I order 34x30 tag say so , but real size was36x32 try buying them from differet source , and same thing never can get athe right size until i took a mesuring tape to the store and mesure before buing them !!
 I love those Jeans . . nice shape and denim . I ordered different colors from this pant and I love them all . it is comfortable , and have a nice leg openning that falls around the boot .
 I have been wearing 517 's for as long as I can remember . They fit perfectly and have remained unchanged for years .
 These boot cut jeans by my favorite jeans maker are exactly what I needed.When I ordered my Harley Davidson boots , I needed pants for when I wear them and these ones are the only ones that fit on the outside where others ca n't . Shopping local yields nothing like these , just junk not worth the money.Quality is what I 've come to expect from Levi 's , outstanding with fit absolutely perfect.More orders coming soon for these.Shipping was prompt , making this buyer very happy.Thank you to everyone for helping this lonely guy that hardly can get out to shop by bringing them to me.Again , THANK YOU VERY MUCH !!
 I thought these were more on the casual side , but after putting them on , they can pull off a nice look . Very comfy , one day to break in . No frays , quality zipper . Dimensions were perfect . Overall color is a shade or two darker than in the picture . Awesome , new favorite pair .
 If you have a problem with jeans bagging in the rear , then these jeans are for you ! They are a great fit and very comfortable ! My husband loves them !
 It 's a very good pant for my husband . Nothing too special or fancy ; he is very satisfied because he got what he expected
 execelente producto muy buena calidad , el pantalon vino en un excelente empaque y llego super rapido deverdad no tengo quejas lo recomiendo
 He looks hot in them , thanks ! What more can I say ? They did n't stay on for very long ... ca n't share any more details .
 I was somewhat hesitant to order Levi 's online but I could n't be happier with this order ! The jeans are exactly as described and fit perfectly . They are genuine Levi 's and are of the highest quality - not seconds . I ca n't recommend this seller highly enough .
 They 're good sellers and the product is very good , I like so much this jean . Ellos son muy buenos vendedores , el producto llego rapido a mis manos y era el esperado , los recomiendo ampliamente .
 I wear Levi jeans every day . Levi 's are the only jeans I will wear.I have worn Levi jeans for the past twenty -LRB- 20 -RRB- years ... or longer.Levi jeans are great ... in fact , i 'm wearin 'em right now ...
 Sent me what I wanted . 15 more 12 more 11 more 9 more 7 more 5 more 3 more done
 These are great jeans , they do tend to run a little big , both on length and waist . The color was a lot more bluer then it looks in the picture , so be weary of that it . It was too country , and I needed more rock and roll , if you know what I mean.Pros
 I was a bit concerned about this purchase . My husband likes the boot cut style and that was an excellent choice for my purchase . I have zero compliants other then I wish I 'd bought more !
 they were exactly what we were looking for . the orginal 517 , these are my hubby 's most favoritie , they also hold up better than the other styles seem to
 Will have to wash several times for them to fit . I buy this size all the time from other retailers and they are n't this big . Like the color and the style . They just run big I guess . Mainly in the length . Would buy again , just a smaller size .
 The fit is nice , the color is holding up through the wash . I am glad they have different sizes then the stores . Very hard to find 33 x 36 !
 I like the way these jeans fit.The are also comfortable.The ones I have purchased previously have been durable .
 d e m a r a v i l l a e s t e m o d e l o muy bueno
 These are the first jeans in a while that actually fit my waist size , inseam and the leg openings are perfect .
 These jeans fit well but the denim seems less hefty than the denim of the same 517s from 5 years ago .
 These jeans come washed so they are soft , supple and ready to wear . They are pre-shrunk so order the size you wear . I choose boot-cut jeans because I wear 12 '' - shaft western boots . Levies are the only jeans I wear because they fit well , look good , and get better with age .
 These jeans are perfect for the guy who wants to wear boots and not look like a geek or a thug . Just the right combination of loose and fitted .
 This is my first pair of Levi 517 's and I have to say I am very impressed . They sit on my natural waist -LRB- not low-rise like the 527 's -RRB- , and are fitted in the seat and thigh , and then flare out below the knee to fall on the boot . I 'm 6 ' 3 '' 190lbs and have a 36 waist and 34 inseam and it fit perfectly . Hard to find jeans these days that sit on the waist ... I 'm not a fan of the low-rise look or feel , so these jeans were a great find .
 Came to Amazon to order these jeans for my husband since no one ever has his size , 36x36 . I was pleasantly surprised because I did order two of these in different colors , Rancher Light and Rinse , both of which were the perfect colors . Perfect light colored jean and perfect dark colored jean . My husband and I are very hard to fit in jeans and tops so when something works we often get multiples , the problem however is that sometimes we buy the exact same thing in a different color and they fit totally different . Not these ! These jeans were great and the same fit ! Some people might not be able to appreciate that as much as I , but I was very grateful . It was a risk I had to take since his size is so common , but with free returns I had to take advantage . The boot leg is also very subtle but incredibly flattering . He does wear boots but of course they are n't necessary . I would say they are very true to size and great quality . They are currently his `` good jeans '' ... . that is until he `` accidentally '' wears them to go work in the garage . But when that happens , because it will , I will be back to purchase more ! By the way he is just over 6 ' 3 '' about 230-240lbs .
 i traveled 80 miles one day looking for the jeans i like with no luck , it did make for a nice bike ride though ! then i went online looking and i found what i was looking for at amozon these jeans are hard to get in my hometown!Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut JeansWhat a nice pair of rugged jeans . And I got them so FAST !! Thanks again.Roxann Hill
 Good product , on time and as shown in Amazon.But ... years ago , ordering the same # jean and the same size always brought the exact same fit and look . Lately , the same length , for instance , some times is a bit too long -LRB- can be fixed -RRB- or a bit too short -LRB- bad news -RRB- . The price to be paid for savings by manufacturing offshore . Lets see if with the crisis we return to the memorable `` MADE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ''
 What can I say ? They are Levis . Perfect fit , excellent quality , and the most impressive thing was the price . Unbelievable !
 The only problem was I had was that I had to have them hemmed 2 &#34; so as not to walk on the cuff . I would have ordered them shorter but they were not offered in the waist size I needed . The waist fit perfect and having them hemmed was not that big of a deal . It coast me $ 12.00 to have them hemmed .
 I love being able to find the 517 's on line and not having to run all over town for the style and size I need .
 If you promise not to tell anybody , I wear lined jeans from eddie bauer or llbean when it gets cooler . I wear these when it gets warmer . True to size , do n't shrink too much .
 These were ordered off Amazon when I could not find them locally . I found the pants and they are describer perfectly and fit exactly as I had wanted them to . I will buy more in the future because they were perfect .
 Completamente satisfecha con el producto , exactamente igual a lo que ofrecieron . LLego en el tiempo estimado que prometieron . Ninguna queja , volveria a comprar de nuevo .
 The Levi jeans were just like I expected . The fit was perfect and received them in just a few days . Thanks !!
 The quality of the denim is lighter , so the good fit disappears by the end of the day . Otherwise , I like 'em !
 Hubby dearest was so happy to find boot cut Levi jeans at Amazon as it seems most stores have quit carrying this style of jean . He likes to wear boot cut jeans and Levi jeans are his favorite brand.No complaints about the fit or wearability either . Ordered two more pairs of jeans today as he 's a happy camper.Recommend .
 Good deal on the jeans and speedy shipping . My first pair of boot cut jeans . My girl friend really likes them on me . I got the dark blue -LRB- rinse -RRB- . Fit good and comfortable .
 My skinny son is 54 years old and will not wear any other jeans - only 517 , boot cut Levi 's so I know what to buy for Christmas and Birthdays . I found a perfect fit for my skinny husband also .
 I ordered these jeansLevi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jeanfor a Christmas gift a short time before Christmas . I knew the size . I was somewhat concerned that I would not get them on time for Christmas The package came just before Christmas , and the jeans were exactly as pictured , nicely packaged -LRB- each pair separately enclosed in plastic bag -RRB- , the right size and color . I was very pleased , as was the recipient of the gift !
 The jeans were a Christmas gift and a style regularly worn by the recipient . They were a perfect fit . They are hard to find locally so we ordered from the Internet . The red tag on the back pocket did not say `` Levis '' and I have never seen this before . Is it significant ?
 Wow . These are great blue jeans , and they come in 38 long which is what he wears . HE wanted the boot cut , and a 34 waist was large enough . Usually he wears a 36 , , but I ordered 34 and they fit just right . Great looking , great price .
 Great product ... my dad was very pleased . He had not been able to find the 517 .
 These were a birthday gift for my son and I had them sent directly to him at college . He loved them and they fit great ! Good quality for the price . He liked the fit of the boot cut .
 These are great jeans for us gals , too , especially if you like to wear a true black color . I dress them up with a feminine camisole and heels , and have got many compliments on them .
 Exactly what my hubby wants . It 's difficult to find his size in our local stores . Very happy Amazon now has Levi 's in his size .
 I love my new bootcuts . I received them quickly , They fit perfectly . Thank you .
 I 've grown frustrated by the lack of good quality/reasonably priced jeans in the market today . At some point , the Levis brand started to suffer in terms of quality/value for the dollar . Do n't remember exactly when that happened , but I started to buy my jeans from Banana Republic . Over time , they stopped making the style I grew to rely on . This created a 7-10 stretch where I could n't seem to find a good pair of jeans . Most recently , I purchased a pair of Lucky jeans - ridiculously over priced . When those began to fail , I tried Levis again and bought these . For a third of the price of Lucky Jeans , these Levis boot-cut jeans are really nice . They have a really substantial feel/weight to them and I could n't be happier with the purchase . I was so pleased , I ended up buying a second pair .
 Levis 517 Boot Cut Jeans are just as advertized . Good fit and a perfect boot cut . I highly recommend them for anyone who needs boot cut jeans .
 I like this style and they are getting very hard to find . The price here was the best I found , got in a timely manner . I 'm happy with my purchase .
 Purchased these jeans for my husband . They have a nice fit and look very good on . No baggy butt like the relaxed fit jeans .
 I usually have a hard time finding good bootcut jeans with the right fit in the retail stores . If the color/wash/fabric is right , the size isnt . If the size is right , the fit is too loose at the seat and thighs . Now that my favorite pair of jeans is past its prime , I started looking for a new pair to replace it . After hunting all stores in and around my area and trying all available bootcuts in my size , I was very disappointed . That is , until I found a pair of Levi 's 517 Blue Ox in the local Macy 's store . This was the first bootcut I found in the last 3 years that fit me perfectly . Since I already had a pair of jeans that was of a very similar color , I came online and started looking for the correct color in that fit . Unfortunately , it wasnt that easy finding one online . Kohls , Dillards and others had Levi 's 517s , but they werent the same ones I saw in the store . Apart from Macys and Amazon , no other site -LRB- including Levi 's own site -RRB- had the same fit in Rancher Light color I was looking for . I could have ordered at Macys website , but my past experience with Amazon was stellar and so it my first choice . Even then I was a little skeptical if the photos were close to how the jeans looked in reality . Since amazon had a free returns on this one , I went ahead with the order . The product , as always with Amazon , came 6 days ahead of their estimated delivery date . The jeans is , in fact , very close to the pictures on the website and the fit is PERFECT !! Thanks to Levi 's for the perfect color and fit and KUDOS to amazon for the perfect shopping experience !
 Finally Levi went back to 7 belt loops instead of the five . Makes a big difference for those of us that work for a living .
 I bought the 517 as I prefer this cut to any other one of the Levi 's catalog , I place it even above the so famous 501 . I 'm fully satisfied
 I love these jeans . The wash and fit are great . That being said , they did arrive with a hole in the seat and the seam is a little crooked on the inside left leg . I really do n't care though because they fit so good .
 It is hard to find male , black , slim fit , boot cut jeans . Believe me I searched many places both on-line and local retail outlets . Finally I found these on Amazon and they were just right . Great fit , looks good , and the price was reasonable . I highly recommend them .
 We will take these to alterations but they were about 5 inches too long . Otherwise they are very nice .
 True to size , did n't shrink , and minimal wrinkling . Love the variety of sizing - son is tall and thin , and hard to fit , but Levis 517 made it happen !
 Well , they 're Levi 's . There you go . Best jeans on the market . Last forever and fit great . The black does fade to gray quicker than I would like , but that 's probably because I wear only black , all the time . So ...
 I have worn Levi jenas for the last 16years , i am relatively tall guy and seldom get my size in the store , Amazon provides me my size and then quality as well .
 Purchased two pairs of Levi 's Boot Cut Jeans for my husband , the Jeans are very hard to find in the stores . Since my husband is tall , it is hard to find 36x36 .
 These pants are very well put together and I am a big fan of Levi 's pants durability which is what prompted me to purchase these .
 I am a woman but men 's jeans fit me better . These are very comfortable . My jeans do NOT get hung up on my boots as they do with jeans that are not boot cut .
 todo salio perfecto , tanto el envio como el paquete recibido , estan esplendidas , la hora de llegada fue la establecida por el vendedor
 Quality jeans , but not made in the USA.Arrived quickly and each pair were individually bagged in plastic.Good fit , for me .
 Fit well at the waist and look good . Last a lot longer than most most jeans and seem to get more and more comfortable the more you wear them .
 My wife thinks it 's funny that I rate my jeans with numbers , but , as a former 505 's man , I now prefer the 517 's 'cause ride my horses more and were my boots more ... plus , they just , plain feel good when they 're on me ...
 Who does n't love Levis ? These are great ! My son was happy on Christmas day and so were we . Happy Holidays !
 It is great to find the exact size , color , and fit you want in a Levi 's jean , and also get it on time .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean , Medium Stonewash , 38x29They fit perfectly . Will probably order more in a couple months .
 Needed a size that few brick & mortar stores keep in stock . Amazon had style I wanted in the size that I wanted at a good price !
 These blue jeans where a great color and a perfect fit . Glad I ordered them . They were a present for my son
 My husband has been wearing Levi 's since he was a teenager . They are the most durable jeans and he loves the boot cut .
 I 've been wearing these for years.They do tend to fade easily so wash them inside out and use a detergent product for black fabrics .
 I bought these as a gift for a friend who has worn this style for years . Good quality , good fit , good style .
 They fit just perfectly and I am very happy to not only get the bestdeal around but beat the sales tax . Good old Levi 's rigid , bootcut jeans have been my all-time favorite jeans my whole life , andI just turned 60 . Got 'em within a week , free shipping faster thanexpected , so that was cool , too . Amazon rules !
 The pants are great . I can not seem to find them in stores like Kohls or Target where I usually shop . I 'm not skinny as far as a skinny person goes but I have thinner legs than a lot of guys . These seem to be not as loose in the butt and thighs . I usually get the 505 's but they are cut a little bigger assuming tree trunk size legs . I have runners legs and these work . If you have big footballer legs , forget about it .
 Finally jeans that fit like the old Levis , these are the old quality heavy denim stuff not that wimpy pre-wash thin as paper junk denim . I would highly recommend these jeans to anyone who 's familiar with real Levis .
 Very easy shopping . I 'm familiar with the pants so it 's just a matter of price and convenience.Sitting at the desk for a few second beats driving to the store , finding out they do n't have the 517 in my size and driving back home . I 've always had trouble just finding the 517 at stores and shopping online sure makes things easier . The pants themselves are everything they 've always been , good fitting and tough.It 's nice to add the stonewash to my collection of darker denim so I do n't look the same every day.I was upprised how fast they came and that 's a big plus too .
 These jeans fit to size perfectly -LRB- for me -RRB- , are comfortable to wear , and have adequate material to reach a guy 's waist ... not hip-huggers . I 'll buy more of these ! Not a deal-breaker by any means but I would prefer them to not have the size label outside ... it seems Levi 's always does this .
 Amazon did not mentioned in the description that this pair of jeans is a Shrink-to-Fit fabric . No question on the quality . . it 's still an amazing jeans , the great Levi 's jeans , never goes out of style ... Take 31 '' waistline x 30 '' inseam if your size is 30 x 30 .
 Levi 's are always the best jeans around . Levi 's Boot Cut are the only kind my husband will wear . Always a good fit .
 Very high quality . Several pairs have consistent fit . Have bought and worn these 517 boot cut jeans for several years .
 I am happy with the jeans and how they fit , but usually when I get 517 's , they are really stiff and then I get to break them in . This pair was already like pre-washed , just differnt than what I am used to , but I still like them and will wear them . Maybe I have to look into differnt types and find exactly what I am looking for next time . Thank you
 I 've been wearing 517 's for a good , long time now , and I love 'em ! The problem is that most of my local stores that sell them -- and very few of them do -- price them highly and also drastically limit the selection compared to the more popular 501 's and 550 's . Additionally , these jeans are often skipped over when it comes to the big sales . Well , shopping for them on Amazon is a decision I should have made long ago . The price here is hard to beat.As for the jeans themselves , they are of the rugged quality that Levi 's is known for . They fit like the product photo shows
 Have had these jeans for a few weeks now & am very satisfied.The flair from the knee down is discrete and does not look like the 70 's bell-bottoms . The fit on top was precisely as marked . The length seems about 1/2 inch longer than sized on the 501 's . Was formerly utilizing 501 slim fit jeans but found that could not place them over motorcyle boots . The 501s were great for rainy rides , but look too much like a cowboy , when tucked into the boots .
 As always , good shopping at amazon.com . Its always a problem finding the right length jeans for me . I found that in this levi 517 Boot cut jean , it feels good to finally find a jean that is not too short . A fact that i would have loved to know before i bought this jeans , is the leg opening size . This jean is very tight around the thigh area . I would just like a bit more details on the product a next time round . Other than that , it always a good shopping experience on Amazon .
 The length and waist were perfect . The quality of Levi jeans was the same as they had always been , good
 I always had to keep pulling up my previous pairs of Levi 's -LRB- any model -RRB- because they only had FIVE belt loops . A key ring and cell phone are not that heavy . I remember growing up with Levi 's having SEVEN belt loops and a heavier canvas . I was pleasantly surprised to see the ` new ' Levi 's 517 now have seven belt loops again . I started to buy a different model , but they still only have the five loops.I just bought a couple of these pairs from Amazon . I did check online at Kohls and their current batch of 517 's still show 5 loops . I will have to wait until I go to the store to see if their stock has been updated . Kohls prices are higher than Amazon , but I will recheck when they go on sale . I still check Amazon first for almost all my purchases.Overall , I like my new Levi 's jeans . I will compare them with older ones to see if the canvas really is slightly thinner . Outsourcing manufacturing almost always results in poorer quality and non-standard sizing . It has 100 % results in putting Americans out of work . I try to buy American whenever I can -- hopefully it will catch on.There is another issue appearing after I washed my new jeans with my old ones . It should n't have made a difference , but the new ones are now covered with fine fluffy hairs . I will have to use a lint brush when I take them out of the dryer for now . Although it may just be a ` break in -- first washings ' issue.Overall , I rate these jeans 4 stars . I will have to wait for a few machine washings to see how the color holds up . I may be old fashioned , but buying jeans looking like they are 1/2 wore out or have holes in them is ` less than optimal ' .
 I ran around town to find my husband Levi 517 's in size 35x32 for Christmas . In the stores , there were stacks of all different sorts of Levi 's to go through . Finally I came home and ordered them through Amazon and received exactly what he wanted . These Levi 's fit perfectly and look great . Very happy they come in off size waists . Thank you for making my job easier and receiving nice fitting jeans .
 I 've grown up wearing Levi 's and in particular 517 's in my adult life . I do like that Levi has added additional belt loops in the past year or so . Over the years Levi has cut some corners in manufacturing , but not enough to discourage me from continuing to buy their stonewashed 517 's . I like the stonewashed jeans since they are ready to wear , unlike the rigid indigo Levi 's that have to be washed several times to soften them up.I am buying more and more items from Amazon for the free shipping and competitive prices . It just saves a lot of time going to a retailer only to find out they do n't have my size or what I want . Even with Amazon collecting California sales tax , I figure the time and gas saved from having to go to a retailer is well worth it .
 These were a secret gift for my brother-in-law . He keeps complaining that he must do laundry every other day because he only has one pair of work pants , but then he just will not go get more or let anyone buy him any ! So , I got the size off of the one pair of jeans he owns -LRB- laundry is at my house -RRB- and I bought several other pairs that were similarly worn . I sneak in a new pair about once a week and so far he has n't noticed that he now has three pair of work pants . When I slip in the new ones , I put them in the dirty clothes hamper he uses . I wonder if he knows his pants are multiplying yet ?
 They arived bfore time , APO adress , in Afghanistan ,1 week took it to arive here , im suprised , and they fit good , i dont hawe no words
 36 &#34; inseam jeans at a reasonable price are hard to find . I really like the fit of these jeans just wish there were other kinds in the same length .
 Just what I expected . After soaking and drying , the fit and feel was as anticipated ... just like the good , old days !!! -LRB- I would estimate that length and waist both shrunk by about one inch ... as Mama warned , some 50 years ago -RRB-
 i got two pairs for my husband . levis are the only thing that fit him right . They make him look like he has a butt !
 I like this product because it fits very well and is comfortable . I recommend it to others . Good for those who like to wear boots .
 Well , its a good jean , everybody know the levi 's quality , the item arive in perfect conditions . . so nothing more to say . .
 Perfect fit , every time . 517 's are difficult for me to find locally , but buying on line thru Amazon is best for me .
 These are like they used to make them ! More belt loops , great fabric - love them ! Ca n't wait to order more of these !
 I was having a really hard time finding the boot cut Levis - no one seems to carry them anymore . These are just what I wanted . They look and fit good .
 Bought these for my husband and they fit true to size , maybe a little bit long but not so much that he wo n't wear them . He love them , they look good so I love them ! Great Pants !
 I ordered these jeans for my 16yo son & he really liked them . The only thing he would have preferred was a lower rise , but he 's wearing them without complaints . : -RRB-
 I bought 2 of these and man they are nice . I 'll admit the guy wearing the jean in the picture sold me . Like I went and look for all the style of Levi 's , and these attracted me the most . Although I would n't tuck in my shirt like that . But they sure look good with some chucks and or casual boots and a dress shirt , with a silver wrist watch , and a pair of shades . They are heavy , and for me kinda tight even though jean of a different brand and style with the same size , fit me perfectly . I do n't know I guess it the way they are made . But for the look , I 'll take the pain any day , yes these jean are so tight mostly in my thigh area and waist , that I do get a little discomfort pain in my lower back . I guess it the way they are design and the heaviness of the jean . Of course I am in the process of getting in shape again . So with time , these will be perfect . I do like to sag a little , but as of right now I ca n't with these . Until I lose some of that belly fat I accumulated over the years .
 These are the jeans I always buy , they are a great comfortable fit . It is also great that Amazon stocks the size I need , it 's impossible to get from the shops .
 My body was made for Levi 's brand jeans , and I 'd worn through a couple of pairs . I bought duplicate black 517s - soft but not washed out , dark , with a predictable fit . They are my new favorites . The process went smoothly . Who knew I 'd be buying clothes online ?
 I ordered these for Christmas for my 6 ' 2 '' grandson who had grown out of all his pants after checking stores and finding his size is almost impossible to find . They were perfect and he loved them .
 This is a very good price for this product , it 's the second one I 've ordered for my son .
 I received my pants very quickly . I was concerned that my size would be too short for boots . I was pleasantly surprised that the designer was thoughtful about the shape and length for this item &#34; after &#34; several washings . Pants are about 1/2 inch longer than the average pants which make them perfect for cowboy boots . Pants are also very comfortable . JCD
 Noticed that they even have an extra pair of belt loops compared to my previous order . They are sturdy & dependable .
 The jeans were great ! The price was right , they were delivered in a timely fashion , and I lost a few lbs to get in them and I look good . lol . I recommend this company .
 These are the only jeans my son likes . He is tall and I have trouble finding his size in local stores and I could not find a better price .
 The jean came very quickly . They were the proper color , size , and cut . The packaging was excellent , and so was the quality of the jeans .
 Perfect price and fit for my husband . I would recommend this jean to any &#34; baby boomer &#34; who loves boot cut jeans.The jean has not changed at all good quality material and the right color . Thank you .
 This pair of Levi 's fits perfectly and the indigo color is the same as the Levi 's I wore back in the day !
 I gave these Jeans to my daughter 's friend for Christmas and he really likes them.He is real thin and wears motorcycle boots.He likes how they fit and loves the boot cut.He especially likes the rugged material .
 My order arrived in a timely fashion , they fit good and look great ... I 'm gon na get a couple more pairs .
 Levi 's 517 ` sThese Levi 's were the perfect fit . I like the fact that they are pre rinsed , which makes the fabric softer .
 I have always appreciated the fit and quality of Levi jeans . The boot cut has a closer fit around the knee with comfortable room in the hips and waist . What Levi Strauss needs to understand is that there is a huge population of men out there that has a 31 inch inseam . Men between 5 ' 9 &#34; and 6 ' fall into this size range . My growth did not stop at 30 &#34; inseam , and did not make it to 32 &#34; . So I either buy high water jeans that show my socks , or I let the cuffs drag the floor which signicantly reduces the life of the jeans . I liked the fit enough that I spent an additional $ 10 to get them hemmed to 31 .
 product arrived as expected on time , the product was as expected and the quality was as you 'd expect to find in a brick & mortar store .
 Great fitting . I usually buy the 527 style but they did n't have black in that style . Ordered a 517 instead and love the fitting .
 The fit and look are great and I saved a few dollars . Will purchase more when the price is right
 love this jeans , the fabric is really good and the cut is impecable . it is original and the communication was really easy , i recieved really fast .
 I 've always wanted a ` black 527 ' but found out I could only get that in rigid black.I decided to try 517 n whao I might just decide to continue with 517 even with other colors.Just the perfect fit I love .
 Is exactly what i was looking for . . i being using this model for years , and this pair of pant are excellent
 BASTANTE BIEN . BUENA CALIDAD DEL PANTALON . ME QUEDO MUY BIEN . TANTO EL LARGO COMO EN CINTURA . EXCELENTE COMPRA A UDS . GRACIAS .
 The jeans are a good deep color . Wish they were n't quite as thin as jean material seems to be getting , but seems they are all like that now . Overall a good pair of jeans.These are hard to find in 36x36 , so I 'm glad Amazon carries them .
 Perfect fit right out of the box . Started wearing immediately , stitches , pockets , zipper perfectly in place . Survived several washes good as new .
 Good price , perfect quality . Very good model for young and old-aged people . Gorgeous color . Classic zipper . I 'm satisfied ! I recommend to buy it .
 These jeans fit me very well and look good . One thing I noticed however is that the denim has a more coarse feeling compared to other Levi 's jeans . I would buy these again .
 IL TELL YOU I HAVE BEEN WEARING LEVI 'S FOR YEARS ON END AND THE BEST DEAL I GOT ON THESE GREAT JEANS WAS FROM MY FAVORITE STORE AMAZON
 I love these jeans . For me they are perfect . Long enough to wear with or without boots and the fit is not too tight . How can you go wrong with Levi 's ?
 I got what I ordered promptly . I wish I had ordered a different color but -- my bad . No complaints . What else can I say ?
 The jeans was just perfect , the material , size and colour , nothing to complain about , and great timing too.They fit really well , and amazon 's size chart was very helpfull .
 Style & size stayed true since the last time I bought a pair , after gettingLevi 's Men 's 527 Low Rise Boot Cut Jeanthat are nothing like they used to be that 's all a shopper can ask .
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut . Black 42 waist / 30 length . If you are short , stocky and have a big butt . These pants are perfect . They wo n't bunch up at your fat knees and they will last a long time before the zipper explodes . I suggest you buy the next size up because they will shrink after 6 months of washing , drying and severe stretching in the seat area . Great pants .
 MY FAVORITE JEANS FOR 25 YEARS . I HAVE WORN MAINLY 501 MODEL , SO I READ MANY REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING THESE 517 JEANS.AFTER THINKING FOR A LONG TIME I DECIDED TO BUY ONE SIZE BIGGER THAN USUAL . IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE.THEY ARE JUST FINE , BLACK COLOR AND ZIPPER FLY WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DETAIL FOR ME !
 My husband 's body type includes slight pot belly and skinny hips and thighs . Almost impossible to find pants that fit well without being either too tight in the belly or looking baggy in the seat and thighs . He used to wear Levi 's Action Jeans which were boot cut jeans with slight stretch in fabric and a slight crease in the legs . These jeans always looked and fit great ; real snappy . Unfortunately they 're no longer available . Then went to wearing David Taylor Flexjeans from Sears which were almost as good . However , he now find that although Sears still sells jeans by this name , they are no longer the same . They are now made in China and are made from a crappy fabric and no longer fit the same . In desperation , he started looking thru available Levis products and found Levi 's 517 . Advertised as slim in seat and thighs . He did not expect much but was pleasantly surprised to find that they are indeed somewhat slim in the seat and thighs , even though the pants he bought had a waist size slightly larger than minimally necessary , thankfully allowing him to breathe . Bottom line was that he was very happy that these pants are not so tight in the waist that its hard to breathe , but still slim enough in the seat and thighs that they do n't look like old man 's jeans . Just wish they had the snappy look of the old Levi 's Action Jeans .
 I bought a pair of these in 29X34 and they are great . Fit perfect , really like the cut , lighter weight material but not too light , should hold up well . Just wish they would reduce the size of the internal tag -- I 've actually had to tuck it back into the pants a few times after putting them on !
 Finally figured out what cut and size I like , but the only place I can find them is the internet . Great pants .
 Many of us do n't want to wear our Levi 's half way up our bellies . 517s are the best answer for that !
 A well tried and true blue jean that I 've been wearing for decades . The fit , finish , and quality is a good as or better than ever .
 These seemed a bit darker in person than pictured but they were a great pair of jeans for my husband . This is his favorite style of jeans and he needed a new pair of &#34; dressy jeans . &#34; Same great jeans as in the past .
 All the Levi 's I purchased for my 16 year old son were ` made to fit ' ! From the straight to boot cut , they all were a perfect fit for his personal taste . They are well made and very stylish .
 Great jeans , great price , speedy delivery as promised ! Will definitely be ordering them again since my son is so tall and slim and this is one of the only places I can find his size .
 Great basic jeans in hard to find sizes . Not much to say otherwise . They have washed up well and held up well for my long and lanky teen .
 Jeans are a little tight in the thighs for my husband . It did n't come with packing slip so I 'm hoping I can return them !
 Good quality but I wish I had done more research on the colors . Ordered rigid because of the look online however the denim itself is rigid .
 Yes , these Levi 's are everything I had hoped they would be and More . Perfect fit , and I 'm very pleased tofinally have a BLACK pair ! Amazon 's got another winner !
 I am a creature of habit . Being of slim build I have found the 517 Boot cut to be the perfect jean for me . I also know my size so the fit was great as received . This is not always the case when ordering over the Internet . Service was great delivered on time as expected .
 These are the best jeans Levis has to offer in my opinion . They are not light and flimsy like some jeans Levis are making these days . The medium stonewash is a great even color . They do n't look faded on the seat and thighs or dingly and dirty like so many jeans do . These jeans are rugged , comfortable and last a long , long time . On top of that they look great . These are the only jeans I will buy .
 These jeans are everything they say they are . We will definately order these jeans again when the time comes . Thanks !
 100 % recomended , i have no doubt that i am going to buy another , it is really regular fit and boot cut
 This is the only jean my husband wears . He has the hardest time finding 36x29 . This is a perfect fit for him . When he needs more I will return to amazon .
 I finally found a pear of jeans that my wife said they look good on me and after being washed still fits great
 Great fit for my long legs ! Hard to find jeans my size but Levi 's always comes through for me ! a
 Ordered these for my boyfriend , they run extremely small , he regularly wears a 32/34 had to send back and get a 36/34 . Other than that they 're great jeans .
 Finally a pair of Levi 's not only affordable , but a pair that is the real deal . . not seconds or blemished . . but cut perfectly . . The best I have bought in years . . Thanks . . and `` I 'll be back for more ''
 Great black on black bootcut jeans . They have even gone back to adding two additional belt loops a feature that went away several years ago .
 Fits well , my husband loves them , quality control met , consistent sizing , and look good on . Will order more as needed
 My son wears a 36 Waist x 36 lenght which is very hard to find . The Levi 's Men 's 517 are about the only jeans he likes and these fit him perfectly . They were shipped very quickly and the price was excellent . They were a birthday gift and he loves them .
 The jeans were pre washed and fit just like I wanted . They were really softer than I expected . I would buy this product again .
 I was so happy with the quality and fit ; I ordered 3 more pairs ! I will be good on jeans for awhile . The price was good too .
 Great quality and a lower price , for me is like a tailored jean , I 'm happy with this product . No more to say thanks to all
 After numerous failed attempts at the 527 's on amazon I finally got a clue and got these jeans . They are PERFECT ... great fit ... weight ... etc. ... just like the jeans I wore in high school 20 years ago ... . I 'm already thinking about a second pair . The light rancher is the perfect color ... . As for the 527 's MADE IN BANGLADESH ... amazing they could ever bear the levis name ... perhaps they were counterfeit . Thanks amazon for my true and needed exchange . The original pair of jeans I ordered ... yes the 527 ... was complete trash . These 517 's are real jeans for real cowboys ... and I 'm not one ... but I do wear a ton of boots ...
 Exellent product
 Finally found levis that were the correct size , if they are still available I will order more in the future
 Great pants . I wish there was a size 33 by 35 . I always have a hard time with pants size . I can get a length 34 , which shrink after a wash or a 36 that drags because there too long . But there is no length 35 in pants , so I do n't have much of choice .
 Excellent product the product I come very well and it is what was waiting of , I come in time , good
 I bought they for my boyfriend who had lost a bit of weight and all his pants were falling down , but these fit and stay up -LRB- Thank God -RRB-
 My husband loves the fit and the price.Great deal.You can dress them up or down!Look no further.Great looking jean , for the price .
 Bought these jeans for my husband . They fit very well and look nice . The shipment arrived on time . I was happy with my purchase .
 I ordered these jeans an exrta size longer becaause I wanted a high cuff . Got exactally that . Perfect !!! Now I 'm looking for a white pair
 The Levi 's 517 Boot Cut were purchused as a replacement of the wrong ones bought at a local store , These ordered & delivered ; I was told fit greatly before & after ; washThe price for my buying , totaled out a nuff less even with shipping to come fromamazon , rather than a store , even on sale after my tax & shipping ; -LRB- as a late gift -RRB- Theonly guestion I got was about , they did not have the Levi 's cardboard shelf tagswe see on Jean 's in store .
 I love my levis . I was unaware they came in black . I bought a blue pair and black pair , Ilove them
 Just as described ! Fit & look exactly what he needed and wanted . And he said I could n't find this product ... LOLThanks !!! The Wife wrote the review ...
 These jeans fit great . The boot cut gives a good look without being sloppy . My husband looks hot in them .
 Got these as a gift for my brother , and they are the true blue classic with a great slim shape . Perfect `` date night '' jeans .
 These are the only jeans my husband will wear and we could not find them ANYWHERE . When i found them here i was happily suprised with the discount price and they look great . Would buy again from this seller .
 Excellent transaction on hard to find size and style Levi Jeans.Reasonable price and quick shipping.I 'm very pleased with this purchase !
 jeans were shipped quick , arrived in good shape the medium stonewash has that worn look most people want , I am pleased with the purchase .
 It 's very good ! 100 % cottonThe higher rise sits comfortably at the waist.A fit you want from a brand you trustFit width & length ; !
 non common size request was delivered promply before Christmas . My son was very happy with the fit and color .
 Well made and very sophisticated . It will go well with anything fancy you wear . I just got it today and it is very nice ! Very happy with this purchase . The price is very nice too .
 These wraps are beautiful . They are going to look amazing paired with my bridesmaid 's gowns . The quality is great !!! Very happy !
 Nice , large wrap very well made -- especially for the price . I am going to order a couple more while I can still get them !
 this is a nice scarf and quite versatile . I bought it for my Halloween costume , but have used it as a wrap on a warm summer 's evening as well . I like the satin borders .
 Served it 's purpose ! Good quality materials , the `` satin border '' that its advertised to have is not as thick as I thought it would be , but its a very sleek and pretty wrap for the price . It was worth it
 It was exactly as described , nicely made . Perfect to top my holiday dress
 I bought this to wear with a black dress . It is very lovely and looked great draped over my shoulders .
 I bought two of these ten years ago , and they are the best . Still good after all these years . And I disagree that they are too roomy -- they have fit me perfectly .
 Great Fit ! My Girlfriend says they make my butt look good . Rolled a 300 the first time I wore them .
 I ordered this for my wife and it arrived today . She washed it straight away and it held up very nicely . She was impressed with how soft and roomy it is . So , I am ordering another .
 This is a very comfortable robe . I first wore one while getting a mamogram and I loved it so much I ordered one . I read other reviews and agree that this is not a robe for a small person . I am a 2x and it fits great with plenty of room . I love it !
 This is the most comfortable thing I had while nursing . It really is more of a robe than a gown . I used it when nursing , it was very convenient and comfortable . It 's not the most fashionable look , but it 's not that bad either . Besides , that was the least of my worries . I had a difficult pregnancy , delivery , and nursing experience . I wanted something comfy and easy to allow my son to nurse . This did the trick . I still wear it on occasion , when it is cold . Would buy again .
 The Butcher 's wife here ... i purchased this with skepticism because of the other reviews . It is not a long hospital gown . It is more of a Kimono style robe . I was looking for a robe for delivery day and right after the birth for ease of nursing , etc. . It is on the larger size and guarantee 's coverage of your belly while walking the halls before delivery.Pros : Large wrap around coverage while at the hospital -LRB- so your bottom is not hanging out -RRB- Soft cottonCons : The material could be a little thickerMaybe to large quickly after the baby arrives
 This is my favorate night gown its so comfortable and it looks great and easy to use for feeding and the price who would have thought you could get the quality at that price it was a pleasant surprise .
 I used this gown and let me tell you ... before , during , and after labor ... it was the most comfortable thing ... about to have another baby and as i get farther and bigger ... im buying a second !
 Wife likes it , and is looking forward to wearing it in the hospital after our baby is born and at home on maternity leave.Comfortable , soft fabric , covers well but allows for easy access .
 My husband ordered 2 of these for me and they just arrived today . They are soft and cozy , providing plenty of room with easy access . They are so well made , I am sure they will provide me with many months of use . They feel expensive , unlike some I have looked at in stores . I may have to order some more now that I see how nice they are , especially with the discounted price here on Amazon .
 I bought this while I was around 3 months pregnant to wear during pregnancy and at the hospital . I am 5 ' 9 and 240 pounds and this gown still has room . It is long , so if you are petite , it would definately hit the floor . Nice fabric ; very soft and durable . Am looking forward to taking it to the hospital for after delivery !
 I received this yesterday and wore it to bed last night and I love it . It 's so comfortable and pretty and really does feel like high-quality stuff . The stitching is well done and the fabric is soft . It is big , but that makes it so comfortable . I 'm 6 months and 194 lbs -LRB- normally a 10-12 pre-pregnancy -RRB- . I registered for it specifically because I want my hospital experience to be less of a `` patient '' thing and more of a `` natural process '' event , so I intend to wear my own gowns there . This seems perfect for that . The button-closure at the top and the length of it make it so I would n't mind wandering around the hospital or receiving any visitors wearing it , without worrying if the gown was opening in all the wrong places , like hospital gowns do . The added plus of sleeping in it at home now and postpartum while nursing are great perks . I guess the only negative comment I can think of is that if you 're hot-natured and giving birth in the dead of summer , you might be a bit too warm in it . It 's a lot of fabric .
 I was looking for a comfortable , thin cotton robe that would provide full coverage to wear during and after labor in the hospital . Searched everywhere online , this is the only one I could find that was long sleeve , full length , and the material I wanted . I was not crazy about the color or the floral pattern , but I ordered it anyway . It is perfect for what I needed ! Still not crazy about the color , they should offer more choices ... but it is soooo comfy , and I am 5 ' 4 '' , and it goes to my ankles . It is ample and roomy for a big pregnant belly , and will be good to wear at home for breastfeeding and during recovery time .
 I just received this in the mail today . The shipping was prompt , I will say.I tried it on and it fits like any other robe , although it has 2 side ties but no long outside tie -LRB- ca n't think of what that 's called at the moment -RRB- that goes around your waist . I can always use one from a different robe , that 's no problem HOWEVER the fabric is not anything like what is shown in the picture . It could be the same fabric . . And if that is the case than its the lighting that makes it appear lighter but this robe is made of fabric that has a pattern of darker pink overall with a sort of `` line drawing '' style of magenta flowers . It kind of is a cartoony pattern , and I 'm not fond of it . The picture is small so its hard to tell , but what I see is a light pastel pink overall color with a traditional floral pattern . And the fabric is n't THAT soft , so I 'm wondering if they 've recently switched the fabric to something else.I 'm going to wash it and see if it softens up . However . . I purchased this robe to wear in the hospital during labor and also for home when I 'm nursing and lazy so I really do n't care THAT much what it looks like ... And the previous comments about it being `` shapeless '' well ... Its a robe folks . A robe . Just that . Nothing more nothing less . I 've never worn a robe that 's `` flattered my figure '' so ... Yep.So I 'm pleased with the prompt shipping and the light feel of this robe -LRB- not made of traditional thick fabric -RRB- . I got pretty much what I expected . I just knocked a star off because the pattern does n't look anything like what it does in the picture . I am slightly disappointed in the cartoony pattern and the dark pink color . BUT still happy :-RRB- -LRB- Just FYI for the company , you should offer different fabric choices ... I would order several of these if you had other patterns -RRB-
 After my daughter was delivered , I was anxious to get into something more comfortable than the hospital gown . This gown was perfect ! I was worried about how it would fit based on some other comments , but at 5 ' 6 '' , 220 lbs after the birth , this fit me perfectly . Also , as does happen after giving birth , I did get a little blood on the gown , but it came out REALLY easily , so I 'll be able to use it for baby # 2 . I highly recommend it .
 These T shirts are the best around , I 'm serious , they are very strong and very soft . A couple friends of mine work in the silkscreening business and told me that the `` Hanes Beefy T '' was THE best out there , so I ordered 6 of them on their advice . I 've never seen T shirts this nice , they are the most comfortable , strongest , and they feel like they will last forever . I 'm so happy with these shirts , they are awesome .
 These are great t-shirts and my boys love them . They are active in sports and there is nothing better than having these shirts to wear . They take the wear and tear and come back for more ! I highly recommend them !
 I bought two of these ten years ago , and they are the best . Still good after all these years . And I disagree that they are too roomy -- they have fit me perfectly .
 I combined this with matching polka dot underwear and it was a hit ! It helped set my birthday off right !
 Good fit . Straps are wonderful . Able to move around without having something cutting into my shoulders . Wonderful product . Keep up the great work playtex .
 Bought this for my 72 yr . old mother who needed support but wanted stretchy straps . She was n't able to find Cross Your Heart bras anywhere else locally . She loves these bras and the price ca n't be beat . She says they are very comfortable . Thank you Amazon !
 The order was on time and well packed and was as discribed . I am pleased with the product . I have used this brand for years and have always liked it .
 This is one of the only bras that I have found to be comfortable for me to wear all of the time . I do a lot of activities and have found this particular style to fit my needs the best . I can only purchase them online and for the past several years have purchased them thru another online service , but they were more expensive and with shipping charges made them more costly than ordering them thru Amazon .
 This is the best bra i have ever owned . I used to buy them here where i live but i couldn , t find them anymore . I found them on Amazon.com and was elated . I , m 65 years old and this bra offers perfect fit , lift with no underwires , comfort and you can wear them without worry of seeing everything through all your clothes . Highly recommened this bra .
 The above article has been my garment of choice for many years and continues to be so for comfort , durability , style , fitness and choice of color . It has been my only choice and remains satisfactory through all changes in size -- some up , some down .
 It 's getting harder and harder to find this item . glad it was available on amazon.com . Good fitting bra , lightly lined and best of all , nowires .
 Let 's face it , girls - tatas on the larger side are just not comfortable . Period . And the bras available do n't help . Now , I have n't tried every single bra - and frankly , I 'm kind of cheap . I wo n't spend $ 80 on a chest basket . It just wo n't happen . It 's a struggle because I also can not stand the fake silk stuff - ya know , the fabric that just balls up , attracts lint , and scratches after one wash . Ick ! What 's a woman to do with `` da girls '' if she wants decent quality - and comfort - on the cheap?Enter the Playtex Women 's Cross Your Heart Lightly Lined Seamless Soft Cup Bra ... aka , the bra you 're looking at now . For a very reasonable price , this bra screams comfort . -LRB- Better the bra screaming comfort than your shoulders screaming from pain because the straps are digging in ! -RRB- The band of this stop 'em floppin ' contraption sits comfortably around your body - no itchy elastic and no pinching . The cups are soft and have just a hint of lining - not enough to build any depth , but plenty to assure you wo n't experience any embarrassing `` headlight '' moments , either . The cups are seamless with equals comfort and no scratchiness . There is n't anything special about the straps - they are normal boulder holder straps - but for some reason , they do n't dig . I think it 's probably due to the way the band lies so well against the skin.I hate wearing bras . Hate it ! I will wear a heavy sweatshirt in the winter if it means I can get away without wearing one . -LRB- While on a quick trip to the store - not all day ! -RRB- The shifting , tugging , riding up , tightness ... and let 's not discuss the back fat issue many boobie bags cause . No thank you ! I have enough issues with my body to deal with without having `` help '' from some uncomfortable wirey thing!I 'm happy to report this bra causes none of those issues - it really is comfortable . I do n't mind putting it on . I 'm not sure if the fit is just really accurate , the bra is well designed , or the materials are better than average ... but this is my new bra . I wo n't purchase any other brand or style . Why ? When you find a good house in your price range , you buy it . It 's that simple .
 This is a wonderful bra . I have saved it in my Favorites folder for the future too as I order them off the Web . It is comfortable and durable . I love them . I wash mine in cold water and air dry them as I have learned in the past that my Playtex bras will shrink if I just throw them in the usual wash . Ten stars !!!!
 I received my order quickly . and the fit was perfect for me . I 'm enjoying the bras . They are exactly what I wanted .
 Was very satified , a little hard to hook -LRB- not as stretchy as other style I was wearing -RRB- but fit so much better .
 The only bra that fits me perfectly . Far better than those very expensive bras they sell in the PINK stores at the mall .
 I found this bra to be very comfortable , gives moderate support and makes you look good in clothes . Have been wearing this style for years and only others like it are a lot more money .
 I 've worn this type bra for many years . Great quality . Now the style seem to be disappearing and I have a hard finding one . I also like the nude color . Can not find that .
 This is the BEST bra there is for support , and the price here at Amason is unbeatable ! . I can not find this in the stores anymore and I am so happy to have found it online . I ordered 4 this Summer and 5 now . I will soon order more incase Playtex ever does discontinue it . You know how that goes ; you find something you really like and it is discontinued . But this bra has been around for a long time . However , that may make it due to be discontinued . I wish Playtex would read the reviews of it all over the net . They are all good . Amazon 's price is unreal !! So very , very pleased . I wish you could get all sizes in both colors though .
 I love these bras ! Just wish they were not discontinued and still available in other colors . The fit is so perfect and comfortable .
 Nice bra for the money - stays put without discomfort and provides appropriate support . I like being able to adjust the straps from in front .
 I purchased the playtex cross your heart bra for my wifeThis is a bra she has been happy using for many years because of comfort support and fitShe would highly recommend it to anyone who needs a natural liftThe service from Amazon was excellent
 The Playtex Women 's cross your heart lightly lined seamless soft cup bra in soft taupe was as described . They fit well . I 've worn this style before and the last ones I wore tended to have straps that began to disintegrate after only a month despite hand washing and line drying . However , because of their excellent fit , I 'm trying them again . Perhaps I just got a bad batch .
 Great bra style by Playtex . Cross Your Heart bras have been a favorite style in my family for years and this beautiful Soft Cup bra is one reason why . It gives me just the right amount of coverage and the support that I keep getting from this amazing bra -LRB- even after years of wearing it -RRB- is nothing less than what I 've always expected from a great brand by Playtex . My only wish is that this wonderful bra came in more -LRB- even though white is my favorite -RRB- colors !
 This was a gift for my grandmother . She is in a nursing home now and can not go out shopping anymore . She needed another bra and told me that she `` only wears Playtex Cross Your Heart '' bras . She did n't need to try it on and test it out . It 's the same excellent quality that has been around for decades !
 Playtex bras have always fit . Never had a problem with them . They wear very well . Worth the price and then some .
 Could not find this product in any store . They are hard to find . Found them on Amazon.com . Very reliable and fast . I will shop here again .
 I ordered several Playtex Cross Your Heart Bras and I was completely satisfied . I have looked for months for this product in the stores and could not find . I am sure gald I checked Amazon ! If you are looking for this item I think you will be completely satisfied when you order it from Amazon !
 I have used this product for about 10 years and I could not find it in the stores so I looked it up on Amazon and there it was . I was very happy .
 Hard to find smaller sizes , nice to be able to find here . O Bly thing that would make it better is to have the beige color .
 I like the fit but thought the fabric was not top quality . Perhaps it was what is to be expected for that price !!
 OTHER THAN BEING WAY OVERPRICED IT IS OKAY I COULD OF BOUGHT THE SAME THING HALF PRICED AT OTHER STORES . IT HAS BEEN A LEARNING EXPERIENCE .
 I have a bit unusual size , 34-D . Most stores do not carry that size , or it is really ugly . I ordered this platex bra and I love it . I stands up tp many washes , many work-outs and many spills . It holds everything tightly and it does n't bounce all over the place . Love it !
 More durable than most bras . Washes well and you can throw it in the dryer with no shrinkage . I wish the elastic was a little less rigid because I find the bra is not particularly comfortable around the back . I wish someone could make a comfortable bra . This is not as comfortable as Playtex would like you to believe . Then again , most bras are uncomfortable as far as I am concerned .
 Once again the playtex brand hasnt let me down . This bra is very soft and comfortable . With excellent support I often forget I have it on .
 Comfy , attractive design , good fit ; but I gained weight over holidays and need a three-hook fastener extension.Will order same again .
 I have used this bra for years , and bought it on Amazon because the price was much lower than anywhere elseIt 's really hard to find my size without wires so this is my everyday braThey last a long time , do n't put it in the dryer , that seems to discolor the elastic , otherwise it 's a great bra
 I 've shopped around to find a bra that fit and uplift and found this Bra # 655 fit myself perfectly . I 'm a 40 + woman and want to have uplift and natural look bra . It 's been hard to find . I bought a dozen of them in the past 7 years and will continue buying it . It 's hard to find it in the store . I 'm glad to find it in Amazon . Wish this bra have a better price . Highly recommend this style .
 After looking in a store for this particular product and not being able to find it I came across it at Amazon . Their price was very very reasonable compared to the store prices . I ordered four thinking maybe it was a sale although they did not advertise it as such . I received it in a very timely manner and will go back to Amazon when there is a need .
 I have worn this product for years and can no longer find them in the stores . I do n't know why , but am very happy to get them on-line . I was very satisfied with the order and how it was sent in a timely manner . The price was also a big factor . Keep up the good work.Thank you !
 This playtex cross your heart bra is attractive and offers good support . It wears well and is a good value . The fit of the bra is better for women who are full at the front . If most of the fullness in your breasts is on the sides you may have some puckering in the nipple area of this bra.This bra does not have additional `` padding '' like so many of todays bras . It is lightly lined so you do feel like you have more support and coverage than with a thin nylon bra . It also sits high enough on the chest that you do n't see the outline of your bra through knit shirts . So many of todays bras are low cut and so enhancing that you ca n't achieve a smooth natural look when you are wearing a knit shirt .
 I 've been a user of Playtex Cross Your Heart Lightly Lined Seamless Soft Cup Bra for years . They fit very well and are so comfortable . I 've had difficulty in finding this item in taupe . I certainly hope I can continue to find them in that color ! Amazon was a great help to me .
 The bra is true to size , the elastic is gentle on the skin , yet firm - as is true for Playtex bras . I also like the front-adjustable straps , which I always look for and want in a bra . Four stars because I am not sure just yet whether I like the `` microfiber '' material as much . It is comfortable , just the feel is slightly different from pure cotton , which I like a lot .
 This bra fits perfectly and is exactly what I wanted . Have been unable to order more . When I click on , it will not go into my cart . I assume they are no longer available .
 I have never ordered a bra online before and was rather concerned that it would fit properly . It turned out to be fine and saved me a trip to the department store -- plus it was a lot less expensive !
 I am very pleased with my Playtex Cross Your Heart Bras . My local retailers are no longer carrying this style so it was great to be able to find them on Amazon . The delivery was prompt .
 The size is one size fits all . I am 5 ' 9 178 lbs and it fit WONDERFULLY !!! I LOVE THIS ITEM !!!! It is very sexy !

 My husband really liked the cap , the workmanship was great . He looks so good in it and I like the way people look at him to read his cap . Thanks for making it available .
 I bought two of these , one red and one blue , for my wife and I traveling to the Philippines . I do n't like to have to lug bags around , especially when we are going to be on and off planes , buses , taxis , jeepneys , multi-cabs , boats , etc in our travels.These bags are very good because they have backpack straps , and wheels . When fully packed they do make quite a big load on your back with the straps ... but they work . Also , you can take the two parts apart and each has straps , so you can use part as a daypack as well.Overall , a very good and versatile design , of high quality and a great price .
 This carry-on is 22 '' from wheel to handle , 16 '' from side to side handle , and 10 '' high with an empty daypack attached .
 Great Fit ! My Girlfriend says they make my butt look good . Rolled a 300 the first time I wore them .
 perfect except the size did n't work for me . A little too warm for me but the ruggedness and the number of pockets makes it above any other product
 VERY well made and nearly bullet-proof ! Very warm and comfy . Obviously , a lot of thought went into the design of these and the materials and construction are truly excellent for the money . If I could make one improvement it would be the addition of shoulder-gussets . I sometimes almost feel claustrophobic when I 'm trying to accomplish something that requires alot of shoulder movement like pruning trees or shoveling snow . Other than that they are great and you will definitely like them .
 When I looked at the sizing charts - I bought a 38 - had to return it for a 42 - that fits perfectly !!! Now he is just waiting for the weather to get cold !! He loves them !!
 My husband loves how these coveralls fit and feel . They seem true to size , but I ca n't speak about their durability yet -LRB- I have no doubts -RRB-
 Super piece of clothing for the cold of winter when you are working outside . Keeps out the cold drafts as well since it is a once piece item .

 This is a great jacket made with quality fabric . It 's the crisp , shiny kind of wool , not the itchy , fuzzy kind . The three-button design and the sculpted fit suit my frame well . Great blazer for tall guys .
 I really like this shirt . I only ordered one at the time . I wanted to be sure that the fit was right . I was n't too sure about ordering clothing online . But , this one fits like it should . I will probably order more of them . Thanks .
 I bought two of these ten years ago , and they are the best . Still good after all these years . And I disagree that they are too roomy -- they have fit me perfectly .

 The shirt fits great and the options of different colors makes it a great choice to please everyone .

 I 've had this wallet for a few months now . It 's well made and I 've had no issues . Not real sure why there was a need for a coin pocket on the outside , I certainly do n't need or use it .

 I own the Austin Reed dartmouth blazer in every color in which they make it -- it is a staple of my business wardrobe . Well made , quality fabric , nicely tailored , classic lines , appropriate for a professional woman . -LRB- something that can be hard to find at times -RRB- It should be noted , however , that the periwinkle and raspberry colors are lovely , but the fabric and buttons are slightly different than the `` classic '' colors -LRB- lighter -RRB- and the linings and interfacings are not as substantial as the brown , navy , camel , red and ivory . It 's still a good value , particularly as these are colors appropriate to warmer seasons and climates , but I was a bit surprised .

 Jeans are a little tight in the thighs for my husband . It did n't come with packing slip so I 'm hoping I can return them !
 Good quality but I wish I had done more research on the colors . Ordered rigid because of the look online however the denim itself is rigid .
 Yes , these Levi 's are everything I had hoped they would be and More . Perfect fit , and I 'm very pleased tofinally have a BLACK pair ! Amazon 's got another winner !
 My wife thinks it 's funny that I rate my jeans with numbers , but , as a former 505 's man , I now prefer the 517 's 'cause ride my horses more and were my boots more ... plus , they just , plain feel good when they 're on me ...
 Who does n't love Levis ? These are great ! My son was happy on Christmas day and so were we . Happy Holidays !
 It is great to find the exact size , color , and fit you want in a Levi 's jean , and also get it on time .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean , Medium Stonewash , 38x29They fit perfectly . Will probably order more in a couple months .
 Needed a size that few brick & mortar stores keep in stock . Amazon had style I wanted in the size that I wanted at a good price !
 These blue jeans where a great color and a perfect fit . Glad I ordered them . They were a present for my son
 Great fit for my long legs ! Hard to find jeans my size but Levi 's always comes through for me ! a
 Ordered these for my boyfriend , they run extremely small , he regularly wears a 32/34 had to send back and get a 36/34 . Other than that they 're great jeans .
 Finally a pair of Levi 's not only affordable , but a pair that is the real deal . . not seconds or blemished . . but cut perfectly . . The best I have bought in years . . Thanks . . and `` I 'll be back for more ''
 They fit just perfectly and I am very happy to not only get the bestdeal around but beat the sales tax . Good old Levi 's rigid , bootcut jeans have been my all-time favorite jeans my whole life , andI just turned 60 . Got 'em within a week , free shipping faster thanexpected , so that was cool , too . Amazon rules !
 The pants are great . I can not seem to find them in stores like Kohls or Target where I usually shop . I 'm not skinny as far as a skinny person goes but I have thinner legs than a lot of guys . These seem to be not as loose in the butt and thighs . I usually get the 505 's but they are cut a little bigger assuming tree trunk size legs . I have runners legs and these work . If you have big footballer legs , forget about it .
 Finally jeans that fit like the old Levis , these are the old quality heavy denim stuff not that wimpy pre-wash thin as paper junk denim . I would highly recommend these jeans to anyone who 's familiar with real Levis .
 Very easy shopping . I 'm familiar with the pants so it 's just a matter of price and convenience.Sitting at the desk for a few second beats driving to the store , finding out they do n't have the 517 in my size and driving back home . I 've always had trouble just finding the 517 at stores and shopping online sure makes things easier . The pants themselves are everything they 've always been , good fitting and tough.It 's nice to add the stonewash to my collection of darker denim so I do n't look the same every day.I was upprised how fast they came and that 's a big plus too .
 These jeans fit to size perfectly -LRB- for me -RRB- , are comfortable to wear , and have adequate material to reach a guy 's waist ... not hip-huggers . I 'll buy more of these ! Not a deal-breaker by any means but I would prefer them to not have the size label outside ... it seems Levi 's always does this .
 Amazon did not mentioned in the description that this pair of jeans is a Shrink-to-Fit fabric . No question on the quality . . it 's still an amazing jeans , the great Levi 's jeans , never goes out of style ... Take 31 '' waistline x 30 '' inseam if your size is 30 x 30 .
 I am happy with the jeans and how they fit , but usually when I get 517 's , they are really stiff and then I get to break them in . This pair was already like pre-washed , just differnt than what I am used to , but I still like them and will wear them . Maybe I have to look into differnt types and find exactly what I am looking for next time . Thank you
 I 've been wearing 517 's for a good , long time now , and I love 'em ! The problem is that most of my local stores that sell them -- and very few of them do -- price them highly and also drastically limit the selection compared to the more popular 501 's and 550 's . Additionally , these jeans are often skipped over when it comes to the big sales . Well , shopping for them on Amazon is a decision I should have made long ago . The price here is hard to beat.As for the jeans themselves , they are of the rugged quality that Levi 's is known for . They fit like the product photo shows
 Have had these jeans for a few weeks now & am very satisfied.The flair from the knee down is discrete and does not look like the 70 's bell-bottoms . The fit on top was precisely as marked . The length seems about 1/2 inch longer than sized on the 501 's . Was formerly utilizing 501 slim fit jeans but found that could not place them over motorcyle boots . The 501s were great for rainy rides , but look too much like a cowboy , when tucked into the boots .
 As always , good shopping at amazon.com . Its always a problem finding the right length jeans for me . I found that in this levi 517 Boot cut jean , it feels good to finally find a jean that is not too short . A fact that i would have loved to know before i bought this jeans , is the leg opening size . This jean is very tight around the thigh area . I would just like a bit more details on the product a next time round . Other than that , it always a good shopping experience on Amazon .
 The length and waist were perfect . The quality of Levi jeans was the same as they had always been , good
 I always had to keep pulling up my previous pairs of Levi 's -LRB- any model -RRB- because they only had FIVE belt loops . A key ring and cell phone are not that heavy . I remember growing up with Levi 's having SEVEN belt loops and a heavier canvas . I was pleasantly surprised to see the ` new ' Levi 's 517 now have seven belt loops again . I started to buy a different model , but they still only have the five loops.I just bought a couple of these pairs from Amazon . I did check online at Kohls and their current batch of 517 's still show 5 loops . I will have to wait until I go to the store to see if their stock has been updated . Kohls prices are higher than Amazon , but I will recheck when they go on sale . I still check Amazon first for almost all my purchases.Overall , I like my new Levi 's jeans . I will compare them with older ones to see if the canvas really is slightly thinner . Outsourcing manufacturing almost always results in poorer quality and non-standard sizing . It has 100 % results in putting Americans out of work . I try to buy American whenever I can -- hopefully it will catch on.There is another issue appearing after I washed my new jeans with my old ones . It should n't have made a difference , but the new ones are now covered with fine fluffy hairs . I will have to use a lint brush when I take them out of the dryer for now . Although it may just be a ` break in -- first washings ' issue.Overall , I rate these jeans 4 stars . I will have to wait for a few machine washings to see how the color holds up . I may be old fashioned , but buying jeans looking like they are 1/2 wore out or have holes in them is ` less than optimal ' .
 I ran around town to find my husband Levi 517 's in size 35x32 for Christmas . In the stores , there were stacks of all different sorts of Levi 's to go through . Finally I came home and ordered them through Amazon and received exactly what he wanted . These Levi 's fit perfectly and look great . Very happy they come in off size waists . Thank you for making my job easier and receiving nice fitting jeans .
 I 've grown up wearing Levi 's and in particular 517 's in my adult life . I do like that Levi has added additional belt loops in the past year or so . Over the years Levi has cut some corners in manufacturing , but not enough to discourage me from continuing to buy their stonewashed 517 's . I like the stonewashed jeans since they are ready to wear , unlike the rigid indigo Levi 's that have to be washed several times to soften them up.I am buying more and more items from Amazon for the free shipping and competitive prices . It just saves a lot of time going to a retailer only to find out they do n't have my size or what I want . Even with Amazon collecting California sales tax , I figure the time and gas saved from having to go to a retailer is well worth it .
 The only problem was I had was that I had to have them hemmed 2 &#34; so as not to walk on the cuff . I would have ordered them shorter but they were not offered in the waist size I needed . The waist fit perfect and having them hemmed was not that big of a deal . It coast me $ 12.00 to have them hemmed .
 I love being able to find the 517 's on line and not having to run all over town for the style and size I need .
 If you promise not to tell anybody , I wear lined jeans from eddie bauer or llbean when it gets cooler . I wear these when it gets warmer . True to size , do n't shrink too much .
 These were a secret gift for my brother-in-law . He keeps complaining that he must do laundry every other day because he only has one pair of work pants , but then he just will not go get more or let anyone buy him any ! So , I got the size off of the one pair of jeans he owns -LRB- laundry is at my house -RRB- and I bought several other pairs that were similarly worn . I sneak in a new pair about once a week and so far he has n't noticed that he now has three pair of work pants . When I slip in the new ones , I put them in the dirty clothes hamper he uses . I wonder if he knows his pants are multiplying yet ?
 They arived bfore time , APO adress , in Afghanistan ,1 week took it to arive here , im suprised , and they fit good , i dont hawe no words
 My husband 's body type includes slight pot belly and skinny hips and thighs . Almost impossible to find pants that fit well without being either too tight in the belly or looking baggy in the seat and thighs . He used to wear Levi 's Action Jeans which were boot cut jeans with slight stretch in fabric and a slight crease in the legs . These jeans always looked and fit great ; real snappy . Unfortunately they 're no longer available . Then went to wearing David Taylor Flexjeans from Sears which were almost as good . However , he now find that although Sears still sells jeans by this name , they are no longer the same . They are now made in China and are made from a crappy fabric and no longer fit the same . In desperation , he started looking thru available Levis products and found Levi 's 517 . Advertised as slim in seat and thighs . He did not expect much but was pleasantly surprised to find that they are indeed somewhat slim in the seat and thighs , even though the pants he bought had a waist size slightly larger than minimally necessary , thankfully allowing him to breathe . Bottom line was that he was very happy that these pants are not so tight in the waist that its hard to breathe , but still slim enough in the seat and thighs that they do n't look like old man 's jeans . Just wish they had the snappy look of the old Levi 's Action Jeans .
 I bought a pair of these in 29X34 and they are great . Fit perfect , really like the cut , lighter weight material but not too light , should hold up well . Just wish they would reduce the size of the internal tag -- I 've actually had to tuck it back into the pants a few times after putting them on !
 Finally figured out what cut and size I like , but the only place I can find them is the internet . Great pants .
 These were ordered off Amazon when I could not find them locally . I found the pants and they are describer perfectly and fit exactly as I had wanted them to . I will buy more in the future because they were perfect .
 Completamente satisfecha con el producto , exactamente igual a lo que ofrecieron . LLego en el tiempo estimado que prometieron . Ninguna queja , volveria a comprar de nuevo .
 The Levi jeans were just like I expected . The fit was perfect and received them in just a few days . Thanks !!
 The quality of the denim is lighter , so the good fit disappears by the end of the day . Otherwise , I like 'em !
 Hubby dearest was so happy to find boot cut Levi jeans at Amazon as it seems most stores have quit carrying this style of jean . He likes to wear boot cut jeans and Levi jeans are his favorite brand.No complaints about the fit or wearability either . Ordered two more pairs of jeans today as he 's a happy camper.Recommend .
 Good deal on the jeans and speedy shipping . My first pair of boot cut jeans . My girl friend really likes them on me . I got the dark blue -LRB- rinse -RRB- . Fit good and comfortable .
 Excellent transaction on hard to find size and style Levi Jeans.Reasonable price and quick shipping.I 'm very pleased with this purchase !
 jeans were shipped quick , arrived in good shape the medium stonewash has that worn look most people want , I am pleased with the purchase .
 It 's very good ! 100 % cottonThe higher rise sits comfortably at the waist.A fit you want from a brand you trustFit width & length ; !
 non common size request was delivered promply before Christmas . My son was very happy with the fit and color .
 Great product ... my dad was very pleased . He had not been able to find the 517 .
 These were a birthday gift for my son and I had them sent directly to him at college . He loved them and they fit great ! Good quality for the price . He liked the fit of the boot cut .
 These are great jeans for us gals , too , especially if you like to wear a true black color . I dress them up with a feminine camisole and heels , and have got many compliments on them .
 Exactly what my hubby wants . It 's difficult to find his size in our local stores . Very happy Amazon now has Levi 's in his size .
 I love my new bootcuts . I received them quickly , They fit perfectly . Thank you .
 Great black on black bootcut jeans . They have even gone back to adding two additional belt loops a feature that went away several years ago .
 Fits well , my husband loves them , quality control met , consistent sizing , and look good on . Will order more as needed
 My son wears a 36 Waist x 36 lenght which is very hard to find . The Levi 's Men 's 517 are about the only jeans he likes and these fit him perfectly . They were shipped very quickly and the price was excellent . They were a birthday gift and he loves them .
 The jeans were pre washed and fit just like I wanted . They were really softer than I expected . I would buy this product again .
 I was so happy with the quality and fit ; I ordered 3 more pairs ! I will be good on jeans for awhile . The price was good too .
 Great quality and a lower price , for me is like a tailored jean , I 'm happy with this product . No more to say thanks to all
 After numerous failed attempts at the 527 's on amazon I finally got a clue and got these jeans . They are PERFECT ... great fit ... weight ... etc. ... just like the jeans I wore in high school 20 years ago ... . I 'm already thinking about a second pair . The light rancher is the perfect color ... . As for the 527 's MADE IN BANGLADESH ... amazing they could ever bear the levis name ... perhaps they were counterfeit . Thanks amazon for my true and needed exchange . The original pair of jeans I ordered ... yes the 527 ... was complete trash . These 517 's are real jeans for real cowboys ... and I 'm not one ... but I do wear a ton of boots ...
 Exellent product
 36 &#34; inseam jeans at a reasonable price are hard to find . I really like the fit of these jeans just wish there were other kinds in the same length .
 Just what I expected . After soaking and drying , the fit and feel was as anticipated ... just like the good , old days !!! -LRB- I would estimate that length and waist both shrunk by about one inch ... as Mama warned , some 50 years ago -RRB-
 i got two pairs for my husband . levis are the only thing that fit him right . They make him look like he has a butt !
 I like this product because it fits very well and is comfortable . I recommend it to others . Good for those who like to wear boots .
 Finally found levis that were the correct size , if they are still available I will order more in the future
 Great pants . I wish there was a size 33 by 35 . I always have a hard time with pants size . I can get a length 34 , which shrink after a wash or a 36 that drags because there too long . But there is no length 35 in pants , so I do n't have much of choice .
 Excellent product the product I come very well and it is what was waiting of , I come in time , good
 I bought they for my boyfriend who had lost a bit of weight and all his pants were falling down , but these fit and stay up -LRB- Thank God -RRB-
 My husband loves the fit and the price.Great deal.You can dress them up or down!Look no further.Great looking jean , for the price .
 My skinny son is 54 years old and will not wear any other jeans - only 517 , boot cut Levi 's so I know what to buy for Christmas and Birthdays . I found a perfect fit for my skinny husband also .
 I ordered these jeansLevi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jeanfor a Christmas gift a short time before Christmas . I knew the size . I was somewhat concerned that I would not get them on time for Christmas The package came just before Christmas , and the jeans were exactly as pictured , nicely packaged -LRB- each pair separately enclosed in plastic bag -RRB- , the right size and color . I was very pleased , as was the recipient of the gift !
 The jeans were a Christmas gift and a style regularly worn by the recipient . They were a perfect fit . They are hard to find locally so we ordered from the Internet . The red tag on the back pocket did not say `` Levis '' and I have never seen this before . Is it significant ?
 Wow . These are great blue jeans , and they come in 38 long which is what he wears . HE wanted the boot cut , and a 34 waist was large enough . Usually he wears a 36 , , but I ordered 34 and they fit just right . Great looking , great price .
 I bought two pairs in two orders - both were perfect - exactly as I expected . On time . Good buy at a decent price .
 These jeans are tough but good looking and fit well . Amazon 's price is great , they are a good value for the money , and we always get prompt delivery and easy return if size is not right .
 the product is excellente , but needs to be taggedcorrectly , I order 34x30 tag say so , but real size was36x32 try buying them from differet source , and same thing never can get athe right size until i took a mesuring tape to the store and mesure before buing them !!
 I love those Jeans . . nice shape and denim . I ordered different colors from this pant and I love them all . it is comfortable , and have a nice leg openning that falls around the boot .
 I have been wearing 517 's for as long as I can remember . They fit perfectly and have remained unchanged for years .
 I 've grown frustrated by the lack of good quality/reasonably priced jeans in the market today . At some point , the Levis brand started to suffer in terms of quality/value for the dollar . Do n't remember exactly when that happened , but I started to buy my jeans from Banana Republic . Over time , they stopped making the style I grew to rely on . This created a 7-10 stretch where I could n't seem to find a good pair of jeans . Most recently , I purchased a pair of Lucky jeans - ridiculously over priced . When those began to fail , I tried Levis again and bought these . For a third of the price of Lucky Jeans , these Levis boot-cut jeans are really nice . They have a really substantial feel/weight to them and I could n't be happier with the purchase . I was so pleased , I ended up buying a second pair .
 Levis 517 Boot Cut Jeans are just as advertized . Good fit and a perfect boot cut . I highly recommend them for anyone who needs boot cut jeans .
 It 's a very good pant for my husband . Nothing too special or fancy ; he is very satisfied because he got what he expected
 execelente producto muy buena calidad , el pantalon vino en un excelente empaque y llego super rapido deverdad no tengo quejas lo recomiendo
 He looks hot in them , thanks ! What more can I say ? They did n't stay on for very long ... ca n't share any more details .
 I was somewhat hesitant to order Levi 's online but I could n't be happier with this order ! The jeans are exactly as described and fit perfectly . They are genuine Levi 's and are of the highest quality - not seconds . I ca n't recommend this seller highly enough .
 My husband has been wearing Levi 's since he was a teenager . They are the most durable jeans and he loves the boot cut .
 I 've been wearing these for years.They do tend to fade easily so wash them inside out and use a detergent product for black fabrics .
 I bought these as a gift for a friend who has worn this style for years . Good quality , good fit , good style .
 Great jeans.Classical style.Low price.Wearing only jeans , levis always loved.Happy New Year!Amazon Forever!I love it .
 This hard to find style arrived on time . These classic jeans fit just the way they should . Going back for more colors .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Slim Fit Jean is leg looks like so long , . . but lap so tight but leg looks like so long . .
 My husband like it . . although I have to cut the length a little bit . . He said he may buy more in the future . . Hopefully they have shorter length then .
 They are Levis what more needs to be said ? Theyre the only jeans im buying from now on . They fit great and last 2-5 times longer than any other jeans ive bought .
 I use to wear the Levis low boot cut , but they discontinue to sell the color I want . After I give this one a try , I like it so much .
 Levi 's are always the best jeans around . Levi 's Boot Cut are the only kind my husband will wear . Always a good fit .
 Very high quality . Several pairs have consistent fit . Have bought and worn these 517 boot cut jeans for several years .
 My husband LOVES these jeans . They are a GREAT FIT , especially in the seat . The legs are n't too wide in the thighs and the bootcut bottom make a terrific silhouette . I like how he looks in them and he says they are REALLY COMFORTABLE . They look best in the darker color and are a good pair of `` dress jeans '' as well as versatile . We are ordering more . Ladies , get him these jeans !
 I 've worn Levi 's for over 50 years . From the days when you had to roll up the cuffs because they only had one length to super bells in the 70 's and now my favorite 517 's . They are always true to size and the workmanship is always excellent . The service at Amazon is always great too . What more can I say , I am one satisfied customer .
 These boot cut Levis have always been my favorite jeans . I had not had any in a while , so when my order arrived I immediately tried them on . I forgot how well they fit , and they are really stylish . Awesome . Will be ordering more .
 Authentic , just as described . Fast delivery . I am very satisfied with purchase . Smooth , one stop purchase . Husband will be very happy on Christmas day ! Thank you .
 todo salio perfecto , tanto el envio como el paquete recibido , estan esplendidas , la hora de llegada fue la establecida por el vendedor
 Quality jeans , but not made in the USA.Arrived quickly and each pair were individually bagged in plastic.Good fit , for me .
 Fit well at the waist and look good . Last a lot longer than most most jeans and seem to get more and more comfortable the more you wear them .
 These are great jeans , they do tend to run a little big , both on length and waist . The color was a lot more bluer then it looks in the picture , so be weary of that it . It was too country , and I needed more rock and roll , if you know what I mean.Pros
 I was a bit concerned about this purchase . My husband likes the boot cut style and that was an excellent choice for my purchase . I have zero compliants other then I wish I 'd bought more !
 they were exactly what we were looking for . the orginal 517 , these are my hubby 's most favoritie , they also hold up better than the other styles seem to
 Will have to wash several times for them to fit . I buy this size all the time from other retailers and they are n't this big . Like the color and the style . They just run big I guess . Mainly in the length . Would buy again , just a smaller size .
 The fit is nice , the color is holding up through the wash . I am glad they have different sizes then the stores . Very hard to find 33 x 36 !
 I like the way these jeans fit.The are also comfortable.The ones I have purchased previously have been durable .
 These jeans come washed so they are soft , supple and ready to wear . They are pre-shrunk so order the size you wear . I choose boot-cut jeans because I wear 12 '' - shaft western boots . Levies are the only jeans I wear because they fit well , look good , and get better with age .
 These jeans are perfect for the guy who wants to wear boots and not look like a geek or a thug . Just the right combination of loose and fitted .
 This is my first pair of Levi 517 's and I have to say I am very impressed . They sit on my natural waist -LRB- not low-rise like the 527 's -RRB- , and are fitted in the seat and thigh , and then flare out below the knee to fall on the boot . I 'm 6 ' 3 '' 190lbs and have a 36 waist and 34 inseam and it fit perfectly . Hard to find jeans these days that sit on the waist ... I 'm not a fan of the low-rise look or feel , so these jeans were a great find .
 Came to Amazon to order these jeans for my husband since no one ever has his size , 36x36 . I was pleasantly surprised because I did order two of these in different colors , Rancher Light and Rinse , both of which were the perfect colors . Perfect light colored jean and perfect dark colored jean . My husband and I are very hard to fit in jeans and tops so when something works we often get multiples , the problem however is that sometimes we buy the exact same thing in a different color and they fit totally different . Not these ! These jeans were great and the same fit ! Some people might not be able to appreciate that as much as I , but I was very grateful . It was a risk I had to take since his size is so common , but with free returns I had to take advantage . The boot leg is also very subtle but incredibly flattering . He does wear boots but of course they are n't necessary . I would say they are very true to size and great quality . They are currently his `` good jeans '' ... . that is until he `` accidentally '' wears them to go work in the garage . But when that happens , because it will , I will be back to purchase more ! By the way he is just over 6 ' 3 '' about 230-240lbs .
 i traveled 80 miles one day looking for the jeans i like with no luck , it did make for a nice bike ride though ! then i went online looking and i found what i was looking for at amozon these jeans are hard to get in my hometown!Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut JeansWhat a nice pair of rugged jeans . And I got them so FAST !! Thanks again.Roxann Hill
 Good product , on time and as shown in Amazon.But ... years ago , ordering the same # jean and the same size always brought the exact same fit and look . Lately , the same length , for instance , some times is a bit too long -LRB- can be fixed -RRB- or a bit too short -LRB- bad news -RRB- . The price to be paid for savings by manufacturing offshore . Lets see if with the crisis we return to the memorable `` MADE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ''
 What can I say ? They are Levis . Perfect fit , excellent quality , and the most impressive thing was the price . Unbelievable !
 517 's are the best fit for me -LRB- I 'm a bit older and looking for just a little more comfort -RRB- . I wear boots most of the time , and these do a great job of dropping over the boot and still maintaining a nice line on the leg . Plus , the little red tag says you are a real Texan and not one of those $ 150.00 / pair wannabe 's .
 a la medida , tabla de medidas excelente ...
 I bought 2 of these and man they are nice . I 'll admit the guy wearing the jean in the picture sold me . Like I went and look for all the style of Levi 's , and these attracted me the most . Although I would n't tuck in my shirt like that . But they sure look good with some chucks and or casual boots and a dress shirt , with a silver wrist watch , and a pair of shades . They are heavy , and for me kinda tight even though jean of a different brand and style with the same size , fit me perfectly . I do n't know I guess it the way they are made . But for the look , I 'll take the pain any day , yes these jean are so tight mostly in my thigh area and waist , that I do get a little discomfort pain in my lower back . I guess it the way they are design and the heaviness of the jean . Of course I am in the process of getting in shape again . So with time , these will be perfect . I do like to sag a little , but as of right now I ca n't with these . Until I lose some of that belly fat I accumulated over the years .
 These are the jeans I always buy , they are a great comfortable fit . It is also great that Amazon stocks the size I need , it 's impossible to get from the shops .
 My body was made for Levi 's brand jeans , and I 'd worn through a couple of pairs . I bought duplicate black 517s - soft but not washed out , dark , with a predictable fit . They are my new favorites . The process went smoothly . Who knew I 'd be buying clothes online ?
 I ordered these for Christmas for my 6 ' 2 '' grandson who had grown out of all his pants after checking stores and finding his size is almost impossible to find . They were perfect and he loved them .
 The Levi 's 517 Boot Cut were purchused as a replacement of the wrong ones bought at a local store , These ordered & delivered ; I was told fit greatly before & after ; washThe price for my buying , totaled out a nuff less even with shipping to come fromamazon , rather than a store , even on sale after my tax & shipping ; -LRB- as a late gift -RRB- Theonly guestion I got was about , they did not have the Levi 's cardboard shelf tagswe see on Jean 's in store .
 I love my levis . I was unaware they came in black . I bought a blue pair and black pair , Ilove them
 Just as described ! Fit & look exactly what he needed and wanted . And he said I could n't find this product ... LOLThanks !!! The Wife wrote the review ...
 These jeans fit great . The boot cut gives a good look without being sloppy . My husband looks hot in them .
 Got these as a gift for my brother , and they are the true blue classic with a great slim shape . Perfect `` date night '' jeans .
 These are the only jeans my husband will wear and we could not find them ANYWHERE . When i found them here i was happily suprised with the discount price and they look great . Would buy again from this seller .
 These jeans fit me very well and look good . One thing I noticed however is that the denim has a more coarse feeling compared to other Levi 's jeans . I would buy these again .
 IL TELL YOU I HAVE BEEN WEARING LEVI 'S FOR YEARS ON END AND THE BEST DEAL I GOT ON THESE GREAT JEANS WAS FROM MY FAVORITE STORE AMAZON
 I love these jeans . For me they are perfect . Long enough to wear with or without boots and the fit is not too tight . How can you go wrong with Levi 's ?
 I got what I ordered promptly . I wish I had ordered a different color but -- my bad . No complaints . What else can I say ?
 The jeans was just perfect , the material , size and colour , nothing to complain about , and great timing too.They fit really well , and amazon 's size chart was very helpfull .
 Style & size stayed true since the last time I bought a pair , after gettingLevi 's Men 's 527 Low Rise Boot Cut Jeanthat are nothing like they used to be that 's all a shopper can ask .
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut . Black 42 waist / 30 length . If you are short , stocky and have a big butt . These pants are perfect . They wo n't bunch up at your fat knees and they will last a long time before the zipper explodes . I suggest you buy the next size up because they will shrink after 6 months of washing , drying and severe stretching in the seat area . Great pants .
 MY FAVORITE JEANS FOR 25 YEARS . I HAVE WORN MAINLY 501 MODEL , SO I READ MANY REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING THESE 517 JEANS.AFTER THINKING FOR A LONG TIME I DECIDED TO BUY ONE SIZE BIGGER THAN USUAL . IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE.THEY ARE JUST FINE , BLACK COLOR AND ZIPPER FLY WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DETAIL FOR ME !
 This pair of Levi 's fits perfectly and the indigo color is the same as the Levi 's I wore back in the day !
 I gave these Jeans to my daughter 's friend for Christmas and he really likes them.He is real thin and wears motorcycle boots.He likes how they fit and loves the boot cut.He especially likes the rugged material .
 My order arrived in a timely fashion , they fit good and look great ... I 'm gon na get a couple more pairs .
 Levi 's 517 ` sThese Levi 's were the perfect fit . I like the fact that they are pre rinsed , which makes the fabric softer .
 Many of us do n't want to wear our Levi 's half way up our bellies . 517s are the best answer for that !
 A well tried and true blue jean that I 've been wearing for decades . The fit , finish , and quality is a good as or better than ever .
 These seemed a bit darker in person than pictured but they were a great pair of jeans for my husband . This is his favorite style of jeans and he needed a new pair of &#34; dressy jeans . &#34; Same great jeans as in the past .
 All the Levi 's I purchased for my 16 year old son were ` made to fit ' ! From the straight to boot cut , they all were a perfect fit for his personal taste . They are well made and very stylish .
 Great jeans , great price , speedy delivery as promised ! Will definitely be ordering them again since my son is so tall and slim and this is one of the only places I can find his size .
 Great basic jeans in hard to find sizes . Not much to say otherwise . They have washed up well and held up well for my long and lanky teen .
 The fit and look are great and I saved a few dollars . Will purchase more when the price is right
 love this jeans , the fabric is really good and the cut is impecable . it is original and the communication was really easy , i recieved really fast .
 I 've always wanted a ` black 527 ' but found out I could only get that in rigid black.I decided to try 517 n whao I might just decide to continue with 517 even with other colors.Just the perfect fit I love .
 Is exactly what i was looking for . . i being using this model for years , and this pair of pant are excellent
 I am a creature of habit . Being of slim build I have found the 517 Boot cut to be the perfect jean for me . I also know my size so the fit was great as received . This is not always the case when ordering over the Internet . Service was great delivered on time as expected .
 These are the best jeans Levis has to offer in my opinion . They are not light and flimsy like some jeans Levis are making these days . The medium stonewash is a great even color . They do n't look faded on the seat and thighs or dingly and dirty like so many jeans do . These jeans are rugged , comfortable and last a long , long time . On top of that they look great . These are the only jeans I will buy .
 These jeans are everything they say they are . We will definately order these jeans again when the time comes . Thanks !
 100 % recomended , i have no doubt that i am going to buy another , it is really regular fit and boot cut
 This is the only jean my husband wears . He has the hardest time finding 36x29 . This is a perfect fit for him . When he needs more I will return to amazon .
 I finally found a pear of jeans that my wife said they look good on me and after being washed still fits great
 d e m a r a v i l l a e s t e m o d e l o muy bueno
 These are the first jeans in a while that actually fit my waist size , inseam and the leg openings are perfect .
 These jeans fit well but the denim seems less hefty than the denim of the same 517s from 5 years ago .
 I received my pants very quickly . I was concerned that my size would be too short for boots . I was pleasantly surprised that the designer was thoughtful about the shape and length for this item &#34; after &#34; several washings . Pants are about 1/2 inch longer than the average pants which make them perfect for cowboy boots . Pants are also very comfortable . JCD
 Noticed that they even have an extra pair of belt loops compared to my previous order . They are sturdy & dependable .
 The jeans were great ! The price was right , they were delivered in a timely fashion , and I lost a few lbs to get in them and I look good . lol . I recommend this company .
 These are the only jeans my son likes . He is tall and I have trouble finding his size in local stores and I could not find a better price .
 The jean came very quickly . They were the proper color , size , and cut . The packaging was excellent , and so was the quality of the jeans .
 Perfect price and fit for my husband . I would recommend this jean to any &#34; baby boomer &#34; who loves boot cut jeans.The jean has not changed at all good quality material and the right color . Thank you .
 If you know your size they fit . I do n't understand the reviews that say the sizes are wrong . Will buy again .
 was just what i expected ... very pleased with purchase . I like the fact that you can get 29 inseam . You can not get that in the store . No need to get them hemmed !
 his pants in overall line is still very good , sturdy , feels soft to the touch on the skin , the profile legendary cutting adds a touch of elegance , and even after several washings the fabric remains the same and does not shrink , the only thing I did not like the pants is that they have deteriorated the quality of the clips and metal buttons , formerly of copper and bronze , and now this are of aluminum and does not look good , however I recommend buying them are very good at the price .
 These came a little long , maybe an inch or two . Seeing as many others have noticed this is a problem with this fit , I suggest going one inseam size lower . I ordered a 30 '' and they fit more like a 31-32 '' . Other than the sizing , they are great jeans , and still look great on me . The boot cut allows the extra length to bunch up a little around the shoes , so you do n't really notice it . It actually looks good.I wish they sold these in a low rise version , as I do n't like hiking them up to where you might put dress pants or khakis . They stopped selling the 517 in a low rise though , so I 'm happy to wear them as is , great fit .
 I have always appreciated the fit and quality of Levi jeans . The boot cut has a closer fit around the knee with comfortable room in the hips and waist . What Levi Strauss needs to understand is that there is a huge population of men out there that has a 31 inch inseam . Men between 5 ' 9 &#34; and 6 ' fall into this size range . My growth did not stop at 30 &#34; inseam , and did not make it to 32 &#34; . So I either buy high water jeans that show my socks , or I let the cuffs drag the floor which signicantly reduces the life of the jeans . I liked the fit enough that I spent an additional $ 10 to get them hemmed to 31 .
 product arrived as expected on time , the product was as expected and the quality was as you 'd expect to find in a brick & mortar store .
 Great fitting . I usually buy the 527 style but they did n't have black in that style . Ordered a 517 instead and love the fitting .
 My grandson loves these jeans , since he 's rather tall we were glad to find Levi 's makes great jeans in his size . Strange as it may seem , many brands of jeans do not come in a 34in length .
 As an active equestrian rider , and a woman of 59 years , I 'm ALWAYS looking for comfortable jeans that sit at my waist -- I do n't like women 's jeans at all - the fabric in women 's jeans seems flimsy , and the low-rise , hip-hugging jeans for riding or leisure wear feels uncomfortable . The men 's Levis and men 's Lee jeans are very comfortable , and they can handle my active life -- for me , men 's Levis 517 bootcut jeans have best variety for colors , and toughest quality in fabric .
 Nice one . . Boot Cut with nice fit.Ordered the Jeans with 29L but got it 3inch longer . So I had to do alteration , usually I order my pants with 29L and it fits perfect on me .
 Levis 517 's fit me better than any other jeans that I 've bought . Gon na stick with them . I wear a 38 waist , 36 inseam . Have bought several pair over the past six months from various places and they all fit the same . Good quality control !
 BASTANTE BIEN . BUENA CALIDAD DEL PANTALON . ME QUEDO MUY BIEN . TANTO EL LARGO COMO EN CINTURA . EXCELENTE COMPRA A UDS . GRACIAS .
 The jeans are a good deep color . Wish they were n't quite as thin as jean material seems to be getting , but seems they are all like that now . Overall a good pair of jeans.These are hard to find in 36x36 , so I 'm glad Amazon carries them .
 Perfect fit right out of the box . Started wearing immediately , stitches , pockets , zipper perfectly in place . Survived several washes good as new .
 Good price , perfect quality . Very good model for young and old-aged people . Gorgeous color . Classic zipper . I 'm satisfied ! I recommend to buy it .
 I like this style and they are getting very hard to find . The price here was the best I found , got in a timely manner . I 'm happy with my purchase .
 Purchased these jeans for my husband . They have a nice fit and look very good on . No baggy butt like the relaxed fit jeans .
 I usually have a hard time finding good bootcut jeans with the right fit in the retail stores . If the color/wash/fabric is right , the size isnt . If the size is right , the fit is too loose at the seat and thighs . Now that my favorite pair of jeans is past its prime , I started looking for a new pair to replace it . After hunting all stores in and around my area and trying all available bootcuts in my size , I was very disappointed . That is , until I found a pair of Levi 's 517 Blue Ox in the local Macy 's store . This was the first bootcut I found in the last 3 years that fit me perfectly . Since I already had a pair of jeans that was of a very similar color , I came online and started looking for the correct color in that fit . Unfortunately , it wasnt that easy finding one online . Kohls , Dillards and others had Levi 's 517s , but they werent the same ones I saw in the store . Apart from Macys and Amazon , no other site -LRB- including Levi 's own site -RRB- had the same fit in Rancher Light color I was looking for . I could have ordered at Macys website , but my past experience with Amazon was stellar and so it my first choice . Even then I was a little skeptical if the photos were close to how the jeans looked in reality . Since amazon had a free returns on this one , I went ahead with the order . The product , as always with Amazon , came 6 days ahead of their estimated delivery date . The jeans is , in fact , very close to the pictures on the website and the fit is PERFECT !! Thanks to Levi 's for the perfect color and fit and KUDOS to amazon for the perfect shopping experience !
 Finally Levi went back to 7 belt loops instead of the five . Makes a big difference for those of us that work for a living .
 I bought the 517 as I prefer this cut to any other one of the Levi 's catalog , I place it even above the so famous 501 . I 'm fully satisfied
 I love these jeans . The wash and fit are great . That being said , they did arrive with a hole in the seat and the seam is a little crooked on the inside left leg . I really do n't care though because they fit so good .
 It is hard to find male , black , slim fit , boot cut jeans . Believe me I searched many places both on-line and local retail outlets . Finally I found these on Amazon and they were just right . Great fit , looks good , and the price was reasonable . I highly recommend them .
 We will take these to alterations but they were about 5 inches too long . Otherwise they are very nice .
 True to size , did n't shrink , and minimal wrinkling . Love the variety of sizing - son is tall and thin , and hard to fit , but Levis 517 made it happen !
 Bought these jeans for my husband . They fit very well and look nice . The shipment arrived on time . I was happy with my purchase .
 I ordered these jeans an exrta size longer becaause I wanted a high cuff . Got exactally that . Perfect !!! Now I 'm looking for a white pair
 Well , they 're Levi 's . There you go . Best jeans on the market . Last forever and fit great . The black does fade to gray quicker than I would like , but that 's probably because I wear only black , all the time . So ...
 I have worn Levi jenas for the last 16years , i am relatively tall guy and seldom get my size in the store , Amazon provides me my size and then quality as well .
 Purchased two pairs of Levi 's Boot Cut Jeans for my husband , the Jeans are very hard to find in the stores . Since my husband is tall , it is hard to find 36x36 .
 These pants are very well put together and I am a big fan of Levi 's pants durability which is what prompted me to purchase these .
 I am a woman but men 's jeans fit me better . These are very comfortable . My jeans do NOT get hung up on my boots as they do with jeans that are not boot cut .
 These boot cut jeans by my favorite jeans maker are exactly what I needed.When I ordered my Harley Davidson boots , I needed pants for when I wear them and these ones are the only ones that fit on the outside where others ca n't . Shopping local yields nothing like these , just junk not worth the money.Quality is what I 've come to expect from Levi 's , outstanding with fit absolutely perfect.More orders coming soon for these.Shipping was prompt , making this buyer very happy.Thank you to everyone for helping this lonely guy that hardly can get out to shop by bringing them to me.Again , THANK YOU VERY MUCH !!
 I thought these were more on the casual side , but after putting them on , they can pull off a nice look . Very comfy , one day to break in . No frays , quality zipper . Dimensions were perfect . Overall color is a shade or two darker than in the picture . Awesome , new favorite pair .
 If you have a problem with jeans bagging in the rear , then these jeans are for you ! They are a great fit and very comfortable ! My husband loves them !
 Well , its a good jean , everybody know the levi 's quality , the item arive in perfect conditions . . so nothing more to say . .
 Perfect fit , every time . 517 's are difficult for me to find locally , but buying on line thru Amazon is best for me .
 These are like they used to make them ! More belt loops , great fabric - love them ! Ca n't wait to order more of these !
 I was having a really hard time finding the boot cut Levis - no one seems to carry them anymore . These are just what I wanted . They look and fit good .
 Bought these for my husband and they fit true to size , maybe a little bit long but not so much that he wo n't wear them . He love them , they look good so I love them ! Great Pants !
 I ordered these jeans for my 16yo son & he really liked them . The only thing he would have preferred was a lower rise , but he 's wearing them without complaints . : -RRB-
 They 're good sellers and the product is very good , I like so much this jean . Ellos son muy buenos vendedores , el producto llego rapido a mis manos y era el esperado , los recomiendo ampliamente .
 I wear Levi jeans every day . Levi 's are the only jeans I will wear.I have worn Levi jeans for the past twenty -LRB- 20 -RRB- years ... or longer.Levi jeans are great ... in fact , i 'm wearin 'em right now ...
 Sent me what I wanted . 15 more 12 more 11 more 9 more 7 more 5 more 3 more done
 This is a very good price for this product , it 's the second one I 've ordered for my son .
 This is a great jacket made with quality fabric . It 's the crisp , shiny kind of wool , not the itchy , fuzzy kind . The three-button design and the sculpted fit suit my frame well . Great blazer for tall guys .
 These T shirts are the best around , I 'm serious , they are very strong and very soft . A couple friends of mine work in the silkscreening business and told me that the `` Hanes Beefy T '' was THE best out there , so I ordered 6 of them on their advice . I 've never seen T shirts this nice , they are the most comfortable , strongest , and they feel like they will last forever . I 'm so happy with these shirts , they are awesome .
 These are great t-shirts and my boys love them . They are active in sports and there is nothing better than having these shirts to wear . They take the wear and tear and come back for more ! I highly recommend them !
 I was thinking it of using it for my tennis . Unfortunately there was no clue saying it dint have pockets . Anyways its a good shorts for great price .
 If you go to the gym or play ball a lot and need a couple pair of shorts so you do n't need to do laundry every other day , these athletic shorts are perfect . They 're thin but durable . I got them on sale for like $ 10 so they do the trick . Do n't get me wrong its not like you 'll look like a dork at the gym , but if you 're looking for something super flashy , then these are n't them .
 Nice shorts that match almost everything . My boyfriend loves to wear them around the house . Great pair of shorts for an extremely great price ! So buy a couple pairs just to have around !
 no pockets , but yann will wear them all summer.yeehaw .
 My son likes these to sleep and wear under pants in winter . They are perfect , washing easily , and retaining their size and color .
 I like the shorts . The price is excellent . The shorts were a little thinner than I imagined . But I am very satisfied with the purchase .
 I have the scrimmage dazzle too they re thin but durable and for 10.00 cool ! no pockets ok for me , lightweight shortsexcellent and Roomy my favorites great price buying of couple more
 My boyfriend says that these are his favorite shorts . Nice and roomy with some breathing room .
 I LIKE THIS BRIEF CASE MADE OF REAL GOOD QUALITY LEATHER , VERY LIGHT AND LOOKS PROFESIONAL , I WILL USE IT TO TRAVEL OVERSEAS AND ALSO FOR TAKING DIFF IMPORTANT DOCUMENT PLACE TO PLACE
 This bag goes with me everyday . It carries my laptop , business cards and several magazines and files . Everything fits well if you pack properly . The quality is solid and it 's built very well . The only 2 complaints I have are as follows : - The leather gets worn around the edges but I think that 's to be expected with as much use as I put it through - Where the strap attaches to the bag -LRB- metal hooks and eyelets -RRB- it makes a very annoying squeaking sound when I walk . It 's happened since day one , I 've yet to try to fix it though , it may be simple.All in all , it 's a solid bag for the price - you could n't go wrong .
 The bag is made from leather of decent quality and has a nice , neat , semiformal appearance . My laptop has a 15.6 '' screen and it fits nicely into the compartment . The padding in this compartment is minimal compared to other bags I 've seen , but I am confident in it and I do n't worry about it . Besides , the bag also has hard and rigid edges which provide extra protection . There is modest space for extra stuff , but I manage to fit in several files , my power adapter , and one or two smallish books . The shoulder strap is made of strong woven material -LRB- not leather -RRB- and has a nice nonslip shoulder pad . All in all I really like the bag .
 I purchased this to replace a Kenneth Cole that busted at the shoulder strap connection after 4 years . This was probably $ 50 less and is a much nicer bad in my opinion . It does n't look like it would suffer from the same issue . Nice leather and styling . Very happy .
 I bought this bag to carry a 17.3 '' widescreen HP Pavilion dv7 laptop . It is probably the smallest case you can squeeze the thing into , the laptop fits very tight in both width and height . It fits , though , and the bag does not lose the look with it inside . There 's just no space left to grab the laptop when I pull it out , extra half an inch definitely would not hurt.The work and material quality is great . The case is rather lightweight itself , its top is strong and does not bend when the case is reasonably heavy loaded.The laptop compartment does not offer much protection , the padding inside is thinner than in most sleeves . The interior lining is made of soft cloth . It will prevent scratches , but hardly anything else.The front compartment is not padded . It provides just enough space to carry a power adapter , mouse , some papers , magazines and occasionally a large book . There are separate pockets for a PDA , CD sleeves , and pens.Overall , a great case for its price . Five stars .
 My husband loves this case for work . Fits his computer and all his papers . Love the color and is very sturdy
 This briefcase is excellent for 15-inch laptop computers , a day planner , cellphone , and a light volume of paperwork.The build quality is outstanding ! I 've seen this model selling elsewhere for nearly $ 300.00 . So buying the Lexington fromAmazon saved a pile of money . The appearance is clean and is not cluttered with useless straps and cumbersome buckles.This is quality all the way ! I 've had several people in my office ask about it . And the russet brown leather is really beautiful.Get rid of the backpack and start looking like the professional you are !
 I was impress with the quality . I was skeptical ordering this on line without looking at it in person . I did n't look cheat . I am happy with the product .
 This is a beautiful , durable , quality item . I recommend this briefcase to anyone . For those wondering if it will fit a 17 '' macbook pro , YES ! My 17 '' macbook pro fits perfectly with plenty of space for the power cable and other documents . It fits the equivalent of up to 3 17 '' MacBooks with room to spare .
 I have a 17 inch Mac and was looking for briefcase for it -- I was actually positively surprised when I received this -- it looks great - space is very good and very elegant - just have for 1 day - but very satisfied - happy with the purchase - recommend .
 Good quality for the price . I shopped around for a bit and found this product was the best price since it included the stockings , outfit , hat and stethoscope . The outfit does not cover up the butt much so heads up on that , you might want to keep this one for around the house ; - -RRB-
 Really do love this item , only had a few complaints ! The first being , the belt was sooooo long . I had to cut off the end and make a new hole for the buckle , which was easy enough . I also went ahead and cut the garters that came attached , off , and wear it with my own separate red garter underneath . Item looks like it 'll be easily washed , and it would be adorable for a pinup shoot !

 Jeans are a little tight in the thighs for my husband . It did n't come with packing slip so I 'm hoping I can return them !
 Good quality but I wish I had done more research on the colors . Ordered rigid because of the look online however the denim itself is rigid .
 Yes , these Levi 's are everything I had hoped they would be and More . Perfect fit , and I 'm very pleased tofinally have a BLACK pair ! Amazon 's got another winner !
 My wife thinks it 's funny that I rate my jeans with numbers , but , as a former 505 's man , I now prefer the 517 's 'cause ride my horses more and were my boots more ... plus , they just , plain feel good when they 're on me ...
 Who does n't love Levis ? These are great ! My son was happy on Christmas day and so were we . Happy Holidays !
 It is great to find the exact size , color , and fit you want in a Levi 's jean , and also get it on time .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean , Medium Stonewash , 38x29They fit perfectly . Will probably order more in a couple months .
 Needed a size that few brick & mortar stores keep in stock . Amazon had style I wanted in the size that I wanted at a good price !
 These blue jeans where a great color and a perfect fit . Glad I ordered them . They were a present for my son
 Ordered these for my boyfriend , they run extremely small , he regularly wears a 32/34 had to send back and get a 36/34 . Other than that they 're great jeans .
 Finally a pair of Levi 's not only affordable , but a pair that is the real deal . . not seconds or blemished . . but cut perfectly . . The best I have bought in years . . Thanks . . and `` I 'll be back for more ''
 They fit just perfectly and I am very happy to not only get the bestdeal around but beat the sales tax . Good old Levi 's rigid , bootcut jeans have been my all-time favorite jeans my whole life , andI just turned 60 . Got 'em within a week , free shipping faster thanexpected , so that was cool , too . Amazon rules !
 The pants are great . I can not seem to find them in stores like Kohls or Target where I usually shop . I 'm not skinny as far as a skinny person goes but I have thinner legs than a lot of guys . These seem to be not as loose in the butt and thighs . I usually get the 505 's but they are cut a little bigger assuming tree trunk size legs . I have runners legs and these work . If you have big footballer legs , forget about it .
 Finally jeans that fit like the old Levis , these are the old quality heavy denim stuff not that wimpy pre-wash thin as paper junk denim . I would highly recommend these jeans to anyone who 's familiar with real Levis .
 Very easy shopping . I 'm familiar with the pants so it 's just a matter of price and convenience.Sitting at the desk for a few second beats driving to the store , finding out they do n't have the 517 in my size and driving back home . I 've always had trouble just finding the 517 at stores and shopping online sure makes things easier . The pants themselves are everything they 've always been , good fitting and tough.It 's nice to add the stonewash to my collection of darker denim so I do n't look the same every day.I was upprised how fast they came and that 's a big plus too .
 These jeans fit to size perfectly -LRB- for me -RRB- , are comfortable to wear , and have adequate material to reach a guy 's waist ... not hip-huggers . I 'll buy more of these ! Not a deal-breaker by any means but I would prefer them to not have the size label outside ... it seems Levi 's always does this .
 Amazon did not mentioned in the description that this pair of jeans is a Shrink-to-Fit fabric . No question on the quality . . it 's still an amazing jeans , the great Levi 's jeans , never goes out of style ... Take 31 '' waistline x 30 '' inseam if your size is 30 x 30 .
 Levi 's are always the best jeans around . Levi 's Boot Cut are the only kind my husband will wear . Always a good fit .
 I am happy with the jeans and how they fit , but usually when I get 517 's , they are really stiff and then I get to break them in . This pair was already like pre-washed , just differnt than what I am used to , but I still like them and will wear them . Maybe I have to look into differnt types and find exactly what I am looking for next time . Thank you
 I 've been wearing 517 's for a good , long time now , and I love 'em ! The problem is that most of my local stores that sell them -- and very few of them do -- price them highly and also drastically limit the selection compared to the more popular 501 's and 550 's . Additionally , these jeans are often skipped over when it comes to the big sales . Well , shopping for them on Amazon is a decision I should have made long ago . The price here is hard to beat.As for the jeans themselves , they are of the rugged quality that Levi 's is known for . They fit like the product photo shows
 Have had these jeans for a few weeks now & am very satisfied.The flair from the knee down is discrete and does not look like the 70 's bell-bottoms . The fit on top was precisely as marked . The length seems about 1/2 inch longer than sized on the 501 's . Was formerly utilizing 501 slim fit jeans but found that could not place them over motorcyle boots . The 501s were great for rainy rides , but look too much like a cowboy , when tucked into the boots .
 As always , good shopping at amazon.com . Its always a problem finding the right length jeans for me . I found that in this levi 517 Boot cut jean , it feels good to finally find a jean that is not too short . A fact that i would have loved to know before i bought this jeans , is the leg opening size . This jean is very tight around the thigh area . I would just like a bit more details on the product a next time round . Other than that , it always a good shopping experience on Amazon .
 The length and waist were perfect . The quality of Levi jeans was the same as they had always been , good
 I always had to keep pulling up my previous pairs of Levi 's -LRB- any model -RRB- because they only had FIVE belt loops . A key ring and cell phone are not that heavy . I remember growing up with Levi 's having SEVEN belt loops and a heavier canvas . I was pleasantly surprised to see the ` new ' Levi 's 517 now have seven belt loops again . I started to buy a different model , but they still only have the five loops.I just bought a couple of these pairs from Amazon . I did check online at Kohls and their current batch of 517 's still show 5 loops . I will have to wait until I go to the store to see if their stock has been updated . Kohls prices are higher than Amazon , but I will recheck when they go on sale . I still check Amazon first for almost all my purchases.Overall , I like my new Levi 's jeans . I will compare them with older ones to see if the canvas really is slightly thinner . Outsourcing manufacturing almost always results in poorer quality and non-standard sizing . It has 100 % results in putting Americans out of work . I try to buy American whenever I can -- hopefully it will catch on.There is another issue appearing after I washed my new jeans with my old ones . It should n't have made a difference , but the new ones are now covered with fine fluffy hairs . I will have to use a lint brush when I take them out of the dryer for now . Although it may just be a ` break in -- first washings ' issue.Overall , I rate these jeans 4 stars . I will have to wait for a few machine washings to see how the color holds up . I may be old fashioned , but buying jeans looking like they are 1/2 wore out or have holes in them is ` less than optimal ' .
 I ran around town to find my husband Levi 517 's in size 35x32 for Christmas . In the stores , there were stacks of all different sorts of Levi 's to go through . Finally I came home and ordered them through Amazon and received exactly what he wanted . These Levi 's fit perfectly and look great . Very happy they come in off size waists . Thank you for making my job easier and receiving nice fitting jeans .
 I 've grown up wearing Levi 's and in particular 517 's in my adult life . I do like that Levi has added additional belt loops in the past year or so . Over the years Levi has cut some corners in manufacturing , but not enough to discourage me from continuing to buy their stonewashed 517 's . I like the stonewashed jeans since they are ready to wear , unlike the rigid indigo Levi 's that have to be washed several times to soften them up.I am buying more and more items from Amazon for the free shipping and competitive prices . It just saves a lot of time going to a retailer only to find out they do n't have my size or what I want . Even with Amazon collecting California sales tax , I figure the time and gas saved from having to go to a retailer is well worth it .
 I bought a pair of these in 29X34 and they are great . Fit perfect , really like the cut , lighter weight material but not too light , should hold up well . Just wish they would reduce the size of the internal tag -- I 've actually had to tuck it back into the pants a few times after putting them on !
 Finally figured out what cut and size I like , but the only place I can find them is the internet . Great pants .
 These were ordered off Amazon when I could not find them locally . I found the pants and they are describer perfectly and fit exactly as I had wanted them to . I will buy more in the future because they were perfect .
 Completamente satisfecha con el producto , exactamente igual a lo que ofrecieron . LLego en el tiempo estimado que prometieron . Ninguna queja , volveria a comprar de nuevo .
 The Levi jeans were just like I expected . The fit was perfect and received them in just a few days . Thanks !!
 The quality of the denim is lighter , so the good fit disappears by the end of the day . Otherwise , I like 'em !
 Hubby dearest was so happy to find boot cut Levi jeans at Amazon as it seems most stores have quit carrying this style of jean . He likes to wear boot cut jeans and Levi jeans are his favorite brand.No complaints about the fit or wearability either . Ordered two more pairs of jeans today as he 's a happy camper.Recommend .
 Good deal on the jeans and speedy shipping . My first pair of boot cut jeans . My girl friend really likes them on me . I got the dark blue -LRB- rinse -RRB- . Fit good and comfortable .
 My skinny son is 54 years old and will not wear any other jeans - only 517 , boot cut Levi 's so I know what to buy for Christmas and Birthdays . I found a perfect fit for my skinny husband also .
 jeans were shipped quick , arrived in good shape the medium stonewash has that worn look most people want , I am pleased with the purchase .
 It 's very good ! 100 % cottonThe higher rise sits comfortably at the waist.A fit you want from a brand you trustFit width & length ; !
 non common size request was delivered promply before Christmas . My son was very happy with the fit and color .
 Great product ... my dad was very pleased . He had not been able to find the 517 .
 These were a birthday gift for my son and I had them sent directly to him at college . He loved them and they fit great ! Good quality for the price . He liked the fit of the boot cut .
 These are great jeans for us gals , too , especially if you like to wear a true black color . I dress them up with a feminine camisole and heels , and have got many compliments on them .
 Exactly what my hubby wants . It 's difficult to find his size in our local stores . Very happy Amazon now has Levi 's in his size .
 I love my new bootcuts . I received them quickly , They fit perfectly . Thank you .
 The only problem was I had was that I had to have them hemmed 2 &#34; so as not to walk on the cuff . I would have ordered them shorter but they were not offered in the waist size I needed . The waist fit perfect and having them hemmed was not that big of a deal . It coast me $ 12.00 to have them hemmed .
 I love being able to find the 517 's on line and not having to run all over town for the style and size I need .
 If you promise not to tell anybody , I wear lined jeans from eddie bauer or llbean when it gets cooler . I wear these when it gets warmer . True to size , do n't shrink too much .
 These were a secret gift for my brother-in-law . He keeps complaining that he must do laundry every other day because he only has one pair of work pants , but then he just will not go get more or let anyone buy him any ! So , I got the size off of the one pair of jeans he owns -LRB- laundry is at my house -RRB- and I bought several other pairs that were similarly worn . I sneak in a new pair about once a week and so far he has n't noticed that he now has three pair of work pants . When I slip in the new ones , I put them in the dirty clothes hamper he uses . I wonder if he knows his pants are multiplying yet ?
 They arived bfore time , APO adress , in Afghanistan ,1 week took it to arive here , im suprised , and they fit good , i dont hawe no words
 Great black on black bootcut jeans . They have even gone back to adding two additional belt loops a feature that went away several years ago .
 Fits well , my husband loves them , quality control met , consistent sizing , and look good on . Will order more as needed
 My son wears a 36 Waist x 36 lenght which is very hard to find . The Levi 's Men 's 517 are about the only jeans he likes and these fit him perfectly . They were shipped very quickly and the price was excellent . They were a birthday gift and he loves them .
 The jeans were pre washed and fit just like I wanted . They were really softer than I expected . I would buy this product again .
 I was so happy with the quality and fit ; I ordered 3 more pairs ! I will be good on jeans for awhile . The price was good too .
 Great quality and a lower price , for me is like a tailored jean , I 'm happy with this product . No more to say thanks to all
 After numerous failed attempts at the 527 's on amazon I finally got a clue and got these jeans . They are PERFECT ... great fit ... weight ... etc. ... just like the jeans I wore in high school 20 years ago ... . I 'm already thinking about a second pair . The light rancher is the perfect color ... . As for the 527 's MADE IN BANGLADESH ... amazing they could ever bear the levis name ... perhaps they were counterfeit . Thanks amazon for my true and needed exchange . The original pair of jeans I ordered ... yes the 527 ... was complete trash . These 517 's are real jeans for real cowboys ... and I 'm not one ... but I do wear a ton of boots ...
 Exellent product
 My skinny son is 54 years old and will not wear any other jeans - only 517 , boot cut Levi 's so I know what to buy for Christmas and Birthdays . I found a perfect fit for my skinny husband also .
 I ordered these jeansLevi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jeanfor a Christmas gift a short time before Christmas . I knew the size . I was somewhat concerned that I would not get them on time for Christmas The package came just before Christmas , and the jeans were exactly as pictured , nicely packaged -LRB- each pair separately enclosed in plastic bag -RRB- , the right size and color . I was very pleased , as was the recipient of the gift !
 The jeans were a Christmas gift and a style regularly worn by the recipient . They were a perfect fit . They are hard to find locally so we ordered from the Internet . The red tag on the back pocket did not say `` Levis '' and I have never seen this before . Is it significant ?
 Wow . These are great blue jeans , and they come in 38 long which is what he wears . HE wanted the boot cut , and a 34 waist was large enough . Usually he wears a 36 , , but I ordered 34 and they fit just right . Great looking , great price .
 I bought two pairs in two orders - both were perfect - exactly as I expected . On time . Good buy at a decent price .
 These jeans are tough but good looking and fit well . Amazon 's price is great , they are a good value for the money , and we always get prompt delivery and easy return if size is not right .
 the product is excellente , but needs to be taggedcorrectly , I order 34x30 tag say so , but real size was36x32 try buying them from differet source , and same thing never can get athe right size until i took a mesuring tape to the store and mesure before buing them !!
 I love those Jeans . . nice shape and denim . I ordered different colors from this pant and I love them all . it is comfortable , and have a nice leg openning that falls around the boot .
 I have been wearing 517 's for as long as I can remember . They fit perfectly and have remained unchanged for years .
 I 've grown frustrated by the lack of good quality/reasonably priced jeans in the market today . At some point , the Levis brand started to suffer in terms of quality/value for the dollar . Do n't remember exactly when that happened , but I started to buy my jeans from Banana Republic . Over time , they stopped making the style I grew to rely on . This created a 7-10 stretch where I could n't seem to find a good pair of jeans . Most recently , I purchased a pair of Lucky jeans - ridiculously over priced . When those began to fail , I tried Levis again and bought these . For a third of the price of Lucky Jeans , these Levis boot-cut jeans are really nice . They have a really substantial feel/weight to them and I could n't be happier with the purchase . I was so pleased , I ended up buying a second pair .
 Levis 517 Boot Cut Jeans are just as advertized . Good fit and a perfect boot cut . I highly recommend them for anyone who needs boot cut jeans .
 It 's a very good pant for my husband . Nothing too special or fancy ; he is very satisfied because he got what he expected
 execelente producto muy buena calidad , el pantalon vino en un excelente empaque y llego super rapido deverdad no tengo quejas lo recomiendo
 He looks hot in them , thanks ! What more can I say ? They did n't stay on for very long ... ca n't share any more details .
 I was somewhat hesitant to order Levi 's online but I could n't be happier with this order ! The jeans are exactly as described and fit perfectly . They are genuine Levi 's and are of the highest quality - not seconds . I ca n't recommend this seller highly enough .
 Just what I expected . After soaking and drying , the fit and feel was as anticipated ... just like the good , old days !!! -LRB- I would estimate that length and waist both shrunk by about one inch ... as Mama warned , some 50 years ago -RRB-
 i got two pairs for my husband . levis are the only thing that fit him right . They make him look like he has a butt !
 I like this product because it fits very well and is comfortable . I recommend it to others . Good for those who like to wear boots .
 Finally found levis that were the correct size , if they are still available I will order more in the future
 Great pants . I wish there was a size 33 by 35 . I always have a hard time with pants size . I can get a length 34 , which shrink after a wash or a 36 that drags because there too long . But there is no length 35 in pants , so I do n't have much of choice .
 Excellent product the product I come very well and it is what was waiting of , I come in time , good
 I bought they for my boyfriend who had lost a bit of weight and all his pants were falling down , but these fit and stay up -LRB- Thank God -RRB-
 My husband loves the fit and the price.Great deal.You can dress them up or down!Look no further.Great looking jean , for the price .
 I 've been wearing these for years.They do tend to fade easily so wash them inside out and use a detergent product for black fabrics .
 I bought these as a gift for a friend who has worn this style for years . Good quality , good fit , good style .
 Great jeans.Classical style.Low price.Wearing only jeans , levis always loved.Happy New Year!Amazon Forever!I love it .
 This hard to find style arrived on time . These classic jeans fit just the way they should . Going back for more colors .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Slim Fit Jean is leg looks like so long , . . but lap so tight but leg looks like so long . .
 My husband like it . . although I have to cut the length a little bit . . He said he may buy more in the future . . Hopefully they have shorter length then .
 They are Levis what more needs to be said ? Theyre the only jeans im buying from now on . They fit great and last 2-5 times longer than any other jeans ive bought .
 I use to wear the Levis low boot cut , but they discontinue to sell the color I want . After I give this one a try , I like it so much .
 If you know your size they fit . I do n't understand the reviews that say the sizes are wrong . Will buy again .
 Very high quality . Several pairs have consistent fit . Have bought and worn these 517 boot cut jeans for several years .
 My husband LOVES these jeans . They are a GREAT FIT , especially in the seat . The legs are n't too wide in the thighs and the bootcut bottom make a terrific silhouette . I like how he looks in them and he says they are REALLY COMFORTABLE . They look best in the darker color and are a good pair of `` dress jeans '' as well as versatile . We are ordering more . Ladies , get him these jeans !
 I 've worn Levi 's for over 50 years . From the days when you had to roll up the cuffs because they only had one length to super bells in the 70 's and now my favorite 517 's . They are always true to size and the workmanship is always excellent . The service at Amazon is always great too . What more can I say , I am one satisfied customer .
 These boot cut Levis have always been my favorite jeans . I had not had any in a while , so when my order arrived I immediately tried them on . I forgot how well they fit , and they are really stylish . Awesome . Will be ordering more .
 Authentic , just as described . Fast delivery . I am very satisfied with purchase . Smooth , one stop purchase . Husband will be very happy on Christmas day ! Thank you .
 My grandson loves these jeans , since he 's rather tall we were glad to find Levi 's makes great jeans in his size . Strange as it may seem , many brands of jeans do not come in a 34in length .
 todo salio perfecto , tanto el envio como el paquete recibido , estan esplendidas , la hora de llegada fue la establecida por el vendedor
 Quality jeans , but not made in the USA.Arrived quickly and each pair were individually bagged in plastic.Good fit , for me .
 Fit well at the waist and look good . Last a lot longer than most most jeans and seem to get more and more comfortable the more you wear them .
 These are great jeans , they do tend to run a little big , both on length and waist . The color was a lot more bluer then it looks in the picture , so be weary of that it . It was too country , and I needed more rock and roll , if you know what I mean.Pros
 I was a bit concerned about this purchase . My husband likes the boot cut style and that was an excellent choice for my purchase . I have zero compliants other then I wish I 'd bought more !
 they were exactly what we were looking for . the orginal 517 , these are my hubby 's most favoritie , they also hold up better than the other styles seem to
 Will have to wash several times for them to fit . I buy this size all the time from other retailers and they are n't this big . Like the color and the style . They just run big I guess . Mainly in the length . Would buy again , just a smaller size .
 The fit is nice , the color is holding up through the wash . I am glad they have different sizes then the stores . Very hard to find 33 x 36 !
 I like the way these jeans fit.The are also comfortable.The ones I have purchased previously have been durable .
 These jeans come washed so they are soft , supple and ready to wear . They are pre-shrunk so order the size you wear . I choose boot-cut jeans because I wear 12 '' - shaft western boots . Levies are the only jeans I wear because they fit well , look good , and get better with age .
 These jeans are perfect for the guy who wants to wear boots and not look like a geek or a thug . Just the right combination of loose and fitted .
 This is my first pair of Levi 517 's and I have to say I am very impressed . They sit on my natural waist -LRB- not low-rise like the 527 's -RRB- , and are fitted in the seat and thigh , and then flare out below the knee to fall on the boot . I 'm 6 ' 3 '' 190lbs and have a 36 waist and 34 inseam and it fit perfectly . Hard to find jeans these days that sit on the waist ... I 'm not a fan of the low-rise look or feel , so these jeans were a great find .
 Came to Amazon to order these jeans for my husband since no one ever has his size , 36x36 . I was pleasantly surprised because I did order two of these in different colors , Rancher Light and Rinse , both of which were the perfect colors . Perfect light colored jean and perfect dark colored jean . My husband and I are very hard to fit in jeans and tops so when something works we often get multiples , the problem however is that sometimes we buy the exact same thing in a different color and they fit totally different . Not these ! These jeans were great and the same fit ! Some people might not be able to appreciate that as much as I , but I was very grateful . It was a risk I had to take since his size is so common , but with free returns I had to take advantage . The boot leg is also very subtle but incredibly flattering . He does wear boots but of course they are n't necessary . I would say they are very true to size and great quality . They are currently his `` good jeans '' ... . that is until he `` accidentally '' wears them to go work in the garage . But when that happens , because it will , I will be back to purchase more ! By the way he is just over 6 ' 3 '' about 230-240lbs .
 These are the jeans I always buy , they are a great comfortable fit . It is also great that Amazon stocks the size I need , it 's impossible to get from the shops .
 My body was made for Levi 's brand jeans , and I 'd worn through a couple of pairs . I bought duplicate black 517s - soft but not washed out , dark , with a predictable fit . They are my new favorites . The process went smoothly . Who knew I 'd be buying clothes online ?
 I ordered these for Christmas for my 6 ' 2 '' grandson who had grown out of all his pants after checking stores and finding his size is almost impossible to find . They were perfect and he loved them .
 The Levi 's 517 Boot Cut were purchused as a replacement of the wrong ones bought at a local store , These ordered & delivered ; I was told fit greatly before & after ; washThe price for my buying , totaled out a nuff less even with shipping to come fromamazon , rather than a store , even on sale after my tax & shipping ; -LRB- as a late gift -RRB- Theonly guestion I got was about , they did not have the Levi 's cardboard shelf tagswe see on Jean 's in store .
 I love my levis . I was unaware they came in black . I bought a blue pair and black pair , Ilove them
 Just as described ! Fit & look exactly what he needed and wanted . And he said I could n't find this product ... LOLThanks !!! The Wife wrote the review ...
 These jeans fit great . The boot cut gives a good look without being sloppy . My husband looks hot in them .
 Got these as a gift for my brother , and they are the true blue classic with a great slim shape . Perfect `` date night '' jeans .
 These are the only jeans my husband will wear and we could not find them ANYWHERE . When i found them here i was happily suprised with the discount price and they look great . Would buy again from this seller .
 Excellent transaction on hard to find size and style Levi Jeans.Reasonable price and quick shipping.I 'm very pleased with this purchase !
 i traveled 80 miles one day looking for the jeans i like with no luck , it did make for a nice bike ride though ! then i went online looking and i found what i was looking for at amozon these jeans are hard to get in my hometown!Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut JeansWhat a nice pair of rugged jeans . And I got them so FAST !! Thanks again.Roxann Hill
 Good product , on time and as shown in Amazon.But ... years ago , ordering the same # jean and the same size always brought the exact same fit and look . Lately , the same length , for instance , some times is a bit too long -LRB- can be fixed -RRB- or a bit too short -LRB- bad news -RRB- . The price to be paid for savings by manufacturing offshore . Lets see if with the crisis we return to the memorable `` MADE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ''
 What can I say ? They are Levis . Perfect fit , excellent quality , and the most impressive thing was the price . Unbelievable !
 517 's are the best fit for me -LRB- I 'm a bit older and looking for just a little more comfort -RRB- . I wear boots most of the time , and these do a great job of dropping over the boot and still maintaining a nice line on the leg . Plus , the little red tag says you are a real Texan and not one of those $ 150.00 / pair wannabe 's .
 a la medida , tabla de medidas excelente ...
 This pair of Levi 's fits perfectly and the indigo color is the same as the Levi 's I wore back in the day !
 I gave these Jeans to my daughter 's friend for Christmas and he really likes them.He is real thin and wears motorcycle boots.He likes how they fit and loves the boot cut.He especially likes the rugged material .
 My order arrived in a timely fashion , they fit good and look great ... I 'm gon na get a couple more pairs .
 Levi 's 517 ` sThese Levi 's were the perfect fit . I like the fact that they are pre rinsed , which makes the fabric softer .
 Many of us do n't want to wear our Levi 's half way up our bellies . 517s are the best answer for that !
 A well tried and true blue jean that I 've been wearing for decades . The fit , finish , and quality is a good as or better than ever .
 These seemed a bit darker in person than pictured but they were a great pair of jeans for my husband . This is his favorite style of jeans and he needed a new pair of &#34; dressy jeans . &#34; Same great jeans as in the past .
 All the Levi 's I purchased for my 16 year old son were ` made to fit ' ! From the straight to boot cut , they all were a perfect fit for his personal taste . They are well made and very stylish .
 Great jeans , great price , speedy delivery as promised ! Will definitely be ordering them again since my son is so tall and slim and this is one of the only places I can find his size .
 Great basic jeans in hard to find sizes . Not much to say otherwise . They have washed up well and held up well for my long and lanky teen .
 The fit and look are great and I saved a few dollars . Will purchase more when the price is right
 love this jeans , the fabric is really good and the cut is impecable . it is original and the communication was really easy , i recieved really fast .
 I 've always wanted a ` black 527 ' but found out I could only get that in rigid black.I decided to try 517 n whao I might just decide to continue with 517 even with other colors.Just the perfect fit I love .
 Is exactly what i was looking for . . i being using this model for years , and this pair of pant are excellent
 I am a creature of habit . Being of slim build I have found the 517 Boot cut to be the perfect jean for me . I also know my size so the fit was great as received . This is not always the case when ordering over the Internet . Service was great delivered on time as expected .
 These are the best jeans Levis has to offer in my opinion . They are not light and flimsy like some jeans Levis are making these days . The medium stonewash is a great even color . They do n't look faded on the seat and thighs or dingly and dirty like so many jeans do . These jeans are rugged , comfortable and last a long , long time . On top of that they look great . These are the only jeans I will buy .
 These jeans are everything they say they are . We will definately order these jeans again when the time comes . Thanks !
 100 % recomended , i have no doubt that i am going to buy another , it is really regular fit and boot cut
 This is the only jean my husband wears . He has the hardest time finding 36x29 . This is a perfect fit for him . When he needs more I will return to amazon .
 I finally found a pear of jeans that my wife said they look good on me and after being washed still fits great
 IL TELL YOU I HAVE BEEN WEARING LEVI 'S FOR YEARS ON END AND THE BEST DEAL I GOT ON THESE GREAT JEANS WAS FROM MY FAVORITE STORE AMAZON
 I love these jeans . For me they are perfect . Long enough to wear with or without boots and the fit is not too tight . How can you go wrong with Levi 's ?
 I got what I ordered promptly . I wish I had ordered a different color but -- my bad . No complaints . What else can I say ?
 The jeans was just perfect , the material , size and colour , nothing to complain about , and great timing too.They fit really well , and amazon 's size chart was very helpfull .
 Style & size stayed true since the last time I bought a pair , after gettingLevi 's Men 's 527 Low Rise Boot Cut Jeanthat are nothing like they used to be that 's all a shopper can ask .
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut . Black 42 waist / 30 length . If you are short , stocky and have a big butt . These pants are perfect . They wo n't bunch up at your fat knees and they will last a long time before the zipper explodes . I suggest you buy the next size up because they will shrink after 6 months of washing , drying and severe stretching in the seat area . Great pants .
 MY FAVORITE JEANS FOR 25 YEARS . I HAVE WORN MAINLY 501 MODEL , SO I READ MANY REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING THESE 517 JEANS.AFTER THINKING FOR A LONG TIME I DECIDED TO BUY ONE SIZE BIGGER THAN USUAL . IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE.THEY ARE JUST FINE , BLACK COLOR AND ZIPPER FLY WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DETAIL FOR ME !
 My husband 's body type includes slight pot belly and skinny hips and thighs . Almost impossible to find pants that fit well without being either too tight in the belly or looking baggy in the seat and thighs . He used to wear Levi 's Action Jeans which were boot cut jeans with slight stretch in fabric and a slight crease in the legs . These jeans always looked and fit great ; real snappy . Unfortunately they 're no longer available . Then went to wearing David Taylor Flexjeans from Sears which were almost as good . However , he now find that although Sears still sells jeans by this name , they are no longer the same . They are now made in China and are made from a crappy fabric and no longer fit the same . In desperation , he started looking thru available Levis products and found Levi 's 517 . Advertised as slim in seat and thighs . He did not expect much but was pleasantly surprised to find that they are indeed somewhat slim in the seat and thighs , even though the pants he bought had a waist size slightly larger than minimally necessary , thankfully allowing him to breathe . Bottom line was that he was very happy that these pants are not so tight in the waist that its hard to breathe , but still slim enough in the seat and thighs that they do n't look like old man 's jeans . Just wish they had the snappy look of the old Levi 's Action Jeans .
 As an active equestrian rider , and a woman of 59 years , I 'm ALWAYS looking for comfortable jeans that sit at my waist -- I do n't like women 's jeans at all - the fabric in women 's jeans seems flimsy , and the low-rise , hip-hugging jeans for riding or leisure wear feels uncomfortable . The men 's Levis and men 's Lee jeans are very comfortable , and they can handle my active life -- for me , men 's Levis 517 bootcut jeans have best variety for colors , and toughest quality in fabric .
 Nice one . . Boot Cut with nice fit.Ordered the Jeans with 29L but got it 3inch longer . So I had to do alteration , usually I order my pants with 29L and it fits perfect on me .
 Levis 517 's fit me better than any other jeans that I 've bought . Gon na stick with them . I wear a 38 waist , 36 inseam . Have bought several pair over the past six months from various places and they all fit the same . Good quality control !
 BASTANTE BIEN . BUENA CALIDAD DEL PANTALON . ME QUEDO MUY BIEN . TANTO EL LARGO COMO EN CINTURA . EXCELENTE COMPRA A UDS . GRACIAS .
 The jeans are a good deep color . Wish they were n't quite as thin as jean material seems to be getting , but seems they are all like that now . Overall a good pair of jeans.These are hard to find in 36x36 , so I 'm glad Amazon carries them .
 Perfect fit right out of the box . Started wearing immediately , stitches , pockets , zipper perfectly in place . Survived several washes good as new .
 Good price , perfect quality . Very good model for young and old-aged people . Gorgeous color . Classic zipper . I 'm satisfied ! I recommend to buy it .
 These jeans fit me very well and look good . One thing I noticed however is that the denim has a more coarse feeling compared to other Levi 's jeans . I would buy these again .
 d e m a r a v i l l a e s t e m o d e l o muy bueno
 These are the first jeans in a while that actually fit my waist size , inseam and the leg openings are perfect .
 These jeans fit well but the denim seems less hefty than the denim of the same 517s from 5 years ago .
 I received my pants very quickly . I was concerned that my size would be too short for boots . I was pleasantly surprised that the designer was thoughtful about the shape and length for this item &#34; after &#34; several washings . Pants are about 1/2 inch longer than the average pants which make them perfect for cowboy boots . Pants are also very comfortable . JCD
 Noticed that they even have an extra pair of belt loops compared to my previous order . They are sturdy & dependable .
 The jeans were great ! The price was right , they were delivered in a timely fashion , and I lost a few lbs to get in them and I look good . lol . I recommend this company .
 These are the only jeans my son likes . He is tall and I have trouble finding his size in local stores and I could not find a better price .
 The jean came very quickly . They were the proper color , size , and cut . The packaging was excellent , and so was the quality of the jeans .
 Perfect price and fit for my husband . I would recommend this jean to any &#34; baby boomer &#34; who loves boot cut jeans.The jean has not changed at all good quality material and the right color . Thank you .
 This pair of Levi 's fits perfectly and the indigo color is the same as the Levi 's I wore back in the day !
 If you know your size they fit . I do n't understand the reviews that say the sizes are wrong . Will buy again .
 was just what i expected ... very pleased with purchase . I like the fact that you can get 29 inseam . You can not get that in the store . No need to get them hemmed !
 his pants in overall line is still very good , sturdy , feels soft to the touch on the skin , the profile legendary cutting adds a touch of elegance , and even after several washings the fabric remains the same and does not shrink , the only thing I did not like the pants is that they have deteriorated the quality of the clips and metal buttons , formerly of copper and bronze , and now this are of aluminum and does not look good , however I recommend buying them are very good at the price .
 These came a little long , maybe an inch or two . Seeing as many others have noticed this is a problem with this fit , I suggest going one inseam size lower . I ordered a 30 '' and they fit more like a 31-32 '' . Other than the sizing , they are great jeans , and still look great on me . The boot cut allows the extra length to bunch up a little around the shoes , so you do n't really notice it . It actually looks good.I wish they sold these in a low rise version , as I do n't like hiking them up to where you might put dress pants or khakis . They stopped selling the 517 in a low rise though , so I 'm happy to wear them as is , great fit .
 I have always appreciated the fit and quality of Levi jeans . The boot cut has a closer fit around the knee with comfortable room in the hips and waist . What Levi Strauss needs to understand is that there is a huge population of men out there that has a 31 inch inseam . Men between 5 ' 9 &#34; and 6 ' fall into this size range . My growth did not stop at 30 &#34; inseam , and did not make it to 32 &#34; . So I either buy high water jeans that show my socks , or I let the cuffs drag the floor which signicantly reduces the life of the jeans . I liked the fit enough that I spent an additional $ 10 to get them hemmed to 31 .
 product arrived as expected on time , the product was as expected and the quality was as you 'd expect to find in a brick & mortar store .
 Great fitting . I usually buy the 527 style but they did n't have black in that style . Ordered a 517 instead and love the fitting .
 These boot cut jeans by my favorite jeans maker are exactly what I needed.When I ordered my Harley Davidson boots , I needed pants for when I wear them and these ones are the only ones that fit on the outside where others ca n't . Shopping local yields nothing like these , just junk not worth the money.Quality is what I 've come to expect from Levi 's , outstanding with fit absolutely perfect.More orders coming soon for these.Shipping was prompt , making this buyer very happy.Thank you to everyone for helping this lonely guy that hardly can get out to shop by bringing them to me.Again , THANK YOU VERY MUCH !!
 I thought these were more on the casual side , but after putting them on , they can pull off a nice look . Very comfy , one day to break in . No frays , quality zipper . Dimensions were perfect . Overall color is a shade or two darker than in the picture . Awesome , new favorite pair .
 If you have a problem with jeans bagging in the rear , then these jeans are for you ! They are a great fit and very comfortable ! My husband loves them !
 Well , its a good jean , everybody know the levi 's quality , the item arive in perfect conditions . . so nothing more to say . .
 Perfect fit , every time . 517 's are difficult for me to find locally , but buying on line thru Amazon is best for me .
 These are like they used to make them ! More belt loops , great fabric - love them ! Ca n't wait to order more of these !
 I was having a really hard time finding the boot cut Levis - no one seems to carry them anymore . These are just what I wanted . They look and fit good .
 Bought these for my husband and they fit true to size , maybe a little bit long but not so much that he wo n't wear them . He love them , they look good so I love them ! Great Pants !
 I ordered these jeans for my 16yo son & he really liked them . The only thing he would have preferred was a lower rise , but he 's wearing them without complaints . : -RRB-
 I wear Levi jeans every day . Levi 's are the only jeans I will wear.I have worn Levi jeans for the past twenty -LRB- 20 -RRB- years ... or longer.Levi jeans are great ... in fact , i 'm wearin 'em right now ...
 Sent me what I wanted . 15 more 12 more 11 more 9 more 7 more 5 more 3 more done
 This is a very good price for this product , it 's the second one I 've ordered for my son .
 I like this style and they are getting very hard to find . The price here was the best I found , got in a timely manner . I 'm happy with my purchase .
 Purchased these jeans for my husband . They have a nice fit and look very good on . No baggy butt like the relaxed fit jeans .
 I usually have a hard time finding good bootcut jeans with the right fit in the retail stores . If the color/wash/fabric is right , the size isnt . If the size is right , the fit is too loose at the seat and thighs . Now that my favorite pair of jeans is past its prime , I started looking for a new pair to replace it . After hunting all stores in and around my area and trying all available bootcuts in my size , I was very disappointed . That is , until I found a pair of Levi 's 517 Blue Ox in the local Macy 's store . This was the first bootcut I found in the last 3 years that fit me perfectly . Since I already had a pair of jeans that was of a very similar color , I came online and started looking for the correct color in that fit . Unfortunately , it wasnt that easy finding one online . Kohls , Dillards and others had Levi 's 517s , but they werent the same ones I saw in the store . Apart from Macys and Amazon , no other site -LRB- including Levi 's own site -RRB- had the same fit in Rancher Light color I was looking for . I could have ordered at Macys website , but my past experience with Amazon was stellar and so it my first choice . Even then I was a little skeptical if the photos were close to how the jeans looked in reality . Since amazon had a free returns on this one , I went ahead with the order . The product , as always with Amazon , came 6 days ahead of their estimated delivery date . The jeans is , in fact , very close to the pictures on the website and the fit is PERFECT !! Thanks to Levi 's for the perfect color and fit and KUDOS to amazon for the perfect shopping experience !
 Finally Levi went back to 7 belt loops instead of the five . Makes a big difference for those of us that work for a living .
 I bought the 517 as I prefer this cut to any other one of the Levi 's catalog , I place it even above the so famous 501 . I 'm fully satisfied
 I love these jeans . The wash and fit are great . That being said , they did arrive with a hole in the seat and the seam is a little crooked on the inside left leg . I really do n't care though because they fit so good .
 It is hard to find male , black , slim fit , boot cut jeans . Believe me I searched many places both on-line and local retail outlets . Finally I found these on Amazon and they were just right . Great fit , looks good , and the price was reasonable . I highly recommend them .
 We will take these to alterations but they were about 5 inches too long . Otherwise they are very nice .
 True to size , did n't shrink , and minimal wrinkling . Love the variety of sizing - son is tall and thin , and hard to fit , but Levis 517 made it happen !
 Bought these jeans for my husband . They fit very well and look nice . The shipment arrived on time . I was happy with my purchase .
 I ordered these jeans an exrta size longer becaause I wanted a high cuff . Got exactally that . Perfect !!! Now I 'm looking for a white pair
 Well , they 're Levi 's . There you go . Best jeans on the market . Last forever and fit great . The black does fade to gray quicker than I would like , but that 's probably because I wear only black , all the time . So ...
 I have worn Levi jenas for the last 16years , i am relatively tall guy and seldom get my size in the store , Amazon provides me my size and then quality as well .
 Purchased two pairs of Levi 's Boot Cut Jeans for my husband , the Jeans are very hard to find in the stores . Since my husband is tall , it is hard to find 36x36 .
 These pants are very well put together and I am a big fan of Levi 's pants durability which is what prompted me to purchase these .
 I am a woman but men 's jeans fit me better . These are very comfortable . My jeans do NOT get hung up on my boots as they do with jeans that are not boot cut .
 todo salio perfecto , tanto el envio como el paquete recibido , estan esplendidas , la hora de llegada fue la establecida por el vendedor
 This is a great jacket made with quality fabric . It 's the crisp , shiny kind of wool , not the itchy , fuzzy kind . The three-button design and the sculpted fit suit my frame well . Great blazer for tall guys .
 These T shirts are the best around , I 'm serious , they are very strong and very soft . A couple friends of mine work in the silkscreening business and told me that the `` Hanes Beefy T '' was THE best out there , so I ordered 6 of them on their advice . I 've never seen T shirts this nice , they are the most comfortable , strongest , and they feel like they will last forever . I 'm so happy with these shirts , they are awesome .
 These are great t-shirts and my boys love them . They are active in sports and there is nothing better than having these shirts to wear . They take the wear and tear and come back for more ! I highly recommend them !

 Incredible design , giving excellent support with comfort and beauty . Enhances everything you wear and looks great on its own , you ca n't beat that ! I 've been a Lunaire customer for about eight years and find integrity in all the products I 've purchased . Personally I have n't found a negative thing to comment on . Considering how long they last , even the price ismore than fair . ENJOY ... UPDATE ... It 's been two years since I purchased Lunaire Piccadilly and wear it most of the time . It 's still in wonderful condition and comfortable . I machine wash it but line dry . LOVE IT ! I 'm going to order a couple more .
 these bras are great , especially for small frames , imo . too bad they 're being discontinued . great fit , great lift & separation , pretty , true to size , awesome price . of course they 're discontinued : -RRB-
 This is an adorable sweater for a great price . I ca n't wait to put it on my little one .
 My son love this sweater . when i Bought this item , maybe I select wrong the colors -LRB- I select Blue -RRB- , but the green is good .
 Loved the costume . I wear a 12-14 great fit . Could also be worn by 16-18 . Not too long falls right at the floor just like in picture . The head accessories and cape do stand up just like in pic . One side of my hat was a little floppy when I tried it on I just placed it under a heavy book for a day and that fixed the issue . Looked awesome when put on . Scared everyone at work LOL !!!!! Kids loved it too !
 It is pretty much a one size fits all unless you are very small or very big , but I am `` average '' -LRB- 5 ' 6 '' , and `` average '' weight '' -RRB- and it fits me fine . The hat piece is flimsy but I plan to fix it up the way another reviewer suggested -LRB- THANKS !!! -RRB- and it is n't as well sewn , the point that comes down in the middle is not well matched/uneven , so I will have to fix that and trim the hanging thread . Also there is no way to keep the neck piece up or attach it to the hat piece ... With a little work this should make an excellent costume I can use year after year or share with friends and family . This year my daughter is planning to be sleeping beauty so we should be a cute little team !
 I looked great on Halloween . A lot of costumes run small , but this was a 12-14 and it fit me with room to spare big . My biggest problem was that it was a little short on me -LRB- hit slightly above the ankle -RRB- and I am average height .
 My mom got a lot of fun wearing this , the kids were impressed , though must of them did n't know the character , it was fun .
 My boyfriend says that these are his favorite shorts . Nice and roomy with some breathing room .
 I was thinking it of using it for my tennis . Unfortunately there was no clue saying it dint have pockets . Anyways its a good shorts for great price .
 If you go to the gym or play ball a lot and need a couple pair of shorts so you do n't need to do laundry every other day , these athletic shorts are perfect . They 're thin but durable . I got them on sale for like $ 10 so they do the trick . Do n't get me wrong its not like you 'll look like a dork at the gym , but if you 're looking for something super flashy , then these are n't them .
 Nice shorts that match almost everything . My boyfriend loves to wear them around the house . Great pair of shorts for an extremely great price ! So buy a couple pairs just to have around !
 no pockets , but yann will wear them all summer.yeehaw .
 My son likes these to sleep and wear under pants in winter . They are perfect , washing easily , and retaining their size and color .
 I like the shorts . The price is excellent . The shorts were a little thinner than I imagined . But I am very satisfied with the purchase .
 I have the scrimmage dazzle too they re thin but durable and for 10.00 cool ! no pockets ok for me , lightweight shortsexcellent and Roomy my favorites great price buying of couple more
 These were a birthday gift for my son and I had them sent directly to him at college . He loved them and they fit great ! Good quality for the price . He liked the fit of the boot cut .
 These are great jeans for us gals , too , especially if you like to wear a true black color . I dress them up with a feminine camisole and heels , and have got many compliments on them .
 Exactly what my hubby wants . It 's difficult to find his size in our local stores . Very happy Amazon now has Levi 's in his size .
 I love my new bootcuts . I received them quickly , They fit perfectly . Thank you .
 I 've grown frustrated by the lack of good quality/reasonably priced jeans in the market today . At some point , the Levis brand started to suffer in terms of quality/value for the dollar . Do n't remember exactly when that happened , but I started to buy my jeans from Banana Republic . Over time , they stopped making the style I grew to rely on . This created a 7-10 stretch where I could n't seem to find a good pair of jeans . Most recently , I purchased a pair of Lucky jeans - ridiculously over priced . When those began to fail , I tried Levis again and bought these . For a third of the price of Lucky Jeans , these Levis boot-cut jeans are really nice . They have a really substantial feel/weight to them and I could n't be happier with the purchase . I was so pleased , I ended up buying a second pair .
 Levis 517 Boot Cut Jeans are just as advertized . Good fit and a perfect boot cut . I highly recommend them for anyone who needs boot cut jeans .
 It 's a very good pant for my husband . Nothing too special or fancy ; he is very satisfied because he got what he expected
 Completamente satisfecha con el producto , exactamente igual a lo que ofrecieron . LLego en el tiempo estimado que prometieron . Ninguna queja , volveria a comprar de nuevo .
 The Levi jeans were just like I expected . The fit was perfect and received them in just a few days . Thanks !!
 The quality of the denim is lighter , so the good fit disappears by the end of the day . Otherwise , I like 'em !
 Hubby dearest was so happy to find boot cut Levi jeans at Amazon as it seems most stores have quit carrying this style of jean . He likes to wear boot cut jeans and Levi jeans are his favorite brand.No complaints about the fit or wearability either . Ordered two more pairs of jeans today as he 's a happy camper.Recommend .
 Good deal on the jeans and speedy shipping . My first pair of boot cut jeans . My girl friend really likes them on me . I got the dark blue -LRB- rinse -RRB- . Fit good and comfortable .
 My skinny son is 54 years old and will not wear any other jeans - only 517 , boot cut Levi 's so I know what to buy for Christmas and Birthdays . I found a perfect fit for my skinny husband also .
 I ordered these jeansLevi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jeanfor a Christmas gift a short time before Christmas . I knew the size . I was somewhat concerned that I would not get them on time for Christmas The package came just before Christmas , and the jeans were exactly as pictured , nicely packaged -LRB- each pair separately enclosed in plastic bag -RRB- , the right size and color . I was very pleased , as was the recipient of the gift !
 The jeans were a Christmas gift and a style regularly worn by the recipient . They were a perfect fit . They are hard to find locally so we ordered from the Internet . The red tag on the back pocket did not say `` Levis '' and I have never seen this before . Is it significant ?
 Wow . These are great blue jeans , and they come in 38 long which is what he wears . HE wanted the boot cut , and a 34 waist was large enough . Usually he wears a 36 , , but I ordered 34 and they fit just right . Great looking , great price .
 I bought two pairs in two orders - both were perfect - exactly as I expected . On time . Good buy at a decent price .
 These were a secret gift for my brother-in-law . He keeps complaining that he must do laundry every other day because he only has one pair of work pants , but then he just will not go get more or let anyone buy him any ! So , I got the size off of the one pair of jeans he owns -LRB- laundry is at my house -RRB- and I bought several other pairs that were similarly worn . I sneak in a new pair about once a week and so far he has n't noticed that he now has three pair of work pants . When I slip in the new ones , I put them in the dirty clothes hamper he uses . I wonder if he knows his pants are multiplying yet ?
 They arived bfore time , APO adress , in Afghanistan ,1 week took it to arive here , im suprised , and they fit good , i dont hawe no words
 36 &#34; inseam jeans at a reasonable price are hard to find . I really like the fit of these jeans just wish there were other kinds in the same length .
 Just what I expected . After soaking and drying , the fit and feel was as anticipated ... just like the good , old days !!! -LRB- I would estimate that length and waist both shrunk by about one inch ... as Mama warned , some 50 years ago -RRB-
 i got two pairs for my husband . levis are the only thing that fit him right . They make him look like he has a butt !
 I like this product because it fits very well and is comfortable . I recommend it to others . Good for those who like to wear boots .
 Finally found levis that were the correct size , if they are still available I will order more in the future
 I am happy with the jeans and how they fit , but usually when I get 517 's , they are really stiff and then I get to break them in . This pair was already like pre-washed , just differnt than what I am used to , but I still like them and will wear them . Maybe I have to look into differnt types and find exactly what I am looking for next time . Thank you
 I 've been wearing 517 's for a good , long time now , and I love 'em ! The problem is that most of my local stores that sell them -- and very few of them do -- price them highly and also drastically limit the selection compared to the more popular 501 's and 550 's . Additionally , these jeans are often skipped over when it comes to the big sales . Well , shopping for them on Amazon is a decision I should have made long ago . The price here is hard to beat.As for the jeans themselves , they are of the rugged quality that Levi 's is known for . They fit like the product photo shows
 Have had these jeans for a few weeks now & am very satisfied.The flair from the knee down is discrete and does not look like the 70 's bell-bottoms . The fit on top was precisely as marked . The length seems about 1/2 inch longer than sized on the 501 's . Was formerly utilizing 501 slim fit jeans but found that could not place them over motorcyle boots . The 501s were great for rainy rides , but look too much like a cowboy , when tucked into the boots .
 As always , good shopping at amazon.com . Its always a problem finding the right length jeans for me . I found that in this levi 517 Boot cut jean , it feels good to finally find a jean that is not too short . A fact that i would have loved to know before i bought this jeans , is the leg opening size . This jean is very tight around the thigh area . I would just like a bit more details on the product a next time round . Other than that , it always a good shopping experience on Amazon .
 The length and waist were perfect . The quality of Levi jeans was the same as they had always been , good
 I always had to keep pulling up my previous pairs of Levi 's -LRB- any model -RRB- because they only had FIVE belt loops . A key ring and cell phone are not that heavy . I remember growing up with Levi 's having SEVEN belt loops and a heavier canvas . I was pleasantly surprised to see the ` new ' Levi 's 517 now have seven belt loops again . I started to buy a different model , but they still only have the five loops.I just bought a couple of these pairs from Amazon . I did check online at Kohls and their current batch of 517 's still show 5 loops . I will have to wait until I go to the store to see if their stock has been updated . Kohls prices are higher than Amazon , but I will recheck when they go on sale . I still check Amazon first for almost all my purchases.Overall , I like my new Levi 's jeans . I will compare them with older ones to see if the canvas really is slightly thinner . Outsourcing manufacturing almost always results in poorer quality and non-standard sizing . It has 100 % results in putting Americans out of work . I try to buy American whenever I can -- hopefully it will catch on.There is another issue appearing after I washed my new jeans with my old ones . It should n't have made a difference , but the new ones are now covered with fine fluffy hairs . I will have to use a lint brush when I take them out of the dryer for now . Although it may just be a ` break in -- first washings ' issue.Overall , I rate these jeans 4 stars . I will have to wait for a few machine washings to see how the color holds up . I may be old fashioned , but buying jeans looking like they are 1/2 wore out or have holes in them is ` less than optimal ' .
 I ran around town to find my husband Levi 517 's in size 35x32 for Christmas . In the stores , there were stacks of all different sorts of Levi 's to go through . Finally I came home and ordered them through Amazon and received exactly what he wanted . These Levi 's fit perfectly and look great . Very happy they come in off size waists . Thank you for making my job easier and receiving nice fitting jeans .
 I 've grown up wearing Levi 's and in particular 517 's in my adult life . I do like that Levi has added additional belt loops in the past year or so . Over the years Levi has cut some corners in manufacturing , but not enough to discourage me from continuing to buy their stonewashed 517 's . I like the stonewashed jeans since they are ready to wear , unlike the rigid indigo Levi 's that have to be washed several times to soften them up.I am buying more and more items from Amazon for the free shipping and competitive prices . It just saves a lot of time going to a retailer only to find out they do n't have my size or what I want . Even with Amazon collecting California sales tax , I figure the time and gas saved from having to go to a retailer is well worth it .
 The pants are great . I can not seem to find them in stores like Kohls or Target where I usually shop . I 'm not skinny as far as a skinny person goes but I have thinner legs than a lot of guys . These seem to be not as loose in the butt and thighs . I usually get the 505 's but they are cut a little bigger assuming tree trunk size legs . I have runners legs and these work . If you have big footballer legs , forget about it .
 Finally jeans that fit like the old Levis , these are the old quality heavy denim stuff not that wimpy pre-wash thin as paper junk denim . I would highly recommend these jeans to anyone who 's familiar with real Levis .
 Very easy shopping . I 'm familiar with the pants so it 's just a matter of price and convenience.Sitting at the desk for a few second beats driving to the store , finding out they do n't have the 517 in my size and driving back home . I 've always had trouble just finding the 517 at stores and shopping online sure makes things easier . The pants themselves are everything they 've always been , good fitting and tough.It 's nice to add the stonewash to my collection of darker denim so I do n't look the same every day.I was upprised how fast they came and that 's a big plus too .
 These jeans fit to size perfectly -LRB- for me -RRB- , are comfortable to wear , and have adequate material to reach a guy 's waist ... not hip-huggers . I 'll buy more of these ! Not a deal-breaker by any means but I would prefer them to not have the size label outside ... it seems Levi 's always does this .
 Amazon did not mentioned in the description that this pair of jeans is a Shrink-to-Fit fabric . No question on the quality . . it 's still an amazing jeans , the great Levi 's jeans , never goes out of style ... Take 31 '' waistline x 30 '' inseam if your size is 30 x 30 .
 Levi 's are always the best jeans around . Levi 's Boot Cut are the only kind my husband will wear . Always a good fit .
 Very high quality . Several pairs have consistent fit . Have bought and worn these 517 boot cut jeans for several years .
 My husband LOVES these jeans . They are a GREAT FIT , especially in the seat . The legs are n't too wide in the thighs and the bootcut bottom make a terrific silhouette . I like how he looks in them and he says they are REALLY COMFORTABLE . They look best in the darker color and are a good pair of `` dress jeans '' as well as versatile . We are ordering more . Ladies , get him these jeans !
 Who does n't love Levis ? These are great ! My son was happy on Christmas day and so were we . Happy Holidays !
 It is great to find the exact size , color , and fit you want in a Levi 's jean , and also get it on time .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean , Medium Stonewash , 38x29They fit perfectly . Will probably order more in a couple months .
 Needed a size that few brick & mortar stores keep in stock . Amazon had style I wanted in the size that I wanted at a good price !
 These blue jeans where a great color and a perfect fit . Glad I ordered them . They were a present for my son
 My husband has been wearing Levi 's since he was a teenager . They are the most durable jeans and he loves the boot cut .
 I 've been wearing these for years.They do tend to fade easily so wash them inside out and use a detergent product for black fabrics .
 I bought these as a gift for a friend who has worn this style for years . Good quality , good fit , good style .
 Great jeans.Classical style.Low price.Wearing only jeans , levis always loved.Happy New Year!Amazon Forever!I love it .
 Great pants . I wish there was a size 33 by 35 . I always have a hard time with pants size . I can get a length 34 , which shrink after a wash or a 36 that drags because there too long . But there is no length 35 in pants , so I do n't have much of choice .
 Excellent product the product I come very well and it is what was waiting of , I come in time , good
 I bought they for my boyfriend who had lost a bit of weight and all his pants were falling down , but these fit and stay up -LRB- Thank God -RRB-
 My husband loves the fit and the price.Great deal.You can dress them up or down!Look no further.Great looking jean , for the price .
 Bought these jeans for my husband . They fit very well and look nice . The shipment arrived on time . I was happy with my purchase .
 I ordered these jeans an exrta size longer becaause I wanted a high cuff . Got exactally that . Perfect !!! Now I 'm looking for a white pair
 Well , they 're Levi 's . There you go . Best jeans on the market . Last forever and fit great . The black does fade to gray quicker than I would like , but that 's probably because I wear only black , all the time . So ...
 Great black on black bootcut jeans . They have even gone back to adding two additional belt loops a feature that went away several years ago .
 Fits well , my husband loves them , quality control met , consistent sizing , and look good on . Will order more as needed
 My son wears a 36 Waist x 36 lenght which is very hard to find . The Levi 's Men 's 517 are about the only jeans he likes and these fit him perfectly . They were shipped very quickly and the price was excellent . They were a birthday gift and he loves them .
 The jeans were pre washed and fit just like I wanted . They were really softer than I expected . I would buy this product again .
 I was so happy with the quality and fit ; I ordered 3 more pairs ! I will be good on jeans for awhile . The price was good too .
 Great quality and a lower price , for me is like a tailored jean , I 'm happy with this product . No more to say thanks to all
 After numerous failed attempts at the 527 's on amazon I finally got a clue and got these jeans . They are PERFECT ... great fit ... weight ... etc. ... just like the jeans I wore in high school 20 years ago ... . I 'm already thinking about a second pair . The light rancher is the perfect color ... . As for the 527 's MADE IN BANGLADESH ... amazing they could ever bear the levis name ... perhaps they were counterfeit . Thanks amazon for my true and needed exchange . The original pair of jeans I ordered ... yes the 527 ... was complete trash . These 517 's are real jeans for real cowboys ... and I 'm not one ... but I do wear a ton of boots ...
 Exellent product
 This hard to find style arrived on time . These classic jeans fit just the way they should . Going back for more colors .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Slim Fit Jean is leg looks like so long , . . but lap so tight but leg looks like so long . .
 My husband like it . . although I have to cut the length a little bit . . He said he may buy more in the future . . Hopefully they have shorter length then .
 They are Levis what more needs to be said ? Theyre the only jeans im buying from now on . They fit great and last 2-5 times longer than any other jeans ive bought .
 I use to wear the Levis low boot cut , but they discontinue to sell the color I want . After I give this one a try , I like it so much .
 If you know your size they fit . I do n't understand the reviews that say the sizes are wrong . Will buy again .
 was just what i expected ... very pleased with purchase . I like the fact that you can get 29 inseam . You can not get that in the store . No need to get them hemmed !
 his pants in overall line is still very good , sturdy , feels soft to the touch on the skin , the profile legendary cutting adds a touch of elegance , and even after several washings the fabric remains the same and does not shrink , the only thing I did not like the pants is that they have deteriorated the quality of the clips and metal buttons , formerly of copper and bronze , and now this are of aluminum and does not look good , however I recommend buying them are very good at the price .
 These came a little long , maybe an inch or two . Seeing as many others have noticed this is a problem with this fit , I suggest going one inseam size lower . I ordered a 30 '' and they fit more like a 31-32 '' . Other than the sizing , they are great jeans , and still look great on me . The boot cut allows the extra length to bunch up a little around the shoes , so you do n't really notice it . It actually looks good.I wish they sold these in a low rise version , as I do n't like hiking them up to where you might put dress pants or khakis . They stopped selling the 517 in a low rise though , so I 'm happy to wear them as is , great fit .
 execelente producto muy buena calidad , el pantalon vino en un excelente empaque y llego super rapido deverdad no tengo quejas lo recomiendo
 He looks hot in them , thanks ! What more can I say ? They did n't stay on for very long ... ca n't share any more details .
 I was somewhat hesitant to order Levi 's online but I could n't be happier with this order ! The jeans are exactly as described and fit perfectly . They are genuine Levi 's and are of the highest quality - not seconds . I ca n't recommend this seller highly enough .
 They 're good sellers and the product is very good , I like so much this jean . Ellos son muy buenos vendedores , el producto llego rapido a mis manos y era el esperado , los recomiendo ampliamente .
 I wear Levi jeans every day . Levi 's are the only jeans I will wear.I have worn Levi jeans for the past twenty -LRB- 20 -RRB- years ... or longer.Levi jeans are great ... in fact , i 'm wearin 'em right now ...
 Sent me what I wanted . 15 more 12 more 11 more 9 more 7 more 5 more 3 more done
 These jeans are tough but good looking and fit well . Amazon 's price is great , they are a good value for the money , and we always get prompt delivery and easy return if size is not right .
 the product is excellente , but needs to be taggedcorrectly , I order 34x30 tag say so , but real size was36x32 try buying them from differet source , and same thing never can get athe right size until i took a mesuring tape to the store and mesure before buing them !!
 I love those Jeans . . nice shape and denim . I ordered different colors from this pant and I love them all . it is comfortable , and have a nice leg openning that falls around the boot .
 I have been wearing 517 's for as long as I can remember . They fit perfectly and have remained unchanged for years .
 These boot cut jeans by my favorite jeans maker are exactly what I needed.When I ordered my Harley Davidson boots , I needed pants for when I wear them and these ones are the only ones that fit on the outside where others ca n't . Shopping local yields nothing like these , just junk not worth the money.Quality is what I 've come to expect from Levi 's , outstanding with fit absolutely perfect.More orders coming soon for these.Shipping was prompt , making this buyer very happy.Thank you to everyone for helping this lonely guy that hardly can get out to shop by bringing them to me.Again , THANK YOU VERY MUCH !!
 I thought these were more on the casual side , but after putting them on , they can pull off a nice look . Very comfy , one day to break in . No frays , quality zipper . Dimensions were perfect . Overall color is a shade or two darker than in the picture . Awesome , new favorite pair .
 If you have a problem with jeans bagging in the rear , then these jeans are for you ! They are a great fit and very comfortable ! My husband loves them !
 Well , its a good jean , everybody know the levi 's quality , the item arive in perfect conditions . . so nothing more to say . .
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut JeansWhat a nice pair of rugged jeans . And I got them so FAST !! Thanks again.Roxann Hill
 Good product , on time and as shown in Amazon.But ... years ago , ordering the same # jean and the same size always brought the exact same fit and look . Lately , the same length , for instance , some times is a bit too long -LRB- can be fixed -RRB- or a bit too short -LRB- bad news -RRB- . The price to be paid for savings by manufacturing offshore . Lets see if with the crisis we return to the memorable `` MADE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ''
 What can I say ? They are Levis . Perfect fit , excellent quality , and the most impressive thing was the price . Unbelievable !
 a la medida , tabla de medidas excelente ...
 The only problem was I had was that I had to have them hemmed 2 &#34; so as not to walk on the cuff . I would have ordered them shorter but they were not offered in the waist size I needed . The waist fit perfect and having them hemmed was not that big of a deal . It coast me $ 12.00 to have them hemmed .
 I love being able to find the 517 's on line and not having to run all over town for the style and size I need .
 If you promise not to tell anybody , I wear lined jeans from eddie bauer or llbean when it gets cooler . I wear these when it gets warmer . True to size , do n't shrink too much .
 These jeans come washed so they are soft , supple and ready to wear . They are pre-shrunk so order the size you wear . I choose boot-cut jeans because I wear 12 '' - shaft western boots . Levies are the only jeans I wear because they fit well , look good , and get better with age .
 These jeans are perfect for the guy who wants to wear boots and not look like a geek or a thug . Just the right combination of loose and fitted .
 This is my first pair of Levi 517 's and I have to say I am very impressed . They sit on my natural waist -LRB- not low-rise like the 527 's -RRB- , and are fitted in the seat and thigh , and then flare out below the knee to fall on the boot . I 'm 6 ' 3 '' 190lbs and have a 36 waist and 34 inseam and it fit perfectly . Hard to find jeans these days that sit on the waist ... I 'm not a fan of the low-rise look or feel , so these jeans were a great find .
 Came to Amazon to order these jeans for my husband since no one ever has his size , 36x36 . I was pleasantly surprised because I did order two of these in different colors , Rancher Light and Rinse , both of which were the perfect colors . Perfect light colored jean and perfect dark colored jean . My husband and I are very hard to fit in jeans and tops so when something works we often get multiples , the problem however is that sometimes we buy the exact same thing in a different color and they fit totally different . Not these ! These jeans were great and the same fit ! Some people might not be able to appreciate that as much as I , but I was very grateful . It was a risk I had to take since his size is so common , but with free returns I had to take advantage . The boot leg is also very subtle but incredibly flattering . He does wear boots but of course they are n't necessary . I would say they are very true to size and great quality . They are currently his `` good jeans '' ... . that is until he `` accidentally '' wears them to go work in the garage . But when that happens , because it will , I will be back to purchase more ! By the way he is just over 6 ' 3 '' about 230-240lbs .
 I was a bit concerned about this purchase . My husband likes the boot cut style and that was an excellent choice for my purchase . I have zero compliants other then I wish I 'd bought more !
 they were exactly what we were looking for . the orginal 517 , these are my hubby 's most favoritie , they also hold up better than the other styles seem to
 Will have to wash several times for them to fit . I buy this size all the time from other retailers and they are n't this big . Like the color and the style . They just run big I guess . Mainly in the length . Would buy again , just a smaller size .
 The fit is nice , the color is holding up through the wash . I am glad they have different sizes then the stores . Very hard to find 33 x 36 !
 I like the way these jeans fit.The are also comfortable.The ones I have purchased previously have been durable .
 d e m a r a v i l l a e s t e m o d e l o muy bueno
 These are the first jeans in a while that actually fit my waist size , inseam and the leg openings are perfect .
 These jeans fit well but the denim seems less hefty than the denim of the same 517s from 5 years ago .
 I received my pants very quickly . I was concerned that my size would be too short for boots . I was pleasantly surprised that the designer was thoughtful about the shape and length for this item &#34; after &#34; several washings . Pants are about 1/2 inch longer than the average pants which make them perfect for cowboy boots . Pants are also very comfortable . JCD
 The jeans was just perfect , the material , size and colour , nothing to complain about , and great timing too.They fit really well , and amazon 's size chart was very helpfull .
 Style & size stayed true since the last time I bought a pair , after gettingLevi 's Men 's 527 Low Rise Boot Cut Jeanthat are nothing like they used to be that 's all a shopper can ask .
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut . Black 42 waist / 30 length . If you are short , stocky and have a big butt . These pants are perfect . They wo n't bunch up at your fat knees and they will last a long time before the zipper explodes . I suggest you buy the next size up because they will shrink after 6 months of washing , drying and severe stretching in the seat area . Great pants .
 MY FAVORITE JEANS FOR 25 YEARS . I HAVE WORN MAINLY 501 MODEL , SO I READ MANY REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING THESE 517 JEANS.AFTER THINKING FOR A LONG TIME I DECIDED TO BUY ONE SIZE BIGGER THAN USUAL . IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE.THEY ARE JUST FINE , BLACK COLOR AND ZIPPER FLY WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DETAIL FOR ME !
 My husband 's body type includes slight pot belly and skinny hips and thighs . Almost impossible to find pants that fit well without being either too tight in the belly or looking baggy in the seat and thighs . He used to wear Levi 's Action Jeans which were boot cut jeans with slight stretch in fabric and a slight crease in the legs . These jeans always looked and fit great ; real snappy . Unfortunately they 're no longer available . Then went to wearing David Taylor Flexjeans from Sears which were almost as good . However , he now find that although Sears still sells jeans by this name , they are no longer the same . They are now made in China and are made from a crappy fabric and no longer fit the same . In desperation , he started looking thru available Levis products and found Levi 's 517 . Advertised as slim in seat and thighs . He did not expect much but was pleasantly surprised to find that they are indeed somewhat slim in the seat and thighs , even though the pants he bought had a waist size slightly larger than minimally necessary , thankfully allowing him to breathe . Bottom line was that he was very happy that these pants are not so tight in the waist that its hard to breathe , but still slim enough in the seat and thighs that they do n't look like old man 's jeans . Just wish they had the snappy look of the old Levi 's Action Jeans .
 I bought a pair of these in 29X34 and they are great . Fit perfect , really like the cut , lighter weight material but not too light , should hold up well . Just wish they would reduce the size of the internal tag -- I 've actually had to tuck it back into the pants a few times after putting them on !
 Finally figured out what cut and size I like , but the only place I can find them is the internet . Great pants .
 These were ordered off Amazon when I could not find them locally . I found the pants and they are describer perfectly and fit exactly as I had wanted them to . I will buy more in the future because they were perfect .
 These are the best jeans Levis has to offer in my opinion . They are not light and flimsy like some jeans Levis are making these days . The medium stonewash is a great even color . They do n't look faded on the seat and thighs or dingly and dirty like so many jeans do . These jeans are rugged , comfortable and last a long , long time . On top of that they look great . These are the only jeans I will buy .
 These jeans are everything they say they are . We will definately order these jeans again when the time comes . Thanks !
 100 % recomended , i have no doubt that i am going to buy another , it is really regular fit and boot cut
 This is the only jean my husband wears . He has the hardest time finding 36x29 . This is a perfect fit for him . When he needs more I will return to amazon .
 I finally found a pear of jeans that my wife said they look good on me and after being washed still fits great
 Great fit for my long legs ! Hard to find jeans my size but Levi 's always comes through for me ! a
 Ordered these for my boyfriend , they run extremely small , he regularly wears a 32/34 had to send back and get a 36/34 . Other than that they 're great jeans .
 Finally a pair of Levi 's not only affordable , but a pair that is the real deal . . not seconds or blemished . . but cut perfectly . . The best I have bought in years . . Thanks . . and `` I 'll be back for more ''
 They fit just perfectly and I am very happy to not only get the bestdeal around but beat the sales tax . Good old Levi 's rigid , bootcut jeans have been my all-time favorite jeans my whole life , andI just turned 60 . Got 'em within a week , free shipping faster thanexpected , so that was cool , too . Amazon rules !
 A well tried and true blue jean that I 've been wearing for decades . The fit , finish , and quality is a good as or better than ever .
 These seemed a bit darker in person than pictured but they were a great pair of jeans for my husband . This is his favorite style of jeans and he needed a new pair of &#34; dressy jeans . &#34; Same great jeans as in the past .
 All the Levi 's I purchased for my 16 year old son were ` made to fit ' ! From the straight to boot cut , they all were a perfect fit for his personal taste . They are well made and very stylish .
 Great jeans , great price , speedy delivery as promised ! Will definitely be ordering them again since my son is so tall and slim and this is one of the only places I can find his size .
 Great basic jeans in hard to find sizes . Not much to say otherwise . They have washed up well and held up well for my long and lanky teen .
 Jeans are a little tight in the thighs for my husband . It did n't come with packing slip so I 'm hoping I can return them !
 Good quality but I wish I had done more research on the colors . Ordered rigid because of the look online however the denim itself is rigid .
 Yes , these Levi 's are everything I had hoped they would be and More . Perfect fit , and I 'm very pleased tofinally have a BLACK pair ! Amazon 's got another winner !
 My wife thinks it 's funny that I rate my jeans with numbers , but , as a former 505 's man , I now prefer the 517 's 'cause ride my horses more and were my boots more ... plus , they just , plain feel good when they 're on me ...
 I love my levis . I was unaware they came in black . I bought a blue pair and black pair , Ilove them
 Just as described ! Fit & look exactly what he needed and wanted . And he said I could n't find this product ... LOLThanks !!! The Wife wrote the review ...
 These jeans fit great . The boot cut gives a good look without being sloppy . My husband looks hot in them .
 Got these as a gift for my brother , and they are the true blue classic with a great slim shape . Perfect `` date night '' jeans .
 These are the only jeans my husband will wear and we could not find them ANYWHERE . When i found them here i was happily suprised with the discount price and they look great . Would buy again from this seller .
 Excellent transaction on hard to find size and style Levi Jeans.Reasonable price and quick shipping.I 'm very pleased with this purchase !
 jeans were shipped quick , arrived in good shape the medium stonewash has that worn look most people want , I am pleased with the purchase .
 It 's very good ! 100 % cottonThe higher rise sits comfortably at the waist.A fit you want from a brand you trustFit width & length ; !
 non common size request was delivered promply before Christmas . My son was very happy with the fit and color .
 Great product ... my dad was very pleased . He had not been able to find the 517 .
 This is a very good price for this product , it 's the second one I 've ordered for my son .
 Perfect fit , every time . 517 's are difficult for me to find locally , but buying on line thru Amazon is best for me .
 These are like they used to make them ! More belt loops , great fabric - love them ! Ca n't wait to order more of these !
 I was having a really hard time finding the boot cut Levis - no one seems to carry them anymore . These are just what I wanted . They look and fit good .
 Bought these for my husband and they fit true to size , maybe a little bit long but not so much that he wo n't wear them . He love them , they look good so I love them ! Great Pants !
 I ordered these jeans for my 16yo son & he really liked them . The only thing he would have preferred was a lower rise , but he 's wearing them without complaints . : -RRB-
 I bought 2 of these and man they are nice . I 'll admit the guy wearing the jean in the picture sold me . Like I went and look for all the style of Levi 's , and these attracted me the most . Although I would n't tuck in my shirt like that . But they sure look good with some chucks and or casual boots and a dress shirt , with a silver wrist watch , and a pair of shades . They are heavy , and for me kinda tight even though jean of a different brand and style with the same size , fit me perfectly . I do n't know I guess it the way they are made . But for the look , I 'll take the pain any day , yes these jean are so tight mostly in my thigh area and waist , that I do get a little discomfort pain in my lower back . I guess it the way they are design and the heaviness of the jean . Of course I am in the process of getting in shape again . So with time , these will be perfect . I do like to sag a little , but as of right now I ca n't with these . Until I lose some of that belly fat I accumulated over the years .
 These are the jeans I always buy , they are a great comfortable fit . It is also great that Amazon stocks the size I need , it 's impossible to get from the shops .
 My body was made for Levi 's brand jeans , and I 'd worn through a couple of pairs . I bought duplicate black 517s - soft but not washed out , dark , with a predictable fit . They are my new favorites . The process went smoothly . Who knew I 'd be buying clothes online ?
 I ordered these for Christmas for my 6 ' 2 '' grandson who had grown out of all his pants after checking stores and finding his size is almost impossible to find . They were perfect and he loved them .
 The Levi 's 517 Boot Cut were purchused as a replacement of the wrong ones bought at a local store , These ordered & delivered ; I was told fit greatly before & after ; washThe price for my buying , totaled out a nuff less even with shipping to come fromamazon , rather than a store , even on sale after my tax & shipping ; -LRB- as a late gift -RRB- Theonly guestion I got was about , they did not have the Levi 's cardboard shelf tagswe see on Jean 's in store .
 I have worn Levi jenas for the last 16years , i am relatively tall guy and seldom get my size in the store , Amazon provides me my size and then quality as well .
 Purchased two pairs of Levi 's Boot Cut Jeans for my husband , the Jeans are very hard to find in the stores . Since my husband is tall , it is hard to find 36x36 .
 These pants are very well put together and I am a big fan of Levi 's pants durability which is what prompted me to purchase these .
 I am a woman but men 's jeans fit me better . These are very comfortable . My jeans do NOT get hung up on my boots as they do with jeans that are not boot cut .
 todo salio perfecto , tanto el envio como el paquete recibido , estan esplendidas , la hora de llegada fue la establecida por el vendedor
 Quality jeans , but not made in the USA.Arrived quickly and each pair were individually bagged in plastic.Good fit , for me .
 Fit well at the waist and look good . Last a lot longer than most most jeans and seem to get more and more comfortable the more you wear them .
 These are great jeans , they do tend to run a little big , both on length and waist . The color was a lot more bluer then it looks in the picture , so be weary of that it . It was too country , and I needed more rock and roll , if you know what I mean.Pros
 I like this style and they are getting very hard to find . The price here was the best I found , got in a timely manner . I 'm happy with my purchase .
 Purchased these jeans for my husband . They have a nice fit and look very good on . No baggy butt like the relaxed fit jeans .
 I usually have a hard time finding good bootcut jeans with the right fit in the retail stores . If the color/wash/fabric is right , the size isnt . If the size is right , the fit is too loose at the seat and thighs . Now that my favorite pair of jeans is past its prime , I started looking for a new pair to replace it . After hunting all stores in and around my area and trying all available bootcuts in my size , I was very disappointed . That is , until I found a pair of Levi 's 517 Blue Ox in the local Macy 's store . This was the first bootcut I found in the last 3 years that fit me perfectly . Since I already had a pair of jeans that was of a very similar color , I came online and started looking for the correct color in that fit . Unfortunately , it wasnt that easy finding one online . Kohls , Dillards and others had Levi 's 517s , but they werent the same ones I saw in the store . Apart from Macys and Amazon , no other site -LRB- including Levi 's own site -RRB- had the same fit in Rancher Light color I was looking for . I could have ordered at Macys website , but my past experience with Amazon was stellar and so it my first choice . Even then I was a little skeptical if the photos were close to how the jeans looked in reality . Since amazon had a free returns on this one , I went ahead with the order . The product , as always with Amazon , came 6 days ahead of their estimated delivery date . The jeans is , in fact , very close to the pictures on the website and the fit is PERFECT !! Thanks to Levi 's for the perfect color and fit and KUDOS to amazon for the perfect shopping experience !
 Finally Levi went back to 7 belt loops instead of the five . Makes a big difference for those of us that work for a living .
 I love these jeans . The wash and fit are great . That being said , they did arrive with a hole in the seat and the seam is a little crooked on the inside left leg . I really do n't care though because they fit so good .
 It is hard to find male , black , slim fit , boot cut jeans . Believe me I searched many places both on-line and local retail outlets . Finally I found these on Amazon and they were just right . Great fit , looks good , and the price was reasonable . I highly recommend them .
 We will take these to alterations but they were about 5 inches too long . Otherwise they are very nice .
 True to size , did n't shrink , and minimal wrinkling . Love the variety of sizing - son is tall and thin , and hard to fit , but Levis 517 made it happen !
 i traveled 80 miles one day looking for the jeans i like with no luck , it did make for a nice bike ride though ! then i went online looking and i found what i was looking for at amozon these jeans are hard to get in my hometown!Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean
 I have always appreciated the fit and quality of Levi jeans . The boot cut has a closer fit around the knee with comfortable room in the hips and waist . What Levi Strauss needs to understand is that there is a huge population of men out there that has a 31 inch inseam . Men between 5 ' 9 &#34; and 6 ' fall into this size range . My growth did not stop at 30 &#34; inseam , and did not make it to 32 &#34; . So I either buy high water jeans that show my socks , or I let the cuffs drag the floor which signicantly reduces the life of the jeans . I liked the fit enough that I spent an additional $ 10 to get them hemmed to 31 .
 product arrived as expected on time , the product was as expected and the quality was as you 'd expect to find in a brick & mortar store .
 Great fitting . I usually buy the 527 style but they did n't have black in that style . Ordered a 517 instead and love the fitting .
 The fit and look are great and I saved a few dollars . Will purchase more when the price is right
 love this jeans , the fabric is really good and the cut is impecable . it is original and the communication was really easy , i recieved really fast .
 I 've always wanted a ` black 527 ' but found out I could only get that in rigid black.I decided to try 517 n whao I might just decide to continue with 517 even with other colors.Just the perfect fit I love .
 Is exactly what i was looking for . . i being using this model for years , and this pair of pant are excellent
 I am a creature of habit . Being of slim build I have found the 517 Boot cut to be the perfect jean for me . I also know my size so the fit was great as received . This is not always the case when ordering over the Internet . Service was great delivered on time as expected .
 Noticed that they even have an extra pair of belt loops compared to my previous order . They are sturdy & dependable .
 The jeans were great ! The price was right , they were delivered in a timely fashion , and I lost a few lbs to get in them and I look good . lol . I recommend this company .
 These are the only jeans my son likes . He is tall and I have trouble finding his size in local stores and I could not find a better price .
 The jean came very quickly . They were the proper color , size , and cut . The packaging was excellent , and so was the quality of the jeans .
 Perfect price and fit for my husband . I would recommend this jean to any &#34; baby boomer &#34; who loves boot cut jeans.The jean has not changed at all good quality material and the right color . Thank you .
 This pair of Levi 's fits perfectly and the indigo color is the same as the Levi 's I wore back in the day !
 I gave these Jeans to my daughter 's friend for Christmas and he really likes them.He is real thin and wears motorcycle boots.He likes how they fit and loves the boot cut.He especially likes the rugged material .
 My order arrived in a timely fashion , they fit good and look great ... I 'm gon na get a couple more pairs .
 Levi 's 517 ` sThese Levi 's were the perfect fit . I like the fact that they are pre rinsed , which makes the fabric softer .
 Many of us do n't want to wear our Levi 's half way up our bellies . 517s are the best answer for that !
 The jeans are a good deep color . Wish they were n't quite as thin as jean material seems to be getting , but seems they are all like that now . Overall a good pair of jeans.These are hard to find in 36x36 , so I 'm glad Amazon carries them .
 Perfect fit right out of the box . Started wearing immediately , stitches , pockets , zipper perfectly in place . Survived several washes good as new .
 Good price , perfect quality . Very good model for young and old-aged people . Gorgeous color . Classic zipper . I 'm satisfied ! I recommend to buy it .
 These jeans fit me very well and look good . One thing I noticed however is that the denim has a more coarse feeling compared to other Levi 's jeans . I would buy these again .
 IL TELL YOU I HAVE BEEN WEARING LEVI 'S FOR YEARS ON END AND THE BEST DEAL I GOT ON THESE GREAT JEANS WAS FROM MY FAVORITE STORE AMAZON
 I love these jeans . For me they are perfect . Long enough to wear with or without boots and the fit is not too tight . How can you go wrong with Levi 's ?
 I got what I ordered promptly . I wish I had ordered a different color but -- my bad . No complaints . What else can I say ?
 My boyfriend says that these are his favorite shorts . Nice and roomy with some breathing room .
 I was thinking it of using it for my tennis . Unfortunately there was no clue saying it dint have pockets . Anyways its a good shorts for great price .
 If you go to the gym or play ball a lot and need a couple pair of shorts so you do n't need to do laundry every other day , these athletic shorts are perfect . They 're thin but durable . I got them on sale for like $ 10 so they do the trick . Do n't get me wrong its not like you 'll look like a dork at the gym , but if you 're looking for something super flashy , then these are n't them .
 Nice shorts that match almost everything . My boyfriend loves to wear them around the house . Great pair of shorts for an extremely great price ! So buy a couple pairs just to have around !
 no pockets , but yann will wear them all summer.yeehaw .
 My son likes these to sleep and wear under pants in winter . They are perfect , washing easily , and retaining their size and color .
 I like the shorts . The price is excellent . The shorts were a little thinner than I imagined . But I am very satisfied with the purchase .

 These T shirts are the best around , I 'm serious , they are very strong and very soft . A couple friends of mine work in the silkscreening business and told me that the `` Hanes Beefy T '' was THE best out there , so I ordered 6 of them on their advice . I 've never seen T shirts this nice , they are the most comfortable , strongest , and they feel like they will last forever . I 'm so happy with these shirts , they are awesome .
 These are great t-shirts and my boys love them . They are active in sports and there is nothing better than having these shirts to wear . They take the wear and tear and come back for more ! I highly recommend them !
 I own the Austin Reed dartmouth blazer in every color in which they make it -- it is a staple of my business wardrobe . Well made , quality fabric , nicely tailored , classic lines , appropriate for a professional woman . -LRB- something that can be hard to find at times -RRB- It should be noted , however , that the periwinkle and raspberry colors are lovely , but the fabric and buttons are slightly different than the `` classic '' colors -LRB- lighter -RRB- and the linings and interfacings are not as substantial as the brown , navy , camel , red and ivory . It 's still a good value , particularly as these are colors appropriate to warmer seasons and climates , but I was a bit surprised .
 This is a nice piece of luggage . Handle works well , as well as the wheels.Overall I am very happy with it .

 Believe me , if all women were ever to discover the power they wield when wearing items of clothing such as this , we men are utterly doomed.This is a wonderful product , as feminine as you can get , but at the same time most definitely not trashy . This is sexy with class , sexy with maturity and grace , communicating confidence and attitude , and it works flawlessly . The lace edging to the cups is a very nice touch , as are the dual shoulder straps . The plunge is very nice ; I only wish this model came in front-closure . One thing I note , though , and this was not really -LRB- to my reading -RRB- fully elaborated in the product 's write-up
 I wear this for rowing . It is very comfortable and a lot cheaper than the uni 's made exclusively for rowing . The shorts are the perfect length -- neither too short nor too long .
 I row in this uni . It is very comfortable and light-weight and significantly cheaper than uni 's marketed for rowers .
 I 've gotten tons of compliments on this bag . I absolutely love it ! I use it as a purse AND a work bag .
 gave this to each of my groomsmen as part of a gift basket full of mens accessories as a way of celebrating my big day and everything they did to help me get there
 It does what it is supposed to do . No problems ... no frills . Just easy functionality .
 Although you may be mistaken for a half a fag while wearing this pink tie . City of London ties are some of the best out there in design .
 I wear it fairly often with my regalia for the K of C Color Corps . The clip loosens occasionally on its own , but it looks very good for special dress events as well .

I 've never seen T shirts this nice , they are the most comfortable , strongest , and they feel like they will last forever . I 'm so happy with these shirts , they are awesome .
 If you know your size they fit . I do n't understand the reviews that say the sizes are wrong . Will buy again .
 was just what i expected ... very pleased with purchase . I like the fact that you can get 29 inseam . You can not get that in the store . No need to get them hemmed !
 his pants in overall line is still very good , sturdy , feels soft to the touch on the skin , the profile legendary cutting adds a touch of elegance , and even after several washings the fabric remains the same and does not shrink , the only thing I did not like the pants is that they have deteriorated the quality of the clips and metal buttons , formerly of copper and bronze , and now this are of aluminum and does not look good , however I recommend buying them are very good at the price .
 These came a little long , maybe an inch or two . Seeing as many others have noticed this is a problem with this fit , I suggest going one inseam size lower . I ordered a 30 '' and they fit more like a 31-32 '' . Other than the sizing , they are great jeans , and still look great on me . The boot cut allows the extra length to bunch up a little around the shoes , so you do n't really notice it . It actually looks good.I wish they sold these in a low rise version , as I do n't like hiking them up to where you might put dress pants or khakis . They stopped selling the 517 in a low rise though , so I 'm happy to wear them as is , great fit .
 I have always appreciated the fit and quality of Levi jeans . The boot cut has a closer fit around the knee with comfortable room in the hips and waist . What Levi Strauss needs to understand is that there is a huge population of men out there that has a 31 inch inseam . Men between 5 ' 9 &#34; and 6 ' fall into this size range . My growth did not stop at 30 &#34; inseam , and did not make it to 32 &#34; . So I either buy high water jeans that show my socks , or I let the cuffs drag the floor which signicantly reduces the life of the jeans . I liked the fit enough that I spent an additional $ 10 to get them hemmed to 31 .
 product arrived as expected on time , the product was as expected and the quality was as you 'd expect to find in a brick & mortar store .
 Great fitting . I usually buy the 527 style but they did n't have black in that style . Ordered a 517 instead and love the fitting .
 My grandson loves these jeans , since he 's rather tall we were glad to find Levi 's makes great jeans in his size . Strange as it may seem , many brands of jeans do not come in a 34in length .
 As an active equestrian rider , and a woman of 59 years , I 'm ALWAYS looking for comfortable jeans that sit at my waist -- I do n't like women 's jeans at all - the fabric in women 's jeans seems flimsy , and the low-rise , hip-hugging jeans for riding or leisure wear feels uncomfortable . The men 's Levis and men 's Lee jeans are very comfortable , and they can handle my active life -- for me , men 's Levis 517 bootcut jeans have best variety for colors , and toughest quality in fabric .
 Nice one . . Boot Cut with nice fit.Ordered the Jeans with 29L but got it 3inch longer . So I had to do alteration , usually I order my pants with 29L and it fits perfect on me .
 Levis 517 's fit me better than any other jeans that I 've bought . Gon na stick with them . I wear a 38 waist , 36 inseam . Have bought several pair over the past six months from various places and they all fit the same . Good quality control !
 BASTANTE BIEN . BUENA CALIDAD DEL PANTALON . ME QUEDO MUY BIEN . TANTO EL LARGO COMO EN CINTURA . EXCELENTE COMPRA A UDS . GRACIAS .
 The jeans are a good deep color . Wish they were n't quite as thin as jean material seems to be getting , but seems they are all like that now . Overall a good pair of jeans.These are hard to find in 36x36 , so I 'm glad Amazon carries them .
 Perfect fit right out of the box . Started wearing immediately , stitches , pockets , zipper perfectly in place . Survived several washes good as new .
 Good price , perfect quality . Very good model for young and old-aged people . Gorgeous color . Classic zipper . I 'm satisfied ! I recommend to buy it .
 I like this style and they are getting very hard to find . The price here was the best I found , got in a timely manner . I 'm happy with my purchase .
 Purchased these jeans for my husband . They have a nice fit and look very good on . No baggy butt like the relaxed fit jeans .
 I usually have a hard time finding good bootcut jeans with the right fit in the retail stores . If the color/wash/fabric is right , the size isnt . If the size is right , the fit is too loose at the seat and thighs . Now that my favorite pair of jeans is past its prime , I started looking for a new pair to replace it . After hunting all stores in and around my area and trying all available bootcuts in my size , I was very disappointed . That is , until I found a pair of Levi 's 517 Blue Ox in the local Macy 's store . This was the first bootcut I found in the last 3 years that fit me perfectly . Since I already had a pair of jeans that was of a very similar color , I came online and started looking for the correct color in that fit . Unfortunately , it wasnt that easy finding one online . Kohls , Dillards and others had Levi 's 517s , but they werent the same ones I saw in the store . Apart from Macys and Amazon , no other site -LRB- including Levi 's own site -RRB- had the same fit in Rancher Light color I was looking for . I could have ordered at Macys website , but my past experience with Amazon was stellar and so it my first choice . Even then I was a little skeptical if the photos were close to how the jeans looked in reality . Since amazon had a free returns on this one , I went ahead with the order . The product , as always with Amazon , came 6 days ahead of their estimated delivery date . The jeans is , in fact , very close to the pictures on the website and the fit is PERFECT !! Thanks to Levi 's for the perfect color and fit and KUDOS to amazon for the perfect shopping experience !
 Finally Levi went back to 7 belt loops instead of the five . Makes a big difference for those of us that work for a living .
 I bought the 517 as I prefer this cut to any other one of the Levi 's catalog , I place it even above the so famous 501 . I 'm fully satisfied
 I love these jeans . The wash and fit are great . That being said , they did arrive with a hole in the seat and the seam is a little crooked on the inside left leg . I really do n't care though because they fit so good .
 It is hard to find male , black , slim fit , boot cut jeans . Believe me I searched many places both on-line and local retail outlets . Finally I found these on Amazon and they were just right . Great fit , looks good , and the price was reasonable . I highly recommend them .
 We will take these to alterations but they were about 5 inches too long . Otherwise they are very nice .
 True to size , did n't shrink , and minimal wrinkling . Love the variety of sizing - son is tall and thin , and hard to fit , but Levis 517 made it happen !
 todo salio perfecto , tanto el envio como el paquete recibido , estan esplendidas , la hora de llegada fue la establecida por el vendedor
 Quality jeans , but not made in the USA.Arrived quickly and each pair were individually bagged in plastic.Good fit , for me .
 Fit well at the waist and look good . Last a lot longer than most most jeans and seem to get more and more comfortable the more you wear them .
 These are great jeans , they do tend to run a little big , both on length and waist . The color was a lot more bluer then it looks in the picture , so be weary of that it . It was too country , and I needed more rock and roll , if you know what I mean.Pros
 I was a bit concerned about this purchase . My husband likes the boot cut style and that was an excellent choice for my purchase . I have zero compliants other then I wish I 'd bought more !
 they were exactly what we were looking for . the orginal 517 , these are my hubby 's most favoritie , they also hold up better than the other styles seem to
 Will have to wash several times for them to fit . I buy this size all the time from other retailers and they are n't this big . Like the color and the style . They just run big I guess . Mainly in the length . Would buy again , just a smaller size .
 The fit is nice , the color is holding up through the wash . I am glad they have different sizes then the stores . Very hard to find 33 x 36 !
 I like the way these jeans fit.The are also comfortable.The ones I have purchased previously have been durable .
 These boot cut jeans by my favorite jeans maker are exactly what I needed.When I ordered my Harley Davidson boots , I needed pants for when I wear them and these ones are the only ones that fit on the outside where others ca n't . Shopping local yields nothing like these , just junk not worth the money.Quality is what I 've come to expect from Levi 's , outstanding with fit absolutely perfect.More orders coming soon for these.Shipping was prompt , making this buyer very happy.Thank you to everyone for helping this lonely guy that hardly can get out to shop by bringing them to me.Again , THANK YOU VERY MUCH !!
 I thought these were more on the casual side , but after putting them on , they can pull off a nice look . Very comfy , one day to break in . No frays , quality zipper . Dimensions were perfect . Overall color is a shade or two darker than in the picture . Awesome , new favorite pair .
 If you have a problem with jeans bagging in the rear , then these jeans are for you ! They are a great fit and very comfortable ! My husband loves them !
 Well , its a good jean , everybody know the levi 's quality , the item arive in perfect conditions . . so nothing more to say . .
 Perfect fit , every time . 517 's are difficult for me to find locally , but buying on line thru Amazon is best for me .
 These are like they used to make them ! More belt loops , great fabric - love them ! Ca n't wait to order more of these !
 I was having a really hard time finding the boot cut Levis - no one seems to carry them anymore . These are just what I wanted . They look and fit good .
 Bought these for my husband and they fit true to size , maybe a little bit long but not so much that he wo n't wear them . He love them , they look good so I love them ! Great Pants !
 I ordered these jeans for my 16yo son & he really liked them . The only thing he would have preferred was a lower rise , but he 's wearing them without complaints . : -RRB-
 I wear Levi jeans every day . Levi 's are the only jeans I will wear.I have worn Levi jeans for the past twenty -LRB- 20 -RRB- years ... or longer.Levi jeans are great ... in fact , i 'm wearin 'em right now ...
 Sent me what I wanted . 15 more 12 more 11 more 9 more 7 more 5 more 3 more done
 This is a very good price for this product , it 's the second one I 've ordered for my son .
 My skinny son is 54 years old and will not wear any other jeans - only 517 , boot cut Levi 's so I know what to buy for Christmas and Birthdays . I found a perfect fit for my skinny husband also .
 I ordered these jeansLevi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jeanfor a Christmas gift a short time before Christmas . I knew the size . I was somewhat concerned that I would not get them on time for Christmas The package came just before Christmas , and the jeans were exactly as pictured , nicely packaged -LRB- each pair separately enclosed in plastic bag -RRB- , the right size and color . I was very pleased , as was the recipient of the gift !
 The jeans were a Christmas gift and a style regularly worn by the recipient . They were a perfect fit . They are hard to find locally so we ordered from the Internet . The red tag on the back pocket did not say `` Levis '' and I have never seen this before . Is it significant ?
 Wow . These are great blue jeans , and they come in 38 long which is what he wears . HE wanted the boot cut , and a 34 waist was large enough . Usually he wears a 36 , , but I ordered 34 and they fit just right . Great looking , great price .
 I bought two pairs in two orders - both were perfect - exactly as I expected . On time . Good buy at a decent price .
 These jeans are tough but good looking and fit well . Amazon 's price is great , they are a good value for the money , and we always get prompt delivery and easy return if size is not right .
 the product is excellente , but needs to be taggedcorrectly , I order 34x30 tag say so , but real size was36x32 try buying them from differet source , and same thing never can get athe right size until i took a mesuring tape to the store and mesure before buing them !!
 I love those Jeans . . nice shape and denim . I ordered different colors from this pant and I love them all . it is comfortable , and have a nice leg openning that falls around the boot .
 I have been wearing 517 's for as long as I can remember . They fit perfectly and have remained unchanged for years .
 I 've grown frustrated by the lack of good quality/reasonably priced jeans in the market today . At some point , the Levis brand started to suffer in terms of quality/value for the dollar . Do n't remember exactly when that happened , but I started to buy my jeans from Banana Republic . Over time , they stopped making the style I grew to rely on . This created a 7-10 stretch where I could n't seem to find a good pair of jeans . Most recently , I purchased a pair of Lucky jeans - ridiculously over priced . When those began to fail , I tried Levis again and bought these . For a third of the price of Lucky Jeans , these Levis boot-cut jeans are really nice . They have a really substantial feel/weight to them and I could n't be happier with the purchase . I was so pleased , I ended up buying a second pair .
 Levis 517 Boot Cut Jeans are just as advertized . Good fit and a perfect boot cut . I highly recommend them for anyone who needs boot cut jeans .
 It 's a very good pant for my husband . Nothing too special or fancy ; he is very satisfied because he got what he expected
 execelente producto muy buena calidad , el pantalon vino en un excelente empaque y llego super rapido deverdad no tengo quejas lo recomiendo
 He looks hot in them , thanks ! What more can I say ? They did n't stay on for very long ... ca n't share any more details .
 I was somewhat hesitant to order Levi 's online but I could n't be happier with this order ! The jeans are exactly as described and fit perfectly . They are genuine Levi 's and are of the highest quality - not seconds . I ca n't recommend this seller highly enough .
 They 're good sellers and the product is very good , I like so much this jean . Ellos son muy buenos vendedores , el producto llego rapido a mis manos y era el esperado , los recomiendo ampliamente .
 d e m a r a v i l l a e s t e m o d e l o muy bueno
 These are the first jeans in a while that actually fit my waist size , inseam and the leg openings are perfect .
 These jeans fit well but the denim seems less hefty than the denim of the same 517s from 5 years ago .
 I received my pants very quickly . I was concerned that my size would be too short for boots . I was pleasantly surprised that the designer was thoughtful about the shape and length for this item &#34; after &#34; several washings . Pants are about 1/2 inch longer than the average pants which make them perfect for cowboy boots . Pants are also very comfortable . JCD
 Noticed that they even have an extra pair of belt loops compared to my previous order . They are sturdy & dependable .
 The jeans were great ! The price was right , they were delivered in a timely fashion , and I lost a few lbs to get in them and I look good . lol . I recommend this company .
 These are the only jeans my son likes . He is tall and I have trouble finding his size in local stores and I could not find a better price .
 The jean came very quickly . They were the proper color , size , and cut . The packaging was excellent , and so was the quality of the jeans .
 Perfect price and fit for my husband . I would recommend this jean to any &#34; baby boomer &#34; who loves boot cut jeans.The jean has not changed at all good quality material and the right color . Thank you .
 These jeans come washed so they are soft , supple and ready to wear . They are pre-shrunk so order the size you wear . I choose boot-cut jeans because I wear 12 '' - shaft western boots . Levies are the only jeans I wear because they fit well , look good , and get better with age .
 These jeans are perfect for the guy who wants to wear boots and not look like a geek or a thug . Just the right combination of loose and fitted .
 This is my first pair of Levi 517 's and I have to say I am very impressed . They sit on my natural waist -LRB- not low-rise like the 527 's -RRB- , and are fitted in the seat and thigh , and then flare out below the knee to fall on the boot . I 'm 6 ' 3 '' 190lbs and have a 36 waist and 34 inseam and it fit perfectly . Hard to find jeans these days that sit on the waist ... I 'm not a fan of the low-rise look or feel , so these jeans were a great find .
 Came to Amazon to order these jeans for my husband since no one ever has his size , 36x36 . I was pleasantly surprised because I did order two of these in different colors , Rancher Light and Rinse , both of which were the perfect colors . Perfect light colored jean and perfect dark colored jean . My husband and I are very hard to fit in jeans and tops so when something works we often get multiples , the problem however is that sometimes we buy the exact same thing in a different color and they fit totally different . Not these ! These jeans were great and the same fit ! Some people might not be able to appreciate that as much as I , but I was very grateful . It was a risk I had to take since his size is so common , but with free returns I had to take advantage . The boot leg is also very subtle but incredibly flattering . He does wear boots but of course they are n't necessary . I would say they are very true to size and great quality . They are currently his `` good jeans '' ... . that is until he `` accidentally '' wears them to go work in the garage . But when that happens , because it will , I will be back to purchase more ! By the way he is just over 6 ' 3 '' about 230-240lbs .
 My husband has been wearing Levi 's since he was a teenager . They are the most durable jeans and he loves the boot cut .
 I 've been wearing these for years.They do tend to fade easily so wash them inside out and use a detergent product for black fabrics .
 I bought these as a gift for a friend who has worn this style for years . Good quality , good fit , good style .
 Great jeans.Classical style.Low price.Wearing only jeans , levis always loved.Happy New Year!Amazon Forever!I love it .
 This hard to find style arrived on time . These classic jeans fit just the way they should . Going back for more colors .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Slim Fit Jean is leg looks like so long , . . but lap so tight but leg looks like so long . .
 My husband like it . . although I have to cut the length a little bit . . He said he may buy more in the future . . Hopefully they have shorter length then .
 They are Levis what more needs to be said ? Theyre the only jeans im buying from now on . They fit great and last 2-5 times longer than any other jeans ive bought .
 I use to wear the Levis low boot cut , but they discontinue to sell the color I want . After I give this one a try , I like it so much .
 Levi 's are always the best jeans around . Levi 's Boot Cut are the only kind my husband will wear . Always a good fit .
 Very high quality . Several pairs have consistent fit . Have bought and worn these 517 boot cut jeans for several years .
 My husband LOVES these jeans . They are a GREAT FIT , especially in the seat . The legs are n't too wide in the thighs and the bootcut bottom make a terrific silhouette . I like how he looks in them and he says they are REALLY COMFORTABLE . They look best in the darker color and are a good pair of `` dress jeans '' as well as versatile . We are ordering more . Ladies , get him these jeans !
 I 've worn Levi 's for over 50 years . From the days when you had to roll up the cuffs because they only had one length to super bells in the 70 's and now my favorite 517 's . They are always true to size and the workmanship is always excellent . The service at Amazon is always great too . What more can I say , I am one satisfied customer .
 These boot cut Levis have always been my favorite jeans . I had not had any in a while , so when my order arrived I immediately tried them on . I forgot how well they fit , and they are really stylish . Awesome . Will be ordering more .
 Authentic , just as described . Fast delivery . I am very satisfied with purchase . Smooth , one stop purchase . Husband will be very happy on Christmas day ! Thank you .
 i traveled 80 miles one day looking for the jeans i like with no luck , it did make for a nice bike ride though ! then i went online looking and i found what i was looking for at amozon these jeans are hard to get in my hometown!Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut JeansWhat a nice pair of rugged jeans . And I got them so FAST !! Thanks again.Roxann Hill
 Good product , on time and as shown in Amazon.But ... years ago , ordering the same # jean and the same size always brought the exact same fit and look . Lately , the same length , for instance , some times is a bit too long -LRB- can be fixed -RRB- or a bit too short -LRB- bad news -RRB- . The price to be paid for savings by manufacturing offshore . Lets see if with the crisis we return to the memorable `` MADE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ''
 What can I say ? They are Levis . Perfect fit , excellent quality , and the most impressive thing was the price . Unbelievable !
 These were a secret gift for my brother-in-law . He keeps complaining that he must do laundry every other day because he only has one pair of work pants , but then he just will not go get more or let anyone buy him any ! So , I got the size off of the one pair of jeans he owns -LRB- laundry is at my house -RRB- and I bought several other pairs that were similarly worn . I sneak in a new pair about once a week and so far he has n't noticed that he now has three pair of work pants . When I slip in the new ones , I put them in the dirty clothes hamper he uses . I wonder if he knows his pants are multiplying yet ?
 They arived bfore time , APO adress , in Afghanistan ,1 week took it to arive here , im suprised , and they fit good , i dont hawe no words
 I bought 2 of these and man they are nice . I 'll admit the guy wearing the jean in the picture sold me . Like I went and look for all the style of Levi 's , and these attracted me the most . Although I would n't tuck in my shirt like that . But they sure look good with some chucks and or casual boots and a dress shirt , with a silver wrist watch , and a pair of shades . They are heavy , and for me kinda tight even though jean of a different brand and style with the same size , fit me perfectly . I do n't know I guess it the way they are made . But for the look , I 'll take the pain any day , yes these jean are so tight mostly in my thigh area and waist , that I do get a little discomfort pain in my lower back . I guess it the way they are design and the heaviness of the jean . Of course I am in the process of getting in shape again . So with time , these will be perfect . I do like to sag a little , but as of right now I ca n't with these . Until I lose some of that belly fat I accumulated over the years .
 These are the jeans I always buy , they are a great comfortable fit . It is also great that Amazon stocks the size I need , it 's impossible to get from the shops .
 My body was made for Levi 's brand jeans , and I 'd worn through a couple of pairs . I bought duplicate black 517s - soft but not washed out , dark , with a predictable fit . They are my new favorites . The process went smoothly . Who knew I 'd be buying clothes online ?
 I ordered these for Christmas for my 6 ' 2 '' grandson who had grown out of all his pants after checking stores and finding his size is almost impossible to find . They were perfect and he loved them .
 The Levi 's 517 Boot Cut were purchused as a replacement of the wrong ones bought at a local store , These ordered & delivered ; I was told fit greatly before & after ; washThe price for my buying , totaled out a nuff less even with shipping to come fromamazon , rather than a store , even on sale after my tax & shipping ; -LRB- as a late gift -RRB- Theonly guestion I got was about , they did not have the Levi 's cardboard shelf tagswe see on Jean 's in store .
 I love my levis . I was unaware they came in black . I bought a blue pair and black pair , Ilove them
 Just as described ! Fit & look exactly what he needed and wanted . And he said I could n't find this product ... LOLThanks !!! The Wife wrote the review ...
 These jeans fit great . The boot cut gives a good look without being sloppy . My husband looks hot in them .
 Got these as a gift for my brother , and they are the true blue classic with a great slim shape . Perfect `` date night '' jeans .
 These are the only jeans my husband will wear and we could not find them ANYWHERE . When i found them here i was happily suprised with the discount price and they look great . Would buy again from this seller .
 These jeans fit me very well and look good . One thing I noticed however is that the denim has a more coarse feeling compared to other Levi 's jeans . I would buy these again .
 IL TELL YOU I HAVE BEEN WEARING LEVI 'S FOR YEARS ON END AND THE BEST DEAL I GOT ON THESE GREAT JEANS WAS FROM MY FAVORITE STORE AMAZON
 I love these jeans . For me they are perfect . Long enough to wear with or without boots and the fit is not too tight . How can you go wrong with Levi 's ?
 I got what I ordered promptly . I wish I had ordered a different color but -- my bad . No complaints . What else can I say ?
 The jeans was just perfect , the material , size and colour , nothing to complain about , and great timing too.They fit really well , and amazon 's size chart was very helpfull .
 Style & size stayed true since the last time I bought a pair , after gettingLevi 's Men 's 527 Low Rise Boot Cut Jeanthat are nothing like they used to be that 's all a shopper can ask .
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut . Black 42 waist / 30 length . If you are short , stocky and have a big butt . These pants are perfect . They wo n't bunch up at your fat knees and they will last a long time before the zipper explodes . I suggest you buy the next size up because they will shrink after 6 months of washing , drying and severe stretching in the seat area . Great pants .
 MY FAVORITE JEANS FOR 25 YEARS . I HAVE WORN MAINLY 501 MODEL , SO I READ MANY REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING THESE 517 JEANS.AFTER THINKING FOR A LONG TIME I DECIDED TO BUY ONE SIZE BIGGER THAN USUAL . IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE.THEY ARE JUST FINE , BLACK COLOR AND ZIPPER FLY WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DETAIL FOR ME !
 Great black on black bootcut jeans . They have even gone back to adding two additional belt loops a feature that went away several years ago .
 Fits well , my husband loves them , quality control met , consistent sizing , and look good on . Will order more as needed
 My son wears a 36 Waist x 36 lenght which is very hard to find . The Levi 's Men 's 517 are about the only jeans he likes and these fit him perfectly . They were shipped very quickly and the price was excellent . They were a birthday gift and he loves them .
 The jeans were pre washed and fit just like I wanted . They were really softer than I expected . I would buy this product again .
 I was so happy with the quality and fit ; I ordered 3 more pairs ! I will be good on jeans for awhile . The price was good too .
 Great quality and a lower price , for me is like a tailored jean , I 'm happy with this product . No more to say thanks to all
 After numerous failed attempts at the 527 's on amazon I finally got a clue and got these jeans . They are PERFECT ... great fit ... weight ... etc. ... just like the jeans I wore in high school 20 years ago ... . I 'm already thinking about a second pair . The light rancher is the perfect color ... . As for the 527 's MADE IN BANGLADESH ... amazing they could ever bear the levis name ... perhaps they were counterfeit . Thanks amazon for my true and needed exchange . The original pair of jeans I ordered ... yes the 527 ... was complete trash . These 517 's are real jeans for real cowboys ... and I 'm not one ... but I do wear a ton of boots ...
 Exellent product
 This pair of Levi 's fits perfectly and the indigo color is the same as the Levi 's I wore back in the day !
 I gave these Jeans to my daughter 's friend for Christmas and he really likes them.He is real thin and wears motorcycle boots.He likes how they fit and loves the boot cut.He especially likes the rugged material .
 My order arrived in a timely fashion , they fit good and look great ... I 'm gon na get a couple more pairs .
 Levi 's 517 ` sThese Levi 's were the perfect fit . I like the fact that they are pre rinsed , which makes the fabric softer .
 Many of us do n't want to wear our Levi 's half way up our bellies . 517s are the best answer for that !
 A well tried and true blue jean that I 've been wearing for decades . The fit , finish , and quality is a good as or better than ever .
 These seemed a bit darker in person than pictured but they were a great pair of jeans for my husband . This is his favorite style of jeans and he needed a new pair of &#34; dressy jeans . &#34; Same great jeans as in the past .
 All the Levi 's I purchased for my 16 year old son were ` made to fit ' ! From the straight to boot cut , they all were a perfect fit for his personal taste . They are well made and very stylish .
 Great jeans , great price , speedy delivery as promised ! Will definitely be ordering them again since my son is so tall and slim and this is one of the only places I can find his size .
 Great basic jeans in hard to find sizes . Not much to say otherwise . They have washed up well and held up well for my long and lanky teen .
 The fit and look are great and I saved a few dollars . Will purchase more when the price is right
 love this jeans , the fabric is really good and the cut is impecable . it is original and the communication was really easy , i recieved really fast .
 I 've always wanted a ` black 527 ' but found out I could only get that in rigid black.I decided to try 517 n whao I might just decide to continue with 517 even with other colors.Just the perfect fit I love .
 Is exactly what i was looking for . . i being using this model for years , and this pair of pant are excellent
 I am a creature of habit . Being of slim build I have found the 517 Boot cut to be the perfect jean for me . I also know my size so the fit was great as received . This is not always the case when ordering over the Internet . Service was great delivered on time as expected .
 These are the best jeans Levis has to offer in my opinion . They are not light and flimsy like some jeans Levis are making these days . The medium stonewash is a great even color . They do n't look faded on the seat and thighs or dingly and dirty like so many jeans do . These jeans are rugged , comfortable and last a long , long time . On top of that they look great . These are the only jeans I will buy .
 These jeans are everything they say they are . We will definately order these jeans again when the time comes . Thanks !
 100 % recomended , i have no doubt that i am going to buy another , it is really regular fit and boot cut
 This is the only jean my husband wears . He has the hardest time finding 36x29 . This is a perfect fit for him . When he needs more I will return to amazon .
 I finally found a pear of jeans that my wife said they look good on me and after being washed still fits great
 Bought these jeans for my husband . They fit very well and look nice . The shipment arrived on time . I was happy with my purchase .
 I ordered these jeans an exrta size longer becaause I wanted a high cuff . Got exactally that . Perfect !!! Now I 'm looking for a white pair
 Well , they 're Levi 's . There you go . Best jeans on the market . Last forever and fit great . The black does fade to gray quicker than I would like , but that 's probably because I wear only black , all the time . So ...
 I have worn Levi jenas for the last 16years , i am relatively tall guy and seldom get my size in the store , Amazon provides me my size and then quality as well .
 Purchased two pairs of Levi 's Boot Cut Jeans for my husband , the Jeans are very hard to find in the stores . Since my husband is tall , it is hard to find 36x36 .
 These pants are very well put together and I am a big fan of Levi 's pants durability which is what prompted me to purchase these .
 I am a woman but men 's jeans fit me better . These are very comfortable . My jeans do NOT get hung up on my boots as they do with jeans that are not boot cut .
 I am happy with the jeans and how they fit , but usually when I get 517 's , they are really stiff and then I get to break them in . This pair was already like pre-washed , just differnt than what I am used to , but I still like them and will wear them . Maybe I have to look into differnt types and find exactly what I am looking for next time . Thank you
 I 've been wearing 517 's for a good , long time now , and I love 'em ! The problem is that most of my local stores that sell them -- and very few of them do -- price them highly and also drastically limit the selection compared to the more popular 501 's and 550 's . Additionally , these jeans are often skipped over when it comes to the big sales . Well , shopping for them on Amazon is a decision I should have made long ago . The price here is hard to beat.As for the jeans themselves , they are of the rugged quality that Levi 's is known for . They fit like the product photo shows
 Have had these jeans for a few weeks now & am very satisfied.The flair from the knee down is discrete and does not look like the 70 's bell-bottoms . The fit on top was precisely as marked . The length seems about 1/2 inch longer than sized on the 501 's . Was formerly utilizing 501 slim fit jeans but found that could not place them over motorcyle boots . The 501s were great for rainy rides , but look too much like a cowboy , when tucked into the boots .
 As always , good shopping at amazon.com . Its always a problem finding the right length jeans for me . I found that in this levi 517 Boot cut jean , it feels good to finally find a jean that is not too short . A fact that i would have loved to know before i bought this jeans , is the leg opening size . This jean is very tight around the thigh area . I would just like a bit more details on the product a next time round . Other than that , it always a good shopping experience on Amazon .
 The length and waist were perfect . The quality of Levi jeans was the same as they had always been , good
 I always had to keep pulling up my previous pairs of Levi 's -LRB- any model -RRB- because they only had FIVE belt loops . A key ring and cell phone are not that heavy . I remember growing up with Levi 's having SEVEN belt loops and a heavier canvas . I was pleasantly surprised to see the ` new ' Levi 's 517 now have seven belt loops again . I started to buy a different model , but they still only have the five loops.I just bought a couple of these pairs from Amazon . I did check online at Kohls and their current batch of 517 's still show 5 loops . I will have to wait until I go to the store to see if their stock has been updated . Kohls prices are higher than Amazon , but I will recheck when they go on sale . I still check Amazon first for almost all my purchases.Overall , I like my new Levi 's jeans . I will compare them with older ones to see if the canvas really is slightly thinner . Outsourcing manufacturing almost always results in poorer quality and non-standard sizing . It has 100 % results in putting Americans out of work . I try to buy American whenever I can -- hopefully it will catch on.There is another issue appearing after I washed my new jeans with my old ones . It should n't have made a difference , but the new ones are now covered with fine fluffy hairs . I will have to use a lint brush when I take them out of the dryer for now . Although it may just be a ` break in -- first washings ' issue.Overall , I rate these jeans 4 stars . I will have to wait for a few machine washings to see how the color holds up . I may be old fashioned , but buying jeans looking like they are 1/2 wore out or have holes in them is ` less than optimal ' .
 I ran around town to find my husband Levi 517 's in size 35x32 for Christmas . In the stores , there were stacks of all different sorts of Levi 's to go through . Finally I came home and ordered them through Amazon and received exactly what he wanted . These Levi 's fit perfectly and look great . Very happy they come in off size waists . Thank you for making my job easier and receiving nice fitting jeans .
 I 've grown up wearing Levi 's and in particular 517 's in my adult life . I do like that Levi has added additional belt loops in the past year or so . Over the years Levi has cut some corners in manufacturing , but not enough to discourage me from continuing to buy their stonewashed 517 's . I like the stonewashed jeans since they are ready to wear , unlike the rigid indigo Levi 's that have to be washed several times to soften them up.I am buying more and more items from Amazon for the free shipping and competitive prices . It just saves a lot of time going to a retailer only to find out they do n't have my size or what I want . Even with Amazon collecting California sales tax , I figure the time and gas saved from having to go to a retailer is well worth it .
 Jeans are a little tight in the thighs for my husband . It did n't come with packing slip so I 'm hoping I can return them !
 Good quality but I wish I had done more research on the colors . Ordered rigid because of the look online however the denim itself is rigid .
 Yes , these Levi 's are everything I had hoped they would be and More . Perfect fit , and I 'm very pleased tofinally have a BLACK pair ! Amazon 's got another winner !
 My wife thinks it 's funny that I rate my jeans with numbers , but , as a former 505 's man , I now prefer the 517 's 'cause ride my horses more and were my boots more ... plus , they just , plain feel good when they 're on me ...
 Who does n't love Levis ? These are great ! My son was happy on Christmas day and so were we . Happy Holidays !
 It is great to find the exact size , color , and fit you want in a Levi 's jean , and also get it on time .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean , Medium Stonewash , 38x29They fit perfectly . Will probably order more in a couple months .
 Needed a size that few brick & mortar stores keep in stock . Amazon had style I wanted in the size that I wanted at a good price !
 These blue jeans where a great color and a perfect fit . Glad I ordered them . They were a present for my son
 Great fit for my long legs ! Hard to find jeans my size but Levi 's always comes through for me ! a
 Ordered these for my boyfriend , they run extremely small , he regularly wears a 32/34 had to send back and get a 36/34 . Other than that they 're great jeans .
 Finally a pair of Levi 's not only affordable , but a pair that is the real deal . . not seconds or blemished . . but cut perfectly . . The best I have bought in years . . Thanks . . and `` I 'll be back for more ''
 They fit just perfectly and I am very happy to not only get the bestdeal around but beat the sales tax . Good old Levi 's rigid , bootcut jeans have been my all-time favorite jeans my whole life , andI just turned 60 . Got 'em within a week , free shipping faster thanexpected , so that was cool , too . Amazon rules !
 The pants are great . I can not seem to find them in stores like Kohls or Target where I usually shop . I 'm not skinny as far as a skinny person goes but I have thinner legs than a lot of guys . These seem to be not as loose in the butt and thighs . I usually get the 505 's but they are cut a little bigger assuming tree trunk size legs . I have runners legs and these work . If you have big footballer legs , forget about it .
 Finally jeans that fit like the old Levis , these are the old quality heavy denim stuff not that wimpy pre-wash thin as paper junk denim . I would highly recommend these jeans to anyone who 's familiar with real Levis .
 Very easy shopping . I 'm familiar with the pants so it 's just a matter of price and convenience.Sitting at the desk for a few second beats driving to the store , finding out they do n't have the 517 in my size and driving back home . I 've always had trouble just finding the 517 at stores and shopping online sure makes things easier . The pants themselves are everything they 've always been , good fitting and tough.It 's nice to add the stonewash to my collection of darker denim so I do n't look the same every day.I was upprised how fast they came and that 's a big plus too .
 These jeans fit to size perfectly -LRB- for me -RRB- , are comfortable to wear , and have adequate material to reach a guy 's waist ... not hip-huggers . I 'll buy more of these ! Not a deal-breaker by any means but I would prefer them to not have the size label outside ... it seems Levi 's always does this .
 Amazon did not mentioned in the description that this pair of jeans is a Shrink-to-Fit fabric . No question on the quality . . it 's still an amazing jeans , the great Levi 's jeans , never goes out of style ... Take 31 '' waistline x 30 '' inseam if your size is 30 x 30 .
 36 &#34; inseam jeans at a reasonable price are hard to find . I really like the fit of these jeans just wish there were other kinds in the same length .
 Just what I expected . After soaking and drying , the fit and feel was as anticipated ... just like the good , old days !!! -LRB- I would estimate that length and waist both shrunk by about one inch ... as Mama warned , some 50 years ago -RRB-
 i got two pairs for my husband . levis are the only thing that fit him right . They make him look like he has a butt !
 I like this product because it fits very well and is comfortable . I recommend it to others . Good for those who like to wear boots .
 Finally found levis that were the correct size , if they are still available I will order more in the future
 Great pants . I wish there was a size 33 by 35 . I always have a hard time with pants size . I can get a length 34 , which shrink after a wash or a 36 that drags because there too long . But there is no length 35 in pants , so I do n't have much of choice .
 Excellent product the product I come very well and it is what was waiting of , I come in time , good
 I bought they for my boyfriend who had lost a bit of weight and all his pants were falling down , but these fit and stay up -LRB- Thank God -RRB-
 My husband loves the fit and the price.Great deal.You can dress them up or down!Look no further.Great looking jean , for the price .
 My husband 's body type includes slight pot belly and skinny hips and thighs . Almost impossible to find pants that fit well without being either too tight in the belly or looking baggy in the seat and thighs . He used to wear Levi 's Action Jeans which were boot cut jeans with slight stretch in fabric and a slight crease in the legs . These jeans always looked and fit great ; real snappy . Unfortunately they 're no longer available . Then went to wearing David Taylor Flexjeans from Sears which were almost as good . However , he now find that although Sears still sells jeans by this name , they are no longer the same . They are now made in China and are made from a crappy fabric and no longer fit the same . In desperation , he started looking thru available Levis products and found Levi 's 517 . Advertised as slim in seat and thighs . He did not expect much but was pleasantly surprised to find that they are indeed somewhat slim in the seat and thighs , even though the pants he bought had a waist size slightly larger than minimally necessary , thankfully allowing him to breathe . Bottom line was that he was very happy that these pants are not so tight in the waist that its hard to breathe , but still slim enough in the seat and thighs that they do n't look like old man 's jeans . Just wish they had the snappy look of the old Levi 's Action Jeans .
 I bought a pair of these in 29X34 and they are great . Fit perfect , really like the cut , lighter weight material but not too light , should hold up well . Just wish they would reduce the size of the internal tag -- I 've actually had to tuck it back into the pants a few times after putting them on !
 Finally figured out what cut and size I like , but the only place I can find them is the internet . Great pants .
 These were ordered off Amazon when I could not find them locally . I found the pants and they are describer perfectly and fit exactly as I had wanted them to . I will buy more in the future because they were perfect .
 Completamente satisfecha con el producto , exactamente igual a lo que ofrecieron . LLego en el tiempo estimado que prometieron . Ninguna queja , volveria a comprar de nuevo .
 The Levi jeans were just like I expected . The fit was perfect and received them in just a few days . Thanks !!
 The quality of the denim is lighter , so the good fit disappears by the end of the day . Otherwise , I like 'em !
 Hubby dearest was so happy to find boot cut Levi jeans at Amazon as it seems most stores have quit carrying this style of jean . He likes to wear boot cut jeans and Levi jeans are his favorite brand.No complaints about the fit or wearability either . Ordered two more pairs of jeans today as he 's a happy camper.Recommend .
 Good deal on the jeans and speedy shipping . My first pair of boot cut jeans . My girl friend really likes them on me . I got the dark blue -LRB- rinse -RRB- . Fit good and comfortable .
 Excellent transaction on hard to find size and style Levi Jeans.Reasonable price and quick shipping.I 'm very pleased with this purchase !
 jeans were shipped quick , arrived in good shape the medium stonewash has that worn look most people want , I am pleased with the purchase .
 It 's very good ! 100 % cottonThe higher rise sits comfortably at the waist.A fit you want from a brand you trustFit width & length ; !
 non common size request was delivered promply before Christmas . My son was very happy with the fit and color .
 Great product ... my dad was very pleased . He had not been able to find the 517 .
 These were a birthday gift for my son and I had them sent directly to him at college . He loved them and they fit great ! Good quality for the price . He liked the fit of the boot cut .
 These are great jeans for us gals , too , especially if you like to wear a true black color . I dress them up with a feminine camisole and heels , and have got many compliments on them .
 Exactly what my hubby wants . It 's difficult to find his size in our local stores . Very happy Amazon now has Levi 's in his size .
 I love my new bootcuts . I received them quickly , They fit perfectly . Thank you .
 Perfect fit , every time . 517 's are difficult for me to find locally , but buying on line thru Amazon is best for me .
 These are like they used to make them ! More belt loops , great fabric - love them ! Ca n't wait to order more of these !
 I was having a really hard time finding the boot cut Levis - no one seems to carry them anymore . These are just what I wanted . They look and fit good .
 Bought these for my husband and they fit true to size , maybe a little bit long but not so much that he wo n't wear them . He love them , they look good so I love them ! Great Pants !
 I ordered these jeans for my 16yo son & he really liked them . The only thing he would have preferred was a lower rise , but he 's wearing them without complaints . : -RRB-
 I bought 2 of these and man they are nice . I 'll admit the guy wearing the jean in the picture sold me . Like I went and look for all the style of Levi 's , and these attracted me the most . Although I would n't tuck in my shirt like that . But they sure look good with some chucks and or casual boots and a dress shirt , with a silver wrist watch , and a pair of shades . They are heavy , and for me kinda tight even though jean of a different brand and style with the same size , fit me perfectly . I do n't know I guess it the way they are made . But for the look , I 'll take the pain any day , yes these jean are so tight mostly in my thigh area and waist , that I do get a little discomfort pain in my lower back . I guess it the way they are design and the heaviness of the jean . Of course I am in the process of getting in shape again . So with time , these will be perfect . I do like to sag a little , but as of right now I ca n't with these . Until I lose some of that belly fat I accumulated over the years .
 These are the jeans I always buy , they are a great comfortable fit . It is also great that Amazon stocks the size I need , it 's impossible to get from the shops .
 My body was made for Levi 's brand jeans , and I 'd worn through a couple of pairs . I bought duplicate black 517s - soft but not washed out , dark , with a predictable fit . They are my new favorites . The process went smoothly . Who knew I 'd be buying clothes online ?
 I ordered these for Christmas for my 6 ' 2 '' grandson who had grown out of all his pants after checking stores and finding his size is almost impossible to find . They were perfect and he loved them .
 The Levi 's 517 Boot Cut were purchused as a replacement of the wrong ones bought at a local store , These ordered & delivered ; I was told fit greatly before & after ; washThe price for my buying , totaled out a nuff less even with shipping to come fromamazon , rather than a store , even on sale after my tax & shipping ; -LRB- as a late gift -RRB- Theonly guestion I got was about , they did not have the Levi 's cardboard shelf tagswe see on Jean 's in store .
 This is a very good price for this product , it 's the second one I 've ordered for my son .
 The jeans are a good deep color . Wish they were n't quite as thin as jean material seems to be getting , but seems they are all like that now . Overall a good pair of jeans.These are hard to find in 36x36 , so I 'm glad Amazon carries them .
 Perfect fit right out of the box . Started wearing immediately , stitches , pockets , zipper perfectly in place . Survived several washes good as new .
 Good price , perfect quality . Very good model for young and old-aged people . Gorgeous color . Classic zipper . I 'm satisfied ! I recommend to buy it .
 These jeans fit me very well and look good . One thing I noticed however is that the denim has a more coarse feeling compared to other Levi 's jeans . I would buy these again .
 IL TELL YOU I HAVE BEEN WEARING LEVI 'S FOR YEARS ON END AND THE BEST DEAL I GOT ON THESE GREAT JEANS WAS FROM MY FAVORITE STORE AMAZON
 I love these jeans . For me they are perfect . Long enough to wear with or without boots and the fit is not too tight . How can you go wrong with Levi 's ?
 I got what I ordered promptly . I wish I had ordered a different color but -- my bad . No complaints . What else can I say ?
 I received my pants very quickly . I was concerned that my size would be too short for boots . I was pleasantly surprised that the designer was thoughtful about the shape and length for this item &#34; after &#34; several washings . Pants are about 1/2 inch longer than the average pants which make them perfect for cowboy boots . Pants are also very comfortable . JCD
 Noticed that they even have an extra pair of belt loops compared to my previous order . They are sturdy & dependable .
 The jeans were great ! The price was right , they were delivered in a timely fashion , and I lost a few lbs to get in them and I look good . lol . I recommend this company .
 These are the only jeans my son likes . He is tall and I have trouble finding his size in local stores and I could not find a better price .
 The jean came very quickly . They were the proper color , size , and cut . The packaging was excellent , and so was the quality of the jeans .
 Perfect price and fit for my husband . I would recommend this jean to any &#34; baby boomer &#34; who loves boot cut jeans.The jean has not changed at all good quality material and the right color . Thank you .
 This pair of Levi 's fits perfectly and the indigo color is the same as the Levi 's I wore back in the day !
 I gave these Jeans to my daughter 's friend for Christmas and he really likes them.He is real thin and wears motorcycle boots.He likes how they fit and loves the boot cut.He especially likes the rugged material .
 My order arrived in a timely fashion , they fit good and look great ... I 'm gon na get a couple more pairs .
 Levi 's 517 ` sThese Levi 's were the perfect fit . I like the fact that they are pre rinsed , which makes the fabric softer .
 I have always appreciated the fit and quality of Levi jeans . The boot cut has a closer fit around the knee with comfortable room in the hips and waist . What Levi Strauss needs to understand is that there is a huge population of men out there that has a 31 inch inseam . Men between 5 ' 9 &#34; and 6 ' fall into this size range . My growth did not stop at 30 &#34; inseam , and did not make it to 32 &#34; . So I either buy high water jeans that show my socks , or I let the cuffs drag the floor which signicantly reduces the life of the jeans . I liked the fit enough that I spent an additional $ 10 to get them hemmed to 31 .
 product arrived as expected on time , the product was as expected and the quality was as you 'd expect to find in a brick & mortar store .
 Great fitting . I usually buy the 527 style but they did n't have black in that style . Ordered a 517 instead and love the fitting .
 The fit and look are great and I saved a few dollars . Will purchase more when the price is right
 love this jeans , the fabric is really good and the cut is impecable . it is original and the communication was really easy , i recieved really fast .
 I 've always wanted a ` black 527 ' but found out I could only get that in rigid black.I decided to try 517 n whao I might just decide to continue with 517 even with other colors.Just the perfect fit I love .
 Is exactly what i was looking for . . i being using this model for years , and this pair of pant are excellent
 I am happy with the jeans and how they fit , but usually when I get 517 's , they are really stiff and then I get to break them in . This pair was already like pre-washed , just differnt than what I am used to , but I still like them and will wear them . Maybe I have to look into differnt types and find exactly what I am looking for next time . Thank you

 These were a secret gift for my brother-in-law . He keeps complaining that he must do laundry every other day because he only has one pair of work pants , but then he just will not go get more or let anyone buy him any ! So , I got the size off of the one pair of jeans he owns -LRB- laundry is at my house -RRB- and I bought several other pairs that were similarly worn . I sneak in a new pair about once a week and so far he has n't noticed that he now has three pair of work pants . When I slip in the new ones , I put them in the dirty clothes hamper he uses . I wonder if he knows his pants are multiplying yet ?
 They arived bfore time , APO adress , in Afghanistan ,1 week took it to arive here , im suprised , and they fit good , i dont hawe no words
 36 &#34; inseam jeans at a reasonable price are hard to find . I really like the fit of these jeans just wish there were other kinds in the same length .
 Just what I expected . After soaking and drying , the fit and feel was as anticipated ... just like the good , old days !!! -LRB- I would estimate that length and waist both shrunk by about one inch ... as Mama warned , some 50 years ago -RRB-
 i got two pairs for my husband . levis are the only thing that fit him right . They make him look like he has a butt !
 I like this product because it fits very well and is comfortable . I recommend it to others . Good for those who like to wear boots .
 Finally found levis that were the correct size , if they are still available I will order more in the future
 A well tried and true blue jean that I 've been wearing for decades . The fit , finish , and quality is a good as or better than ever .
 These seemed a bit darker in person than pictured but they were a great pair of jeans for my husband . This is his favorite style of jeans and he needed a new pair of &#34; dressy jeans . &#34; Same great jeans as in the past .
 All the Levi 's I purchased for my 16 year old son were ` made to fit ' ! From the straight to boot cut , they all were a perfect fit for his personal taste . They are well made and very stylish .
 Great jeans , great price , speedy delivery as promised ! Will definitely be ordering them again since my son is so tall and slim and this is one of the only places I can find his size .
 Great basic jeans in hard to find sizes . Not much to say otherwise . They have washed up well and held up well for my long and lanky teen .
 Jeans are a little tight in the thighs for my husband . It did n't come with packing slip so I 'm hoping I can return them !
 Good quality but I wish I had done more research on the colors . Ordered rigid because of the look online however the denim itself is rigid .
 Yes , these Levi 's are everything I had hoped they would be and More . Perfect fit , and I 'm very pleased tofinally have a BLACK pair ! Amazon 's got another winner !
 My wife thinks it 's funny that I rate my jeans with numbers , but , as a former 505 's man , I now prefer the 517 's 'cause ride my horses more and were my boots more ... plus , they just , plain feel good when they 're on me ...
 These are the best jeans Levis has to offer in my opinion . They are not light and flimsy like some jeans Levis are making these days . The medium stonewash is a great even color . They do n't look faded on the seat and thighs or dingly and dirty like so many jeans do . These jeans are rugged , comfortable and last a long , long time . On top of that they look great . These are the only jeans I will buy .
 These jeans are everything they say they are . We will definately order these jeans again when the time comes . Thanks !
 100 % recomended , i have no doubt that i am going to buy another , it is really regular fit and boot cut
 This is the only jean my husband wears . He has the hardest time finding 36x29 . This is a perfect fit for him . When he needs more I will return to amazon .
 I finally found a pear of jeans that my wife said they look good on me and after being washed still fits great
 Great fit for my long legs ! Hard to find jeans my size but Levi 's always comes through for me ! a
 Ordered these for my boyfriend , they run extremely small , he regularly wears a 32/34 had to send back and get a 36/34 . Other than that they 're great jeans .
 Finally a pair of Levi 's not only affordable , but a pair that is the real deal . . not seconds or blemished . . but cut perfectly . . The best I have bought in years . . Thanks . . and `` I 'll be back for more ''
 They fit just perfectly and I am very happy to not only get the bestdeal around but beat the sales tax . Good old Levi 's rigid , bootcut jeans have been my all-time favorite jeans my whole life , andI just turned 60 . Got 'em within a week , free shipping faster thanexpected , so that was cool , too . Amazon rules !
 The jeans was just perfect , the material , size and colour , nothing to complain about , and great timing too.They fit really well , and amazon 's size chart was very helpfull .
 Style & size stayed true since the last time I bought a pair , after gettingLevi 's Men 's 527 Low Rise Boot Cut Jeanthat are nothing like they used to be that 's all a shopper can ask .
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut . Black 42 waist / 30 length . If you are short , stocky and have a big butt . These pants are perfect . They wo n't bunch up at your fat knees and they will last a long time before the zipper explodes . I suggest you buy the next size up because they will shrink after 6 months of washing , drying and severe stretching in the seat area . Great pants .
 MY FAVORITE JEANS FOR 25 YEARS . I HAVE WORN MAINLY 501 MODEL , SO I READ MANY REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING THESE 517 JEANS.AFTER THINKING FOR A LONG TIME I DECIDED TO BUY ONE SIZE BIGGER THAN USUAL . IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE.THEY ARE JUST FINE , BLACK COLOR AND ZIPPER FLY WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DETAIL FOR ME !
 My husband 's body type includes slight pot belly and skinny hips and thighs . Almost impossible to find pants that fit well without being either too tight in the belly or looking baggy in the seat and thighs . He used to wear Levi 's Action Jeans which were boot cut jeans with slight stretch in fabric and a slight crease in the legs . These jeans always looked and fit great ; real snappy . Unfortunately they 're no longer available . Then went to wearing David Taylor Flexjeans from Sears which were almost as good . However , he now find that although Sears still sells jeans by this name , they are no longer the same . They are now made in China and are made from a crappy fabric and no longer fit the same . In desperation , he started looking thru available Levis products and found Levi 's 517 . Advertised as slim in seat and thighs . He did not expect much but was pleasantly surprised to find that they are indeed somewhat slim in the seat and thighs , even though the pants he bought had a waist size slightly larger than minimally necessary , thankfully allowing him to breathe . Bottom line was that he was very happy that these pants are not so tight in the waist that its hard to breathe , but still slim enough in the seat and thighs that they do n't look like old man 's jeans . Just wish they had the snappy look of the old Levi 's Action Jeans .
 I bought a pair of these in 29X34 and they are great . Fit perfect , really like the cut , lighter weight material but not too light , should hold up well . Just wish they would reduce the size of the internal tag -- I 've actually had to tuck it back into the pants a few times after putting them on !
 Finally figured out what cut and size I like , but the only place I can find them is the internet . Great pants .
 These were ordered off Amazon when I could not find them locally . I found the pants and they are describer perfectly and fit exactly as I had wanted them to . I will buy more in the future because they were perfect .
 Great black on black bootcut jeans . They have even gone back to adding two additional belt loops a feature that went away several years ago .
 Fits well , my husband loves them , quality control met , consistent sizing , and look good on . Will order more as needed
 My son wears a 36 Waist x 36 lenght which is very hard to find . The Levi 's Men 's 517 are about the only jeans he likes and these fit him perfectly . They were shipped very quickly and the price was excellent . They were a birthday gift and he loves them .
 The jeans were pre washed and fit just like I wanted . They were really softer than I expected . I would buy this product again .
 I was so happy with the quality and fit ; I ordered 3 more pairs ! I will be good on jeans for awhile . The price was good too .
 Great quality and a lower price , for me is like a tailored jean , I 'm happy with this product . No more to say thanks to all
 After numerous failed attempts at the 527 's on amazon I finally got a clue and got these jeans . They are PERFECT ... great fit ... weight ... etc. ... just like the jeans I wore in high school 20 years ago ... . I 'm already thinking about a second pair . The light rancher is the perfect color ... . As for the 527 's MADE IN BANGLADESH ... amazing they could ever bear the levis name ... perhaps they were counterfeit . Thanks amazon for my true and needed exchange . The original pair of jeans I ordered ... yes the 527 ... was complete trash . These 517 's are real jeans for real cowboys ... and I 'm not one ... but I do wear a ton of boots ...
 Exellent product
 Finally found levis that were the correct size , if they are still available I will order more in the future
 Great pants . I wish there was a size 33 by 35 . I always have a hard time with pants size . I can get a length 34 , which shrink after a wash or a 36 that drags because there too long . But there is no length 35 in pants , so I do n't have much of choice .
 Excellent product the product I come very well and it is what was waiting of , I come in time , good
 I bought they for my boyfriend who had lost a bit of weight and all his pants were falling down , but these fit and stay up -LRB- Thank God -RRB-
 My husband loves the fit and the price.Great deal.You can dress them up or down!Look no further.Great looking jean , for the price .
 Bought these jeans for my husband . They fit very well and look nice . The shipment arrived on time . I was happy with my purchase .
 I ordered these jeans an exrta size longer becaause I wanted a high cuff . Got exactally that . Perfect !!! Now I 'm looking for a white pair
 I love my levis . I was unaware they came in black . I bought a blue pair and black pair , Ilove them
 Just as described ! Fit & look exactly what he needed and wanted . And he said I could n't find this product ... LOLThanks !!! The Wife wrote the review ...
 These jeans fit great . The boot cut gives a good look without being sloppy . My husband looks hot in them .
 Got these as a gift for my brother , and they are the true blue classic with a great slim shape . Perfect `` date night '' jeans .
 These are the only jeans my husband will wear and we could not find them ANYWHERE . When i found them here i was happily suprised with the discount price and they look great . Would buy again from this seller .
 Excellent transaction on hard to find size and style Levi Jeans.Reasonable price and quick shipping.I 'm very pleased with this purchase !
 jeans were shipped quick , arrived in good shape the medium stonewash has that worn look most people want , I am pleased with the purchase .
 It 's very good ! 100 % cottonThe higher rise sits comfortably at the waist.A fit you want from a brand you trustFit width & length ; !
 non common size request was delivered promply before Christmas . My son was very happy with the fit and color .
 Great product ... my dad was very pleased . He had not been able to find the 517 .
 This hard to find style arrived on time . These classic jeans fit just the way they should . Going back for more colors .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Slim Fit Jean is leg looks like so long , . . but lap so tight but leg looks like so long . .
 My husband like it . . although I have to cut the length a little bit . . He said he may buy more in the future . . Hopefully they have shorter length then .
 They are Levis what more needs to be said ? Theyre the only jeans im buying from now on . They fit great and last 2-5 times longer than any other jeans ive bought .
 I use to wear the Levis low boot cut , but they discontinue to sell the color I want . After I give this one a try , I like it so much .
 If you know your size they fit . I do n't understand the reviews that say the sizes are wrong . Will buy again .
 was just what i expected ... very pleased with purchase . I like the fact that you can get 29 inseam . You can not get that in the store . No need to get them hemmed !
 his pants in overall line is still very good , sturdy , feels soft to the touch on the skin , the profile legendary cutting adds a touch of elegance , and even after several washings the fabric remains the same and does not shrink , the only thing I did not like the pants is that they have deteriorated the quality of the clips and metal buttons , formerly of copper and bronze , and now this are of aluminum and does not look good , however I recommend buying them are very good at the price .
 These came a little long , maybe an inch or two . Seeing as many others have noticed this is a problem with this fit , I suggest going one inseam size lower . I ordered a 30 '' and they fit more like a 31-32 '' . Other than the sizing , they are great jeans , and still look great on me . The boot cut allows the extra length to bunch up a little around the shoes , so you do n't really notice it . It actually looks good.I wish they sold these in a low rise version , as I do n't like hiking them up to where you might put dress pants or khakis . They stopped selling the 517 in a low rise though , so I 'm happy to wear them as is , great fit .
 My husband LOVES these jeans . They are a GREAT FIT , especially in the seat . The legs are n't too wide in the thighs and the bootcut bottom make a terrific silhouette . I like how he looks in them and he says they are REALLY COMFORTABLE . They look best in the darker color and are a good pair of `` dress jeans '' as well as versatile . We are ordering more . Ladies , get him these jeans !
 I 've worn Levi 's for over 50 years . From the days when you had to roll up the cuffs because they only had one length to super bells in the 70 's and now my favorite 517 's . They are always true to size and the workmanship is always excellent . The service at Amazon is always great too . What more can I say , I am one satisfied customer .
 These boot cut Levis have always been my favorite jeans . I had not had any in a while , so when my order arrived I immediately tried them on . I forgot how well they fit , and they are really stylish . Awesome . Will be ordering more .
 Authentic , just as described . Fast delivery . I am very satisfied with purchase . Smooth , one stop purchase . Husband will be very happy on Christmas day ! Thank you .
 My grandson loves these jeans , since he 's rather tall we were glad to find Levi 's makes great jeans in his size . Strange as it may seem , many brands of jeans do not come in a 34in length .
 As an active equestrian rider , and a woman of 59 years , I 'm ALWAYS looking for comfortable jeans that sit at my waist -- I do n't like women 's jeans at all - the fabric in women 's jeans seems flimsy , and the low-rise , hip-hugging jeans for riding or leisure wear feels uncomfortable . The men 's Levis and men 's Lee jeans are very comfortable , and they can handle my active life -- for me , men 's Levis 517 bootcut jeans have best variety for colors , and toughest quality in fabric .
 Nice one . . Boot Cut with nice fit.Ordered the Jeans with 29L but got it 3inch longer . So I had to do alteration , usually I order my pants with 29L and it fits perfect on me .
 Levis 517 's fit me better than any other jeans that I 've bought . Gon na stick with them . I wear a 38 waist , 36 inseam . Have bought several pair over the past six months from various places and they all fit the same . Good quality control !
 These jeans come washed so they are soft , supple and ready to wear . They are pre-shrunk so order the size you wear . I choose boot-cut jeans because I wear 12 '' - shaft western boots . Levies are the only jeans I wear because they fit well , look good , and get better with age .
 These jeans are perfect for the guy who wants to wear boots and not look like a geek or a thug . Just the right combination of loose and fitted .
 This is my first pair of Levi 517 's and I have to say I am very impressed . They sit on my natural waist -LRB- not low-rise like the 527 's -RRB- , and are fitted in the seat and thigh , and then flare out below the knee to fall on the boot . I 'm 6 ' 3 '' 190lbs and have a 36 waist and 34 inseam and it fit perfectly . Hard to find jeans these days that sit on the waist ... I 'm not a fan of the low-rise look or feel , so these jeans were a great find .
 Came to Amazon to order these jeans for my husband since no one ever has his size , 36x36 . I was pleasantly surprised because I did order two of these in different colors , Rancher Light and Rinse , both of which were the perfect colors . Perfect light colored jean and perfect dark colored jean . My husband and I are very hard to fit in jeans and tops so when something works we often get multiples , the problem however is that sometimes we buy the exact same thing in a different color and they fit totally different . Not these ! These jeans were great and the same fit ! Some people might not be able to appreciate that as much as I , but I was very grateful . It was a risk I had to take since his size is so common , but with free returns I had to take advantage . The boot leg is also very subtle but incredibly flattering . He does wear boots but of course they are n't necessary . I would say they are very true to size and great quality . They are currently his `` good jeans '' ... . that is until he `` accidentally '' wears them to go work in the garage . But when that happens , because it will , I will be back to purchase more ! By the way he is just over 6 ' 3 '' about 230-240lbs .
 i traveled 80 miles one day looking for the jeans i like with no luck , it did make for a nice bike ride though ! then i went online looking and i found what i was looking for at amozon these jeans are hard to get in my hometown!Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut JeansWhat a nice pair of rugged jeans . And I got them so FAST !! Thanks again.Roxann Hill
 Good product , on time and as shown in Amazon.But ... years ago , ordering the same # jean and the same size always brought the exact same fit and look . Lately , the same length , for instance , some times is a bit too long -LRB- can be fixed -RRB- or a bit too short -LRB- bad news -RRB- . The price to be paid for savings by manufacturing offshore . Lets see if with the crisis we return to the memorable `` MADE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ''
 What can I say ? They are Levis . Perfect fit , excellent quality , and the most impressive thing was the price . Unbelievable !
 The only problem was I had was that I had to have them hemmed 2 &#34; so as not to walk on the cuff . I would have ordered them shorter but they were not offered in the waist size I needed . The waist fit perfect and having them hemmed was not that big of a deal . It coast me $ 12.00 to have them hemmed .
 I love being able to find the 517 's on line and not having to run all over town for the style and size I need .
 If you promise not to tell anybody , I wear lined jeans from eddie bauer or llbean when it gets cooler . I wear these when it gets warmer . True to size , do n't shrink too much .
 These are great jeans , they do tend to run a little big , both on length and waist . The color was a lot more bluer then it looks in the picture , so be weary of that it . It was too country , and I needed more rock and roll , if you know what I mean.Pros
 I was a bit concerned about this purchase . My husband likes the boot cut style and that was an excellent choice for my purchase . I have zero compliants other then I wish I 'd bought more !
 they were exactly what we were looking for . the orginal 517 , these are my hubby 's most favoritie , they also hold up better than the other styles seem to
 Will have to wash several times for them to fit . I buy this size all the time from other retailers and they are n't this big . Like the color and the style . They just run big I guess . Mainly in the length . Would buy again , just a smaller size .
 The fit is nice , the color is holding up through the wash . I am glad they have different sizes then the stores . Very hard to find 33 x 36 !
 I like the way these jeans fit.The are also comfortable.The ones I have purchased previously have been durable .
 d e m a r a v i l l a e s t e m o d e l o muy bueno
 These are the first jeans in a while that actually fit my waist size , inseam and the leg openings are perfect .
 These jeans fit well but the denim seems less hefty than the denim of the same 517s from 5 years ago .
 I bought two pairs in two orders - both were perfect - exactly as I expected . On time . Good buy at a decent price .
 These jeans are tough but good looking and fit well . Amazon 's price is great , they are a good value for the money , and we always get prompt delivery and easy return if size is not right .
 the product is excellente , but needs to be taggedcorrectly , I order 34x30 tag say so , but real size was36x32 try buying them from differet source , and same thing never can get athe right size until i took a mesuring tape to the store and mesure before buing them !!
 I love those Jeans . . nice shape and denim . I ordered different colors from this pant and I love them all . it is comfortable , and have a nice leg openning that falls around the boot .
 I have been wearing 517 's for as long as I can remember . They fit perfectly and have remained unchanged for years .
 These boot cut jeans by my favorite jeans maker are exactly what I needed.When I ordered my Harley Davidson boots , I needed pants for when I wear them and these ones are the only ones that fit on the outside where others ca n't . Shopping local yields nothing like these , just junk not worth the money.Quality is what I 've come to expect from Levi 's , outstanding with fit absolutely perfect.More orders coming soon for these.Shipping was prompt , making this buyer very happy.Thank you to everyone for helping this lonely guy that hardly can get out to shop by bringing them to me.Again , THANK YOU VERY MUCH !!
 I thought these were more on the casual side , but after putting them on , they can pull off a nice look . Very comfy , one day to break in . No frays , quality zipper . Dimensions were perfect . Overall color is a shade or two darker than in the picture . Awesome , new favorite pair .
 If you have a problem with jeans bagging in the rear , then these jeans are for you ! They are a great fit and very comfortable ! My husband loves them !
 execelente producto muy buena calidad , el pantalon vino en un excelente empaque y llego super rapido deverdad no tengo quejas lo recomiendo
 He looks hot in them , thanks ! What more can I say ? They did n't stay on for very long ... ca n't share any more details .
 I was somewhat hesitant to order Levi 's online but I could n't be happier with this order ! The jeans are exactly as described and fit perfectly . They are genuine Levi 's and are of the highest quality - not seconds . I ca n't recommend this seller highly enough .
 They 're good sellers and the product is very good , I like so much this jean . Ellos son muy buenos vendedores , el producto llego rapido a mis manos y era el esperado , los recomiendo ampliamente .
 I wear Levi jeans every day . Levi 's are the only jeans I will wear.I have worn Levi jeans for the past twenty -LRB- 20 -RRB- years ... or longer.Levi jeans are great ... in fact , i 'm wearin 'em right now ...
 Sent me what I wanted . 15 more 12 more 11 more 9 more 7 more 5 more 3 more done
 These were ordered off Amazon when I could not find them locally . I found the pants and they are describer perfectly and fit exactly as I had wanted them to . I will buy more in the future because they were perfect .
 Completamente satisfecha con el producto , exactamente igual a lo que ofrecieron . LLego en el tiempo estimado que prometieron . Ninguna queja , volveria a comprar de nuevo .
 The Levi jeans were just like I expected . The fit was perfect and received them in just a few days . Thanks !!
 The quality of the denim is lighter , so the good fit disappears by the end of the day . Otherwise , I like 'em !
 Hubby dearest was so happy to find boot cut Levi jeans at Amazon as it seems most stores have quit carrying this style of jean . He likes to wear boot cut jeans and Levi jeans are his favorite brand.No complaints about the fit or wearability either . Ordered two more pairs of jeans today as he 's a happy camper.Recommend .
 Good deal on the jeans and speedy shipping . My first pair of boot cut jeans . My girl friend really likes them on me . I got the dark blue -LRB- rinse -RRB- . Fit good and comfortable .
 My skinny son is 54 years old and will not wear any other jeans - only 517 , boot cut Levi 's so I know what to buy for Christmas and Birthdays . I found a perfect fit for my skinny husband also .
 I ordered these jeansLevi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jeanfor a Christmas gift a short time before Christmas . I knew the size . I was somewhat concerned that I would not get them on time for Christmas The package came just before Christmas , and the jeans were exactly as pictured , nicely packaged -LRB- each pair separately enclosed in plastic bag -RRB- , the right size and color . I was very pleased , as was the recipient of the gift !
 The jeans were a Christmas gift and a style regularly worn by the recipient . They were a perfect fit . They are hard to find locally so we ordered from the Internet . The red tag on the back pocket did not say `` Levis '' and I have never seen this before . Is it significant ?
 Wow . These are great blue jeans , and they come in 38 long which is what he wears . HE wanted the boot cut , and a 34 waist was large enough . Usually he wears a 36 , , but I ordered 34 and they fit just right . Great looking , great price .
 These were a birthday gift for my son and I had them sent directly to him at college . He loved them and they fit great ! Good quality for the price . He liked the fit of the boot cut .
 These are great jeans for us gals , too , especially if you like to wear a true black color . I dress them up with a feminine camisole and heels , and have got many compliments on them .
 Exactly what my hubby wants . It 's difficult to find his size in our local stores . Very happy Amazon now has Levi 's in his size .
 I love my new bootcuts . I received them quickly , They fit perfectly . Thank you .
 I 've grown frustrated by the lack of good quality/reasonably priced jeans in the market today . At some point , the Levis brand started to suffer in terms of quality/value for the dollar . Do n't remember exactly when that happened , but I started to buy my jeans from Banana Republic . Over time , they stopped making the style I grew to rely on . This created a 7-10 stretch where I could n't seem to find a good pair of jeans . Most recently , I purchased a pair of Lucky jeans - ridiculously over priced . When those began to fail , I tried Levis again and bought these . For a third of the price of Lucky Jeans , these Levis boot-cut jeans are really nice . They have a really substantial feel/weight to them and I could n't be happier with the purchase . I was so pleased , I ended up buying a second pair .
 Levis 517 Boot Cut Jeans are just as advertized . Good fit and a perfect boot cut . I highly recommend them for anyone who needs boot cut jeans .
 It 's a very good pant for my husband . Nothing too special or fancy ; he is very satisfied because he got what he expected
 My wife thinks it 's funny that I rate my jeans with numbers , but , as a former 505 's man , I now prefer the 517 's 'cause ride my horses more and were my boots more ... plus , they just , plain feel good when they 're on me ...
 Who does n't love Levis ? These are great ! My son was happy on Christmas day and so were we . Happy Holidays !
 It is great to find the exact size , color , and fit you want in a Levi 's jean , and also get it on time .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean , Medium Stonewash , 38x29They fit perfectly . Will probably order more in a couple months .
 Needed a size that few brick & mortar stores keep in stock . Amazon had style I wanted in the size that I wanted at a good price !
 These blue jeans where a great color and a perfect fit . Glad I ordered them . They were a present for my son
 My husband has been wearing Levi 's since he was a teenager . They are the most durable jeans and he loves the boot cut .
 I 've been wearing these for years.They do tend to fade easily so wash them inside out and use a detergent product for black fabrics .
 I bought these as a gift for a friend who has worn this style for years . Good quality , good fit , good style .
 The pants are great . I can not seem to find them in stores like Kohls or Target where I usually shop . I 'm not skinny as far as a skinny person goes but I have thinner legs than a lot of guys . These seem to be not as loose in the butt and thighs . I usually get the 505 's but they are cut a little bigger assuming tree trunk size legs . I have runners legs and these work . If you have big footballer legs , forget about it .
 Finally jeans that fit like the old Levis , these are the old quality heavy denim stuff not that wimpy pre-wash thin as paper junk denim . I would highly recommend these jeans to anyone who 's familiar with real Levis .
 Very easy shopping . I 'm familiar with the pants so it 's just a matter of price and convenience.Sitting at the desk for a few second beats driving to the store , finding out they do n't have the 517 in my size and driving back home . I 've always had trouble just finding the 517 at stores and shopping online sure makes things easier . The pants themselves are everything they 've always been , good fitting and tough.It 's nice to add the stonewash to my collection of darker denim so I do n't look the same every day.I was upprised how fast they came and that 's a big plus too .
 These jeans fit to size perfectly -LRB- for me -RRB- , are comfortable to wear , and have adequate material to reach a guy 's waist ... not hip-huggers . I 'll buy more of these ! Not a deal-breaker by any means but I would prefer them to not have the size label outside ... it seems Levi 's always does this .
 Amazon did not mentioned in the description that this pair of jeans is a Shrink-to-Fit fabric . No question on the quality . . it 's still an amazing jeans , the great Levi 's jeans , never goes out of style ... Take 31 '' waistline x 30 '' inseam if your size is 30 x 30 .
 Levi 's are always the best jeans around . Levi 's Boot Cut are the only kind my husband will wear . Always a good fit .
 Very high quality . Several pairs have consistent fit . Have bought and worn these 517 boot cut jeans for several years .
 My husband LOVES these jeans . They are a GREAT FIT , especially in the seat . The legs are n't too wide in the thighs and the bootcut bottom make a terrific silhouette . I like how he looks in them and he says they are REALLY COMFORTABLE . They look best in the darker color and are a good pair of `` dress jeans '' as well as versatile . We are ordering more . Ladies , get him these jeans !
 Well , they 're Levi 's . There you go . Best jeans on the market . Last forever and fit great . The black does fade to gray quicker than I would like , but that 's probably because I wear only black , all the time . So ...
 I have worn Levi jenas for the last 16years , i am relatively tall guy and seldom get my size in the store , Amazon provides me my size and then quality as well .
 Purchased two pairs of Levi 's Boot Cut Jeans for my husband , the Jeans are very hard to find in the stores . Since my husband is tall , it is hard to find 36x36 .
 These pants are very well put together and I am a big fan of Levi 's pants durability which is what prompted me to purchase these .
 I am a woman but men 's jeans fit me better . These are very comfortable . My jeans do NOT get hung up on my boots as they do with jeans that are not boot cut .
 todo salio perfecto , tanto el envio como el paquete recibido , estan esplendidas , la hora de llegada fue la establecida por el vendedor
 Quality jeans , but not made in the USA.Arrived quickly and each pair were individually bagged in plastic.Good fit , for me .
 Fit well at the waist and look good . Last a lot longer than most most jeans and seem to get more and more comfortable the more you wear them .
 I like this style and they are getting very hard to find . The price here was the best I found , got in a timely manner . I 'm happy with my purchase .
 Purchased these jeans for my husband . They have a nice fit and look very good on . No baggy butt like the relaxed fit jeans .
 I usually have a hard time finding good bootcut jeans with the right fit in the retail stores . If the color/wash/fabric is right , the size isnt . If the size is right , the fit is too loose at the seat and thighs . Now that my favorite pair of jeans is past its prime , I started looking for a new pair to replace it . After hunting all stores in and around my area and trying all available bootcuts in my size , I was very disappointed . That is , until I found a pair of Levi 's 517 Blue Ox in the local Macy 's store . This was the first bootcut I found in the last 3 years that fit me perfectly . Since I already had a pair of jeans that was of a very similar color , I came online and started looking for the correct color in that fit . Unfortunately , it wasnt that easy finding one online . Kohls , Dillards and others had Levi 's 517s , but they werent the same ones I saw in the store . Apart from Macys and Amazon , no other site -LRB- including Levi 's own site -RRB- had the same fit in Rancher Light color I was looking for . I could have ordered at Macys website , but my past experience with Amazon was stellar and so it my first choice . Even then I was a little skeptical if the photos were close to how the jeans looked in reality . Since amazon had a free returns on this one , I went ahead with the order . The product , as always with Amazon , came 6 days ahead of their estimated delivery date . The jeans is , in fact , very close to the pictures on the website and the fit is PERFECT !! Thanks to Levi 's for the perfect color and fit and KUDOS to amazon for the perfect shopping experience !
 Finally Levi went back to 7 belt loops instead of the five . Makes a big difference for those of us that work for a living .
 I bought the 517 as I prefer this cut to any other one of the Levi 's catalog , I place it even above the so famous 501 . I 'm fully satisfied
 I love these jeans . The wash and fit are great . That being said , they did arrive with a hole in the seat and the seam is a little crooked on the inside left leg . I really do n't care though because they fit so good .
 It is hard to find male , black , slim fit , boot cut jeans . Believe me I searched many places both on-line and local retail outlets . Finally I found these on Amazon and they were just right . Great fit , looks good , and the price was reasonable . I highly recommend them .
 We will take these to alterations but they were about 5 inches too long . Otherwise they are very nice .
 True to size , did n't shrink , and minimal wrinkling . Love the variety of sizing - son is tall and thin , and hard to fit , but Levis 517 made it happen !
 I bought the silver paisley vest and tie to jazz up an old suit that I wanted to wear to my son 's wedding . It certainly did the trick ! Everyone commented on it favorably .
 We bought this vest for the father of the bride because Men 's Wearhouse does n't have the Tuscany vest style in big sizes . They only can provide plain vest in bib styles for bigger guys and I do n't wan na embarrass my dad at our wedding ! We bought it in 3XL . It 's not the quality like Men 's Wearhouse -LRB- the back fabric is a lil bit thin -RRB- but you pay to rent the vest and tie at Men 's Wearhouse around $ 40 . And the tie matches perfect to the vest , the Tuscany style vest comes with a stripe vest and I do n't think that paisley and stripes match together well . We are so happy with this purchase ! I would buy the vest set in other colors again ! The shipping was fast and free , we ordered three -LRB- for the groom , father of the bride and the ring bearer -RRB- on Friday and we got it on Monday !
 The vest and tie have an elegant , expensive look . I purchased the set for my son to wear to prom . Although we purchased a medium , the vest was very wide , I guess to accommodate many different sizes . I noticed this to be the case with rental vests that other guys were wearing also . My son is very slim and , while I am not at all even close to a seamstress , or even handy , I easily tacked in the sides for a more custom fit . We received the shipment quickly , in only a few days using standard shipping .
 The Silver paisley vest & tie set did impress me :-RRB- nice quality & he looked good in it .
 I was extremely happy with this purchase which I received very quickly after ordering . The matching tie was a real bonus because I can wear it with many other outfits .
 After searching for and still not finding just the right material to have vests made for the gentlemen in the community theatre musical review I was directing , I turned to the internet . We were able to order 5 vests in different sizes that were perfect for our show . The one problem we had was that the XXXL vest -LRB- ordered after taking the measureents carefully -RRB- did not fit the portly young man and we had to alter it .
 cant really beat price . i bought i red and silver -LRB- thought i was buying white -- oops -RRB- . you get a tie and 5-button vest -LRB- w / solid back -RRB- . decent construction and materials -- no complaints.shipping was okay , b/w 7-10 days under normal shipping option .
 Purchased the silver plaid and gold vest with matching ties to compliment my black suit , they look fantastic !!! This look will put you way ahead of the fashion curve . Highly recommend !!
 Great products and everyone likes it . It was ordered for church choir New Year performance . Hope our brothers look great
 I purchased this item for my son to wear to prom . It was exactly what I was looking for . The $ 30 was well spent for both tie and vest which can be used in the future . I would purchase again if the need arises .
 Ordered this for our daughter 's wedding for the groom 's men . It was a great color and goes great with the tux .
 My son had three proms to attend . . so we bought him a tux and 2 of these vest sets . . one silver and one in lavendar to match his dates dresses ... they made him look like a million dollars ... fast delivery and a great product . . worth every penny
 What a great deal . Received it quickly and it was perfect for my son 's prom .
 It is no Hugo Boss but for the price you get a great vest of decent quality . The tie is a litte beneath standards , being a little tin of quality but all by all , a great buy for the money
 Great way to make an old tux look new . I purchased two and they are well worth the money . Great buy .
 Beautiful vest . So happy to have my fiance ' wearing this in our wedding ! This is about the 7th vest I have ordered . Great value
 I am happy with the quality and the stitch but I would not say this is of a very good quality , the buckle behind the west is cheap and inferior , I bought this for a wedding and probably I may wear only once or twice a year so it is all-right for my purpose.Buyers beware of the size , I bought XL and thought it would fit my chest 44 , but to my disappointment XL waist is 48 , I will not return but I decided to alter it by myself.I hope they will advertise the sizes correctly to make purchase easier .
 My son sported this totally magnificent vest and tie set . It gave just the right pop in his black suit . The fit was a bit full for my son who is slender . He was not able to take off his jacket though because of the fullness of the cut . He will probably grow tall enough for the vest to become to short before he grows full enough to fill it and take off his jacket . However , it is such an excellent look that we do n't care he can leave his jacket open and let it 's beauty be seen .
 I chose this vest for my wedding day and when I got it it was exactly what I was hoping it would be
 I ordered this vest/tie for my wedding . Had the Fathers and Groomsmen do the same . Shipping was quick , with no problems . The quality was surprisingly good considering the price . I wanted to stay low cost for me and the guys , so this was perfect . Just having the guys wear this with a dress shirt and pants . Great alternative to pricey tux rentals and a lot more comfortable for a summer wedding . Also , this does have a shine to it , which is exactly what I was going for . I 'm a big fan of silver , so like I mentioned , this product was a perfect fit .
 GreatThese people rockI asked for a quick postage as i needed it real fast for a wedding.I live in Australia.These people pulled out all the stops and got it to me with a time to spare in case of problems . -LRB- Which there was none -RRB- . The vest and tie itself was great . Great fit and looked fantastic.Would not hesitate to buy from these people again , Brilliant.Thanks again
 I purchased this tie and vest for my sisters wedding . . so if she likes it , I love it . For the price and quality its a steal . The material is a little thin but its only for one night for about 4 hours and will probably be the only and last time I wear it . . it 'll work for you , go ahead and purchase if you 're skeptical .
 I would order for Krisar Enterprises again . They get it , I had a problem and they had no problem fixing it . Great job
 I 've bought this men 's set for marriage ceremony . The delivery was around 10 days . I 've got excellent quality vest and tie for small price - that set really worth and I 'm absolutely sure enough good alternative / substitution of pure silk set from ebay which price is 60 . I 'll recommend to anybody who going attend some great event . I 've chosen grey & silver because my wife also has grey & silver color dress - it is looks good & shining , we did a lot of pictures and now , when I see on them - I 'm glad what made that purchase .
 Product came as described , a little wrinkled from the soft plastic envelope being in the mailbox but no big deal-it was just what we wanted and for a great price .
 Considering the price of this vest , the quality is very good . While it many not be a fine silk-type vest , it 's nice and flashy enough to give the impression of taste . The vest also fits fine , and is true to size despite the complaints that others have made.I have two main complaints about this vest though
 A great product with great shipping . The product does tend to run a little small , but it is great quality , and an absolutely beautiful product ! A great seller !!!!
 ESTOY MUY SATISFECHO CON ESTE CHALECO Y CORBATA , ES MUY ELEGANTE , GRAN ESTILO , BUENA CORBATA Y LA TELA ES SUAVE ...
 Purchased 2 vest and tie sets . I had to them for larger size . Love the sets . The return service was simple and fast . I 'll be recomending this purchase to my friends and returning for more . Thanks so much .
 Bought about 40 of these for my men 's chorus and my quartet . Happy with the look and the price . Have n't found a better deal out there , but you 'll need to order about $ 50 worth to get free shipping . You do need to order one size larger in the larger sizes to make them fit right .
 This was just what we needed for our daughter 's wedding . The vest and tie arrived timely , well made , correct color and fabric.I would highly recommend them to anyone for their products .
 Good quality for the price . I bought it for my hubby , fits good , texture is really light . Would not recommend to buy size bigger like some other reviewers recommended . Bought in size M and it was exactly like size M , may be even little bit bigger . Altogether we like this set !
 I was thinking it of using it for my tennis . Unfortunately there was no clue saying it dint have pockets . Anyways its a good shorts for great price .
 If you go to the gym or play ball a lot and need a couple pair of shorts so you do n't need to do laundry every other day , these athletic shorts are perfect . They 're thin but durable . I got them on sale for like $ 10 so they do the trick . Do n't get me wrong its not like you 'll look like a dork at the gym , but if you 're looking for something super flashy , then these are n't them .
 Nice shorts that match almost everything . My boyfriend loves to wear them around the house . Great pair of shorts for an extremely great price ! So buy a couple pairs just to have around !
 no pockets , but yann will wear them all summer.yeehaw .
 My son likes these to sleep and wear under pants in winter . They are perfect , washing easily , and retaining their size and color .
 I like the shorts . The price is excellent . The shorts were a little thinner than I imagined . But I am very satisfied with the purchase .
 I have the scrimmage dazzle too they re thin but durable and for 10.00 cool ! no pockets ok for me , lightweight shortsexcellent and Roomy my favorites great price buying of couple more
 My boyfriend says that these are his favorite shorts . Nice and roomy with some breathing room .
 I had some compression shirts from about 5 years ago . These new ones are not the same fabric quality as they used to be , fabric is lighter and less stretchy . Despite they fit perfectly and work fine , I 'm worried about the durabilty of the shirt .
 I love this bowtie , it looks just like the picture , I used twice so far and it looks awesome , it fits just right , the color matched perfectly , the price is right for the item , I would recommended to anyone looking for a nice bowtie without going to a store or looking to buy a nice bowtie for a nice price .
 I bought this item for a show I was designing , but we did not wind up using it . Still , the item was shipped quickly and I am sure one day it will be used for something !
 I needed the product for use in a senior show . I sang a song that Sinatra sang , and used the tie as part of my costuming
 If you are just planning to use a Bow tie for one occasion . This might work for you . No need to learn the complicated loops , just get this one . Quality looks decent .
 This was inexpensive and easy to use . Bought more than one for future use . Would definitely recommend this product and vendor to others !
 excellent product ! Needed spare bow ties for a mass choir for the boys who `` forgot '' these were terrific at a quarter of the cost of any others we found .
 I needed bow-ties for some High School boys that would be serving at my daughter 's wedding . I found these bowties for only $ 2.50 each ! I thought it was too good to be true , but it got even better !!! They shipped to me in TWO days ! I did n't pay extra for this service . The bow ties were great . Easy to use , well made and handsome ! Thanks for making our `` bow-tie boys '' looks so good and for not breaking the bank .
 I actually purchased this for my dog -LRB- yeah , I know , sorry ! -RRB- so ca n't really state how it works on a man . It is a decent quality , true dark black , and has a nice adjustable band .
 This product worked great for our costumes . Looks just like those worn with tuxedos .
 These bowties are for my sons to be in a wedding . It think they will work fine , although they may be a little big for a seven and six year old . I think they will be fine . They fit around their necks and are nice plain black to match their tuxes .
 A solid black men 's bowtie . It 's not a real bowtie , in the sense that it is pre-tied so you just have to clip it in the back . Good condition and shipped promptly .
 BOWTIE Solid BLACK Men 's Bow Tie Tuxedo Ties BowTiesThe Bow Tie I purchased is of excellent quality , asnd well worth the price .
 Purchased this when I couldm ' t find my bow tie to use with my Tux . It 's exactly as advertised and I put it to good use .
 great tie , I used it for photo shoots.my soots lookes great and very good with this tie and my tux.looked very professional.I really like your clothes also
 surprised it did not come with the costume and had to be purchased seperately but it does complete the look
 I purchased the BOWTIE Solid BLACK for our driver who delivered guests to our wedding . He and we got lots of compliments on it . It was a hit !
 No complaints , standard bow tie and for the price is well worth it . Ca n't really go wrong when on a budget .
 gets the job done . ladies dig it . i rock it as often as possible . great price need i say much more ?
 I was a little nervous about this item , given how cheap it was , but it far surpassed my expectations ! Great quality!Note
 The tie is pre-tied with a strap that fastens . It 's smallest adjustment is still a little large for me -LRB- I wear a 14 '' collar -RRB- .
 I needed some black bow ties for an event I was catering and these ties worked out great . My servers looked really sharp . They were also reasonably priced and arrived quickly .
 Nice quality , great for the costume it was purchased for ... could probably use for reals in a pinch . Kinda satiny . : -RRB-
 About a week before the chorus I was a part of was to perform portions of the Messiah for Palm Sunday , one of the directors informs us that we are to wear a black bow tie . I heard from others in the chorus that they drove all over town and could n't find a bow tie . No surprise , I mean , who wears these things anymore ? Unless you 're getting one with a tux , a standalone bow tie is n't something you 're gon na find at Walmart . So this was helpful because the bow tie was just what I needed , and I needed it in short notice and it came very quickly . Also it was cheap , and it would n't be nice to pay a lot for something I needed once . It was also very easy to put on ; I 'm a person that needs to look at a series of diagrams every time I need to tie a normal tie , so anyone can use this product.The only con is that when you buy it Amazon will recommend Child Abraham Lincoln costumes and Black Plastic Canes , and of course more bow ties , as if you needed more than one , when you go to the main page .
 this was a really nice bow tie . i definitely recommend this product , am happy with it but i wish the strings were a little longer . my neck is small , but i think it ca n't fit huge necked males
 I bought this for Halloween . It is of good value for this low price , although the quality of the material is not extraordinary . Because of the length , it can be used by both an adult and a child.Delivery was really prompt with Prime .
 In spite of its low price , this bowtie will certainly exceed your expectations . It is made of good quality fabric and is apparently well assembled . The adjustable strap fits every neck-size . Highly recommended , especially considering it is not an item one wears on a daily basis , which obviously adds to its durability .
 I bought this for my fiancee who is a musician -LRB- violinist -RRB- . He wears it in concerts all the time and says it is fine . The bowtie arrived very quickly and everything was in order . Great value .
 the bowties came very fast and none were damaged and perfect for my staff to use . it was easy to put on and very adjustable . only downfall is every now and then they would fall off on their own .
 Good accessory with some nice material . Solid buy.I wo n't give it a 5/5 though , because the threading that holds the left part of the clip on came out and I had to sew it back on -LRB- it 's like 5 minutes , though , no big deal -RRB- Also keep in mind I got it for about $ 2 plus $ 1 shipping , so I 'm reviewing it for THAT $ 3 price and no higher . At the current $ 6 would look elsewhere or expect more .
 i needed this for my halloween costume . im dressing up as lady gaga skeleton tuxedo . i saw this bow tie at a store for like $ 9 . so the price was great just what i need it ! i also love the fact that its so silky . i highly reccomend .
 Wan na look like George Clooney ? buy this one . Fast prompted shipping . Great bang for the buck . All you need is to supplement it with black suit .
 I had a masquerade party to attend at the end of the week and needed an inexpensive bow tie . The tie worked perfectly for the occasion and it was delivered with plenty of time to spare .
 The description for the product says `` silk feel '' , and I think that is a fair description . For the price you ca n't really beat this bow tie . It is adjustable so it will fit any adult neck . It 's very easy to put on , with a clip that connects to the back of the bow . Some bow ties are divided by a black plastic strip , but this one is not . It 's divided by the same material . If your in a pinch , or you just want to look nice without spending alot of money , then you should be happy with this tie .
 This is a nice black bow tie , simple and perfect for the price.If you need a bow tie , purchase this one .
 Received this tie very quickly and in great condition !! Fits good and seems like it should last . Cant go wrong for the price .
 This bow tie was perfect for my 19 year-old son who needed it for his orchestra 's Christmas concert . It is not too big , nor too small . Inexpensive and quick delivery .
 I ordered this tie for my son in law for Christmas . The price was incredible seeing what they are asking for the same tie in the malls . Quality looks great - I think he will like it . Delivery was prompt as promised ... I would order from them again .
 item was exactly what I wanted and the right price too ! Very timely delivery . Thanks .
 I needed some Black Bowties to give a sharp look to some servers at a social function and they were just the ticket , very attactive with a white shirt and inexpensive .
 I ordered this bow tie because I had borrowed my teacher 's after I forgot to bring my own to a performance . I lost track of the bow tie for a little while -LRB- I found it later on inside the pocket of my tuxedo jacket -RRB- , so I placed an order for a brand new one because I felt bad.As for the product quality , it is everything that someone would expect it to be . Personally , I prefer bow ties that must be tied by hand , but the hooked ties work fine , as well . Hardware looks to be sturdy , the shape of the bows and knot were appropriate , and the fabric was definitely of passable quality.All of this for only a couple bucks -- definitely a steal at that price , especially if you are simply looking for something cheap -LRB- or if you do n't know how to tie a bow tie ! -RRB- Definitely a small price to pay for my teacher to stop asking about the tie I had borrowed.Ordering , shipping , and receiving was problem-free . Bow tie came in a small plastic package , and everything was ready to go , no batteries or assembly required ! -LRB- - :
 I took the plunge to buy a formal/black bow tie for a wedding we attended a few weeks ago . I 've always worn long ties for over 55 years , but , wanted something new and different to wear for this occasion . I really was n't sure what I 'd be getting for only about $ 5 , but , other reviewers seemed quite satisfied with this purchase.When it arrived , I immediately looked it over and tried it on . Wow ! The bow was crisp and perfectly shaped . It used a simple adjustment strap and hook and would fit any sized neck . The bow itself has the perfect size I wanted -LRB- not too small , not too big -RRB- At the wedding -LRB- this is what really makes me glad I bought it -RRB- , I received several compliments and even a `` thumbs-up '' from people . I was the only attendee there with a bow tie , and in no way did I feel out of place wearing it , if anything , I felt a bit unique wearing a bow tie there.I 'm hooked on bow ties now and plan to order more from Amazon , hopefully from the same company I received this one from.They say you get what you pay for . in this case I honestly feel I got more then I paid for . Very satisfied all around including the nice plastic sleeve the tie is shipped in to protect it .
 Shipping was just as described and the tie was a big hit with my husband . He was looking very sexy at his Masonic Meeting . Thanks !
 My son needed a bow tie for his band uniform for high school , and I said , where do you get a bow tie . Looked up on the computer , and found this , it was priced great , so ordered 2 , since he 'll probably lose one as they are small , they were shipped quick . cound n't be happier with purchase . thank you .
 It did the job and cost less than half the normal retail value-what more do I really need to say ...
 Very smooth , silky and shiny ! If you need a stylish bow tie for work or whatever , this is the one you need .
 I was thinking it of using it for my tennis . Unfortunately there was no clue saying it dint have pockets . Anyways its a good shorts for great price .
 If you go to the gym or play ball a lot and need a couple pair of shorts so you do n't need to do laundry every other day , these athletic shorts are perfect . They 're thin but durable . I got them on sale for like $ 10 so they do the trick . Do n't get me wrong its not like you 'll look like a dork at the gym , but if you 're looking for something super flashy , then these are n't them .
 Nice shorts that match almost everything . My boyfriend loves to wear them around the house . Great pair of shorts for an extremely great price ! So buy a couple pairs just to have around !
 no pockets , but yann will wear them all summer.yeehaw .
 My son likes these to sleep and wear under pants in winter . They are perfect , washing easily , and retaining their size and color .
 I like the shorts . The price is excellent . The shorts were a little thinner than I imagined . But I am very satisfied with the purchase .
 I have the scrimmage dazzle too they re thin but durable and for 10.00 cool ! no pockets ok for me , lightweight shortsexcellent and Roomy my favorites great price buying of couple more
 My boyfriend says that these are his favorite shorts . Nice and roomy with some breathing room .
 It 's very good ! 100 % cottonThe higher rise sits comfortably at the waist.A fit you want from a brand you trustFit width & length ; !
 non common size request was delivered promply before Christmas . My son was very happy with the fit and color .
 Great product ... my dad was very pleased . He had not been able to find the 517 .
 These were a birthday gift for my son and I had them sent directly to him at college . He loved them and they fit great ! Good quality for the price . He liked the fit of the boot cut .
 These are great jeans for us gals , too , especially if you like to wear a true black color . I dress them up with a feminine camisole and heels , and have got many compliments on them .
 Exactly what my hubby wants . It 's difficult to find his size in our local stores . Very happy Amazon now has Levi 's in his size .
 I love my new bootcuts . I received them quickly , They fit perfectly . Thank you .
 I 've grown frustrated by the lack of good quality/reasonably priced jeans in the market today . At some point , the Levis brand started to suffer in terms of quality/value for the dollar . Do n't remember exactly when that happened , but I started to buy my jeans from Banana Republic . Over time , they stopped making the style I grew to rely on . This created a 7-10 stretch where I could n't seem to find a good pair of jeans . Most recently , I purchased a pair of Lucky jeans - ridiculously over priced . When those began to fail , I tried Levis again and bought these . For a third of the price of Lucky Jeans , these Levis boot-cut jeans are really nice . They have a really substantial feel/weight to them and I could n't be happier with the purchase . I was so pleased , I ended up buying a second pair .
 Finally figured out what cut and size I like , but the only place I can find them is the internet . Great pants .
 These were ordered off Amazon when I could not find them locally . I found the pants and they are describer perfectly and fit exactly as I had wanted them to . I will buy more in the future because they were perfect .
 Completamente satisfecha con el producto , exactamente igual a lo que ofrecieron . LLego en el tiempo estimado que prometieron . Ninguna queja , volveria a comprar de nuevo .
 The Levi jeans were just like I expected . The fit was perfect and received them in just a few days . Thanks !!
 The quality of the denim is lighter , so the good fit disappears by the end of the day . Otherwise , I like 'em !
 Hubby dearest was so happy to find boot cut Levi jeans at Amazon as it seems most stores have quit carrying this style of jean . He likes to wear boot cut jeans and Levi jeans are his favorite brand.No complaints about the fit or wearability either . Ordered two more pairs of jeans today as he 's a happy camper.Recommend .
 Good deal on the jeans and speedy shipping . My first pair of boot cut jeans . My girl friend really likes them on me . I got the dark blue -LRB- rinse -RRB- . Fit good and comfortable .
 My skinny son is 54 years old and will not wear any other jeans - only 517 , boot cut Levi 's so I know what to buy for Christmas and Birthdays . I found a perfect fit for my skinny husband also .
 I ordered these jeansLevi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jeanfor a Christmas gift a short time before Christmas . I knew the size . I was somewhat concerned that I would not get them on time for Christmas The package came just before Christmas , and the jeans were exactly as pictured , nicely packaged -LRB- each pair separately enclosed in plastic bag -RRB- , the right size and color . I was very pleased , as was the recipient of the gift !
 Ordered these for my boyfriend , they run extremely small , he regularly wears a 32/34 had to send back and get a 36/34 . Other than that they 're great jeans .
 Finally a pair of Levi 's not only affordable , but a pair that is the real deal . . not seconds or blemished . . but cut perfectly . . The best I have bought in years . . Thanks . . and `` I 'll be back for more ''
 They fit just perfectly and I am very happy to not only get the bestdeal around but beat the sales tax . Good old Levi 's rigid , bootcut jeans have been my all-time favorite jeans my whole life , andI just turned 60 . Got 'em within a week , free shipping faster thanexpected , so that was cool , too . Amazon rules !
 The pants are great . I can not seem to find them in stores like Kohls or Target where I usually shop . I 'm not skinny as far as a skinny person goes but I have thinner legs than a lot of guys . These seem to be not as loose in the butt and thighs . I usually get the 505 's but they are cut a little bigger assuming tree trunk size legs . I have runners legs and these work . If you have big footballer legs , forget about it .
 Finally jeans that fit like the old Levis , these are the old quality heavy denim stuff not that wimpy pre-wash thin as paper junk denim . I would highly recommend these jeans to anyone who 's familiar with real Levis .
 Very easy shopping . I 'm familiar with the pants so it 's just a matter of price and convenience.Sitting at the desk for a few second beats driving to the store , finding out they do n't have the 517 in my size and driving back home . I 've always had trouble just finding the 517 at stores and shopping online sure makes things easier . The pants themselves are everything they 've always been , good fitting and tough.It 's nice to add the stonewash to my collection of darker denim so I do n't look the same every day.I was upprised how fast they came and that 's a big plus too .
 These jeans fit to size perfectly -LRB- for me -RRB- , are comfortable to wear , and have adequate material to reach a guy 's waist ... not hip-huggers . I 'll buy more of these ! Not a deal-breaker by any means but I would prefer them to not have the size label outside ... it seems Levi 's always does this .
 Amazon did not mentioned in the description that this pair of jeans is a Shrink-to-Fit fabric . No question on the quality . . it 's still an amazing jeans , the great Levi 's jeans , never goes out of style ... Take 31 '' waistline x 30 '' inseam if your size is 30 x 30 .
 Levi 's are always the best jeans around . Levi 's Boot Cut are the only kind my husband will wear . Always a good fit .
 Good quality but I wish I had done more research on the colors . Ordered rigid because of the look online however the denim itself is rigid .
 Yes , these Levi 's are everything I had hoped they would be and More . Perfect fit , and I 'm very pleased tofinally have a BLACK pair ! Amazon 's got another winner !
 My wife thinks it 's funny that I rate my jeans with numbers , but , as a former 505 's man , I now prefer the 517 's 'cause ride my horses more and were my boots more ... plus , they just , plain feel good when they 're on me ...
 Who does n't love Levis ? These are great ! My son was happy on Christmas day and so were we . Happy Holidays !
 It is great to find the exact size , color , and fit you want in a Levi 's jean , and also get it on time .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean , Medium Stonewash , 38x29They fit perfectly . Will probably order more in a couple months .
 Needed a size that few brick & mortar stores keep in stock . Amazon had style I wanted in the size that I wanted at a good price !
 These blue jeans where a great color and a perfect fit . Glad I ordered them . They were a present for my son
 My husband has been wearing Levi 's since he was a teenager . They are the most durable jeans and he loves the boot cut .
 I love being able to find the 517 's on line and not having to run all over town for the style and size I need .
 If you promise not to tell anybody , I wear lined jeans from eddie bauer or llbean when it gets cooler . I wear these when it gets warmer . True to size , do n't shrink too much .
 These were a secret gift for my brother-in-law . He keeps complaining that he must do laundry every other day because he only has one pair of work pants , but then he just will not go get more or let anyone buy him any ! So , I got the size off of the one pair of jeans he owns -LRB- laundry is at my house -RRB- and I bought several other pairs that were similarly worn . I sneak in a new pair about once a week and so far he has n't noticed that he now has three pair of work pants . When I slip in the new ones , I put them in the dirty clothes hamper he uses . I wonder if he knows his pants are multiplying yet ?
 They arived bfore time , APO adress , in Afghanistan ,1 week took it to arive here , im suprised , and they fit good , i dont hawe no words
 36 &#34; inseam jeans at a reasonable price are hard to find . I really like the fit of these jeans just wish there were other kinds in the same length .
 Just what I expected . After soaking and drying , the fit and feel was as anticipated ... just like the good , old days !!! -LRB- I would estimate that length and waist both shrunk by about one inch ... as Mama warned , some 50 years ago -RRB-
 I am happy with the jeans and how they fit , but usually when I get 517 's , they are really stiff and then I get to break them in . This pair was already like pre-washed , just differnt than what I am used to , but I still like them and will wear them . Maybe I have to look into differnt types and find exactly what I am looking for next time . Thank you
 I 've been wearing 517 's for a good , long time now , and I love 'em ! The problem is that most of my local stores that sell them -- and very few of them do -- price them highly and also drastically limit the selection compared to the more popular 501 's and 550 's . Additionally , these jeans are often skipped over when it comes to the big sales . Well , shopping for them on Amazon is a decision I should have made long ago . The price here is hard to beat.As for the jeans themselves , they are of the rugged quality that Levi 's is known for . They fit like the product photo shows
 Have had these jeans for a few weeks now & am very satisfied.The flair from the knee down is discrete and does not look like the 70 's bell-bottoms . The fit on top was precisely as marked . The length seems about 1/2 inch longer than sized on the 501 's . Was formerly utilizing 501 slim fit jeans but found that could not place them over motorcyle boots . The 501s were great for rainy rides , but look too much like a cowboy , when tucked into the boots .
 As always , good shopping at amazon.com . Its always a problem finding the right length jeans for me . I found that in this levi 517 Boot cut jean , it feels good to finally find a jean that is not too short . A fact that i would have loved to know before i bought this jeans , is the leg opening size . This jean is very tight around the thigh area . I would just like a bit more details on the product a next time round . Other than that , it always a good shopping experience on Amazon .
 The length and waist were perfect . The quality of Levi jeans was the same as they had always been , good
 I always had to keep pulling up my previous pairs of Levi 's -LRB- any model -RRB- because they only had FIVE belt loops . A key ring and cell phone are not that heavy . I remember growing up with Levi 's having SEVEN belt loops and a heavier canvas . I was pleasantly surprised to see the ` new ' Levi 's 517 now have seven belt loops again . I started to buy a different model , but they still only have the five loops.I just bought a couple of these pairs from Amazon . I did check online at Kohls and their current batch of 517 's still show 5 loops . I will have to wait until I go to the store to see if their stock has been updated . Kohls prices are higher than Amazon , but I will recheck when they go on sale . I still check Amazon first for almost all my purchases.Overall , I like my new Levi 's jeans . I will compare them with older ones to see if the canvas really is slightly thinner . Outsourcing manufacturing almost always results in poorer quality and non-standard sizing . It has 100 % results in putting Americans out of work . I try to buy American whenever I can -- hopefully it will catch on.There is another issue appearing after I washed my new jeans with my old ones . It should n't have made a difference , but the new ones are now covered with fine fluffy hairs . I will have to use a lint brush when I take them out of the dryer for now . Although it may just be a ` break in -- first washings ' issue.Overall , I rate these jeans 4 stars . I will have to wait for a few machine washings to see how the color holds up . I may be old fashioned , but buying jeans looking like they are 1/2 wore out or have holes in them is ` less than optimal ' .
 I ran around town to find my husband Levi 517 's in size 35x32 for Christmas . In the stores , there were stacks of all different sorts of Levi 's to go through . Finally I came home and ordered them through Amazon and received exactly what he wanted . These Levi 's fit perfectly and look great . Very happy they come in off size waists . Thank you for making my job easier and receiving nice fitting jeans .
 I 've grown up wearing Levi 's and in particular 517 's in my adult life . I do like that Levi has added additional belt loops in the past year or so . Over the years Levi has cut some corners in manufacturing , but not enough to discourage me from continuing to buy their stonewashed 517 's . I like the stonewashed jeans since they are ready to wear , unlike the rigid indigo Levi 's that have to be washed several times to soften them up.I am buying more and more items from Amazon for the free shipping and competitive prices . It just saves a lot of time going to a retailer only to find out they do n't have my size or what I want . Even with Amazon collecting California sales tax , I figure the time and gas saved from having to go to a retailer is well worth it .
 Very high quality . Several pairs have consistent fit . Have bought and worn these 517 boot cut jeans for several years .
 My husband LOVES these jeans . They are a GREAT FIT , especially in the seat . The legs are n't too wide in the thighs and the bootcut bottom make a terrific silhouette . I like how he looks in them and he says they are REALLY COMFORTABLE . They look best in the darker color and are a good pair of `` dress jeans '' as well as versatile . We are ordering more . Ladies , get him these jeans !
 I 've worn Levi 's for over 50 years . From the days when you had to roll up the cuffs because they only had one length to super bells in the 70 's and now my favorite 517 's . They are always true to size and the workmanship is always excellent . The service at Amazon is always great too . What more can I say , I am one satisfied customer .
 These boot cut Levis have always been my favorite jeans . I had not had any in a while , so when my order arrived I immediately tried them on . I forgot how well they fit , and they are really stylish . Awesome . Will be ordering more .
 Authentic , just as described . Fast delivery . I am very satisfied with purchase . Smooth , one stop purchase . Husband will be very happy on Christmas day ! Thank you .
 My grandson loves these jeans , since he 's rather tall we were glad to find Levi 's makes great jeans in his size . Strange as it may seem , many brands of jeans do not come in a 34in length .
 As an active equestrian rider , and a woman of 59 years , I 'm ALWAYS looking for comfortable jeans that sit at my waist -- I do n't like women 's jeans at all - the fabric in women 's jeans seems flimsy , and the low-rise , hip-hugging jeans for riding or leisure wear feels uncomfortable . The men 's Levis and men 's Lee jeans are very comfortable , and they can handle my active life -- for me , men 's Levis 517 bootcut jeans have best variety for colors , and toughest quality in fabric .
 I 've been wearing these for years.They do tend to fade easily so wash them inside out and use a detergent product for black fabrics .
 I bought these as a gift for a friend who has worn this style for years . Good quality , good fit , good style .
 Great jeans.Classical style.Low price.Wearing only jeans , levis always loved.Happy New Year!Amazon Forever!I love it .
 This hard to find style arrived on time . These classic jeans fit just the way they should . Going back for more colors .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Slim Fit Jean is leg looks like so long , . . but lap so tight but leg looks like so long . .
 My husband like it . . although I have to cut the length a little bit . . He said he may buy more in the future . . Hopefully they have shorter length then .
 They are Levis what more needs to be said ? Theyre the only jeans im buying from now on . They fit great and last 2-5 times longer than any other jeans ive bought .
 I use to wear the Levis low boot cut , but they discontinue to sell the color I want . After I give this one a try , I like it so much .
 If you know your size they fit . I do n't understand the reviews that say the sizes are wrong . Will buy again .
 was just what i expected ... very pleased with purchase . I like the fact that you can get 29 inseam . You can not get that in the store . No need to get them hemmed !
 i got two pairs for my husband . levis are the only thing that fit him right . They make him look like he has a butt !
 I like this product because it fits very well and is comfortable . I recommend it to others . Good for those who like to wear boots .
 Finally found levis that were the correct size , if they are still available I will order more in the future
 Great pants . I wish there was a size 33 by 35 . I always have a hard time with pants size . I can get a length 34 , which shrink after a wash or a 36 that drags because there too long . But there is no length 35 in pants , so I do n't have much of choice .
 Excellent product the product I come very well and it is what was waiting of , I come in time , good
 I bought they for my boyfriend who had lost a bit of weight and all his pants were falling down , but these fit and stay up -LRB- Thank God -RRB-
 My husband loves the fit and the price.Great deal.You can dress them up or down!Look no further.Great looking jean , for the price .
 Bought these jeans for my husband . They fit very well and look nice . The shipment arrived on time . I was happy with my purchase .
 Great black on black bootcut jeans . They have even gone back to adding two additional belt loops a feature that went away several years ago .
 Fits well , my husband loves them , quality control met , consistent sizing , and look good on . Will order more as needed
 My son wears a 36 Waist x 36 lenght which is very hard to find . The Levi 's Men 's 517 are about the only jeans he likes and these fit him perfectly . They were shipped very quickly and the price was excellent . They were a birthday gift and he loves them .
 The jeans were pre washed and fit just like I wanted . They were really softer than I expected . I would buy this product again .
 I was so happy with the quality and fit ; I ordered 3 more pairs ! I will be good on jeans for awhile . The price was good too .
 Great quality and a lower price , for me is like a tailored jean , I 'm happy with this product . No more to say thanks to all
 After numerous failed attempts at the 527 's on amazon I finally got a clue and got these jeans . They are PERFECT ... great fit ... weight ... etc. ... just like the jeans I wore in high school 20 years ago ... . I 'm already thinking about a second pair . The light rancher is the perfect color ... . As for the 527 's MADE IN BANGLADESH ... amazing they could ever bear the levis name ... perhaps they were counterfeit . Thanks amazon for my true and needed exchange . The original pair of jeans I ordered ... yes the 527 ... was complete trash . These 517 's are real jeans for real cowboys ... and I 'm not one ... but I do wear a ton of boots ...
 Exellent product
 Levis 517 Boot Cut Jeans are just as advertized . Good fit and a perfect boot cut . I highly recommend them for anyone who needs boot cut jeans .
 It 's a very good pant for my husband . Nothing too special or fancy ; he is very satisfied because he got what he expected
 execelente producto muy buena calidad , el pantalon vino en un excelente empaque y llego super rapido deverdad no tengo quejas lo recomiendo
 He looks hot in them , thanks ! What more can I say ? They did n't stay on for very long ... ca n't share any more details .
 I was somewhat hesitant to order Levi 's online but I could n't be happier with this order ! The jeans are exactly as described and fit perfectly . They are genuine Levi 's and are of the highest quality - not seconds . I ca n't recommend this seller highly enough .
 They 're good sellers and the product is very good , I like so much this jean . Ellos son muy buenos vendedores , el producto llego rapido a mis manos y era el esperado , los recomiendo ampliamente .
 I wear Levi jeans every day . Levi 's are the only jeans I will wear.I have worn Levi jeans for the past twenty -LRB- 20 -RRB- years ... or longer.Levi jeans are great ... in fact , i 'm wearin 'em right now ...
 The jeans were a Christmas gift and a style regularly worn by the recipient . They were a perfect fit . They are hard to find locally so we ordered from the Internet . The red tag on the back pocket did not say `` Levis '' and I have never seen this before . Is it significant ?
 Wow . These are great blue jeans , and they come in 38 long which is what he wears . HE wanted the boot cut , and a 34 waist was large enough . Usually he wears a 36 , , but I ordered 34 and they fit just right . Great looking , great price .
 I bought two pairs in two orders - both were perfect - exactly as I expected . On time . Good buy at a decent price .
 These jeans are tough but good looking and fit well . Amazon 's price is great , they are a good value for the money , and we always get prompt delivery and easy return if size is not right .
 the product is excellente , but needs to be taggedcorrectly , I order 34x30 tag say so , but real size was36x32 try buying them from differet source , and same thing never can get athe right size until i took a mesuring tape to the store and mesure before buing them !!
 I love those Jeans . . nice shape and denim . I ordered different colors from this pant and I love them all . it is comfortable , and have a nice leg openning that falls around the boot .
 I have been wearing 517 's for as long as I can remember . They fit perfectly and have remained unchanged for years .
 These boot cut jeans by my favorite jeans maker are exactly what I needed.When I ordered my Harley Davidson boots , I needed pants for when I wear them and these ones are the only ones that fit on the outside where others ca n't . Shopping local yields nothing like these , just junk not worth the money.Quality is what I 've come to expect from Levi 's , outstanding with fit absolutely perfect.More orders coming soon for these.Shipping was prompt , making this buyer very happy.Thank you to everyone for helping this lonely guy that hardly can get out to shop by bringing them to me.Again , THANK YOU VERY MUCH !!
 I thought these were more on the casual side , but after putting them on , they can pull off a nice look . Very comfy , one day to break in . No frays , quality zipper . Dimensions were perfect . Overall color is a shade or two darker than in the picture . Awesome , new favorite pair .
 I love these jeans . For me they are perfect . Long enough to wear with or without boots and the fit is not too tight . How can you go wrong with Levi 's ?
 I got what I ordered promptly . I wish I had ordered a different color but -- my bad . No complaints . What else can I say ?
 The jeans was just perfect , the material , size and colour , nothing to complain about , and great timing too.They fit really well , and amazon 's size chart was very helpfull .
 Style & size stayed true since the last time I bought a pair , after gettingLevi 's Men 's 527 Low Rise Boot Cut Jeanthat are nothing like they used to be that 's all a shopper can ask .
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut . Black 42 waist / 30 length . If you are short , stocky and have a big butt . These pants are perfect . They wo n't bunch up at your fat knees and they will last a long time before the zipper explodes . I suggest you buy the next size up because they will shrink after 6 months of washing , drying and severe stretching in the seat area . Great pants .
 MY FAVORITE JEANS FOR 25 YEARS . I HAVE WORN MAINLY 501 MODEL , SO I READ MANY REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING THESE 517 JEANS.AFTER THINKING FOR A LONG TIME I DECIDED TO BUY ONE SIZE BIGGER THAN USUAL . IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE.THEY ARE JUST FINE , BLACK COLOR AND ZIPPER FLY WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DETAIL FOR ME !
 My husband 's body type includes slight pot belly and skinny hips and thighs . Almost impossible to find pants that fit well without being either too tight in the belly or looking baggy in the seat and thighs . He used to wear Levi 's Action Jeans which were boot cut jeans with slight stretch in fabric and a slight crease in the legs . These jeans always looked and fit great ; real snappy . Unfortunately they 're no longer available . Then went to wearing David Taylor Flexjeans from Sears which were almost as good . However , he now find that although Sears still sells jeans by this name , they are no longer the same . They are now made in China and are made from a crappy fabric and no longer fit the same . In desperation , he started looking thru available Levis products and found Levi 's 517 . Advertised as slim in seat and thighs . He did not expect much but was pleasantly surprised to find that they are indeed somewhat slim in the seat and thighs , even though the pants he bought had a waist size slightly larger than minimally necessary , thankfully allowing him to breathe . Bottom line was that he was very happy that these pants are not so tight in the waist that its hard to breathe , but still slim enough in the seat and thighs that they do n't look like old man 's jeans . Just wish they had the snappy look of the old Levi 's Action Jeans .
 I bought a pair of these in 29X34 and they are great . Fit perfect , really like the cut , lighter weight material but not too light , should hold up well . Just wish they would reduce the size of the internal tag -- I 've actually had to tuck it back into the pants a few times after putting them on !
 I 've always wanted a ` black 527 ' but found out I could only get that in rigid black.I decided to try 517 n whao I might just decide to continue with 517 even with other colors.Just the perfect fit I love .
 Is exactly what i was looking for . . i being using this model for years , and this pair of pant are excellent
 I am a creature of habit . Being of slim build I have found the 517 Boot cut to be the perfect jean for me . I also know my size so the fit was great as received . This is not always the case when ordering over the Internet . Service was great delivered on time as expected .
 These are the best jeans Levis has to offer in my opinion . They are not light and flimsy like some jeans Levis are making these days . The medium stonewash is a great even color . They do n't look faded on the seat and thighs or dingly and dirty like so many jeans do . These jeans are rugged , comfortable and last a long , long time . On top of that they look great . These are the only jeans I will buy .
 These jeans are everything they say they are . We will definately order these jeans again when the time comes . Thanks !
 100 % recomended , i have no doubt that i am going to buy another , it is really regular fit and boot cut
 This is the only jean my husband wears . He has the hardest time finding 36x29 . This is a perfect fit for him . When he needs more I will return to amazon .
 I finally found a pear of jeans that my wife said they look good on me and after being washed still fits great
 Great fit for my long legs ! Hard to find jeans my size but Levi 's always comes through for me ! a
 My order arrived in a timely fashion , they fit good and look great ... I 'm gon na get a couple more pairs .
 Levi 's 517 ` sThese Levi 's were the perfect fit . I like the fact that they are pre rinsed , which makes the fabric softer .
 Many of us do n't want to wear our Levi 's half way up our bellies . 517s are the best answer for that !
 A well tried and true blue jean that I 've been wearing for decades . The fit , finish , and quality is a good as or better than ever .
 These seemed a bit darker in person than pictured but they were a great pair of jeans for my husband . This is his favorite style of jeans and he needed a new pair of &#34; dressy jeans . &#34; Same great jeans as in the past .
 All the Levi 's I purchased for my 16 year old son were ` made to fit ' ! From the straight to boot cut , they all were a perfect fit for his personal taste . They are well made and very stylish .
 Great jeans , great price , speedy delivery as promised ! Will definitely be ordering them again since my son is so tall and slim and this is one of the only places I can find his size .
 Great basic jeans in hard to find sizes . Not much to say otherwise . They have washed up well and held up well for my long and lanky teen .
 Jeans are a little tight in the thighs for my husband . It did n't come with packing slip so I 'm hoping I can return them !
 i traveled 80 miles one day looking for the jeans i like with no luck , it did make for a nice bike ride though ! then i went online looking and i found what i was looking for at amozon these jeans are hard to get in my hometown!Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut JeansWhat a nice pair of rugged jeans . And I got them so FAST !! Thanks again.Roxann Hill
 Good product , on time and as shown in Amazon.But ... years ago , ordering the same # jean and the same size always brought the exact same fit and look . Lately , the same length , for instance , some times is a bit too long -LRB- can be fixed -RRB- or a bit too short -LRB- bad news -RRB- . The price to be paid for savings by manufacturing offshore . Lets see if with the crisis we return to the memorable `` MADE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ''
 What can I say ? They are Levis . Perfect fit , excellent quality , and the most impressive thing was the price . Unbelievable !
 a la medida , tabla de medidas excelente ...
 The only problem was I had was that I had to have them hemmed 2 &#34; so as not to walk on the cuff . I would have ordered them shorter but they were not offered in the waist size I needed . The waist fit perfect and having them hemmed was not that big of a deal . It coast me $ 12.00 to have them hemmed .
 These jeans come washed so they are soft , supple and ready to wear . They are pre-shrunk so order the size you wear . I choose boot-cut jeans because I wear 12 '' - shaft western boots . Levies are the only jeans I wear because they fit well , look good , and get better with age .
 These jeans are perfect for the guy who wants to wear boots and not look like a geek or a thug . Just the right combination of loose and fitted .
 This is my first pair of Levi 517 's and I have to say I am very impressed . They sit on my natural waist -LRB- not low-rise like the 527 's -RRB- , and are fitted in the seat and thigh , and then flare out below the knee to fall on the boot . I 'm 6 ' 3 '' 190lbs and have a 36 waist and 34 inseam and it fit perfectly . Hard to find jeans these days that sit on the waist ... I 'm not a fan of the low-rise look or feel , so these jeans were a great find .
 Came to Amazon to order these jeans for my husband since no one ever has his size , 36x36 . I was pleasantly surprised because I did order two of these in different colors , Rancher Light and Rinse , both of which were the perfect colors . Perfect light colored jean and perfect dark colored jean . My husband and I are very hard to fit in jeans and tops so when something works we often get multiples , the problem however is that sometimes we buy the exact same thing in a different color and they fit totally different . Not these ! These jeans were great and the same fit ! Some people might not be able to appreciate that as much as I , but I was very grateful . It was a risk I had to take since his size is so common , but with free returns I had to take advantage . The boot leg is also very subtle but incredibly flattering . He does wear boots but of course they are n't necessary . I would say they are very true to size and great quality . They are currently his `` good jeans '' ... . that is until he `` accidentally '' wears them to go work in the garage . But when that happens , because it will , I will be back to purchase more ! By the way he is just over 6 ' 3 '' about 230-240lbs .
 Fit well at the waist and look good . Last a lot longer than most most jeans and seem to get more and more comfortable the more you wear them .
 These are great jeans , they do tend to run a little big , both on length and waist . The color was a lot more bluer then it looks in the picture , so be weary of that it . It was too country , and I needed more rock and roll , if you know what I mean.Pros
 I was a bit concerned about this purchase . My husband likes the boot cut style and that was an excellent choice for my purchase . I have zero compliants other then I wish I 'd bought more !
 they were exactly what we were looking for . the orginal 517 , these are my hubby 's most favoritie , they also hold up better than the other styles seem to
 Will have to wash several times for them to fit . I buy this size all the time from other retailers and they are n't this big . Like the color and the style . They just run big I guess . Mainly in the length . Would buy again , just a smaller size .
 The fit is nice , the color is holding up through the wash . I am glad they have different sizes then the stores . Very hard to find 33 x 36 !
 I like the way these jeans fit.The are also comfortable.The ones I have purchased previously have been durable .
 d e m a r a v i l l a e s t e m o d e l o muy bueno
 My body was made for Levi 's brand jeans , and I 'd worn through a couple of pairs . I bought duplicate black 517s - soft but not washed out , dark , with a predictable fit . They are my new favorites . The process went smoothly . Who knew I 'd be buying clothes online ?
 I ordered these for Christmas for my 6 ' 2 '' grandson who had grown out of all his pants after checking stores and finding his size is almost impossible to find . They were perfect and he loved them .
 The Levi 's 517 Boot Cut were purchused as a replacement of the wrong ones bought at a local store , These ordered & delivered ; I was told fit greatly before & after ; washThe price for my buying , totaled out a nuff less even with shipping to come fromamazon , rather than a store , even on sale after my tax & shipping ; -LRB- as a late gift -RRB- Theonly guestion I got was about , they did not have the Levi 's cardboard shelf tagswe see on Jean 's in store .
 I love my levis . I was unaware they came in black . I bought a blue pair and black pair , Ilove them
 Just as described ! Fit & look exactly what he needed and wanted . And he said I could n't find this product ... LOLThanks !!! The Wife wrote the review ...
 These jeans fit great . The boot cut gives a good look without being sloppy . My husband looks hot in them .
 Got these as a gift for my brother , and they are the true blue classic with a great slim shape . Perfect `` date night '' jeans .
 These are the only jeans my husband will wear and we could not find them ANYWHERE . When i found them here i was happily suprised with the discount price and they look great . Would buy again from this seller .
 Excellent transaction on hard to find size and style Levi Jeans.Reasonable price and quick shipping.I 'm very pleased with this purchase !
 jeans were shipped quick , arrived in good shape the medium stonewash has that worn look most people want , I am pleased with the purchase .
 Sent me what I wanted . 15 more 12 more 11 more 9 more 7 more 5 more 3 more done
 This is a very good price for this product , it 's the second one I 've ordered for my son .
 If you have a problem with jeans bagging in the rear , then these jeans are for you ! They are a great fit and very comfortable ! My husband loves them !
 Well , its a good jean , everybody know the levi 's quality , the item arive in perfect conditions . . so nothing more to say . .
 Perfect fit , every time . 517 's are difficult for me to find locally , but buying on line thru Amazon is best for me .
 These are like they used to make them ! More belt loops , great fabric - love them ! Ca n't wait to order more of these !
 I was having a really hard time finding the boot cut Levis - no one seems to carry them anymore . These are just what I wanted . They look and fit good .
 Bought these for my husband and they fit true to size , maybe a little bit long but not so much that he wo n't wear them . He love them , they look good so I love them ! Great Pants !
 I ordered these jeans for my 16yo son & he really liked them . The only thing he would have preferred was a lower rise , but he 's wearing them without complaints . : -RRB-
 I bought 2 of these and man they are nice . I 'll admit the guy wearing the jean in the picture sold me . Like I went and look for all the style of Levi 's , and these attracted me the most . Although I would n't tuck in my shirt like that . But they sure look good with some chucks and or casual boots and a dress shirt , with a silver wrist watch , and a pair of shades . They are heavy , and for me kinda tight even though jean of a different brand and style with the same size , fit me perfectly . I do n't know I guess it the way they are made . But for the look , I 'll take the pain any day , yes these jean are so tight mostly in my thigh area and waist , that I do get a little discomfort pain in my lower back . I guess it the way they are design and the heaviness of the jean . Of course I am in the process of getting in shape again . So with time , these will be perfect . I do like to sag a little , but as of right now I ca n't with these . Until I lose some of that belly fat I accumulated over the years .
 These are the jeans I always buy , they are a great comfortable fit . It is also great that Amazon stocks the size I need , it 's impossible to get from the shops .
 his pants in overall line is still very good , sturdy , feels soft to the touch on the skin , the profile legendary cutting adds a touch of elegance , and even after several washings the fabric remains the same and does not shrink , the only thing I did not like the pants is that they have deteriorated the quality of the clips and metal buttons , formerly of copper and bronze , and now this are of aluminum and does not look good , however I recommend buying them are very good at the price .
 These came a little long , maybe an inch or two . Seeing as many others have noticed this is a problem with this fit , I suggest going one inseam size lower . I ordered a 30 '' and they fit more like a 31-32 '' . Other than the sizing , they are great jeans , and still look great on me . The boot cut allows the extra length to bunch up a little around the shoes , so you do n't really notice it . It actually looks good.I wish they sold these in a low rise version , as I do n't like hiking them up to where you might put dress pants or khakis . They stopped selling the 517 in a low rise though , so I 'm happy to wear them as is , great fit .
 I have always appreciated the fit and quality of Levi jeans . The boot cut has a closer fit around the knee with comfortable room in the hips and waist . What Levi Strauss needs to understand is that there is a huge population of men out there that has a 31 inch inseam . Men between 5 ' 9 &#34; and 6 ' fall into this size range . My growth did not stop at 30 &#34; inseam , and did not make it to 32 &#34; . So I either buy high water jeans that show my socks , or I let the cuffs drag the floor which signicantly reduces the life of the jeans . I liked the fit enough that I spent an additional $ 10 to get them hemmed to 31 .
 product arrived as expected on time , the product was as expected and the quality was as you 'd expect to find in a brick & mortar store .
 Great fitting . I usually buy the 527 style but they did n't have black in that style . Ordered a 517 instead and love the fitting .
 The fit and look are great and I saved a few dollars . Will purchase more when the price is right
 love this jeans , the fabric is really good and the cut is impecable . it is original and the communication was really easy , i recieved really fast .
 These are the first jeans in a while that actually fit my waist size , inseam and the leg openings are perfect .
 These jeans fit well but the denim seems less hefty than the denim of the same 517s from 5 years ago .
 I received my pants very quickly . I was concerned that my size would be too short for boots . I was pleasantly surprised that the designer was thoughtful about the shape and length for this item &#34; after &#34; several washings . Pants are about 1/2 inch longer than the average pants which make them perfect for cowboy boots . Pants are also very comfortable . JCD
 Noticed that they even have an extra pair of belt loops compared to my previous order . They are sturdy & dependable .
 The jeans were great ! The price was right , they were delivered in a timely fashion , and I lost a few lbs to get in them and I look good . lol . I recommend this company .
 These are the only jeans my son likes . He is tall and I have trouble finding his size in local stores and I could not find a better price .
 The jean came very quickly . They were the proper color , size , and cut . The packaging was excellent , and so was the quality of the jeans .
 Perfect price and fit for my husband . I would recommend this jean to any &#34; baby boomer &#34; who loves boot cut jeans.The jean has not changed at all good quality material and the right color . Thank you .
 This pair of Levi 's fits perfectly and the indigo color is the same as the Levi 's I wore back in the day !
 I gave these Jeans to my daughter 's friend for Christmas and he really likes them.He is real thin and wears motorcycle boots.He likes how they fit and loves the boot cut.He especially likes the rugged material .
 Nice one . . Boot Cut with nice fit.Ordered the Jeans with 29L but got it 3inch longer . So I had to do alteration , usually I order my pants with 29L and it fits perfect on me .
 Levis 517 's fit me better than any other jeans that I 've bought . Gon na stick with them . I wear a 38 waist , 36 inseam . Have bought several pair over the past six months from various places and they all fit the same . Good quality control !
 BASTANTE BIEN . BUENA CALIDAD DEL PANTALON . ME QUEDO MUY BIEN . TANTO EL LARGO COMO EN CINTURA . EXCELENTE COMPRA A UDS . GRACIAS .
 The jeans are a good deep color . Wish they were n't quite as thin as jean material seems to be getting , but seems they are all like that now . Overall a good pair of jeans.These are hard to find in 36x36 , so I 'm glad Amazon carries them .
 Perfect fit right out of the box . Started wearing immediately , stitches , pockets , zipper perfectly in place . Survived several washes good as new .
 Good price , perfect quality . Very good model for young and old-aged people . Gorgeous color . Classic zipper . I 'm satisfied ! I recommend to buy it .
 These jeans fit me very well and look good . One thing I noticed however is that the denim has a more coarse feeling compared to other Levi 's jeans . I would buy these again .
 IL TELL YOU I HAVE BEEN WEARING LEVI 'S FOR YEARS ON END AND THE BEST DEAL I GOT ON THESE GREAT JEANS WAS FROM MY FAVORITE STORE AMAZON
 I ordered these jeans an exrta size longer becaause I wanted a high cuff . Got exactally that . Perfect !!! Now I 'm looking for a white pair
 Well , they 're Levi 's . There you go . Best jeans on the market . Last forever and fit great . The black does fade to gray quicker than I would like , but that 's probably because I wear only black , all the time . So ...
 I have worn Levi jenas for the last 16years , i am relatively tall guy and seldom get my size in the store , Amazon provides me my size and then quality as well .
 Purchased two pairs of Levi 's Boot Cut Jeans for my husband , the Jeans are very hard to find in the stores . Since my husband is tall , it is hard to find 36x36 .
 These pants are very well put together and I am a big fan of Levi 's pants durability which is what prompted me to purchase these .
 I am a woman but men 's jeans fit me better . These are very comfortable . My jeans do NOT get hung up on my boots as they do with jeans that are not boot cut .

 Quality jeans , but not made in the USA.Arrived quickly and each pair were individually bagged in plastic.Good fit , for me .
 I like this style and they are getting very hard to find . The price here was the best I found , got in a timely manner . I 'm happy with my purchase .
 Purchased these jeans for my husband . They have a nice fit and look very good on . No baggy butt like the relaxed fit jeans .
 I usually have a hard time finding good bootcut jeans with the right fit in the retail stores . If the color/wash/fabric is right , the size isnt . If the size is right , the fit is too loose at the seat and thighs . Now that my favorite pair of jeans is past its prime , I started looking for a new pair to replace it . After hunting all stores in and around my area and trying all available bootcuts in my size , I was very disappointed . That is , until I found a pair of Levi 's 517 Blue Ox in the local Macy 's store . This was the first bootcut I found in the last 3 years that fit me perfectly . Since I already had a pair of jeans that was of a very similar color , I came online and started looking for the correct color in that fit . Unfortunately , it wasnt that easy finding one online . Kohls , Dillards and others had Levi 's 517s , but they werent the same ones I saw in the store . Apart from Macys and Amazon , no other site -LRB- including Levi 's own site -RRB- had the same fit in Rancher Light color I was looking for . I could have ordered at Macys website , but my past experience with Amazon was stellar and so it my first choice . Even then I was a little skeptical if the photos were close to how the jeans looked in reality . Since amazon had a free returns on this one , I went ahead with the order . The product , as always with Amazon , came 6 days ahead of their estimated delivery date . The jeans is , in fact , very close to the pictures on the website and the fit is PERFECT !! Thanks to Levi 's for the perfect color and fit and KUDOS to amazon for the perfect shopping experience !
 Finally Levi went back to 7 belt loops instead of the five . Makes a big difference for those of us that work for a living .
 I bought the 517 as I prefer this cut to any other one of the Levi 's catalog , I place it even above the so famous 501 . I 'm fully satisfied
 I love these jeans . The wash and fit are great . That being said , they did arrive with a hole in the seat and the seam is a little crooked on the inside left leg . I really do n't care though because they fit so good .
 It is hard to find male , black , slim fit , boot cut jeans . Believe me I searched many places both on-line and local retail outlets . Finally I found these on Amazon and they were just right . Great fit , looks good , and the price was reasonable . I highly recommend them .
 We will take these to alterations but they were about 5 inches too long . Otherwise they are very nice .
 True to size , did n't shrink , and minimal wrinkling . Love the variety of sizing - son is tall and thin , and hard to fit , but Levis 517 made it happen !
 I had some compression shirts from about 5 years ago . These new ones are not the same fabric quality as they used to be , fabric is lighter and less stretchy . Despite they fit perfectly and work fine , I 'm worried about the durabilty of the shirt .
 These T shirts are the best around , I 'm serious , they are very strong and very soft . A couple friends of mine work in the silkscreening business and told me that the `` Hanes Beefy T '' was THE best out there , so I ordered 6 of them on their advice . I 've never seen T shirts this nice , they are the most comfortable , strongest , and they feel like they will last forever . I 'm so happy with these shirts , they are awesome .
 It 's a bit hard to tell from the picture posted here - but this mask is a half mask . You can just see the edges on the cheeks . The top teeth hang over your upper lip . In the night , with the right coordinating makeup , this mask disappears in to your own skin -LRB- as long as you 're Caucasian , LOL ! -RRB- and is very effective and frightening . I pair it with a tall white wig and a vampire costume , and it freaks people out . One note - this mask has fake rings through the `` nose '' and `` eyebrow '' . That 's a little weird for a vampire , so I just carefully snipped them off and it did n't look bad at all . This mask is quite a bit more comfortable on a warm night , precisely because it is a half mask . If it 's REALLY hot on Oct 31 though , put a few pads of cotton balls between the mask and your face skin . It really helps !
 I was thinking it of using it for my tennis . Unfortunately there was no clue saying it dint have pockets . Anyways its a good shorts for great price .
 If you go to the gym or play ball a lot and need a couple pair of shorts so you do n't need to do laundry every other day , these athletic shorts are perfect . They 're thin but durable . I got them on sale for like $ 10 so they do the trick . Do n't get me wrong its not like you 'll look like a dork at the gym , but if you 're looking for something super flashy , then these are n't them .
 Nice shorts that match almost everything . My boyfriend loves to wear them around the house . Great pair of shorts for an extremely great price ! So buy a couple pairs just to have around !
 no pockets , but yann will wear them all summer.yeehaw .
 My son likes these to sleep and wear under pants in winter . They are perfect , washing easily , and retaining their size and color .
 I like the shorts . The price is excellent . The shorts were a little thinner than I imagined . But I am very satisfied with the purchase .
 I have the scrimmage dazzle too they re thin but durable and for 10.00 cool ! no pockets ok for me , lightweight shortsexcellent and Roomy my favorites great price buying of couple more
 My boyfriend says that these are his favorite shorts . Nice and roomy with some breathing room .
 Yes its cheap but not crappy . Its a good deal ! the Receiver loved it ! Its a steal ! How can you go wrong !
 Two of us were ushers at our church on Christmas Eve and we wanted to look spiffy . These bowties were just perfect . Nice red color , just the right size , easy to put on and adjust .
 We do many performances during a years time , and change color of our members bowties , cummerbunds , and sash 's 3 to 4 times a year . This year , we were caught off guard and had no red bow ties . I found these on Amazon , ordered them , and they came quickly and in plenty of time for our performances . The ties seem to be well made and a whole lot less thanwhat we had been paying for them in the past . I wish I had ordered the clip on 's instead of the strap type , but these workedjust as well . Just required a little adjusting of each others collar . Very good value for the price , and I will be looking atthis site again for our other colored ties that we use .
 This bowtie was easy to tie -LRB- I would n't be able to tie one from scratch -RRB- , it looks good . I 'm associated with a jazz ensemble big band , I wore it to the Xmas concerts this year , and everyone loved it , I got several comments on it in public as well .
 -LSB- ... -RSB- Boom!A bowtie under $ 6 going so well with a $ 300 blazer ? Can you ask for more ? Well yes ... MORE COLORS !!!
 I got it for a gift for a Pee Wee Herman costume so I did n't actually wear it , but it looked like a tie that would be great for a holiday formal event . It is the same as a tie you would get at a tuxedo place for a wedding .
 Got it quickly . Good basic value . Fourteen more words are required for this to be a valid review . Two more .
 This bow tie is so awesome it makes me want to dance the Charleston 24/7 . What else can I say ?
 The Solid-Mens-Red Tuxedo-Bow Tie is a quality product at a very low price . The Bow is pre-tied with a strap and has a clip in the front so that it 's very easy to fasten . It adds a festive touch to your Holiday or Theme parties : - -RRB-
 Bowtie was nice ... was purchased for a costume , but was of good quality even to wear with a suit . The color is a perfect red .
 This was for a costume and worked well . Not the best quality but serviceable - exactly what I expected for the price .
 scrambling to finish son 's Dr. Who costume . This was -LSB- more or less -RSB- the right color , came quickly , decent quality and adjustable enough that it fit his 13 yr old neck .
 My 12 year old son -LRB- who is on the small size for 12 -RRB- wanted a bowtie . I was n't sure about this but I figured for the price it was worth a try . I was pleased at how adjustable it was so that he could put it on the smallest setting and it fit him - so if you are considering it for a kid -LRB- not a really young kid -RRB- it is adjustable .
 I bought this bow tie for my husband to wear as Moe from the 3 Stooges , for Halloween . He has even worn it to work a few times ... whatta hipster !
 Love the bow tie . It 's a great great way of tying up my Mary Poppins costume . Thanks for the quick shopping too !
 While the order didnt arrive until a few days after i needed it it seems to be a very nice bow tie . Ill find a way to wear it another time for sure .
 This is NOT a bowtie you 'd want to purchase for a formal engagement , or if you 're looking for a very hardcore cosplay bowtie . The bowtie is made of a sturdy material that seems like it will hold for several years , is adjustable for just about any neck size short of a muscle man , and just plain looks good in a cosplay environment .
 I bought this bowtie for my sons Halloween costume as the eleventh doctor . it is sized for a child and fits a 4-7 y/o well . no problems at all.pro 's : Bowtie 's are coolcon 's : none
 I recieved this a few days ago , much earlier than the estimated date was!It 's nice quality , no rips or tears , loose strings . It 's a nice bright red too and just very nice quality for such a low price.Very happy -LRB- :
 this is an awesome bowtie , great color great quality great size and great value , what 's more , it is only a few bucks !!! it is just amazing !
 Everyone loved this bow . It 's not even a cheap bow . I use it for a dress shirt and it goes really swell . It was worth the buy .
 I purchased this red bow tie for a Pee Wee Herman costume . I was a hit at the 80 's theme party I was hosting . Very comfortable to wear and quality material .
 This bowtie is exactly what we wanted - it 's on the smallish side for an adult , but perfect for my son 's costume . It arrived very quickly in perfect condition .
 The tie was wonderful . Great price and quality , very nice looking . Looks much more expensive than it is . Great deal !
 My younger sister recently became obsessed with Doctor Who and as a result of the eleventh doctor decrying them as `` cool '' , she gained a nearly insatiable thirst for bow ties . As she was graduating high school I decided I would treat her to a bow tie of her choice and she decided that she most wanted a red one.I am most pleased with this bow tie . The color is beautiful and cheery and consistent . The Doctor would love it and my sister is happy .
 This is an epic bowtie . I wear it every day -LRB- without a proper suit -RRB- and i love it . I highly suggest buying it because it is epic . I am wearing it right now as i type this .
 where do I start ? oh yeah ... bowties are cool ! this one is for sure a winner , great for a dance , wedding , or traveling across the universe .
 This is for a Doctor Who costume . Very pleased with the quality ; it 's quite nice . Shipped very quickly . The sizing seems like it would fit just about any neck size .
 My daughter was a dr. who character for halloween and we bought this b/c it was the cheapest one we could find on ebay that was red . It 's actually really good quality and she looked adorable .
 This bow tie was perfect for my New Year 's Eve costume . Some reviews mentioned that the size was small , but I found it comparable to my everyday bowties . Ca n't beat this for the price . The quality was great , as both sides were even and the material was not snagged or marred .
 I bought this for a costume for a Christmas party and everyone loved it . I get compliments every time I wear it . People can not tell the difference between this and a real bow tie .
 Perfect price and perfect color , adjusts really easily , not to big but not to small . great product ! I would def . recommend .
 I order my red bow tie from at 4pm and got it the next day with prime shipping . The item is of excellent quality and worked well for the dance performance I used it for . I also purchase arm guarders that matched perfectly .
 I was a little hesitant about purchasing this bowtie due to the low price . I suspected that the quality may not meet my standards and since this was for a graduation , I was really worried . When the bowtie arrived , I was pleasantly surprised ! The bowtie was exactly what the graduate wanted and he was very happy . Great buy and comes highly recommended !
 The shipping was right on time . Love the little shimmer the bow ties have . They are not matte and boring . The adjustable band helps a lot !!
 My boys wear bowties/matching hats so having a variety of ties is a must & finding them at a decent price is great -LRB- who knows how long the bowtie fad will last -RRB- . The quality is good and the red was a `` true '' red so it matches most hats .
 The bow tie was received in very good condidtion . Color is great and looks professional . My son is training to become an actor so he had to have the right , red bow tie .
 This red bow tie was just what we were looking for to complete a graduation outfit . The red color was a perfect match to his graduation gown .
 I love this bow tie ! It 's not as shiny as it looks in the picture , but it 's still nice ! Seems like it 's very study material !
 The color is a nice red but not quite my version of a Christmas Red ... that may be subject to opinion of course . None the less the bowties worked great for our barbershop quartet , singing in a Christmas event . They arrived on time and well packaged . Only complaint I had was the hook , which was fairly close to the front so it was visible when you wore it , and not covered with a little cloth tab , like my regular tuxedo tie .
 My boyfriend wore this for a holiday party and it was a good buy . It was easily adjustable and worked out very nicely .
 These T shirts are the best around , I 'm serious , they are very strong and very soft . A couple friends of mine work in the silkscreening business and told me that the `` Hanes Beefy T '' was THE best out there , so I ordered 6 of them on their advice . I 've never seen T shirts this nice , they are the most comfortable , strongest , and they feel like they will last forever . I 'm so happy with these shirts , they are awesome .
 These are great t-shirts and my boys love them . They are active in sports and there is nothing better than having these shirts to wear . They take the wear and tear and come back for more ! I highly recommend them !
 I am happy with the jeans and how they fit , but usually when I get 517 's , they are really stiff and then I get to break them in . This pair was already like pre-washed , just differnt than what I am used to , but I still like them and will wear them . Maybe I have to look into differnt types and find exactly what I am looking for next time . Thank you
 I 've been wearing 517 's for a good , long time now , and I love 'em ! The problem is that most of my local stores that sell them -- and very few of them do -- price them highly and also drastically limit the selection compared to the more popular 501 's and 550 's . Additionally , these jeans are often skipped over when it comes to the big sales . Well , shopping for them on Amazon is a decision I should have made long ago . The price here is hard to beat.As for the jeans themselves , they are of the rugged quality that Levi 's is known for . They fit like the product photo shows
 Have had these jeans for a few weeks now & am very satisfied.The flair from the knee down is discrete and does not look like the 70 's bell-bottoms . The fit on top was precisely as marked . The length seems about 1/2 inch longer than sized on the 501 's . Was formerly utilizing 501 slim fit jeans but found that could not place them over motorcyle boots . The 501s were great for rainy rides , but look too much like a cowboy , when tucked into the boots .
 As always , good shopping at amazon.com . Its always a problem finding the right length jeans for me . I found that in this levi 517 Boot cut jean , it feels good to finally find a jean that is not too short . A fact that i would have loved to know before i bought this jeans , is the leg opening size . This jean is very tight around the thigh area . I would just like a bit more details on the product a next time round . Other than that , it always a good shopping experience on Amazon .
 The length and waist were perfect . The quality of Levi jeans was the same as they had always been , good
 I always had to keep pulling up my previous pairs of Levi 's -LRB- any model -RRB- because they only had FIVE belt loops . A key ring and cell phone are not that heavy . I remember growing up with Levi 's having SEVEN belt loops and a heavier canvas . I was pleasantly surprised to see the ` new ' Levi 's 517 now have seven belt loops again . I started to buy a different model , but they still only have the five loops.I just bought a couple of these pairs from Amazon . I did check online at Kohls and their current batch of 517 's still show 5 loops . I will have to wait until I go to the store to see if their stock has been updated . Kohls prices are higher than Amazon , but I will recheck when they go on sale . I still check Amazon first for almost all my purchases.Overall , I like my new Levi 's jeans . I will compare them with older ones to see if the canvas really is slightly thinner . Outsourcing manufacturing almost always results in poorer quality and non-standard sizing . It has 100 % results in putting Americans out of work . I try to buy American whenever I can -- hopefully it will catch on.There is another issue appearing after I washed my new jeans with my old ones . It should n't have made a difference , but the new ones are now covered with fine fluffy hairs . I will have to use a lint brush when I take them out of the dryer for now . Although it may just be a ` break in -- first washings ' issue.Overall , I rate these jeans 4 stars . I will have to wait for a few machine washings to see how the color holds up . I may be old fashioned , but buying jeans looking like they are 1/2 wore out or have holes in them is ` less than optimal ' .
 I ran around town to find my husband Levi 517 's in size 35x32 for Christmas . In the stores , there were stacks of all different sorts of Levi 's to go through . Finally I came home and ordered them through Amazon and received exactly what he wanted . These Levi 's fit perfectly and look great . Very happy they come in off size waists . Thank you for making my job easier and receiving nice fitting jeans .
 I 've grown up wearing Levi 's and in particular 517 's in my adult life . I do like that Levi has added additional belt loops in the past year or so . Over the years Levi has cut some corners in manufacturing , but not enough to discourage me from continuing to buy their stonewashed 517 's . I like the stonewashed jeans since they are ready to wear , unlike the rigid indigo Levi 's that have to be washed several times to soften them up.I am buying more and more items from Amazon for the free shipping and competitive prices . It just saves a lot of time going to a retailer only to find out they do n't have my size or what I want . Even with Amazon collecting California sales tax , I figure the time and gas saved from having to go to a retailer is well worth it .
 These were a secret gift for my brother-in-law . He keeps complaining that he must do laundry every other day because he only has one pair of work pants , but then he just will not go get more or let anyone buy him any ! So , I got the size off of the one pair of jeans he owns -LRB- laundry is at my house -RRB- and I bought several other pairs that were similarly worn . I sneak in a new pair about once a week and so far he has n't noticed that he now has three pair of work pants . When I slip in the new ones , I put them in the dirty clothes hamper he uses . I wonder if he knows his pants are multiplying yet ?
 They arived bfore time , APO adress , in Afghanistan ,1 week took it to arive here , im suprised , and they fit good , i dont hawe no words
 36 &#34; inseam jeans at a reasonable price are hard to find . I really like the fit of these jeans just wish there were other kinds in the same length .
 Just what I expected . After soaking and drying , the fit and feel was as anticipated ... just like the good , old days !!! -LRB- I would estimate that length and waist both shrunk by about one inch ... as Mama warned , some 50 years ago -RRB-
 i got two pairs for my husband . levis are the only thing that fit him right . They make him look like he has a butt !
 I like this product because it fits very well and is comfortable . I recommend it to others . Good for those who like to wear boots .
 Finally found levis that were the correct size , if they are still available I will order more in the future
 Great pants . I wish there was a size 33 by 35 . I always have a hard time with pants size . I can get a length 34 , which shrink after a wash or a 36 that drags because there too long . But there is no length 35 in pants , so I do n't have much of choice .
 The Levi jeans were just like I expected . The fit was perfect and received them in just a few days . Thanks !!
 The quality of the denim is lighter , so the good fit disappears by the end of the day . Otherwise , I like 'em !
 Hubby dearest was so happy to find boot cut Levi jeans at Amazon as it seems most stores have quit carrying this style of jean . He likes to wear boot cut jeans and Levi jeans are his favorite brand.No complaints about the fit or wearability either . Ordered two more pairs of jeans today as he 's a happy camper.Recommend .
 Good deal on the jeans and speedy shipping . My first pair of boot cut jeans . My girl friend really likes them on me . I got the dark blue -LRB- rinse -RRB- . Fit good and comfortable .
 My skinny son is 54 years old and will not wear any other jeans - only 517 , boot cut Levi 's so I know what to buy for Christmas and Birthdays . I found a perfect fit for my skinny husband also .
 I ordered these jeansLevi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jeanfor a Christmas gift a short time before Christmas . I knew the size . I was somewhat concerned that I would not get them on time for Christmas The package came just before Christmas , and the jeans were exactly as pictured , nicely packaged -LRB- each pair separately enclosed in plastic bag -RRB- , the right size and color . I was very pleased , as was the recipient of the gift !
 The jeans were a Christmas gift and a style regularly worn by the recipient . They were a perfect fit . They are hard to find locally so we ordered from the Internet . The red tag on the back pocket did not say `` Levis '' and I have never seen this before . Is it significant ?
 Wow . These are great blue jeans , and they come in 38 long which is what he wears . HE wanted the boot cut , and a 34 waist was large enough . Usually he wears a 36 , , but I ordered 34 and they fit just right . Great looking , great price .
 I bought two pairs in two orders - both were perfect - exactly as I expected . On time . Good buy at a decent price .
 These jeans are tough but good looking and fit well . Amazon 's price is great , they are a good value for the money , and we always get prompt delivery and easy return if size is not right .
 These are great jeans for us gals , too , especially if you like to wear a true black color . I dress them up with a feminine camisole and heels , and have got many compliments on them .
 Exactly what my hubby wants . It 's difficult to find his size in our local stores . Very happy Amazon now has Levi 's in his size .
 I love my new bootcuts . I received them quickly , They fit perfectly . Thank you .
 I 've grown frustrated by the lack of good quality/reasonably priced jeans in the market today . At some point , the Levis brand started to suffer in terms of quality/value for the dollar . Do n't remember exactly when that happened , but I started to buy my jeans from Banana Republic . Over time , they stopped making the style I grew to rely on . This created a 7-10 stretch where I could n't seem to find a good pair of jeans . Most recently , I purchased a pair of Lucky jeans - ridiculously over priced . When those began to fail , I tried Levis again and bought these . For a third of the price of Lucky Jeans , these Levis boot-cut jeans are really nice . They have a really substantial feel/weight to them and I could n't be happier with the purchase . I was so pleased , I ended up buying a second pair .
 Levis 517 Boot Cut Jeans are just as advertized . Good fit and a perfect boot cut . I highly recommend them for anyone who needs boot cut jeans .
 It 's a very good pant for my husband . Nothing too special or fancy ; he is very satisfied because he got what he expected
 execelente producto muy buena calidad , el pantalon vino en un excelente empaque y llego super rapido deverdad no tengo quejas lo recomiendo
 It is great to find the exact size , color , and fit you want in a Levi 's jean , and also get it on time .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean , Medium Stonewash , 38x29They fit perfectly . Will probably order more in a couple months .
 Needed a size that few brick & mortar stores keep in stock . Amazon had style I wanted in the size that I wanted at a good price !
 These blue jeans where a great color and a perfect fit . Glad I ordered them . They were a present for my son
 My husband has been wearing Levi 's since he was a teenager . They are the most durable jeans and he loves the boot cut .
 I 've been wearing these for years.They do tend to fade easily so wash them inside out and use a detergent product for black fabrics .
 I bought these as a gift for a friend who has worn this style for years . Good quality , good fit , good style .
 Great jeans.Classical style.Low price.Wearing only jeans , levis always loved.Happy New Year!Amazon Forever!I love it .
 This hard to find style arrived on time . These classic jeans fit just the way they should . Going back for more colors .
 Finally jeans that fit like the old Levis , these are the old quality heavy denim stuff not that wimpy pre-wash thin as paper junk denim . I would highly recommend these jeans to anyone who 's familiar with real Levis .
 Very easy shopping . I 'm familiar with the pants so it 's just a matter of price and convenience.Sitting at the desk for a few second beats driving to the store , finding out they do n't have the 517 in my size and driving back home . I 've always had trouble just finding the 517 at stores and shopping online sure makes things easier . The pants themselves are everything they 've always been , good fitting and tough.It 's nice to add the stonewash to my collection of darker denim so I do n't look the same every day.I was upprised how fast they came and that 's a big plus too .
 These jeans fit to size perfectly -LRB- for me -RRB- , are comfortable to wear , and have adequate material to reach a guy 's waist ... not hip-huggers . I 'll buy more of these ! Not a deal-breaker by any means but I would prefer them to not have the size label outside ... it seems Levi 's always does this .
 Amazon did not mentioned in the description that this pair of jeans is a Shrink-to-Fit fabric . No question on the quality . . it 's still an amazing jeans , the great Levi 's jeans , never goes out of style ... Take 31 '' waistline x 30 '' inseam if your size is 30 x 30 .
 Levi 's are always the best jeans around . Levi 's Boot Cut are the only kind my husband will wear . Always a good fit .
 Very high quality . Several pairs have consistent fit . Have bought and worn these 517 boot cut jeans for several years .
 My husband LOVES these jeans . They are a GREAT FIT , especially in the seat . The legs are n't too wide in the thighs and the bootcut bottom make a terrific silhouette . I like how he looks in them and he says they are REALLY COMFORTABLE . They look best in the darker color and are a good pair of `` dress jeans '' as well as versatile . We are ordering more . Ladies , get him these jeans !
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Slim Fit Jean is leg looks like so long , . . but lap so tight but leg looks like so long . .
 My husband like it . . although I have to cut the length a little bit . . He said he may buy more in the future . . Hopefully they have shorter length then .
 They are Levis what more needs to be said ? Theyre the only jeans im buying from now on . They fit great and last 2-5 times longer than any other jeans ive bought .
 I use to wear the Levis low boot cut , but they discontinue to sell the color I want . After I give this one a try , I like it so much .
 If you know your size they fit . I do n't understand the reviews that say the sizes are wrong . Will buy again .
 was just what i expected ... very pleased with purchase . I like the fact that you can get 29 inseam . You can not get that in the store . No need to get them hemmed !
 his pants in overall line is still very good , sturdy , feels soft to the touch on the skin , the profile legendary cutting adds a touch of elegance , and even after several washings the fabric remains the same and does not shrink , the only thing I did not like the pants is that they have deteriorated the quality of the clips and metal buttons , formerly of copper and bronze , and now this are of aluminum and does not look good , however I recommend buying them are very good at the price .
 These came a little long , maybe an inch or two . Seeing as many others have noticed this is a problem with this fit , I suggest going one inseam size lower . I ordered a 30 '' and they fit more like a 31-32 '' . Other than the sizing , they are great jeans , and still look great on me . The boot cut allows the extra length to bunch up a little around the shoes , so you do n't really notice it . It actually looks good.I wish they sold these in a low rise version , as I do n't like hiking them up to where you might put dress pants or khakis . They stopped selling the 517 in a low rise though , so I 'm happy to wear them as is , great fit .
 I have always appreciated the fit and quality of Levi jeans . The boot cut has a closer fit around the knee with comfortable room in the hips and waist . What Levi Strauss needs to understand is that there is a huge population of men out there that has a 31 inch inseam . Men between 5 ' 9 &#34; and 6 ' fall into this size range . My growth did not stop at 30 &#34; inseam , and did not make it to 32 &#34; . So I either buy high water jeans that show my socks , or I let the cuffs drag the floor which signicantly reduces the life of the jeans . I liked the fit enough that I spent an additional $ 10 to get them hemmed to 31 .
 I 've worn Levi 's for over 50 years . From the days when you had to roll up the cuffs because they only had one length to super bells in the 70 's and now my favorite 517 's . They are always true to size and the workmanship is always excellent . The service at Amazon is always great too . What more can I say , I am one satisfied customer .
 These boot cut Levis have always been my favorite jeans . I had not had any in a while , so when my order arrived I immediately tried them on . I forgot how well they fit , and they are really stylish . Awesome . Will be ordering more .
 Authentic , just as described . Fast delivery . I am very satisfied with purchase . Smooth , one stop purchase . Husband will be very happy on Christmas day ! Thank you .
 My grandson loves these jeans , since he 's rather tall we were glad to find Levi 's makes great jeans in his size . Strange as it may seem , many brands of jeans do not come in a 34in length .
 As an active equestrian rider , and a woman of 59 years , I 'm ALWAYS looking for comfortable jeans that sit at my waist -- I do n't like women 's jeans at all - the fabric in women 's jeans seems flimsy , and the low-rise , hip-hugging jeans for riding or leisure wear feels uncomfortable . The men 's Levis and men 's Lee jeans are very comfortable , and they can handle my active life -- for me , men 's Levis 517 bootcut jeans have best variety for colors , and toughest quality in fabric .
 Nice one . . Boot Cut with nice fit.Ordered the Jeans with 29L but got it 3inch longer . So I had to do alteration , usually I order my pants with 29L and it fits perfect on me .
 Levis 517 's fit me better than any other jeans that I 've bought . Gon na stick with them . I wear a 38 waist , 36 inseam . Have bought several pair over the past six months from various places and they all fit the same . Good quality control !
 BASTANTE BIEN . BUENA CALIDAD DEL PANTALON . ME QUEDO MUY BIEN . TANTO EL LARGO COMO EN CINTURA . EXCELENTE COMPRA A UDS . GRACIAS .
 The jeans are a good deep color . Wish they were n't quite as thin as jean material seems to be getting , but seems they are all like that now . Overall a good pair of jeans.These are hard to find in 36x36 , so I 'm glad Amazon carries them .
 Great black on black bootcut jeans . They have even gone back to adding two additional belt loops a feature that went away several years ago .
 Fits well , my husband loves them , quality control met , consistent sizing , and look good on . Will order more as needed
 My son wears a 36 Waist x 36 lenght which is very hard to find . The Levi 's Men 's 517 are about the only jeans he likes and these fit him perfectly . They were shipped very quickly and the price was excellent . They were a birthday gift and he loves them .
 The jeans were pre washed and fit just like I wanted . They were really softer than I expected . I would buy this product again .
 I was so happy with the quality and fit ; I ordered 3 more pairs ! I will be good on jeans for awhile . The price was good too .
 Great quality and a lower price , for me is like a tailored jean , I 'm happy with this product . No more to say thanks to all
 After numerous failed attempts at the 527 's on amazon I finally got a clue and got these jeans . They are PERFECT ... great fit ... weight ... etc. ... just like the jeans I wore in high school 20 years ago ... . I 'm already thinking about a second pair . The light rancher is the perfect color ... . As for the 527 's MADE IN BANGLADESH ... amazing they could ever bear the levis name ... perhaps they were counterfeit . Thanks amazon for my true and needed exchange . The original pair of jeans I ordered ... yes the 527 ... was complete trash . These 517 's are real jeans for real cowboys ... and I 'm not one ... but I do wear a ton of boots ...
 Exellent product
 Excellent product the product I come very well and it is what was waiting of , I come in time , good
 I bought they for my boyfriend who had lost a bit of weight and all his pants were falling down , but these fit and stay up -LRB- Thank God -RRB-
 My husband loves the fit and the price.Great deal.You can dress them up or down!Look no further.Great looking jean , for the price .
 Bought these jeans for my husband . They fit very well and look nice . The shipment arrived on time . I was happy with my purchase .
 I ordered these jeans an exrta size longer becaause I wanted a high cuff . Got exactally that . Perfect !!! Now I 'm looking for a white pair
 Well , they 're Levi 's . There you go . Best jeans on the market . Last forever and fit great . The black does fade to gray quicker than I would like , but that 's probably because I wear only black , all the time . So ...
 the product is excellente , but needs to be taggedcorrectly , I order 34x30 tag say so , but real size was36x32 try buying them from differet source , and same thing never can get athe right size until i took a mesuring tape to the store and mesure before buing them !!
 I love those Jeans . . nice shape and denim . I ordered different colors from this pant and I love them all . it is comfortable , and have a nice leg openning that falls around the boot .
 I have been wearing 517 's for as long as I can remember . They fit perfectly and have remained unchanged for years .
 These boot cut jeans by my favorite jeans maker are exactly what I needed.When I ordered my Harley Davidson boots , I needed pants for when I wear them and these ones are the only ones that fit on the outside where others ca n't . Shopping local yields nothing like these , just junk not worth the money.Quality is what I 've come to expect from Levi 's , outstanding with fit absolutely perfect.More orders coming soon for these.Shipping was prompt , making this buyer very happy.Thank you to everyone for helping this lonely guy that hardly can get out to shop by bringing them to me.Again , THANK YOU VERY MUCH !!
 I thought these were more on the casual side , but after putting them on , they can pull off a nice look . Very comfy , one day to break in . No frays , quality zipper . Dimensions were perfect . Overall color is a shade or two darker than in the picture . Awesome , new favorite pair .
 If you have a problem with jeans bagging in the rear , then these jeans are for you ! They are a great fit and very comfortable ! My husband loves them !
 Well , its a good jean , everybody know the levi 's quality , the item arive in perfect conditions . . so nothing more to say . .
 Perfect fit , every time . 517 's are difficult for me to find locally , but buying on line thru Amazon is best for me .
 He looks hot in them , thanks ! What more can I say ? They did n't stay on for very long ... ca n't share any more details .
 I was somewhat hesitant to order Levi 's online but I could n't be happier with this order ! The jeans are exactly as described and fit perfectly . They are genuine Levi 's and are of the highest quality - not seconds . I ca n't recommend this seller highly enough .
 They 're good sellers and the product is very good , I like so much this jean . Ellos son muy buenos vendedores , el producto llego rapido a mis manos y era el esperado , los recomiendo ampliamente .
 I wear Levi jeans every day . Levi 's are the only jeans I will wear.I have worn Levi jeans for the past twenty -LRB- 20 -RRB- years ... or longer.Levi jeans are great ... in fact , i 'm wearin 'em right now ...
 Sent me what I wanted . 15 more 12 more 11 more 9 more 7 more 5 more 3 more done
 This is a very good price for this product , it 's the second one I 've ordered for my son .
 These seemed a bit darker in person than pictured but they were a great pair of jeans for my husband . This is his favorite style of jeans and he needed a new pair of &#34; dressy jeans . &#34; Same great jeans as in the past .
 All the Levi 's I purchased for my 16 year old son were ` made to fit ' ! From the straight to boot cut , they all were a perfect fit for his personal taste . They are well made and very stylish .
 Great jeans , great price , speedy delivery as promised ! Will definitely be ordering them again since my son is so tall and slim and this is one of the only places I can find his size .
 Great basic jeans in hard to find sizes . Not much to say otherwise . They have washed up well and held up well for my long and lanky teen .
 Jeans are a little tight in the thighs for my husband . It did n't come with packing slip so I 'm hoping I can return them !
 Good quality but I wish I had done more research on the colors . Ordered rigid because of the look online however the denim itself is rigid .
 Yes , these Levi 's are everything I had hoped they would be and More . Perfect fit , and I 'm very pleased tofinally have a BLACK pair ! Amazon 's got another winner !
 My wife thinks it 's funny that I rate my jeans with numbers , but , as a former 505 's man , I now prefer the 517 's 'cause ride my horses more and were my boots more ... plus , they just , plain feel good when they 're on me ...
 Who does n't love Levis ? These are great ! My son was happy on Christmas day and so were we . Happy Holidays !
 These jeans are everything they say they are . We will definately order these jeans again when the time comes . Thanks !
 100 % recomended , i have no doubt that i am going to buy another , it is really regular fit and boot cut
 This is the only jean my husband wears . He has the hardest time finding 36x29 . This is a perfect fit for him . When he needs more I will return to amazon .
 I finally found a pear of jeans that my wife said they look good on me and after being washed still fits great
 Great fit for my long legs ! Hard to find jeans my size but Levi 's always comes through for me ! a
 Ordered these for my boyfriend , they run extremely small , he regularly wears a 32/34 had to send back and get a 36/34 . Other than that they 're great jeans .
 Finally a pair of Levi 's not only affordable , but a pair that is the real deal . . not seconds or blemished . . but cut perfectly . . The best I have bought in years . . Thanks . . and `` I 'll be back for more ''
 They fit just perfectly and I am very happy to not only get the bestdeal around but beat the sales tax . Good old Levi 's rigid , bootcut jeans have been my all-time favorite jeans my whole life , andI just turned 60 . Got 'em within a week , free shipping faster thanexpected , so that was cool , too . Amazon rules !
 The pants are great . I can not seem to find them in stores like Kohls or Target where I usually shop . I 'm not skinny as far as a skinny person goes but I have thinner legs than a lot of guys . These seem to be not as loose in the butt and thighs . I usually get the 505 's but they are cut a little bigger assuming tree trunk size legs . I have runners legs and these work . If you have big footballer legs , forget about it .
 Style & size stayed true since the last time I bought a pair , after gettingLevi 's Men 's 527 Low Rise Boot Cut Jeanthat are nothing like they used to be that 's all a shopper can ask .
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut . Black 42 waist / 30 length . If you are short , stocky and have a big butt . These pants are perfect . They wo n't bunch up at your fat knees and they will last a long time before the zipper explodes . I suggest you buy the next size up because they will shrink after 6 months of washing , drying and severe stretching in the seat area . Great pants .
 MY FAVORITE JEANS FOR 25 YEARS . I HAVE WORN MAINLY 501 MODEL , SO I READ MANY REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING THESE 517 JEANS.AFTER THINKING FOR A LONG TIME I DECIDED TO BUY ONE SIZE BIGGER THAN USUAL . IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE.THEY ARE JUST FINE , BLACK COLOR AND ZIPPER FLY WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DETAIL FOR ME !
 My husband 's body type includes slight pot belly and skinny hips and thighs . Almost impossible to find pants that fit well without being either too tight in the belly or looking baggy in the seat and thighs . He used to wear Levi 's Action Jeans which were boot cut jeans with slight stretch in fabric and a slight crease in the legs . These jeans always looked and fit great ; real snappy . Unfortunately they 're no longer available . Then went to wearing David Taylor Flexjeans from Sears which were almost as good . However , he now find that although Sears still sells jeans by this name , they are no longer the same . They are now made in China and are made from a crappy fabric and no longer fit the same . In desperation , he started looking thru available Levis products and found Levi 's 517 . Advertised as slim in seat and thighs . He did not expect much but was pleasantly surprised to find that they are indeed somewhat slim in the seat and thighs , even though the pants he bought had a waist size slightly larger than minimally necessary , thankfully allowing him to breathe . Bottom line was that he was very happy that these pants are not so tight in the waist that its hard to breathe , but still slim enough in the seat and thighs that they do n't look like old man 's jeans . Just wish they had the snappy look of the old Levi 's Action Jeans .
 I bought a pair of these in 29X34 and they are great . Fit perfect , really like the cut , lighter weight material but not too light , should hold up well . Just wish they would reduce the size of the internal tag -- I 've actually had to tuck it back into the pants a few times after putting them on !
 Finally figured out what cut and size I like , but the only place I can find them is the internet . Great pants .
 These were ordered off Amazon when I could not find them locally . I found the pants and they are describer perfectly and fit exactly as I had wanted them to . I will buy more in the future because they were perfect .
 Completamente satisfecha con el producto , exactamente igual a lo que ofrecieron . LLego en el tiempo estimado que prometieron . Ninguna queja , volveria a comprar de nuevo .
 they were exactly what we were looking for . the orginal 517 , these are my hubby 's most favoritie , they also hold up better than the other styles seem to
 Will have to wash several times for them to fit . I buy this size all the time from other retailers and they are n't this big . Like the color and the style . They just run big I guess . Mainly in the length . Would buy again , just a smaller size .
 The fit is nice , the color is holding up through the wash . I am glad they have different sizes then the stores . Very hard to find 33 x 36 !
 I like the way these jeans fit.The are also comfortable.The ones I have purchased previously have been durable .
 d e m a r a v i l l a e s t e m o d e l o muy bueno
 These are the first jeans in a while that actually fit my waist size , inseam and the leg openings are perfect .
 These jeans fit well but the denim seems less hefty than the denim of the same 517s from 5 years ago .
 I received my pants very quickly . I was concerned that my size would be too short for boots . I was pleasantly surprised that the designer was thoughtful about the shape and length for this item &#34; after &#34; several washings . Pants are about 1/2 inch longer than the average pants which make them perfect for cowboy boots . Pants are also very comfortable . JCD
 Noticed that they even have an extra pair of belt loops compared to my previous order . They are sturdy & dependable .
 These jeans come washed so they are soft , supple and ready to wear . They are pre-shrunk so order the size you wear . I choose boot-cut jeans because I wear 12 '' - shaft western boots . Levies are the only jeans I wear because they fit well , look good , and get better with age .
 These jeans are perfect for the guy who wants to wear boots and not look like a geek or a thug . Just the right combination of loose and fitted .
 This is my first pair of Levi 517 's and I have to say I am very impressed . They sit on my natural waist -LRB- not low-rise like the 527 's -RRB- , and are fitted in the seat and thigh , and then flare out below the knee to fall on the boot . I 'm 6 ' 3 '' 190lbs and have a 36 waist and 34 inseam and it fit perfectly . Hard to find jeans these days that sit on the waist ... I 'm not a fan of the low-rise look or feel , so these jeans were a great find .
 Came to Amazon to order these jeans for my husband since no one ever has his size , 36x36 . I was pleasantly surprised because I did order two of these in different colors , Rancher Light and Rinse , both of which were the perfect colors . Perfect light colored jean and perfect dark colored jean . My husband and I are very hard to fit in jeans and tops so when something works we often get multiples , the problem however is that sometimes we buy the exact same thing in a different color and they fit totally different . Not these ! These jeans were great and the same fit ! Some people might not be able to appreciate that as much as I , but I was very grateful . It was a risk I had to take since his size is so common , but with free returns I had to take advantage . The boot leg is also very subtle but incredibly flattering . He does wear boots but of course they are n't necessary . I would say they are very true to size and great quality . They are currently his `` good jeans '' ... . that is until he `` accidentally '' wears them to go work in the garage . But when that happens , because it will , I will be back to purchase more ! By the way he is just over 6 ' 3 '' about 230-240lbs .
 i traveled 80 miles one day looking for the jeans i like with no luck , it did make for a nice bike ride though ! then i went online looking and i found what i was looking for at amozon these jeans are hard to get in my hometown!Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut JeansWhat a nice pair of rugged jeans . And I got them so FAST !! Thanks again.Roxann Hill
 Good product , on time and as shown in Amazon.But ... years ago , ordering the same # jean and the same size always brought the exact same fit and look . Lately , the same length , for instance , some times is a bit too long -LRB- can be fixed -RRB- or a bit too short -LRB- bad news -RRB- . The price to be paid for savings by manufacturing offshore . Lets see if with the crisis we return to the memorable `` MADE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ''
 What can I say ? They are Levis . Perfect fit , excellent quality , and the most impressive thing was the price . Unbelievable !
 If you promise not to tell anybody , I wear lined jeans from eddie bauer or llbean when it gets cooler . I wear these when it gets warmer . True to size , do n't shrink too much .
 Just as described ! Fit & look exactly what he needed and wanted . And he said I could n't find this product ... LOLThanks !!! The Wife wrote the review ...
 These jeans fit great . The boot cut gives a good look without being sloppy . My husband looks hot in them .
 Got these as a gift for my brother , and they are the true blue classic with a great slim shape . Perfect `` date night '' jeans .
 These are the only jeans my husband will wear and we could not find them ANYWHERE . When i found them here i was happily suprised with the discount price and they look great . Would buy again from this seller .
 Excellent transaction on hard to find size and style Levi Jeans.Reasonable price and quick shipping.I 'm very pleased with this purchase !
 jeans were shipped quick , arrived in good shape the medium stonewash has that worn look most people want , I am pleased with the purchase .
 It 's very good ! 100 % cottonThe higher rise sits comfortably at the waist.A fit you want from a brand you trustFit width & length ; !
 non common size request was delivered promply before Christmas . My son was very happy with the fit and color .
 Great product ... my dad was very pleased . He had not been able to find the 517 .
 These were a birthday gift for my son and I had them sent directly to him at college . He loved them and they fit great ! Good quality for the price . He liked the fit of the boot cut .
 I like this style and they are getting very hard to find . The price here was the best I found , got in a timely manner . I 'm happy with my purchase .
 Purchased these jeans for my husband . They have a nice fit and look very good on . No baggy butt like the relaxed fit jeans .
 I usually have a hard time finding good bootcut jeans with the right fit in the retail stores . If the color/wash/fabric is right , the size isnt . If the size is right , the fit is too loose at the seat and thighs . Now that my favorite pair of jeans is past its prime , I started looking for a new pair to replace it . After hunting all stores in and around my area and trying all available bootcuts in my size , I was very disappointed . That is , until I found a pair of Levi 's 517 Blue Ox in the local Macy 's store . This was the first bootcut I found in the last 3 years that fit me perfectly . Since I already had a pair of jeans that was of a very similar color , I came online and started looking for the correct color in that fit . Unfortunately , it wasnt that easy finding one online . Kohls , Dillards and others had Levi 's 517s , but they werent the same ones I saw in the store . Apart from Macys and Amazon , no other site -LRB- including Levi 's own site -RRB- had the same fit in Rancher Light color I was looking for . I could have ordered at Macys website , but my past experience with Amazon was stellar and so it my first choice . Even then I was a little skeptical if the photos were close to how the jeans looked in reality . Since amazon had a free returns on this one , I went ahead with the order . The product , as always with Amazon , came 6 days ahead of their estimated delivery date . The jeans is , in fact , very close to the pictures on the website and the fit is PERFECT !! Thanks to Levi 's for the perfect color and fit and KUDOS to amazon for the perfect shopping experience !
 Finally Levi went back to 7 belt loops instead of the five . Makes a big difference for those of us that work for a living .
 I bought the 517 as I prefer this cut to any other one of the Levi 's catalog , I place it even above the so famous 501 . I 'm fully satisfied
 I love these jeans . The wash and fit are great . That being said , they did arrive with a hole in the seat and the seam is a little crooked on the inside left leg . I really do n't care though because they fit so good .
 It is hard to find male , black , slim fit , boot cut jeans . Believe me I searched many places both on-line and local retail outlets . Finally I found these on Amazon and they were just right . Great fit , looks good , and the price was reasonable . I highly recommend them .
 We will take these to alterations but they were about 5 inches too long . Otherwise they are very nice .
 True to size , did n't shrink , and minimal wrinkling . Love the variety of sizing - son is tall and thin , and hard to fit , but Levis 517 made it happen !
 I have worn Levi jenas for the last 16years , i am relatively tall guy and seldom get my size in the store , Amazon provides me my size and then quality as well .
 Purchased two pairs of Levi 's Boot Cut Jeans for my husband , the Jeans are very hard to find in the stores . Since my husband is tall , it is hard to find 36x36 .
 These pants are very well put together and I am a big fan of Levi 's pants durability which is what prompted me to purchase these .
 I am a woman but men 's jeans fit me better . These are very comfortable . My jeans do NOT get hung up on my boots as they do with jeans that are not boot cut .
 todo salio perfecto , tanto el envio como el paquete recibido , estan esplendidas , la hora de llegada fue la establecida por el vendedor
 Quality jeans , but not made in the USA.Arrived quickly and each pair were individually bagged in plastic.Good fit , for me .
 Fit well at the waist and look good . Last a lot longer than most most jeans and seem to get more and more comfortable the more you wear them .
 These are great jeans , they do tend to run a little big , both on length and waist . The color was a lot more bluer then it looks in the picture , so be weary of that it . It was too country , and I needed more rock and roll , if you know what I mean.Pros
 I was a bit concerned about this purchase . My husband likes the boot cut style and that was an excellent choice for my purchase . I have zero compliants other then I wish I 'd bought more !
 These are like they used to make them ! More belt loops , great fabric - love them ! Ca n't wait to order more of these !
 I was having a really hard time finding the boot cut Levis - no one seems to carry them anymore . These are just what I wanted . They look and fit good .
 Bought these for my husband and they fit true to size , maybe a little bit long but not so much that he wo n't wear them . He love them , they look good so I love them ! Great Pants !
 I ordered these jeans for my 16yo son & he really liked them . The only thing he would have preferred was a lower rise , but he 's wearing them without complaints . : -RRB-
 I bought 2 of these and man they are nice . I 'll admit the guy wearing the jean in the picture sold me . Like I went and look for all the style of Levi 's , and these attracted me the most . Although I would n't tuck in my shirt like that . But they sure look good with some chucks and or casual boots and a dress shirt , with a silver wrist watch , and a pair of shades . They are heavy , and for me kinda tight even though jean of a different brand and style with the same size , fit me perfectly . I do n't know I guess it the way they are made . But for the look , I 'll take the pain any day , yes these jean are so tight mostly in my thigh area and waist , that I do get a little discomfort pain in my lower back . I guess it the way they are design and the heaviness of the jean . Of course I am in the process of getting in shape again . So with time , these will be perfect . I do like to sag a little , but as of right now I ca n't with these . Until I lose some of that belly fat I accumulated over the years .
 These are the jeans I always buy , they are a great comfortable fit . It is also great that Amazon stocks the size I need , it 's impossible to get from the shops .
 My body was made for Levi 's brand jeans , and I 'd worn through a couple of pairs . I bought duplicate black 517s - soft but not washed out , dark , with a predictable fit . They are my new favorites . The process went smoothly . Who knew I 'd be buying clothes online ?
 I ordered these for Christmas for my 6 ' 2 '' grandson who had grown out of all his pants after checking stores and finding his size is almost impossible to find . They were perfect and he loved them .
 The Levi 's 517 Boot Cut were purchused as a replacement of the wrong ones bought at a local store , These ordered & delivered ; I was told fit greatly before & after ; washThe price for my buying , totaled out a nuff less even with shipping to come fromamazon , rather than a store , even on sale after my tax & shipping ; -LRB- as a late gift -RRB- Theonly guestion I got was about , they did not have the Levi 's cardboard shelf tagswe see on Jean 's in store .
 I love my levis . I was unaware they came in black . I bought a blue pair and black pair , Ilove them
 Perfect fit right out of the box . Started wearing immediately , stitches , pockets , zipper perfectly in place . Survived several washes good as new .
 Good price , perfect quality . Very good model for young and old-aged people . Gorgeous color . Classic zipper . I 'm satisfied ! I recommend to buy it .
 These jeans fit me very well and look good . One thing I noticed however is that the denim has a more coarse feeling compared to other Levi 's jeans . I would buy these again .
 IL TELL YOU I HAVE BEEN WEARING LEVI 'S FOR YEARS ON END AND THE BEST DEAL I GOT ON THESE GREAT JEANS WAS FROM MY FAVORITE STORE AMAZON
 I love these jeans . For me they are perfect . Long enough to wear with or without boots and the fit is not too tight . How can you go wrong with Levi 's ?
 I got what I ordered promptly . I wish I had ordered a different color but -- my bad . No complaints . What else can I say ?
 The jeans was just perfect , the material , size and colour , nothing to complain about , and great timing too.They fit really well , and amazon 's size chart was very helpfull .
 The jeans were great ! The price was right , they were delivered in a timely fashion , and I lost a few lbs to get in them and I look good . lol . I recommend this company .
 These are the only jeans my son likes . He is tall and I have trouble finding his size in local stores and I could not find a better price .
 The jean came very quickly . They were the proper color , size , and cut . The packaging was excellent , and so was the quality of the jeans .
 Perfect price and fit for my husband . I would recommend this jean to any &#34; baby boomer &#34; who loves boot cut jeans.The jean has not changed at all good quality material and the right color . Thank you .
 This pair of Levi 's fits perfectly and the indigo color is the same as the Levi 's I wore back in the day !
 I gave these Jeans to my daughter 's friend for Christmas and he really likes them.He is real thin and wears motorcycle boots.He likes how they fit and loves the boot cut.He especially likes the rugged material .
 My order arrived in a timely fashion , they fit good and look great ... I 'm gon na get a couple more pairs .
 Levi 's 517 ` sThese Levi 's were the perfect fit . I like the fact that they are pre rinsed , which makes the fabric softer .
 Many of us do n't want to wear our Levi 's half way up our bellies . 517s are the best answer for that !
 A well tried and true blue jean that I 've been wearing for decades . The fit , finish , and quality is a good as or better than ever .
 product arrived as expected on time , the product was as expected and the quality was as you 'd expect to find in a brick & mortar store .
 Great fitting . I usually buy the 527 style but they did n't have black in that style . Ordered a 517 instead and love the fitting .
 The fit and look are great and I saved a few dollars . Will purchase more when the price is right
 love this jeans , the fabric is really good and the cut is impecable . it is original and the communication was really easy , i recieved really fast .
 I 've always wanted a ` black 527 ' but found out I could only get that in rigid black.I decided to try 517 n whao I might just decide to continue with 517 even with other colors.Just the perfect fit I love .
 Is exactly what i was looking for . . i being using this model for years , and this pair of pant are excellent
 I am a creature of habit . Being of slim build I have found the 517 Boot cut to be the perfect jean for me . I also know my size so the fit was great as received . This is not always the case when ordering over the Internet . Service was great delivered on time as expected .
 These are the best jeans Levis has to offer in my opinion . They are not light and flimsy like some jeans Levis are making these days . The medium stonewash is a great even color . They do n't look faded on the seat and thighs or dingly and dirty like so many jeans do . These jeans are rugged , comfortable and last a long , long time . On top of that they look great . These are the only jeans I will buy .
 Received the item quickly . The quality of the bowtie is good for its price . Will buy again from this vendor .
 I bought this bow tie -LRB- not sure if that 's one word or two -- the item title is n't even consistent with itself -RRB- for a college theatre performance . It looks great from a distance and is easily adjustable . Up close , though , you can really tell that it 's poor quality due to threads hanging off of it . It 's great for performance or for an `` everyday '' look if that 's your style , but if you need something for a formal event I would recommend laying out a little more money for something else .
 This was purchased for my son 's wedding and it worked out well . The fit was good and the color was as stated in the description .
 It accomplished the high stress , ultra difficult mission of showing up at my house being a bowtie . If you need a bowtie , you 've contacted the correct site .
 The price is right - my high schoolers wear bowties/matching hats for dances and `` sports dress day '' so when I can get a bowtie under $ 10 -LRB- w / free shipping -RRB- I jump on it . The material is a little thinner than the other bowties I 've purchased -LRB- here and retail stores -RRB- so not sure how long it will hold up but for the price , it 's all good . I 'll probably purchase more in other colors .
 this was the very first time I ordered from Amazon.com and was very pleased with the enormous website and fashions available . my son is getting married and need white suspenders and bow ties . the quality was wonderful and I saved 60 % with Amazon instead of going to a Tux rental store .
 This thing ended up being very high quality , even though it 's inexpensive . I have been very happy with it . It fits very well and is adjustable .
 The tie was much better than I expected for the price I paid . Adjustable and the material has a nice texture .
 When I ordered this bowtie I never expected how much it would change my life . I just needed a white bowtie to go with the white tuxedo I was renting for my wedding , since the rental shop does n't have any white bowties.To my amazement however I got far more than I bargained for . I feel like inspectorate gadget at the new years gala . I never thought I 'd have need of a retractable satellite dish or a 11 inch hunting knife but those two things alone have come in more useful than I could have ever imagined.The concealed weapons permit tucked in the strap seemed a bit much until when clipping the tie on one day and the clip fell out of a 9mm Baretta somehow tucked into the folds.I was simply amazed at the shear amount of extras that came with my tie . Aside for the satellite dish , knife , and gun that I 've mentioned there was also : A case of ginger ale6 throwing starsA disposable cellular phoneThe microphone to a ham radio2 9-Volt batteriesA ream of card stock paperPinking shearsA bolt of camouflage fabricWater purification tabletsA signaling mirrorA wireless mouseA live mouseMatchesAnother bowtie60 feet of nylon ropeA toothbrushEnough spices to start a specialty bakeryA steering wheeland 35 half-inch steel ball bearingsIn all I am elated with this purchase and I would strongly recommend this product and this seller to others . The sellers willingness to go above and beyond to provide a quality product is second to none .
 This bowtie was very nice & my son looked quite handsome in it ! It was goodquality & arrived in good time . Good seller .
 The tie looks great , pure white . The tie however is smaller than a non pre tied tie . Slightly larger would be nice .
 For a one time event , it 's perfect ! Luckily for us a day was all we needed . Therefore , I would n't recommend it if you are looking for extended use of it .
 it is a really cool bowtie , great for formal stuff . i wouldve liked it to have a better clasp though ...
 I love the solid white bow ties that I received and intend to buy more colors . I also received my ties in a timely matter .
 I 've ordered this item twice . Would have given it five , but it was weird . The first tie I got was pretty nasty looking ... But it was a white bow tie and complemented me about it . Then , I lost it , so I got a new one , which was 100 % nicer ... I dunno how the company picks who to give the junkier ones too .
 I find these leggings are superior in fit and comfort to other brands that cost more . Perfect for wearing under jeans when the weather is cold!They have less compression than theCapezio Women 's Capri Legging , which is good as far as I am concerned , as I want to wear them all day without feeling overly squished .
 These are the best of any legging I 've bought recently but definitely not the quality Danskin has made in the past . I 've worn leggings for over 25 yrs and still have some Danskin 's that are over 15 yrs old . They 're retired now r/t fading and are only for home use . They 're still structurally very sound . I would say the size and fit is accurate in these and the best for the money I 've found .
 I bought these to workout in and ended up wearing them everywhere ! They are so comfortable !!!
 I purchased these just as comfy-wear for a plane trip and because they matched the color gray in a top I own . They worked out great . The color is true to the picture and they feel good against my skin and are very comfortable . I even went in the ocean with them and the cotton did not stretch out . Also the fit is nice in that i did not have to constantly pull them up because of slippage .
 Just what I was looking for !!! There are n't too many stores that are carrying this style any more and it was nice to find them at Amazon . They cost less than the Danskin on line store and that made me very happy . They arrived before the due date and were the correct size - even a better guess on my part .
 I bought these Danskin capris for workouts at the gym . They fit well and are extremely comfortable and wash well . Just what I needed and wanted .
 I wear these about 4 times a week , wash after each wear & they have not worn out in the inner thigh area . I wear them while working out , circuit training & interval training , yoga & sometimes to trail run . I dont like wearing these pants to the gym b/c the gray color shows everything in the back -LRB- sweat ... ect . -RRB- So I took off 1 star b/c of that . Otherwise , a great pant for my workouts and just to wear around the house .
 I love these capris ! I 've been wearing them for physical therapy & while I 'm on the elliptical , and they 're really supportive and comfortable !
 Great quality at a great price . Way better than trying to make your own .
 This was a fantastic costume ! The price was quite reasonable and the shipping was incredibly fast . It was a hit at all the parties I went to and I ca n't wait to wear it again . My only problem was that I wished the comb on the chicken 's head stood up straight like it does in the picture -- it actually tends to flop over when you wear the costume . Other than that , outstanding !
 These T shirts are the best around , I 'm serious , they are very strong and very soft . A couple friends of mine work in the silkscreening business and told me that the `` Hanes Beefy T '' was THE best out there , so I ordered 6 of them on their advice . I 've never seen T shirts this nice , they are the most comfortable , strongest , and they feel like they will last forever . I 'm so happy with these shirts , they are awesome .
 I 've been wearing these for years.They do tend to fade easily so wash them inside out and use a detergent product for black fabrics .
 I bought these as a gift for a friend who has worn this style for years . Good quality , good fit , good style .
 Great jeans.Classical style.Low price.Wearing only jeans , levis always loved.Happy New Year!Amazon Forever!I love it .
 This hard to find style arrived on time . These classic jeans fit just the way they should . Going back for more colors .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Slim Fit Jean is leg looks like so long , . . but lap so tight but leg looks like so long . .
 My husband like it . . although I have to cut the length a little bit . . He said he may buy more in the future . . Hopefully they have shorter length then .
 They are Levis what more needs to be said ? Theyre the only jeans im buying from now on . They fit great and last 2-5 times longer than any other jeans ive bought .
 I use to wear the Levis low boot cut , but they discontinue to sell the color I want . After I give this one a try , I like it so much .
 If you know your size they fit . I do n't understand the reviews that say the sizes are wrong . Will buy again .
 was just what i expected ... very pleased with purchase . I like the fact that you can get 29 inseam . You can not get that in the store . No need to get them hemmed !
 Very high quality . Several pairs have consistent fit . Have bought and worn these 517 boot cut jeans for several years .
 My husband LOVES these jeans . They are a GREAT FIT , especially in the seat . The legs are n't too wide in the thighs and the bootcut bottom make a terrific silhouette . I like how he looks in them and he says they are REALLY COMFORTABLE . They look best in the darker color and are a good pair of `` dress jeans '' as well as versatile . We are ordering more . Ladies , get him these jeans !
 I 've worn Levi 's for over 50 years . From the days when you had to roll up the cuffs because they only had one length to super bells in the 70 's and now my favorite 517 's . They are always true to size and the workmanship is always excellent . The service at Amazon is always great too . What more can I say , I am one satisfied customer .
 These boot cut Levis have always been my favorite jeans . I had not had any in a while , so when my order arrived I immediately tried them on . I forgot how well they fit , and they are really stylish . Awesome . Will be ordering more .
 Authentic , just as described . Fast delivery . I am very satisfied with purchase . Smooth , one stop purchase . Husband will be very happy on Christmas day ! Thank you .
 My grandson loves these jeans , since he 's rather tall we were glad to find Levi 's makes great jeans in his size . Strange as it may seem , many brands of jeans do not come in a 34in length .
 As an active equestrian rider , and a woman of 59 years , I 'm ALWAYS looking for comfortable jeans that sit at my waist -- I do n't like women 's jeans at all - the fabric in women 's jeans seems flimsy , and the low-rise , hip-hugging jeans for riding or leisure wear feels uncomfortable . The men 's Levis and men 's Lee jeans are very comfortable , and they can handle my active life -- for me , men 's Levis 517 bootcut jeans have best variety for colors , and toughest quality in fabric .
 Fit well at the waist and look good . Last a lot longer than most most jeans and seem to get more and more comfortable the more you wear them .
 These are great jeans , they do tend to run a little big , both on length and waist . The color was a lot more bluer then it looks in the picture , so be weary of that it . It was too country , and I needed more rock and roll , if you know what I mean.Pros
 I was a bit concerned about this purchase . My husband likes the boot cut style and that was an excellent choice for my purchase . I have zero compliants other then I wish I 'd bought more !
 they were exactly what we were looking for . the orginal 517 , these are my hubby 's most favoritie , they also hold up better than the other styles seem to
 Will have to wash several times for them to fit . I buy this size all the time from other retailers and they are n't this big . Like the color and the style . They just run big I guess . Mainly in the length . Would buy again , just a smaller size .
 The fit is nice , the color is holding up through the wash . I am glad they have different sizes then the stores . Very hard to find 33 x 36 !
 I like the way these jeans fit.The are also comfortable.The ones I have purchased previously have been durable .
 d e m a r a v i l l a e s t e m o d e l o muy bueno
 i traveled 80 miles one day looking for the jeans i like with no luck , it did make for a nice bike ride though ! then i went online looking and i found what i was looking for at amozon these jeans are hard to get in my hometown!Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut JeansWhat a nice pair of rugged jeans . And I got them so FAST !! Thanks again.Roxann Hill
 Good product , on time and as shown in Amazon.But ... years ago , ordering the same # jean and the same size always brought the exact same fit and look . Lately , the same length , for instance , some times is a bit too long -LRB- can be fixed -RRB- or a bit too short -LRB- bad news -RRB- . The price to be paid for savings by manufacturing offshore . Lets see if with the crisis we return to the memorable `` MADE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ''
 What can I say ? They are Levis . Perfect fit , excellent quality , and the most impressive thing was the price . Unbelievable !
 a la medida , tabla de medidas excelente ...
 The only problem was I had was that I had to have them hemmed 2 &#34; so as not to walk on the cuff . I would have ordered them shorter but they were not offered in the waist size I needed . The waist fit perfect and having them hemmed was not that big of a deal . It coast me $ 12.00 to have them hemmed .
 These jeans come washed so they are soft , supple and ready to wear . They are pre-shrunk so order the size you wear . I choose boot-cut jeans because I wear 12 '' - shaft western boots . Levies are the only jeans I wear because they fit well , look good , and get better with age .
 These jeans are perfect for the guy who wants to wear boots and not look like a geek or a thug . Just the right combination of loose and fitted .
 This is my first pair of Levi 517 's and I have to say I am very impressed . They sit on my natural waist -LRB- not low-rise like the 527 's -RRB- , and are fitted in the seat and thigh , and then flare out below the knee to fall on the boot . I 'm 6 ' 3 '' 190lbs and have a 36 waist and 34 inseam and it fit perfectly . Hard to find jeans these days that sit on the waist ... I 'm not a fan of the low-rise look or feel , so these jeans were a great find .
 Came to Amazon to order these jeans for my husband since no one ever has his size , 36x36 . I was pleasantly surprised because I did order two of these in different colors , Rancher Light and Rinse , both of which were the perfect colors . Perfect light colored jean and perfect dark colored jean . My husband and I are very hard to fit in jeans and tops so when something works we often get multiples , the problem however is that sometimes we buy the exact same thing in a different color and they fit totally different . Not these ! These jeans were great and the same fit ! Some people might not be able to appreciate that as much as I , but I was very grateful . It was a risk I had to take since his size is so common , but with free returns I had to take advantage . The boot leg is also very subtle but incredibly flattering . He does wear boots but of course they are n't necessary . I would say they are very true to size and great quality . They are currently his `` good jeans '' ... . that is until he `` accidentally '' wears them to go work in the garage . But when that happens , because it will , I will be back to purchase more ! By the way he is just over 6 ' 3 '' about 230-240lbs .
 The jeans were a Christmas gift and a style regularly worn by the recipient . They were a perfect fit . They are hard to find locally so we ordered from the Internet . The red tag on the back pocket did not say `` Levis '' and I have never seen this before . Is it significant ?
 Wow . These are great blue jeans , and they come in 38 long which is what he wears . HE wanted the boot cut , and a 34 waist was large enough . Usually he wears a 36 , , but I ordered 34 and they fit just right . Great looking , great price .
 I bought two pairs in two orders - both were perfect - exactly as I expected . On time . Good buy at a decent price .
 These jeans are tough but good looking and fit well . Amazon 's price is great , they are a good value for the money , and we always get prompt delivery and easy return if size is not right .
 the product is excellente , but needs to be taggedcorrectly , I order 34x30 tag say so , but real size was36x32 try buying them from differet source , and same thing never can get athe right size until i took a mesuring tape to the store and mesure before buing them !!
 I love those Jeans . . nice shape and denim . I ordered different colors from this pant and I love them all . it is comfortable , and have a nice leg openning that falls around the boot .
 I have been wearing 517 's for as long as I can remember . They fit perfectly and have remained unchanged for years .
 These boot cut jeans by my favorite jeans maker are exactly what I needed.When I ordered my Harley Davidson boots , I needed pants for when I wear them and these ones are the only ones that fit on the outside where others ca n't . Shopping local yields nothing like these , just junk not worth the money.Quality is what I 've come to expect from Levi 's , outstanding with fit absolutely perfect.More orders coming soon for these.Shipping was prompt , making this buyer very happy.Thank you to everyone for helping this lonely guy that hardly can get out to shop by bringing them to me.Again , THANK YOU VERY MUCH !!
 I thought these were more on the casual side , but after putting them on , they can pull off a nice look . Very comfy , one day to break in . No frays , quality zipper . Dimensions were perfect . Overall color is a shade or two darker than in the picture . Awesome , new favorite pair .
 Levis 517 Boot Cut Jeans are just as advertized . Good fit and a perfect boot cut . I highly recommend them for anyone who needs boot cut jeans .
 It 's a very good pant for my husband . Nothing too special or fancy ; he is very satisfied because he got what he expected
 execelente producto muy buena calidad , el pantalon vino en un excelente empaque y llego super rapido deverdad no tengo quejas lo recomiendo
 He looks hot in them , thanks ! What more can I say ? They did n't stay on for very long ... ca n't share any more details .
 I was somewhat hesitant to order Levi 's online but I could n't be happier with this order ! The jeans are exactly as described and fit perfectly . They are genuine Levi 's and are of the highest quality - not seconds . I ca n't recommend this seller highly enough .
 They 're good sellers and the product is very good , I like so much this jean . Ellos son muy buenos vendedores , el producto llego rapido a mis manos y era el esperado , los recomiendo ampliamente .
 I wear Levi jeans every day . Levi 's are the only jeans I will wear.I have worn Levi jeans for the past twenty -LRB- 20 -RRB- years ... or longer.Levi jeans are great ... in fact , i 'm wearin 'em right now ...
 I like this style and they are getting very hard to find . The price here was the best I found , got in a timely manner . I 'm happy with my purchase .
 Purchased these jeans for my husband . They have a nice fit and look very good on . No baggy butt like the relaxed fit jeans .
 I usually have a hard time finding good bootcut jeans with the right fit in the retail stores . If the color/wash/fabric is right , the size isnt . If the size is right , the fit is too loose at the seat and thighs . Now that my favorite pair of jeans is past its prime , I started looking for a new pair to replace it . After hunting all stores in and around my area and trying all available bootcuts in my size , I was very disappointed . That is , until I found a pair of Levi 's 517 Blue Ox in the local Macy 's store . This was the first bootcut I found in the last 3 years that fit me perfectly . Since I already had a pair of jeans that was of a very similar color , I came online and started looking for the correct color in that fit . Unfortunately , it wasnt that easy finding one online . Kohls , Dillards and others had Levi 's 517s , but they werent the same ones I saw in the store . Apart from Macys and Amazon , no other site -LRB- including Levi 's own site -RRB- had the same fit in Rancher Light color I was looking for . I could have ordered at Macys website , but my past experience with Amazon was stellar and so it my first choice . Even then I was a little skeptical if the photos were close to how the jeans looked in reality . Since amazon had a free returns on this one , I went ahead with the order . The product , as always with Amazon , came 6 days ahead of their estimated delivery date . The jeans is , in fact , very close to the pictures on the website and the fit is PERFECT !! Thanks to Levi 's for the perfect color and fit and KUDOS to amazon for the perfect shopping experience !
 Finally Levi went back to 7 belt loops instead of the five . Makes a big difference for those of us that work for a living .
 I bought the 517 as I prefer this cut to any other one of the Levi 's catalog , I place it even above the so famous 501 . I 'm fully satisfied
 I love these jeans . The wash and fit are great . That being said , they did arrive with a hole in the seat and the seam is a little crooked on the inside left leg . I really do n't care though because they fit so good .
 It is hard to find male , black , slim fit , boot cut jeans . Believe me I searched many places both on-line and local retail outlets . Finally I found these on Amazon and they were just right . Great fit , looks good , and the price was reasonable . I highly recommend them .
 We will take these to alterations but they were about 5 inches too long . Otherwise they are very nice .
 True to size , did n't shrink , and minimal wrinkling . Love the variety of sizing - son is tall and thin , and hard to fit , but Levis 517 made it happen !
 I ordered these jeans an exrta size longer becaause I wanted a high cuff . Got exactally that . Perfect !!! Now I 'm looking for a white pair
 Well , they 're Levi 's . There you go . Best jeans on the market . Last forever and fit great . The black does fade to gray quicker than I would like , but that 's probably because I wear only black , all the time . So ...
 I have worn Levi jenas for the last 16years , i am relatively tall guy and seldom get my size in the store , Amazon provides me my size and then quality as well .
 Purchased two pairs of Levi 's Boot Cut Jeans for my husband , the Jeans are very hard to find in the stores . Since my husband is tall , it is hard to find 36x36 .
 These pants are very well put together and I am a big fan of Levi 's pants durability which is what prompted me to purchase these .
 I am a woman but men 's jeans fit me better . These are very comfortable . My jeans do NOT get hung up on my boots as they do with jeans that are not boot cut .
 todo salio perfecto , tanto el envio como el paquete recibido , estan esplendidas , la hora de llegada fue la establecida por el vendedor
 Quality jeans , but not made in the USA.Arrived quickly and each pair were individually bagged in plastic.Good fit , for me .
 Finally figured out what cut and size I like , but the only place I can find them is the internet . Great pants .
 These were ordered off Amazon when I could not find them locally . I found the pants and they are describer perfectly and fit exactly as I had wanted them to . I will buy more in the future because they were perfect .
 Completamente satisfecha con el producto , exactamente igual a lo que ofrecieron . LLego en el tiempo estimado que prometieron . Ninguna queja , volveria a comprar de nuevo .
 The Levi jeans were just like I expected . The fit was perfect and received them in just a few days . Thanks !!
 The quality of the denim is lighter , so the good fit disappears by the end of the day . Otherwise , I like 'em !
 Hubby dearest was so happy to find boot cut Levi jeans at Amazon as it seems most stores have quit carrying this style of jean . He likes to wear boot cut jeans and Levi jeans are his favorite brand.No complaints about the fit or wearability either . Ordered two more pairs of jeans today as he 's a happy camper.Recommend .
 Good deal on the jeans and speedy shipping . My first pair of boot cut jeans . My girl friend really likes them on me . I got the dark blue -LRB- rinse -RRB- . Fit good and comfortable .
 My skinny son is 54 years old and will not wear any other jeans - only 517 , boot cut Levi 's so I know what to buy for Christmas and Birthdays . I found a perfect fit for my skinny husband also .
 I ordered these jeansLevi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jeanfor a Christmas gift a short time before Christmas . I knew the size . I was somewhat concerned that I would not get them on time for Christmas The package came just before Christmas , and the jeans were exactly as pictured , nicely packaged -LRB- each pair separately enclosed in plastic bag -RRB- , the right size and color . I was very pleased , as was the recipient of the gift !
 It 's very good ! 100 % cottonThe higher rise sits comfortably at the waist.A fit you want from a brand you trustFit width & length ; !
 non common size request was delivered promply before Christmas . My son was very happy with the fit and color .
 Great product ... my dad was very pleased . He had not been able to find the 517 .
 These were a birthday gift for my son and I had them sent directly to him at college . He loved them and they fit great ! Good quality for the price . He liked the fit of the boot cut .
 These are great jeans for us gals , too , especially if you like to wear a true black color . I dress them up with a feminine camisole and heels , and have got many compliments on them .
 Exactly what my hubby wants . It 's difficult to find his size in our local stores . Very happy Amazon now has Levi 's in his size .
 I love my new bootcuts . I received them quickly , They fit perfectly . Thank you .
 I 've grown frustrated by the lack of good quality/reasonably priced jeans in the market today . At some point , the Levis brand started to suffer in terms of quality/value for the dollar . Do n't remember exactly when that happened , but I started to buy my jeans from Banana Republic . Over time , they stopped making the style I grew to rely on . This created a 7-10 stretch where I could n't seem to find a good pair of jeans . Most recently , I purchased a pair of Lucky jeans - ridiculously over priced . When those began to fail , I tried Levis again and bought these . For a third of the price of Lucky Jeans , these Levis boot-cut jeans are really nice . They have a really substantial feel/weight to them and I could n't be happier with the purchase . I was so pleased , I ended up buying a second pair .
 Good quality but I wish I had done more research on the colors . Ordered rigid because of the look online however the denim itself is rigid .
 Yes , these Levi 's are everything I had hoped they would be and More . Perfect fit , and I 'm very pleased tofinally have a BLACK pair ! Amazon 's got another winner !
 My wife thinks it 's funny that I rate my jeans with numbers , but , as a former 505 's man , I now prefer the 517 's 'cause ride my horses more and were my boots more ... plus , they just , plain feel good when they 're on me ...
 Who does n't love Levis ? These are great ! My son was happy on Christmas day and so were we . Happy Holidays !
 It is great to find the exact size , color , and fit you want in a Levi 's jean , and also get it on time .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean , Medium Stonewash , 38x29They fit perfectly . Will probably order more in a couple months .
 Needed a size that few brick & mortar stores keep in stock . Amazon had style I wanted in the size that I wanted at a good price !
 These blue jeans where a great color and a perfect fit . Glad I ordered them . They were a present for my son
 My husband has been wearing Levi 's since he was a teenager . They are the most durable jeans and he loves the boot cut .
 Ordered these for my boyfriend , they run extremely small , he regularly wears a 32/34 had to send back and get a 36/34 . Other than that they 're great jeans .
 Finally a pair of Levi 's not only affordable , but a pair that is the real deal . . not seconds or blemished . . but cut perfectly . . The best I have bought in years . . Thanks . . and `` I 'll be back for more ''
 They fit just perfectly and I am very happy to not only get the bestdeal around but beat the sales tax . Good old Levi 's rigid , bootcut jeans have been my all-time favorite jeans my whole life , andI just turned 60 . Got 'em within a week , free shipping faster thanexpected , so that was cool , too . Amazon rules !
 The pants are great . I can not seem to find them in stores like Kohls or Target where I usually shop . I 'm not skinny as far as a skinny person goes but I have thinner legs than a lot of guys . These seem to be not as loose in the butt and thighs . I usually get the 505 's but they are cut a little bigger assuming tree trunk size legs . I have runners legs and these work . If you have big footballer legs , forget about it .
 Finally jeans that fit like the old Levis , these are the old quality heavy denim stuff not that wimpy pre-wash thin as paper junk denim . I would highly recommend these jeans to anyone who 's familiar with real Levis .
 Very easy shopping . I 'm familiar with the pants so it 's just a matter of price and convenience.Sitting at the desk for a few second beats driving to the store , finding out they do n't have the 517 in my size and driving back home . I 've always had trouble just finding the 517 at stores and shopping online sure makes things easier . The pants themselves are everything they 've always been , good fitting and tough.It 's nice to add the stonewash to my collection of darker denim so I do n't look the same every day.I was upprised how fast they came and that 's a big plus too .
 These jeans fit to size perfectly -LRB- for me -RRB- , are comfortable to wear , and have adequate material to reach a guy 's waist ... not hip-huggers . I 'll buy more of these ! Not a deal-breaker by any means but I would prefer them to not have the size label outside ... it seems Levi 's always does this .
 Amazon did not mentioned in the description that this pair of jeans is a Shrink-to-Fit fabric . No question on the quality . . it 's still an amazing jeans , the great Levi 's jeans , never goes out of style ... Take 31 '' waistline x 30 '' inseam if your size is 30 x 30 .
 Levi 's are always the best jeans around . Levi 's Boot Cut are the only kind my husband will wear . Always a good fit .
 If you have a problem with jeans bagging in the rear , then these jeans are for you ! They are a great fit and very comfortable ! My husband loves them !
 Well , its a good jean , everybody know the levi 's quality , the item arive in perfect conditions . . so nothing more to say . .
 Perfect fit , every time . 517 's are difficult for me to find locally , but buying on line thru Amazon is best for me .
 These are like they used to make them ! More belt loops , great fabric - love them ! Ca n't wait to order more of these !
 I was having a really hard time finding the boot cut Levis - no one seems to carry them anymore . These are just what I wanted . They look and fit good .
 Bought these for my husband and they fit true to size , maybe a little bit long but not so much that he wo n't wear them . He love them , they look good so I love them ! Great Pants !
 I ordered these jeans for my 16yo son & he really liked them . The only thing he would have preferred was a lower rise , but he 's wearing them without complaints . : -RRB-
 I bought 2 of these and man they are nice . I 'll admit the guy wearing the jean in the picture sold me . Like I went and look for all the style of Levi 's , and these attracted me the most . Although I would n't tuck in my shirt like that . But they sure look good with some chucks and or casual boots and a dress shirt , with a silver wrist watch , and a pair of shades . They are heavy , and for me kinda tight even though jean of a different brand and style with the same size , fit me perfectly . I do n't know I guess it the way they are made . But for the look , I 'll take the pain any day , yes these jean are so tight mostly in my thigh area and waist , that I do get a little discomfort pain in my lower back . I guess it the way they are design and the heaviness of the jean . Of course I am in the process of getting in shape again . So with time , these will be perfect . I do like to sag a little , but as of right now I ca n't with these . Until I lose some of that belly fat I accumulated over the years .
 These are the jeans I always buy , they are a great comfortable fit . It is also great that Amazon stocks the size I need , it 's impossible to get from the shops .
 Sent me what I wanted . 15 more 12 more 11 more 9 more 7 more 5 more 3 more done
 This is a very good price for this product , it 's the second one I 've ordered for my son .
 I love being able to find the 517 's on line and not having to run all over town for the style and size I need .
 If you promise not to tell anybody , I wear lined jeans from eddie bauer or llbean when it gets cooler . I wear these when it gets warmer . True to size , do n't shrink too much .
 These were a secret gift for my brother-in-law . He keeps complaining that he must do laundry every other day because he only has one pair of work pants , but then he just will not go get more or let anyone buy him any ! So , I got the size off of the one pair of jeans he owns -LRB- laundry is at my house -RRB- and I bought several other pairs that were similarly worn . I sneak in a new pair about once a week and so far he has n't noticed that he now has three pair of work pants . When I slip in the new ones , I put them in the dirty clothes hamper he uses . I wonder if he knows his pants are multiplying yet ?
 They arived bfore time , APO adress , in Afghanistan ,1 week took it to arive here , im suprised , and they fit good , i dont hawe no words
 36 &#34; inseam jeans at a reasonable price are hard to find . I really like the fit of these jeans just wish there were other kinds in the same length .
 Just what I expected . After soaking and drying , the fit and feel was as anticipated ... just like the good , old days !!! -LRB- I would estimate that length and waist both shrunk by about one inch ... as Mama warned , some 50 years ago -RRB-
 I am happy with the jeans and how they fit , but usually when I get 517 's , they are really stiff and then I get to break them in . This pair was already like pre-washed , just differnt than what I am used to , but I still like them and will wear them . Maybe I have to look into differnt types and find exactly what I am looking for next time . Thank you
 I 've been wearing 517 's for a good , long time now , and I love 'em ! The problem is that most of my local stores that sell them -- and very few of them do -- price them highly and also drastically limit the selection compared to the more popular 501 's and 550 's . Additionally , these jeans are often skipped over when it comes to the big sales . Well , shopping for them on Amazon is a decision I should have made long ago . The price here is hard to beat.As for the jeans themselves , they are of the rugged quality that Levi 's is known for . They fit like the product photo shows
 Have had these jeans for a few weeks now & am very satisfied.The flair from the knee down is discrete and does not look like the 70 's bell-bottoms . The fit on top was precisely as marked . The length seems about 1/2 inch longer than sized on the 501 's . Was formerly utilizing 501 slim fit jeans but found that could not place them over motorcyle boots . The 501s were great for rainy rides , but look too much like a cowboy , when tucked into the boots .
 As always , good shopping at amazon.com . Its always a problem finding the right length jeans for me . I found that in this levi 517 Boot cut jean , it feels good to finally find a jean that is not too short . A fact that i would have loved to know before i bought this jeans , is the leg opening size . This jean is very tight around the thigh area . I would just like a bit more details on the product a next time round . Other than that , it always a good shopping experience on Amazon .
 The length and waist were perfect . The quality of Levi jeans was the same as they had always been , good
 I always had to keep pulling up my previous pairs of Levi 's -LRB- any model -RRB- because they only had FIVE belt loops . A key ring and cell phone are not that heavy . I remember growing up with Levi 's having SEVEN belt loops and a heavier canvas . I was pleasantly surprised to see the ` new ' Levi 's 517 now have seven belt loops again . I started to buy a different model , but they still only have the five loops.I just bought a couple of these pairs from Amazon . I did check online at Kohls and their current batch of 517 's still show 5 loops . I will have to wait until I go to the store to see if their stock has been updated . Kohls prices are higher than Amazon , but I will recheck when they go on sale . I still check Amazon first for almost all my purchases.Overall , I like my new Levi 's jeans . I will compare them with older ones to see if the canvas really is slightly thinner . Outsourcing manufacturing almost always results in poorer quality and non-standard sizing . It has 100 % results in putting Americans out of work . I try to buy American whenever I can -- hopefully it will catch on.There is another issue appearing after I washed my new jeans with my old ones . It should n't have made a difference , but the new ones are now covered with fine fluffy hairs . I will have to use a lint brush when I take them out of the dryer for now . Although it may just be a ` break in -- first washings ' issue.Overall , I rate these jeans 4 stars . I will have to wait for a few machine washings to see how the color holds up . I may be old fashioned , but buying jeans looking like they are 1/2 wore out or have holes in them is ` less than optimal ' .
 I ran around town to find my husband Levi 517 's in size 35x32 for Christmas . In the stores , there were stacks of all different sorts of Levi 's to go through . Finally I came home and ordered them through Amazon and received exactly what he wanted . These Levi 's fit perfectly and look great . Very happy they come in off size waists . Thank you for making my job easier and receiving nice fitting jeans .
 I 've grown up wearing Levi 's and in particular 517 's in my adult life . I do like that Levi has added additional belt loops in the past year or so . Over the years Levi has cut some corners in manufacturing , but not enough to discourage me from continuing to buy their stonewashed 517 's . I like the stonewashed jeans since they are ready to wear , unlike the rigid indigo Levi 's that have to be washed several times to soften them up.I am buying more and more items from Amazon for the free shipping and competitive prices . It just saves a lot of time going to a retailer only to find out they do n't have my size or what I want . Even with Amazon collecting California sales tax , I figure the time and gas saved from having to go to a retailer is well worth it .
 Nice one . . Boot Cut with nice fit.Ordered the Jeans with 29L but got it 3inch longer . So I had to do alteration , usually I order my pants with 29L and it fits perfect on me .
 Levis 517 's fit me better than any other jeans that I 've bought . Gon na stick with them . I wear a 38 waist , 36 inseam . Have bought several pair over the past six months from various places and they all fit the same . Good quality control !
 BASTANTE BIEN . BUENA CALIDAD DEL PANTALON . ME QUEDO MUY BIEN . TANTO EL LARGO COMO EN CINTURA . EXCELENTE COMPRA A UDS . GRACIAS .
 The jeans are a good deep color . Wish they were n't quite as thin as jean material seems to be getting , but seems they are all like that now . Overall a good pair of jeans.These are hard to find in 36x36 , so I 'm glad Amazon carries them .
 Perfect fit right out of the box . Started wearing immediately , stitches , pockets , zipper perfectly in place . Survived several washes good as new .
 Good price , perfect quality . Very good model for young and old-aged people . Gorgeous color . Classic zipper . I 'm satisfied ! I recommend to buy it .
 These jeans fit me very well and look good . One thing I noticed however is that the denim has a more coarse feeling compared to other Levi 's jeans . I would buy these again .
 IL TELL YOU I HAVE BEEN WEARING LEVI 'S FOR YEARS ON END AND THE BEST DEAL I GOT ON THESE GREAT JEANS WAS FROM MY FAVORITE STORE AMAZON
 These are the first jeans in a while that actually fit my waist size , inseam and the leg openings are perfect .
 These jeans fit well but the denim seems less hefty than the denim of the same 517s from 5 years ago .
 I received my pants very quickly . I was concerned that my size would be too short for boots . I was pleasantly surprised that the designer was thoughtful about the shape and length for this item &#34; after &#34; several washings . Pants are about 1/2 inch longer than the average pants which make them perfect for cowboy boots . Pants are also very comfortable . JCD
 Noticed that they even have an extra pair of belt loops compared to my previous order . They are sturdy & dependable .
 The jeans were great ! The price was right , they were delivered in a timely fashion , and I lost a few lbs to get in them and I look good . lol . I recommend this company .
 These are the only jeans my son likes . He is tall and I have trouble finding his size in local stores and I could not find a better price .
 The jean came very quickly . They were the proper color , size , and cut . The packaging was excellent , and so was the quality of the jeans .
 Perfect price and fit for my husband . I would recommend this jean to any &#34; baby boomer &#34; who loves boot cut jeans.The jean has not changed at all good quality material and the right color . Thank you .
 This pair of Levi 's fits perfectly and the indigo color is the same as the Levi 's I wore back in the day !
 I gave these Jeans to my daughter 's friend for Christmas and he really likes them.He is real thin and wears motorcycle boots.He likes how they fit and loves the boot cut.He especially likes the rugged material .
 his pants in overall line is still very good , sturdy , feels soft to the touch on the skin , the profile legendary cutting adds a touch of elegance , and even after several washings the fabric remains the same and does not shrink , the only thing I did not like the pants is that they have deteriorated the quality of the clips and metal buttons , formerly of copper and bronze , and now this are of aluminum and does not look good , however I recommend buying them are very good at the price .
 These came a little long , maybe an inch or two . Seeing as many others have noticed this is a problem with this fit , I suggest going one inseam size lower . I ordered a 30 '' and they fit more like a 31-32 '' . Other than the sizing , they are great jeans , and still look great on me . The boot cut allows the extra length to bunch up a little around the shoes , so you do n't really notice it . It actually looks good.I wish they sold these in a low rise version , as I do n't like hiking them up to where you might put dress pants or khakis . They stopped selling the 517 in a low rise though , so I 'm happy to wear them as is , great fit .
 I have always appreciated the fit and quality of Levi jeans . The boot cut has a closer fit around the knee with comfortable room in the hips and waist . What Levi Strauss needs to understand is that there is a huge population of men out there that has a 31 inch inseam . Men between 5 ' 9 &#34; and 6 ' fall into this size range . My growth did not stop at 30 &#34; inseam , and did not make it to 32 &#34; . So I either buy high water jeans that show my socks , or I let the cuffs drag the floor which signicantly reduces the life of the jeans . I liked the fit enough that I spent an additional $ 10 to get them hemmed to 31 .
 product arrived as expected on time , the product was as expected and the quality was as you 'd expect to find in a brick & mortar store .
 Great fitting . I usually buy the 527 style but they did n't have black in that style . Ordered a 517 instead and love the fitting .
 The fit and look are great and I saved a few dollars . Will purchase more when the price is right
 love this jeans , the fabric is really good and the cut is impecable . it is original and the communication was really easy , i recieved really fast .
 My order arrived in a timely fashion , they fit good and look great ... I 'm gon na get a couple more pairs .
 Levi 's 517 ` sThese Levi 's were the perfect fit . I like the fact that they are pre rinsed , which makes the fabric softer .
 Many of us do n't want to wear our Levi 's half way up our bellies . 517s are the best answer for that !
 A well tried and true blue jean that I 've been wearing for decades . The fit , finish , and quality is a good as or better than ever .
 These seemed a bit darker in person than pictured but they were a great pair of jeans for my husband . This is his favorite style of jeans and he needed a new pair of &#34; dressy jeans . &#34; Same great jeans as in the past .
 All the Levi 's I purchased for my 16 year old son were ` made to fit ' ! From the straight to boot cut , they all were a perfect fit for his personal taste . They are well made and very stylish .
 Great jeans , great price , speedy delivery as promised ! Will definitely be ordering them again since my son is so tall and slim and this is one of the only places I can find his size .
 Great basic jeans in hard to find sizes . Not much to say otherwise . They have washed up well and held up well for my long and lanky teen .
 Jeans are a little tight in the thighs for my husband . It did n't come with packing slip so I 'm hoping I can return them !
 I 've always wanted a ` black 527 ' but found out I could only get that in rigid black.I decided to try 517 n whao I might just decide to continue with 517 even with other colors.Just the perfect fit I love .
 Is exactly what i was looking for . . i being using this model for years , and this pair of pant are excellent
 I am a creature of habit . Being of slim build I have found the 517 Boot cut to be the perfect jean for me . I also know my size so the fit was great as received . This is not always the case when ordering over the Internet . Service was great delivered on time as expected .
 These are the best jeans Levis has to offer in my opinion . They are not light and flimsy like some jeans Levis are making these days . The medium stonewash is a great even color . They do n't look faded on the seat and thighs or dingly and dirty like so many jeans do . These jeans are rugged , comfortable and last a long , long time . On top of that they look great . These are the only jeans I will buy .
 These jeans are everything they say they are . We will definately order these jeans again when the time comes . Thanks !
 100 % recomended , i have no doubt that i am going to buy another , it is really regular fit and boot cut
 This is the only jean my husband wears . He has the hardest time finding 36x29 . This is a perfect fit for him . When he needs more I will return to amazon .
 I finally found a pear of jeans that my wife said they look good on me and after being washed still fits great
 Great fit for my long legs ! Hard to find jeans my size but Levi 's always comes through for me ! a
 I love these jeans . For me they are perfect . Long enough to wear with or without boots and the fit is not too tight . How can you go wrong with Levi 's ?
 I got what I ordered promptly . I wish I had ordered a different color but -- my bad . No complaints . What else can I say ?
 The jeans was just perfect , the material , size and colour , nothing to complain about , and great timing too.They fit really well , and amazon 's size chart was very helpfull .
 Style & size stayed true since the last time I bought a pair , after gettingLevi 's Men 's 527 Low Rise Boot Cut Jeanthat are nothing like they used to be that 's all a shopper can ask .
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut . Black 42 waist / 30 length . If you are short , stocky and have a big butt . These pants are perfect . They wo n't bunch up at your fat knees and they will last a long time before the zipper explodes . I suggest you buy the next size up because they will shrink after 6 months of washing , drying and severe stretching in the seat area . Great pants .
 MY FAVORITE JEANS FOR 25 YEARS . I HAVE WORN MAINLY 501 MODEL , SO I READ MANY REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING THESE 517 JEANS.AFTER THINKING FOR A LONG TIME I DECIDED TO BUY ONE SIZE BIGGER THAN USUAL . IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE.THEY ARE JUST FINE , BLACK COLOR AND ZIPPER FLY WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DETAIL FOR ME !
 My husband 's body type includes slight pot belly and skinny hips and thighs . Almost impossible to find pants that fit well without being either too tight in the belly or looking baggy in the seat and thighs . He used to wear Levi 's Action Jeans which were boot cut jeans with slight stretch in fabric and a slight crease in the legs . These jeans always looked and fit great ; real snappy . Unfortunately they 're no longer available . Then went to wearing David Taylor Flexjeans from Sears which were almost as good . However , he now find that although Sears still sells jeans by this name , they are no longer the same . They are now made in China and are made from a crappy fabric and no longer fit the same . In desperation , he started looking thru available Levis products and found Levi 's 517 . Advertised as slim in seat and thighs . He did not expect much but was pleasantly surprised to find that they are indeed somewhat slim in the seat and thighs , even though the pants he bought had a waist size slightly larger than minimally necessary , thankfully allowing him to breathe . Bottom line was that he was very happy that these pants are not so tight in the waist that its hard to breathe , but still slim enough in the seat and thighs that they do n't look like old man 's jeans . Just wish they had the snappy look of the old Levi 's Action Jeans .
 I bought a pair of these in 29X34 and they are great . Fit perfect , really like the cut , lighter weight material but not too light , should hold up well . Just wish they would reduce the size of the internal tag -- I 've actually had to tuck it back into the pants a few times after putting them on !
 My body was made for Levi 's brand jeans , and I 'd worn through a couple of pairs . I bought duplicate black 517s - soft but not washed out , dark , with a predictable fit . They are my new favorites . The process went smoothly . Who knew I 'd be buying clothes online ?
 I ordered these for Christmas for my 6 ' 2 '' grandson who had grown out of all his pants after checking stores and finding his size is almost impossible to find . They were perfect and he loved them .
 The Levi 's 517 Boot Cut were purchused as a replacement of the wrong ones bought at a local store , These ordered & delivered ; I was told fit greatly before & after ; washThe price for my buying , totaled out a nuff less even with shipping to come fromamazon , rather than a store , even on sale after my tax & shipping ; -LRB- as a late gift -RRB- Theonly guestion I got was about , they did not have the Levi 's cardboard shelf tagswe see on Jean 's in store .
 I love my levis . I was unaware they came in black . I bought a blue pair and black pair , Ilove them
 Just as described ! Fit & look exactly what he needed and wanted . And he said I could n't find this product ... LOLThanks !!! The Wife wrote the review ...
 These jeans fit great . The boot cut gives a good look without being sloppy . My husband looks hot in them .
 Got these as a gift for my brother , and they are the true blue classic with a great slim shape . Perfect `` date night '' jeans .
 These are the only jeans my husband will wear and we could not find them ANYWHERE . When i found them here i was happily suprised with the discount price and they look great . Would buy again from this seller .
 Excellent transaction on hard to find size and style Levi Jeans.Reasonable price and quick shipping.I 'm very pleased with this purchase !
 jeans were shipped quick , arrived in good shape the medium stonewash has that worn look most people want , I am pleased with the purchase .
 i got two pairs for my husband . levis are the only thing that fit him right . They make him look like he has a butt !
 I like this product because it fits very well and is comfortable . I recommend it to others . Good for those who like to wear boots .
 Finally found levis that were the correct size , if they are still available I will order more in the future
 Great pants . I wish there was a size 33 by 35 . I always have a hard time with pants size . I can get a length 34 , which shrink after a wash or a 36 that drags because there too long . But there is no length 35 in pants , so I do n't have much of choice .
 Excellent product the product I come very well and it is what was waiting of , I come in time , good
 I bought they for my boyfriend who had lost a bit of weight and all his pants were falling down , but these fit and stay up -LRB- Thank God -RRB-
 My husband loves the fit and the price.Great deal.You can dress them up or down!Look no further.Great looking jean , for the price .
 Bought these jeans for my husband . They fit very well and look nice . The shipment arrived on time . I was happy with my purchase .
 Great black on black bootcut jeans . They have even gone back to adding two additional belt loops a feature that went away several years ago .
 Fits well , my husband loves them , quality control met , consistent sizing , and look good on . Will order more as needed
 My son wears a 36 Waist x 36 lenght which is very hard to find . The Levi 's Men 's 517 are about the only jeans he likes and these fit him perfectly . They were shipped very quickly and the price was excellent . They were a birthday gift and he loves them .
 The jeans were pre washed and fit just like I wanted . They were really softer than I expected . I would buy this product again .
 I was so happy with the quality and fit ; I ordered 3 more pairs ! I will be good on jeans for awhile . The price was good too .
 Great quality and a lower price , for me is like a tailored jean , I 'm happy with this product . No more to say thanks to all
 After numerous failed attempts at the 527 's on amazon I finally got a clue and got these jeans . They are PERFECT ... great fit ... weight ... etc. ... just like the jeans I wore in high school 20 years ago ... . I 'm already thinking about a second pair . The light rancher is the perfect color ... . As for the 527 's MADE IN BANGLADESH ... amazing they could ever bear the levis name ... perhaps they were counterfeit . Thanks amazon for my true and needed exchange . The original pair of jeans I ordered ... yes the 527 ... was complete trash . These 517 's are real jeans for real cowboys ... and I 'm not one ... but I do wear a ton of boots ...
 Exellent product
 I bought this scarf to cover a recent surgery scar on my upper neck.The scarf covers perfectly when tied in a knot on opposite side of scar.The black is jet black which I wanted .
 Perfect size to tie around the neck and pair with a nice work shirt . Color is very elegant . Fabric of good quality .
 I ordered seven of the 30x30 scarves . Not one of them was 30x30 . I measured each one . I had everything from 29x29 , 29.75 x30 to 29.75 x29 .75 so I am glad I went with the larger scarf . One scarf had a hole in it but I did not notice it until I went to use it . It is small but I was past the exchange date when I found it so I have one scarf with a small hole . The scarves are soft , shiny and very comfortable . I highly recommend going over the scarf more carefully upon arrival than I did so you can take advantage of the exchange policy if needed .
 This vibrant red scarf is 100 % polyester , but with the folds ironed out , it looks like a satin material . The quality of the scarf and of Wolfmark neckwear as a company I recommend . The 30 X 30 size is what works best for me , as I am able to tie it in many ways and to wear it with different looks . I found a very nice website tutorial that shows 21 different ways to tie a scarf . The 30 X 30 is probably the size to work best in trying all 21 . There is a black , sleeveless tank I wear that this with tied in cravat fashion . It 's also large enough to wear as a bandeau , not to mention how pretty it is as a standard wispy wrap for my neck . Thank you , Wolfmark !
 Great scarf ! I searched the web high and low before I came across this scarf
 Nice quality scarf . I can tell it will last a long time and it feels great . I got it in white , but if I needed another solid scarf to match a different outfit , I 'd get this brand . I like scarves and I 'm happy to confirm that I do n't have to spend $ 40 in a department store to get a good one .
 I love my new scarf . The item arrived as detailed and much sooner than I thought it would . The color is beautiful and I will surely order from this vendor again .
 I got this to use as part of a Fred -LRB- from Scooby Doo -RRB- costume . It 's fabulous . I think it 's worth the money regardless of the circumstance you 're planning for it .
 I was extremely satisfied with this product . The scarf has good texture . It shipped nicely . I ll buy more .
 These T shirts are the best around , I 'm serious , they are very strong and very soft . A couple friends of mine work in the silkscreening business and told me that the `` Hanes Beefy T '' was THE best out there , so I ordered 6 of them on their advice . I 've never seen T shirts this nice , they are the most comfortable , strongest , and they feel like they will last forever . I 'm so happy with these shirts , they are awesome .
 Black , Fitted , Simple Logo - no weird colors or patterns - its the real deal-my favorite Eagles hat ... worth every cent .

 These are great t-shirts and my boys love them . They are active in sports and there is nothing better than having these shirts to wear . They take the wear and tear and come back for more ! I highly recommend them !

 I bought this bag to use with my iPad , and to allow me to carry other `` stuff '' -LRB- pens , gum , etc. -RRB- . This bag is perfect for this type of stuff , and really fits exactly what I was looking for . I wanted a bag that I could carry whether I 'm wearing a suit or shorts , and the black canvas exterior is versatile in this regards . I also wanted a bag that does n't have the appearance of a typical computer bag -- you know the kind that scream , `` Hey , I 'm carrying an expensive computer here ! `` The bag has versatile pockets that allow me to carry many different things , yet has a good weight to it . I like the metal clasp on the front , and I like the fact that the shoulder strap is detachable . The canvas is a good , sturdy weight , and so far , I 've not had any difficulty keeping it clean . I 've also not noticed any smell with my bag , as a previous reviewer reported.Overall , it 's a good bag that exactly fit my need . I would recommend it to others .
 I like this bag a lot but two flaws . 1 . Its quite heavy . Not for the small . 2 . The clasp for the flap is n't easy to lock . Beside that its great .
 I bought a smaller bag for school , but the size and weight of some of my books forced me to find a larger bag for heavier class days . This bag works so well for what I am using it for . Books , notebooks , and laptop fit nicely , and pens , pencils , calculator , phone and charger all have their place . The bag itself is a little heavy , but for short distance walking it is n't a problem . It is well made with durable materials , which is the reason it is a little heavy . Definitely recommend this as an alternative to poor quality , expensive backpacks .
 I love it . It 's my go bag . My work bag and a lot of other things . I get a lot of questions about it . I tell them the same thing
 Great quality product for the price . Rigid/robust feel , plenty of storage . I was pleasantly surprised to notice the siding in the `` laptop '' main compartment is foam lined .
 My boyfriend loves this bag - the only issue we ran into is that there was a magnetic tag in it that kept setting off shoplifting alarms when we were out and about . Make sure you look for it , and take it out before you start using the bag - otherwise , great !
 This bag is everything the description described . The only down part is the strap does n't really have any padding and it ca n't really be adjusted for length
 I had to cut the eye holes bigger . I also cut the teeth off cause I could n't drink with it and when I smiled the teeth hit my lip . but other than that great mask .
 My son wanted to be a zombie clown for Halloween . He is 11 and very specific that everything has to be `` comfortable '' This maske , with a clown wig , fit the bill perfectly . Looks great !!!!! Scary !!!!! -LRB- is there anything more scary than clowns ... -RRB- And you can breathe easily and comfortably .
 Not sure what the other reviewer was expecting , but the mask looks exactly as it is pictured and was a great price compared to others I had looked at . Quality seems to be okay and the shipping was super fast . The other review put me off a bit , but I went ahead and ordered and am glad I did !

 Got these for my runner husband . They keep him cool and wick the sweat away and are comfortable and yet lightweight .
 These socks are amazing . Whether it be while wearing my Vibrams , or just with a regular sneaker , they are warm yet still breathable , and super comfortable . I 'll grab these before I grab a regular pair of socks any day .
 They say that you do n't have to wear socks with vibrams however I do NOT recommend it , you only get a few days use and they start to stink . These socks extend the use before having to wash the shoes . They are comfortable , and watch out on linoleum or other smooth surface because you will be doing a Tom Cruise slide if you do n't pay attention . Extrememly comfortable and they seem very durable I have had a pair for about 7 or 8 months and wear them quite frequently.If you are military tho you can actually get a better deal at a Navy Exchange , a few dollars off and you get them without having to wait . Found this out AFTER we order them lol
 They are just like any other toe socks in my opinion . Worked great and I bought at a good price !
 Walked 39 miles this past weekend for the Avonwalk for Breastcancer . I fought blisters throughout my training until I purchased these socks - I now have 4 pair ! No blisters after 39 miles !
 Ok , i bought it for me but fail on the size so igive it to her and she like it
 i got those stupid shoes with the toes and they hurt me like hell but these were the only socks that worked with it . the socks are great but i 'm not a fan of the separated toes .
 When I first hit these it was rather difficult fitting all my toes in at first but became progressively easier after third time , its true to size also I 'm 6 ' 2 so when it says big and tall definitely , I have more wiggle room in my pinky toe in my Harlem Knights voice above all else get them they work well with the addidas toe shoe when working out . You heard it again from Chiro Doc !
 These are cool and pretty comfortable and work well protecting each toe but they take a little getting used to because the seams basically trace your toes , they go between each toe and across the tips and feel a little weird at first .
 I was supprised how much better my feet feel in these socks , even without wearing my Vibram Five Fingers . The socks are fine .
 These socks are thin -LRB- as many reviewers have pointed out -RRB- but the material is soft and the ankle is not constricted . I bought them to wear playing golf -LRB- hot summers = blisters b/w the toes -RRB- and thought they would help with the rubbing . They do that very well . I was concerned about the lack of cushion on the bottom , but the support offered by my golf shoes was adequate . They are uni-sex sized so if you are a Female , order a size lower . They are a bit big .
 bought these for my fiance . he loves them . though his shoe size is on the outer edge of the size indicator so they * just * fit . overall he 's quite satisfied with the quality . this winter he 's even been wearing them as a liner under regular socks when he 's not wearing his toeshoes !
 I bought these socks to use doing mud runs/obstacle course races . I know the socks I wear doing these event take an extreme beating . The Injinji socks held up excellently for the 10 mile course . The added bonus over other socks is that they kept my toes separated in all the mud , water obstacles , and rain . Although I do run in toe-shoes , I use standard athletic shoes , I will not run a race with another pair of socks again !
 Bought these originally to wear with Vibram FiveFingers shoes , and they work great for that . Since then I 've stopped wearing Vibrams and now just wearing some different running shoes ... but I continue to wear my Injinjis ! I feel like I have that tiny extra bit of connection to the road , and let 's face it ... they 're fun to wear.I love the Micro ones ... nice ankle length . Long enough to stick up over the top of my running shoes , but not too long so that you look like a dork .
 After every race I had a bruised first toe , due to my socks wrapping around the toe and cutting off circulation . The Injinji socks stopped the problem ! No more embarrassing bruised toe after a run !
 I buy these socks for my husband who wears three different pairs of Vibrams for work , the gym , or just every day wear . They help keep the shoes and his feet fresh and are a perfect fit for any activity !
 I enjoy wearing my Vibrams and enjoy my increased joint heath with them . Though , the smell of them was becoming unbearable especially when I sweat in them . I tried washing them in the laundry and hand-washing , I even tried foot powder but they were just getting dirtier . So I decided to buy these socks and now I do n't have problems with sweat or the smell anymore . I wear the largest size Vibram Bikilas carried for women , and these still fit comfortably with the socks .
 I am wearing with minamalist shoes and they feel great . fit around each toe great . I wear them all day .
 I bought these to hike with because I was getting blisters in between my toes . These really helped by keeping my toes off each other . I have recently bought Vibram barefoot runners and was getting a little chaffing at 1.5 miles . I added these socks and did 5 miles with zero issue .
 Perfect ! These socks are great . They are my first pairs of toe socks . I use them for running and biking and love the feeling of having each toe being housed in its own little glove . My toes do n't rub together painfully when I run and I 've had zero issues with the moist yucky toe feeling I 'd get after running 3-4 miles in regular socks . I was worried the feeling of individual toes would be weird , but it 's actually incredible feeling . . I can see now that I 'm going to have to invest in updating my entire sock drawer .
 I love running in Vibrams , but I almost always finish my long runs with blister pain . These socks have ended that , at no expense ! Some people have commented that they leave extra material hanging off the ends or their smaller toes - this is true for me . However , you can just bunch them up a bit so they fit snug and then there is no problem . Great quality , and the best price I was a able to find .
 Just used these on a half marathon with my vibram KSO 's and they worked really well , gave just enough additional comfort for the long run . There is already some wear on the bottom of the socks so I can only hope injinji come out with higher quality socks . In the meantime , I will probably buy additional pairs .
 I love to hike and walk during every season except winter when I get to ski instead . When spring rolls around I start walking and hiking again but go through periods of toes blistering and healing . These socks have solved that problem . My feet are able to get back in condition while not blistering . I will probably start wearing socks like this all the time . Love them !
 They deliver - exactly what I wanted
 I will be purchasing more.These are very confortable and keep my toes from getting blisters on long runs.These socks also make a great conversation peice.I think the quality of these socks is better then most normal socks .
 I do n't know if I like toe socks but if i did , I would like these ones . They are light , thin , soft and comfortable .
 My Five Finger KSOs were a tad bit too big , and these socks helped to fill the gap . They fit perfectly , and feel great between your toes . With the KSOs on , my wife and I walk our dogs without the slightest discomfort now .
 i bought these socks at first because they looked funny and was curious so i thought i would give it a try . It did take some time to get used to having my toes being separated , but after a while , i do n't even want to take them off . It did get kind of embarrassing when i take my shoes off in front of people though . but overall , i do like these socks .
 I wear them with my five fingers kso 's and my newbalance trail runners . These socks are great .
 These are great socks for running . I get bad blisters and did n't know enough to figure out why . Stop running in cotton ! Toe socks freak me out , they look weird . I still love these socks , even if it takes me a second longer to put them on.They stop the blisters . The first pair I purchased -LRB- medium -RRB- was a bit smaller than these -LRB- medium again -RRB- , not sure why but I needed the little extra so it 's perfect now . They are lightweight , so when I hand-wash them after a daily run , they are dry and ready to go by next morning
 Been a long time runner , marathons , short races . After reading about these socks for years finally decided to try them . I was concerned they might feel weird . However , found the socks are comfortable , cool , and I do n't notice and discomfort . Each toe has its own sleeve , like wearing and glove on your feet . This has cut down on any rubbing of toes against each other . I will be purchasing more of these socks soon .
 imagine a glove ... but for your feet . that 's pretty much it . not much more to say than that .
 Really comfortable . Bought the smallest size and with a little shifting and adjustment , they fit fine . I am scheduled for foot surgery between toes and the separation and bit of padding these socks offer really help . I wore them on a hike and on the treadmill and they reduced the foot pain intensity & allowed me to extend my time . I plan to purchase additional pairs .
 Originally I bought these socks to go with my vibram 's as socks are required for us . They work great I was a little worried they would take away from the shoes and make them uncomfortable . However , I do n't even notice that I am wearing them . I had no intention of wearing the socks with my normal running shoes but on a few occasions I had no choice . Now they are the only socks that I will wear when I am working out . I would recommend these to anyone . They keep my feet cooler and have decreased any hotspots that I get while running .
 These socks are perfect for use with the fibrams or the mupuk five finger shoes . Takes some getting used to but feels great once you do . Highly recomended . Only wish they made a lower cut for this sock .
 I bought these socks originally to use with my vibram five finger shoes , and I do use them for that , but I also used them on my runs with regular running sneaks . I really like them .
 Great Socks , Toed obviously . I used them for my Vibram Five Finger 's My only complaint is that they are n't lower . I 'd prefer them to pretty much match the KSO height -LRB- so they would n't come up farther than the KSO Five Fingers -RRB-
 I love these socks ! Since I have bought them I have not taken them off . You may get strange looks but the comfort you feel in these socks will over compensate the looks .
 I 'm hardly an avid runner , so I ca n't comment from that end , but for me ? These socks are worth every penny . I have wider feet with flat arches , meaning most of my exercise shoes are stability-based and lack the amazing ventilation I 'd love them to have ... which makes for very warm , sweaty feet , VERY VERY fast . I Zumba a few times a week and we also walk about 1-2 hours a night , and my warm feet were getting so blistered from rubbing toes that it was preventing me from going at all . My husband suggested trying these and I was a little worried they 'd be thick -LRB- even though it says CoolMax -RRB- , so I also bought another brand -LRB- which was awful -RRB- . The result ? They have literally SAVED my workouts . I can walk for hours or Zumba like a dork and my feet , no matter how sweaty , do n't rub or chaff , which lets me be injury-free for the next day!I am the type who grumbles about paying $ 7 for a pack of socks , so shelling out $ 12 for a single pair was NOT ideal to me ... but I love them so much , I just order two more pairs . That says something ! ; -RRB-
 Just when I thought it was supremely comfortable to barefoot my FILA Skeletoes or my Vibram FiveFingers Komodo Sport `` Toes Shoes '' -LRB- please do n't cancel my man-card -RRB- I got these beauties . WOW is all I can say . I have other brands of socks but nothing compares to the feel and fit of these Injinji 's . They wic away the moisture and stay in place . They maintain their shape through washings but mostly just feel good enough for a cigarette after you wear them with whatever minimalism shoes you have . My big Fred Flinstones 13 's fit these like a glove !
 First , the sizing was confusing , so I went to the injinji website to try to figure it out . I ordered medium and I wear a women 's size 11 -LRB- men 's size 9 -RRB- so bear in mind when ordering . That said , these are very very comfortable socks ! They felt odd when I first put them on , but once I got used to the sensation , I absolutely love them ! I am planning on transitioning to a minimal running shoe , and am confident these will help the transition .
 I bought these socks to help my from rubbing on the bottom of my Vibram Five Finger shoes because I was getting a big blister under my big toe . These socks are true to fit -LRB- I 'm a women 's 7 and I bought the small and they 're perfect -RRB- and keep my feet in place in my shoes and no more blister ! They dont make my KSO 's too tight either , I think they 're actually more comfortable with the socks now !
 I really like these socks . I used these socks during a rainy trail run . I knew my feet would be wet running through the creeks but it was also going to raining during the run . I was looking for something to prevent blisters on my toes from all the moisture . I did n't get any blisters on my toes during the race . I ended up buying 4 more pairs . I love them for running . I have small feet so I had to get used to putting them on ; I have plenty of extra room at the little toes in the socks but I have never had a problem with my toes slipping out or becoming uncomfortable . I would recommend these socks . They are not thick so I just wear another sock over them for the cold months.I used the free super saver shipping , and they still arrived with a week .
 These.socks are great . I wear them hiking and they keep your toes from rubbing . They are also great to wear for golf .
 I won a pair of these as prize at a race I did last summer and fell in love with them . Seems like I have WAY less foot fatigue after a long run and zero worry of blisters . I would have never spent this kind of money on socks before but now I am TOTALLY hooked . Best thing ever and totally worth the cost especially when you buy them on Amazon -LRB- way cheaper than any other place I have found . -RRB-
 At first the socks feel a bit constricting but after 5 minutes you ca n't feel them at all . I just ran 5 miles and had no blisters or sore toes for the first time . I am buying two more pairs now : -RRB-
 I got these so that I could run in my Bikilas without running a risk of getting blisters . As it turns out , these are also great for holding band-aids in place when certain numbskulls -- namely me -- walk barefoot on a wooden dock and end up having to dig splinters out of my toes.These are very comfortable once you get used to them , and I will be ordering more .
 I wear these with my vibrams and love them - have never gotten a blister . I 've also used them in a bunch of races , as much as 100 miles , and had great luck . However , if you 're doing a race that 's going to be really wet or have stream crossings , I would recommend getting one of the higher cut ones since the lowest cut one can fall down when it gets really wet , which is annoying and makes heel blisters more likely .
 I got these to wear with my Vibram shoes and they are great socks . I accidentally ordered small and thought I would have to send them back but they actually feel better when they are a bit tighter , especially if you are wearing them with shoes . I would say try one size smaller than you think you need.Also , much like Vibram shoes your toes will need to be in descending order for these socks to work for you .
 I bought these socks primarily b/c I recently purchased the Fila Skele-toes . These socks fit great with them . It takes a tad longer than putting on regular socks but that is expected .
 I bought these socks for two reasons - one have a pair of Vibram shoes that I wear for working out in and also I 've been having horrible blister development as I 've increased my workout time . They work great with my Vibrams as extra protection from shoe rub . But I also wear them with another pair of thin socks when I wear my regular tennis shoes and have found that they really protect me from `` between the toes '' blisters.So far they have held up well , but I do n't know if the quality of the material is much different from other `` toe '' socks that are less expensive . They are a bit pricey , I feel . And if I found a less expensive alternative , I would probably purchase them before I shelled out this price again .
 Great quality sock . Works well with the Vibram 5-fingers . I wore these for my BQ marathon and no blisters!I wore the thin injinji sock and another thin regular sock over it . -LRB- The double sock idea to prevent blisters is from an Ultra-marathoner friend -RRB- .
 I bought these to wear with my Vibrant Treks but ended up wearing them as my every day socks . They 're the most comfortable socks ever !
 I own 3 pairs of Vibrams and I love them even more , when I wear the toe socks with them .
 I have only had these for a short time , but after a few hours of wearing them to get used to the extra material , I am really enjoying them . I use these socks not only when running , but for basketball and tennis too . Works great so far , and I am going to buy more of them .
 These socks are awesome . I completed a 47 mile walk and they kept my feet dry . I did n't get any blisters and I attribute that to the socks keeping my toes separated . They are well worth it . I did try wearing them with my Vibram five fingers and the socks made them feel a little snug . Overall , the socks are great !
 I only bought this socks because of a requirement to wear socks in our physical training uniforms . So these socks allowed me to wear my five finger shoes during required PT . What I found was that I actually felt more comfortable in the Five Finger shoes with this sock than I did without them . They add just a slight amount of cushion but little bulk . I had worried at first they may bunch or cause trouble in the toe pockets but that was not the case . They also do a good job of absorbing sweat and water during longer workouts or when wearing Five Fingers during inclement weather . All and all I am quite pleased with these socks and plan to add a few more pairs to the drawer .
 The Injinji Toesock is a great addition to the Vibram Bikila Five finger running shoe . I had happily run in the Bikila for several months without socks before developing some chafing high up on my instep . The seam there became rough after several washings . I tried the Toesock and the problem was solved immediately . I was concerned that the Toesock would bunch up and cause problems because the Bikilas literally fit like a glove without socks . But , the Injinji Toesocks did not significantly change the fit of the shoe and actually added a level of comfort . I run early mornings before work and if the ground is particularly cold , that cold comes right through the thin sole and numbs my toes . Now with the Toesocks , there is just enough insulation to ward off the cold . If you run with the barefoot style shoes , I highly recommend the Injinji Toesocks . They will enhance your barefoot running experience .
 I ordered two different kinds of toesocks from Injinji . I got a mini-crew pair and these mico toesocks . I wanted to try the different styles and weights . What I did n't expect was the difference in size . These were much smaller . They are supposed to fit women 's shoe sizes 6 to 8 1/2 . I am a 6 1/2 and I can barely make them fit . Someone who is a size 8 could never wear them.I am happy with them ; they do what I wanted them to do -- prevent pinch blisters on my toes .
 I bought these after getting bad blisters while playing sports . I intended to use them as inner socks , to wear over the calf socks over these , as blister protection . Problem solved . Quality socks ! The individual toe holes take some getting used to though !
 First time purchase of any sock/shoe of this kind and certainly not my last ! I feel great when I wear them and it improves my performance when running . Customer for life !
 I bought these for my husband who owns a pair of Fila 4 Toe shoes . These are the only type of socks that will fit inside . I have purchased Injinji Performance Toesocks previously and found them to be durable and well made . They are a bit pricey per pair but pairing them up with 4 or 5 toe shoes does not create a lot of choices .
 I absolutely love these socks ! They are very comfortable and just what I was looking for to keep my toes from rubbing together while running . They were delivered on time and were in perfect condition .
 These are my preferred running and hiking socks ... the best I 've found for preventing blisters . They 're not padded so I do n't care for them when I 'm going to be just standing a lot , like I do at work . But when running , I prefer blister prevention over sock padding .
 I use these with my vibrum five fingers . They fit great and cut down on the blisters that I got from first wearing the five fingers .
 Really did n't need the socks for my Vibram Bikilas . Gave it a shot . Pefect fit and comfortable . No regrets . Got a few extra pairs .
 I was nervous about these socks at first , but I have to admit they are phenomenal . I run 4-5 days a week 3-6 miles at a time and these socks have changed my focus and energy level . Highly recommend !
 best socks i have purchased , the price is high but well worth it . this company makes a great product you will not be dissapointed . goes great with the vibrant shoes
 I wear these type socks and footlets for relief from one toe that has started going under the toe next to it . On my feet for hours and it gets painful . These are well made , keep toes straight -LRB- like when I was younger -RRB- and keep me going painfree . I wish this company made this style , little footlets that do n't show with dress shoes .
 Highly recommended . These are Best kind of socks to get for your toed shoes . Good quality . I use them for working out mainly
 If you 're running in Vibram 5Finger shoes I believe these are absolutely required , especially if you will be trail running -LRB- re
 I got these socks to wear with my Vibram KSO Trek shoes . So far , I have found that it is a good fit and its comfortable . I just hope that it will stand the test of time . I will have to update this review in a few months .
 Good Product . Turned out just as described on the site . Would recommend it to everyone . I think its a little overpriced . Similar products available at much lower rates .
 I am a blister prone Marathon runner and spent years looking for the right sock - INJINJI is it ! In the 4 years I have been wearing these socks I have run 4 Marathons , and dozens of 5K and 10K races and I 've gotten exactly zero blisters . I wo n't wear any other sock .
 Bought these for my son who wears those toe shoes
 These are not bad , it 's a little different putting them on , but once you get use to it , not really a problem at all . I run in the merrell barefoot shoe and these are perfect for these type of shoes !!!
 Very comfortableEasy to wear & washUsed with my vibram fivefinger shoes for a run . Keeps dirt and sand out & protects ankles from chaffing
 I guess they performed well for my son . He used these with toe shoes in a `` Tough Mudder '' event . Unfortunately he lost one of the four socks he had for this event . It '' s not only tough on your body but tough on your clothes as well . He finished the event , and I 'm proud of him for this .
 I have severe hammer toes . These socks keep my toenails from digging into toes . Great for preventing blisters and great conversation starters . Highly recommend !
 They fit great inside my FiveFingers . They keep my shoes clean and I think it makes the shoes a little easier to put on . The socks , however , do take a little finesse to get the toes to fit right . The socks feel great and stay where they 're supposed to .
 I bought these socks to go inside my Vibrams Five Fingers Bikila LS , and they work perfectly . Do not take up too much toe space or room in the shoe . I normally wear a Women 's 8.5 -LRB- US -RRB- and I wear a 40 Womens -LRB- EU -RRB- in Vibrams . I ordered a medium because I did n't think a small would fit even though the range went up to 8.5 . The mediums fit very well and are shaped so well I feel like they were made for my feet . The heel is even stitched in such a way that you can see where your heel would go when you are not wearing them . I find these very comfortable when I have my Vibrams on , but a little weird to wear by themselves . Also , when I first tried them on out of the box I had an allergic reaction to some detergent or starch in the sock but after washing them and hanging them to dry I had no problems . So I would suggest to wash before wearing the first time -LRB- assuming they fit -RRB- . The instructions say to hang dry , and I could see how drying these socks would make the toes not fit anymore . Would definitely recommend to anyone in need of toe socks . Also the height of the sock is as shown in the images , just above the ankle bone .
 These socks work good with Vibram Five Fingers . They are a little snug . Good product to help keep feet warmer in cold whether .
 There is some extra cloth on the little toe and I notice it when I am putting the Vibram Five Finger shoes on but after a minute of wear it feels normal . An obvious tip
 Okay so I bought these because I bought a pair of Vibram shoes . The socks are great but have some major drawbacks when not used with the Vibram shoes.First of all , these socks are supposed to cool your feet . You will have to get used to this feature because it will feel as if your foot was numbed the first couple of times you wear the socks . This happens mostly when wearing the socks without my Vibrams on . Because of this , I can never wear these socks without wearing shoes . The other major issue is that I can not wear these socks with any other shoes except my Vibrams . Since traditional socks consist of one dome of material over your foot there is minimal cluttering of material . This sock obviously covers the toes so there are layers of sock between your toes . When wearing these socks with traditional shoes , I feel as if my toes are squished together due to that extra material in between my toes . This might be a personal issue though because I do have wide feet and I tend to buy wide shoes.In my personal opinion , I can safely say that these socks work more than fine in my Vibrams but are a disaster for me in any other situation . I 'm giving it four stars because they work for what I expected but lack versatility . I never expected to use them for anything else , though .
 injinji Micro Toesocks are very well made . The material seems to very comfortable . They stay in place , without slipping down in my shoes
 These socks do what they are supposed to do and thats it . Due to my wearing of Vibram Five Fingers I am required to wear socks with some of my work related activities and it was either these or cut off socks which tend to roll up . They product is good , they hold up well , breath well , and are very thin . The downside is they are stupidly expensive . I have recently purchasedadidas Men 's Climalite II 2-Pack Low Cut Sock , Shoe Size 6-12which can be cut off near the mid section and since they have an elastic type band in the middle they stay together better than regular cut off socks and do n't roll up as much .
 I purchased these for my son who wore his Skeletoes without socks the first time and said he needed socks . Odd coming from someone who loves to wear his sneakers without socks ... He is between a size 7 and 8 mens so I purchased the small -LRB- size 5-7 -RRB- . They are a little tight but I was afraid if I got the next size up they would be swimming on him . They fit fine and snug which is probably good since you do n't want a lot of extra fabric in these form fitting shoes.So far so good . They were comfortable for him to wear all day and when he first put his foot in the Skeletoes with the socks on he said , `` That 's so much better . `` We 'll see how they hold up with use and washing . I 'll come back and update after we 've used them for a number of months .
 could have been a 5 star but $ 12.00 for one pair of socks should be at least two in the pack anyways great sock for the new Filas Skele-Toes
 I love my Vibrams , mostly because I found these socks to wear with them . These socks are wonderful - truly , wonderful does n't even begin to cover how much I love these socks . I 've had issues with my toes rubbing against each other and blistering for years , but with these , all the moisture is wicked away , leaving me perfectly comfortable and blister-free . I wo n't leave home in my Vibrams without these socks on underneath them.The ultimate test for them was the time my husband and I both did two two-hour hikes in Mammoth Caves in Kentucky . I fully expected to be horribly uncomfortable for the entire day . Not only are caves chilly and wet -LRB- prime conditions for blistering to occur -RRB- , but due to me accidentally stepping right into a fire ant bed a day before I left to go on the trip , I also had several large and painful fire ant bites all over the top of my right foot . I had been looking forward to this trip for months , though , and I decided that , no matter what , I 'd make it through the hikes , even if it was painful and I had to walk slowly . I crossed my fingers and put on these socks under my Vibrams , hoping that they 'd protect me , but honestly not expecting too much . During the hikes , my feet felt great - I even forgot about the ant bites because they did n't hurt at all . After the hikes , my feet were blister-free -LRB- except for the ant bites -RRB- , and the ant bites were completely undisturbed and not irritated at all from having the sock over them . I was so relieved to not be in horrible pain , and I am convinced that I would n't have enjoyed that hike at all , had I not had these socks to protect my injured feet.Unfortunately , they are expensive , and it 's a pain having to fish them out of the wet laundry in my washer and hang them up to dry rather than just throwing them in the dryer with the rest of my laundry . In my opinion , I 'd rather pay a little more and go to a little bit of extra trouble to save myself the pain and discomfort of blisters .
 I have owned the vibram 5 finger KSO treks for about 10 months at this point and had reached a point where cold temps would not let me wear them anymore . I bought these socks in black to match my kso treks . These socks make all the difference for wearing vibram 5 fingers.They are very thin and will not cause any problems with wearing for a long time , and also even though the five fingers are a tight fit these socks are good to wear with them shoes .
 this product was a good buy and shiped fast and eficent . these socks fit well in my vibrams and they not only keep your feet cool but they also keep your feet warm , and because they dry fast when they get wet your feet stay warner . i walked through about 6 iches of snow in my vibrams and my feet didnt get cold . these also keep my vibrams from geting to smelly before you have to wash them , if you had several pairs you would never have to wash your vibrams . since i bought theses i have bought about 4 more pairs , one of then is their meduim thickness pair and they work even better to keep your feet warm than the thin ones . in the end i would recoment these socks to anyone with a pair of vibrams .
 I 'd never worn 5-toe socks before I splurged on a few pairs of these . They look great , are very comfortable and are every bit as durable as the best socks i 've tried . As you can imagine , they take a tad bit more effort to take on and pull off -- you ca n't yank them off like you can normal socks , but you get used to it . While I 'm sure mostly runners use these socks , anyone who has to do a lot of walking will get benefit from these . They totally prevent your toes from rubbing making blisters and sore toes a distant memory . These are right up there with sliced bread . Just do n't try to eat them .
 The injinji toe socks are perfect for Vibram 5-finger shoes . The socks are thin , so they fit comfortably with the shoes . I 've also worn them when wearing more traditional shoes and they are comfortable . They wash well , keeping their shape and elasticity .
 because they have individual toes built in . At first I found them to be a little uncomfortable but after wearing over time these socks are very comfortable .
 This product makes the world of difference when running , in that it keeps your toes from rubbing against one another , which in turn helps them from not getting raw & itchy . Highly recommend this product !
 So far the socks are fine and seem to be working . takes time to put them on and get them on the right toes .
 Bought two sets for my Iraqi mission , Well stiched and comfortable . Highly recommended and price is affortable . You 're toes will thank you for it : -RRB-
 Bought these socks for my husband and son who wear vibrums . Keeps their feet cool and reduces odor build up in vibrums .
 I read many reviews on this product and it has many good reviews . I order a pair to try it out . Yes !!! No lie it 's really comfortable . I took it on my camping trip and fell in love with it . Really comfortable . I am planning to bring this on my next vacation . I think it will work great with all that walking .
 Not too hot and just the right fit , i ordered 10 pairs . 5 white / 5 gray . Everywhere i take my shoes off people ask me where i got these - perfect for the new FiveFinger shoes !
 I love these socks !! It feels as if my toes are being individually massaged . I love the snug feel of them around my toes . I am not a runner so I ca n't speak to the issues they are looking for , but my feet are dry , cool , & comfortable all day in these . I will be buying more & more .
 I 'm able to get all my toes into all the toe slots of my KSOs with these socks . Additionally , they make a big difference in protection from sharp pea gravel . Yea , still feel them , but no sharp pains . I 'll be getting a back up pair .
 The price is on par with what you get here . Sure the socks are expensive , but I am using them only for my running training and I got to say for running they are spectacular . Super comfortable . They look stupid and you will mistake them for gloves , but they are amazing for running .
 I 've been wearing these socks for jogging and at work -LRB- I 'm on my feet all day -RRB- . My toes are thankful for the separation . I inherited pinky toes that like to curl under the next toe and these help eliminate friction damage . With these socks and good insoles , my feet and legs are not tired at the end of the day .
 Great socks but why do they have to cost so much ? Am I paying extra for the toes ? Helped keep my boyfriends feet warm on cold morning runs , so I 'm happy .
 These are the best for Vibram users . Highly recommend them . They do take a little getting used to at first and a little frustrating to put on the first couple of days but you get the hang of it very quickly .
 When I got my first pair I left them in my closet for a few months until I bought some Vibrams . When I took them out to wear them with my new shoes I found that one of them had a hole in the seem between the big toe and the toe next to it . I was very disappointed but I decided to get another pair to see if this was a quality issue or just happened to be a mistake . I got my second pair and I love to wear them . My feet get slightly chilly in the winter but these socks do keep them warmer than nothing and they work great with my Vibram KSOs . The ankle fit does look so attractive with the Vibrams but it keeps the ankle from developing blisters and helps with gunk build-up in the shoes .
 These would be 5 stars if they made the toes a little longer . I have size 11.5 feet , but I guess my toes are longer than most people 's so they do n't quite make it all the way down my big toe . Other than that they work very well . They keep my fivefinger shoes smell free .
 At first these socks are a bit snug , but after you wear them they streach to fit your foot , and dont shrink in the wash . They are perfect with tennis shoes or just around the house . I love the rubber on the bottom so you dont slip around on laminate/tiled/wood floors !
 I bought these socks for my Five Fingers , but ended up running a marathon in them . I was having bad blisters on the tops of my second and third toes after long runs -LRB- 15 + miles -RRB- and gave them a shot . For the marathon , I also sprayed some second skin -LRB- I forget the brand -RRB- but afterwards I had no blisters anywhere . Very happy with these socks . -LRB- As an aside , I also own the lightweight version of these . Great for Five Fingers , too loose for regular shoes . -RRB-
 I have n't been running long , saw these in a running magazine just had to try them!Now I need some more !
 I am a diabetic that has had toe complications , not lost any but have had to have surgery to help a diabetic ulcer heal.The socks are great , have only worn with my vibrams -LRB- komodo -RRB- . Very comfortable and fit great.I have size 12 feet , the chart says I should wear a large . . but took the advice I read in a couple of articles and ordered the size larger . Not disapointed so far ... some say that they had a bit extra toe lenght , but I have not had they issue they fit great.I would recommend to anyone , especially diabetics , who want a comfortable walk and support helping to keep healthy feet .
 They have made socks that allow me to grab objects with my toes AND stay warm ! The fact that they make them in stylish black with a minimalist logo and in sizes that fit my rather large feet make this a wonderful and fantastic innovation in undershoe garment technology previously only accessible to the youth . Brilliant !
 great socks , came fast fit well only 1 sock had logo tho . and a little pricey but i love them i wear them in my normal shoes too
 At first I hated these socks because I never wore toe socks and the only reason I bought them is because I bought me a pair of vibram toe shoes . After awhile I got use to it being between my toes and now I love them and are by far the most comfy socks , while second best . Asics are the best but these are better than any Nike socks .
 I typically get blisters between every toe when I walk . These socks have solved this problem 100 % ! Love them - I never wear my sneakers without them .
 These socks are so comfortable -- not too thick . I bought them for leisure and they are so comfortable . They appear to be made well with good , tight seams . I think the sizes tend to run small . I wear a size 10.5 to 11 women 's shoe size , but I ordered the large -LRB- 12 + -RRB- and they fit just right . I think the 9-11 size would have been too small . I plan on ordering more of these . They are really comfortable !
 These feel great and take practically no getting use to at all . Just wear them for a couple minutes , walk around , and your feet will naturally get comfortable with the sock . Try them out and see for yourself just how comfortable they are !
 These have been a source of interest to my family and friends . They think that these socks are pretty weird , but I do n't care because they do their job . They keep my toes dry . They 're not too thick or warm either . I 'll definitely be buying more and I would recommend them to my friends . I like these better than the crew socks . The toes are a little tighter than the crew socks , but that was n't a big deal .
 I bought these socks on a lark for my husband and myself . It is a truly weird feeling to have your toes separated from each other in this sock . Still , we enjoy wearing them on days when we know we will be walking around for most of the day . The separation really does cut down on blisters . Fair warning , my husband found these socks to run a bit small , so if you are at the top end of the size range , go for the next larger size .
 These were a little thinner than I expected for a ` performance sock ' ; they were about the thickness of a pair of average cotton dress socks . They were very comfy in the toes , but I usually wear something more padded for running , so they felt a little weird under the ball of my foot . My toes felt great after running in them - I have overlapping toes that can get crunched together and blistered.I would love to get a pair of these with extra cushioning just on the bottom . I do n't think the toe area could be much thicker and still work . A taller pair of these work work well as a liner sock inside hiking boots .
 I was looking for socks that were comfortable in my walking shoes since I am going on a walking tour of Italy . I 've been testing them out for the last 2 days and am very pleased with how they feel . I like the weight of the sock ; it adds a thin layer of comfort to my walking shoes . I was a little worried that the extra material around each toe would make my shoes feel too tight but they do n't , well except for around my big toe . That feels a little snug , but not uncomfortable . Putting on the socks works best if you line up your big toe and then put each toe in , one at a time . The only problem I had was with my little toe . It took just a little more finesse to get it in the sock . I must have an extra short little toe because all of the other toes fit the sock great , but there is extra length on the little toe . I ca n't really feel that in my shoe , though . The socks have not slipped down over my heels ; they are staying in place . I like these socks so much , I am getting another pair .
 The socks fit perfect . They fit into the barefoot shoe almost as if I did n't have them on . Made a huge difference in the friction between the shoe and my skin . They add just enough padding to make those 5K 's a little easier on the feet . I did n't have any trouble with the toes not being too short or being to long . I will definitely get another pair .
 I play a lot of tennis and have been suffering from friction pain on the bottoms of my feet while playingtennis . I have tried everything with no luck untilI found these socks . NO friction and no pain . Really wonderful . Their claims of no friction are really true .
 this sock is very light weighted , comfortable and easier to slip on then I thought . Perfect fit with my new Vibram , loving it !
 I love them and will probably never run in anything else again . Takes a very short time to get used to and then very comfortable and well worth the money . That all said , Amazon 's review process sucks .
 I am a fitness walker and during the summer when it 's hot outside , my last 2 toes get very bad blisters in them ... I purchased a pair of these socks and guess what ? No more blisters ! The socks arrived quickly and they are so comfortable : -RRB-
 I 've only used these once but they provide a lot more comfort than going bare with just my Vibram Fivefingers . My feet usually get sore after walking for too long but they 're able to take more impact as the socks provide some extra cushion . They fit well and look good with the Vibrams . I have n't tried to wash these yet but with a few people saying the washing machine rips them up , I 'll probably hand wash them just in case .
 This is a really good stuff . I 've worn it twice already for running . Bought it for an upcoming 10 miler . Had issues with other socks before for a race longer than 10k . I like this a LOT . I recommend it . I will be buying a few more soon .
 These socks are everything they say and more !! I bought the injinji Performance Original Weight Micro Toesocks , Black Medium . My shoe size is between a 10.5 and 11 and since that 's the difference in a med . and a large I went with the med . thinking I would rather them be tight than loose and they fit perfectly !! I work in a restaurant and I 'm on my feet all day these socks never slip down and stay dry and keep my feet at the perfect temperature ! The best thing about these socks are that they align my toes making my whole foot feel sooo much better at the end of the night !!! I highly recommend these socks for everyone !! and I will be throwing away all my other socks and buying more of these !
 These are great toe socks ! :-RRB- If you have any bunions , they are excellent . These socks separate your toes , properly . One of my feet has a bunion and these toe socks really highlight the difference & leaning that occurs w / a bunion , on the other toes -LRB- not good -RRB- . I have tried another kind of toe sock and not only were they not the same , they really hurt the foot and toes & caused extreme pain . The fabric was different & sizing ; whereas the Injinji brand - are a softer fabric and more `` giving '' for movement , or in my case - leaning that may occur ! A sure fit and perfect true to size fitting as well . : -RRB-
 This is the best pair of socks I 've ever worn . They are form fitting and they Go great with my Vibrams .
 The injiji toesocks are the best stocks to go along with Vibram shoes . The fit well and do not snuggle up .
 Male responder ; I have one toe -LRB- next to pinky toe -RRB- that likes to rest partially under the middle toe . After a day of walking around in normal socks the cuticle on the toe underneath is displaced and gets fairly tender . . These socks cure that problem completely . Very comfortable . This is first experience with toe socks - they are kind of a pain to put on but it 's worth it .
 I used to get a large blister between my two smallest toes on really long runs -LRB- 20 miles and over -RRB- . I tried Body Glide and Vaseline which helped , but they made a mess out of my socks . Then I tried a pair of Injinjis and the problem completely went away . Since the sock material wraps each toe , they move against each other with very little friction . I do n't even notice the feeling of the sock material between each toe , and I do n't feel like they stuff the toe box of my shoes either . If you have toe-blister problems , try a pair . The micro length comes up just above the cuff of my shoes , and is perfect for hot weather .
 They were a little higher on my leg than I like , so I gave them to my father and he loves them.He is a runner and they work perfectly for what he needs them for . I definantly recomend them to anyone who likes socks a little taller on your leg .
 this is exactly what it says it is , it came on time , and works great with my vibrims , but of course isnt required
 These socks were for my son , who runs lots of races . He was getting blisters on his toes , but with these socks , no more blisters . He wears them under high quality running shoes , and under minimalist shoes . He 's very happy with the socks .
 I used to make fun of people for wearing these , but now my feel feel free and avoid stinking from wearing no socks . Try them and be a converted believer .
 I love injinji socks ! They fit just right and are perfect for running in vibrams . I got the black ones instead of the white ones because they cover up stains better .
 These socks are awesome . I wear them with my vibram shoes , and they feel great ! Wish they were n't so expensive though .
 I recently purchased the Vibram five finger shoes and was reading online about the socks made for them . The socks fit good and made it easier toget use to the shoes during the break end period . They dont bunch up in the toe of the shoe like I thought they would . Keep up the good work .
 SO comfy ! These work great with my Vibram shoes . They are true to size , and fit perfectly -LRB- I 'm a size 7.5 women 's and I got a size small in the socks -RRB- . I would recommend these to anyone that is looking for comfortable alternatives to traditional socks , or for socks to go with their 5 finger Vibram shoes .
 Love these toe socks , you feel like you have more balance and control when wearing them even in regular athletic shoes . Will be buying more .
 Great product . Both my spouse and myself love them . Good fit , comfortable and do not work their way down into your shoes . Feet seem much cooler even after hours of wear . We have reordered additional pairs .
 These are my favorite socks , except for putting them on my feet . I have a serious case of hammer toe , so these ca n't just be pulled on ; you have to work each of the individual toes . Which is good if you 're in the process of papering your feet , or you need to warm your feet up a little bit in the morning . But they are fantastic as far as keeping your toes warm , they wick the sweat away quite well , and have thus far proved durable for someone who 's running around on concrete 8-10 hours five days a week .
 Most comfortable socks I 've ever worn for running . Considering buying more to wear all the time for everything . Love these !
 I specifically bough these for use with some Vibram Five Fingers shoes and now I wear them all the time . They are just the right thickness that they do n't mess up the feel of the Vibram shoes , very snug fitting . They wick moisture superbly and seem to wear well , we 'll see over time if the continue to hold up well . They are fairly expensive so it can be a tough purchase decision but , for me they were a good value .
 They fit grate , I ware a size 13 shoe and the large fits me grate . the toes streach a little bit . Ill put up some pics if i remember .
 I am an avid walker and 5K runner and have long had a problem with blisters between my toes . I have used bandaids , moleskin , vaseline , and chafing creams without much success . I have tried different shoes and different socks in various combinations . I bought a pair of the Vibram barefoot running shoes and love them ... no blisters ! But they are too thin to wear in the winter and not sturdy enough for hiking . These socks are perfect ! My toes are blister free , they actually keep my feet cooler , and they can be worn with any athletic shoe or even boots .
 This is a great sock for the Vibram running toe shoes . Definately recommend these ... they are thin enough so your feet do not burn up whil you have them on .
 I ran 13-15 miles in my regular socks and got one big blister . Since then , I bought these socks and have used them on all my long runs . So far , I 've ran up to 18 miles and no more blisters ! I plan to use these socks for an upcoming marathon . I still have the bruised toes , though . I run a lot and was hoping these socks would stop my toes from bruising too , but unfortunately , they have not . I have yet to find that magical item . I have changed shoe sizes , brands , socks , bandaids , etc. . Any ideas ?
 These socks are great . I bought them to wear with my Vibram Five Fingers . They are soft and fit nice and snug and do n't bunch up and the heel does n't ride down as I run . Great find !
 Great sock ! Better in my opinion than the color banded one as this one does n't have stitching on the inside of sock . Wish they were cheaper but I guess the labor to add 5 toes is considerably more .
 I enjoy doing charity walks , but suffer from blisters between the toes after the events . Doing some research online on blister prevention , one solution was to purchase toe socks . Most sites recommended the brand , Injinji . After purchasing these socks , I walked over 6 miles in them and did n't get any blisters , wearing the same running shoes that I normally wear . I usually develop them after 3 miles or so . They are truly a life saver . I plan to go hiking and will be looking into this brand again.This was my first toe sock purchase but definitely wo n't be my last .
 As mentioned in the title , overall , I like the socks . They 're comfortable and I have n't had any of the problems mentioned above about there being too much fabric on the toes . Maybe I just have big toes , but either way , they fit me well . They 're not quite seamless , but the seam that is there , is pretty much unnoticeable.The only problem I could say about them is that they 're pretty expensive . I really only bought them hoping that they came in a bundle . If there were three to a pack , I would probably replace all of my normal day-to-day socks with these . But at $ 10 a pair , I 'll stick to just using these as a personal treat . Probably wo n't buy again unless the price drops significantly .
 I agree with the other reviewers that these do n't work well with my Vibram KSO 's . The injinji liners work ok with the Vibrams but the performance micros are too thick.That said , I love the feel of these socks . They promote good toe separation and are very comfortable . I did a mud run in them and they held up well , prevented blisters , and wicked enough to not have my foot be a wet , shredded mess at the end.The one criticism is that they wear quickly . After only a few washes and light/casual usage around the house and on interval runs some of my socks are becoming thread bare around the midfoot and heel .
 I bought these socks along with a pair of 2010 Vibram Bikila toe shoes . The socks feel great and work well with the Vibrams . I have n't really put them through the paces since I mostly run without them , but they seem to be hardy enough for frequent use.One warning before buying
 These fit perfectly and have just the right amount of material around each toe to feel comfy . I am size 13-14 US and have rather wide feet , and these socks fit me fine . My Girlfriend wore a pair earlier and she says they fit her just fine , and her feet are significantly smaller than mine , so they have a great range of fit!I wear these when I wear my Vibram Five-Fingers KSO for Men ... Highly Recommended for use whit Vibram Products .
 The good - these socks do the trick in terms of helping toes discomfort I was having during the weekly long runs!The not so go - sizes are a little small , takes a little effort to get toes in .
 I really like my socks because they hold my toes straighter but wishthey were a little bit strong because my toes are so crocked that wouldhelp to walk better.Shirley
 If money did n't matter I 'd buy 50 pairs of these . Probably the most expensive running sock I 'll ever buy ... And my toes are a little too fat , but that is MY problem ... not the socks
 Not much to say about toe socks or socks in general . I bought a few of these and very much enjoy wearing them on long runs . Avoids toes beings squished and blisters . Takes a bit longer to put them on , but much recommended .
 I bought these as a gift for my husband , who runs about 20 miles a week . He says , `` they are very comfortable and doesnt even feel like you have socks on but no blisters . ''
 Great product and great response . the socks feels great with the Vibram Fivefinger shoes . I recommend this product for anyone even if you do n't have the shoes .
 Once you start using these socks you wo n't want to go back to regular socks . It takes a little getting use to putting them on .
 I got these socks mainly out of curiosity and also because I saw a lot of reviews from runners . I like to run but it 's mainly while playing games like basket ball or soccer etc. and I wanted a sock that did n't slip around in the shoe or get completely soaked after a while . I really like the feel of the socks and they seem to work as described . They really keep my feet warm and dry . I think they look cool and they shipped really fast and arrived earlier than estimated . Great product .
 I saw these socks on amazon and thought how slly they look.I read a review from a runner who said they were great . I decided to try some . Well I now have about 12 pair . I have always had corns between my toes that are very painful . since that first pair my feet feel better than ever.I never go anywhere without these on my feet.They can be a little hard to put on but worth the effort . I recommend to anyone with or without a problem .
 Injinji toe socks are great . I wear them with my vibram five finger running shoes . They are awsome .
 Currently , I 'm training for a marathon and have had a serious problem with blisters . I have been on the search for a solution to the enormous blisters that formed between my toes on long runs -LRB- 10 + miles -RRB- , and band-aids and tape just were n't cutting it . I figured with the five finger phenomena going on , I could find some sporty toe socks , which would cut down on the friction between toes . I came across these and have been very impressed . The difference between runs with and without these socks are like night and day . I no longer get large blood blisters between my toes . There are different thicknesses for these socks . I have tried both the original weight and light weight socks . They both serve a great purpose , but if you are looking for durability , I would go with the original weight socks . The orginal weight socks have held up well even on my 18 + mile days . The light weight version of these socks helped prevent blisters , but they got holes in them easily -LRB- on 5 mile and under days -RRB- . Overall , I am very impressed with the original weight version of these socks . I felt my money was very well spent to eliminate blisters from my running routine !
 I bought these before running my first marathon . I had been prepared for blisters on my foot , but I was n't ready for the amount of blistering I was getting between my toes on my long runs . Even bodyglide , vaseline , aquaphor , and moleskin were n't perfect solutions . The vaseline , aquaphor , and bodyglide wore of by 20 miles -LRB- I ended up having to add more at aid stations -RRB- . Moleskin is good for after the blister happens , but not for preventing them , so much . These socks prohibit the toes from rubbing together , so if they 're well fitted , they solve the problem.However , what I found is that initially , my feet were uncomfortable after wearing these for a bit . My toes would ache . I 'm not sure if that 's a result of me wearing heels too much and my toes getting used to being fairly crammed together , but it did take some breaking in for me to be able to wear these for extended periods . I wore them around the house and running errands for a few days , and that solved the problem . I have come to love these as an everyday sock , too.The microfiber is great ; I like these more than the regular injinji socks because of the breathability . They keep my toes cool and wick away moisture well . For me , these have been a toe-saver , so to speak !
 I have Vibram Five Fingers shoes and I loved running and walking around in them but I found that if I went on a run of any significant length I got blisters on my feet . These socks are the perfect answer ! They fit securely within the shoes and I do n't have any problems with circulation , tightness , or shoe fit . Best of all , I can go on long runs and not get any blisters or have any of the discomfort that I had before.As for quality , the socks are well constructed and easy to get on and off . I find them comfortable and so far they have shown good durability but I 've only been running in them for a couple months . I would highly recommend these , particularly to anyone using Vibram who has issues with blisters .
 The toesocks are wonderful ! Suffer from arthritis and sometimes it is very painful to walk . Received these socks from my children and what a difference ! I can walk freely now and suffer little pain . Wonderful fabric , easy to wash and just love them
 These socks not only fit perfectly with Vibram Fivefingers footwear , they also feel great , help eliminate footwear odor , and get lots of looks .
 Great Socks to run in and they do n't show too much with the vibram shoes .
 I 'm new to the idea of toe socks -LRB- purchased because I wanted to wear them with Vibram Five Fingers -RRB- but am quite taken with the idea . I would recommend them to everyone to wear with any kind of shoes .
 I recently developed bunions and I started looking for things to ease the pain . I noticed that my socks were often squeezing my toes together which caused more pain , particularly my workout socks . I bought 1 pair of these socks to try out and noticed an immediate difference . I 'm very pleased w/the quality of the socks . I get alot of friction when I work out in other socks because I have custom orthotics that build the inside of the shoe up which causes the back of my heel to slip . When I wear these socks , I do n't notice the friction at all . The fit is great , I love them . I 've already purchased several more pairs and plan to buy more for fall in the taller style for everyday use.side note
 This is the only running sock I can wear . No matter how short I clip my toenails , over time one toe will cut the neighboring toe . This is avoided with the Injinji . I wear them year-round and although they are a rather thin sock , my feet are warm enough . They are moisture wicking . It takes some practice getting them on . I make sure to pull them off -LRB- gently -RRB- by the toe for washing . They are not the most durable and I 've mended them at the crease and at the top of the big toe . Even with this , they are extremely comfortable and worth the money .
 I bought these socks on a whim because I just purchased a pair of Vibram FiveFinger Bikila LS toe shoes . Love the shoes , but I am not wearing these socks with them because the shoes are skin tight without the socks . I have ended up wearing my injinji 's with every other pair of shoes I own . I currently have 3 pairs of these socks and will be purchasing more very soon . I will never wear a regular pair of socks again . I am officially a toe-sock convert . They allow a greater range of motion and completely eliminate toe bunching caused by socks .
 I got my first pair of five toe running shoes and was unsure if I should get the socks , but after one run with the socks I knew I would never run without them again . I tried to run without the socks the first time I ran and the shoes rubbed my feet raw . Not only are the socks extremely comfortable and good protection from the inside of the shoes , they look cool too . I highly recommend them to anyone who plans to put a lot of miles in the five toe shoes . Also for my fellow Marines who are getting the five toe shoes , white socks are part of the P.T. uniform so you should get these and avoid your NCO having a reason to chew you out .
 my buddys talk about me when they come over and see them on my feet but I love them gotem on right now .
 The socks are exactly what you 'd expect . They fit very well , and are comfortable . I bought them to wear with my vibrams but they 're comfortable enough to wear with pretty much anything for pretty much anything .
 Love these ; makes wearing my Vibram Fivefingers much more comfortable . Only complaint I have is that they started pilling after just a few washes . Otherwise , they 're great .
 I love these socks and they are worth the money ! I do not get blisters anymore and they are comfortableand keep my feet happy and dry ! Worth the investment
 I 'm an avid runner and I have 8 different pairs of Injinji socks . The gray socks are the way to go because they will not fade like the black ones or stain like the white ones . I have not experienced any fitting problems -LRB- shoe size 10 , medium sock size -RRB- and my Injinji socks are my preferred socks for race day , even over my `` high performance '' pricier athletic socks . I own two pairs of Five Finger shoes -LRB- KSOs and Bikila LS -RRB- and the socks are a perfect fit . Getting them on and off are not as smooth as conventional socks but I choose to sacrifice a few seconds of extra effort over discomfort , blisters , or hot feet . They are perfect as winter socks with my Five Fingers -LRB- in Houston 's mild winters -RRB- . I have ran as much as a marathon in them . Love my Injinjis .
 They are good socks.The only thing I do n't like is the size of the branding on the socks .
 I bought these as a gift for our grandson ! He says he can never have too many of the injinji toesocks . He runs track and these are the most comfortable and absorbent socks he has ever run across .
 Anyway i try it one time , just to know how feel , and feel good but !! my mistake was i get ones more small than i am :-LRB- ,
 I did the Breast Cancer 3 Day 60 mile walk with this socks AND was blister free . I always got blisters in the past . I love these socks . I would STRONGLY recommend these socks to anyone who walks long distance .
 These socks are great for running , VIbrams or no . Also very comfortable to lounge around in . If you wear them with Vibrams it can feel like your toes are being constricted if your VFFS fit snugly .
 I chafe . I bike or run more than an hour , it 's nightmarish and finding gear that helps is my constant quest . These socks do it for me . I no longer have to carry first aid tape and band aids for my toes because these prevent the blisters and chafing between them . Also , I wear Vibrams on a regular basis , and can not wear them without socks without blistering the bottom of my toes so these also solve that problem .
 My wife put them on she loves them . I have had mine on all day and they work great . Absolutely wonderful fit , feel and function .
 I bought a pair of Vibram Five-Fingers and needed some socks -LRB- my feet sweat -RRB- to wear with them . I shopped around these got some great reviews , so I finally went and got some . I wear a size 9.5 shoe -LRB- 42 in Vibram -RRB- and I tried on the medium socks . They were good , but a little tall . I then tried on the small and they were perfect in height . They barely showed over my very low Vibrams . However , I noticed they put some stress on the slots between my toes . It was n't uncomfortable , just a little distracting.For this round , I decided on the mediums and they work a little better . They are taller -LRB- just over my ankle -RRB- and the toe slots seem a little better . These socks breathe really well and keep my feet cool . May not be the best for winter since they do breathe so well , but I love them during the summer . My Vibrams were a little long and these socks help me fill them out better .
 I love these socks ! I have been taping my toes for months now and after wearing these socks I have had no blistering and rubbing .
 My feet have never been as dry after a run . Only think that would make these better would be an L or R to more quickly differentiate which sock is for which foot .
 These fit well with my Vibrams and are great for just wearing around the house , but I 've noticed they pill incredibly easily and are pricey . The fit is a bit higher than I anticipated , but they 're good socks and work well while running .
 Very comfortable to wear . I wear them with my Vibrams five fingers and with regular dress shoes . But after only 1 wash already looked and felt old . Itd be ok if they had packs of more than one pair for a better deal . but overall OK
 The socks are awesome . They work very well with five finger shoes if you have them . They are also very comfy in regular shoes . The durability could be a bit better , that is why they lose one star . Overall great sock -LRB- if a bit pricy -RRB- .
 This is like the 3rd or 4th pair of these I have ordered and the quality is great and so is the price.I wear them every time I wear my VFF 's so they do n't get all sweaty and stinky !
 I 've used these socks one time so far on a 5 mile run . No blisters or rubbing so far so good !
 They came as expected , fit as expected and seem to be doing everything they claimed to . Work well with Vibrams.con
 I like the socks . They work well with the vibrams , but they attract a lot of fuz and hair . That annoys me , I feel like they are never clean even when they come right out of the wash .
 Like most I ordered these for use w / Vibram FiveFingers -LRB- I dont do shoes w/o socks , even if they ARE toe shoes -RRB- and overall I 'm quite happy w / them.General FitFor me the fit is good for each toe and there is n't a lot of extra fabric to get bunched up . Each toe pocket does fit quite snugly against the seam/junction between the toes , so depending on toe length its possible they might cut in and cause circulation problems . `` Micro '' is definitely the word for them -- they / barely / come higher than the top edge of my KSOs and sometimes will slip lower , though that 's generally not a problem . Definitely going to get some crew style for colder weather.Fit w / FiveFingersI wear a W38 KSO and for me these socks add just the right feeling of snugness to the fit . In no way do my feet feel `` crowded '' or like I need to up a size to compensate , so I would n't worry about that.QualityMy first impression of these is that they 're quite thin and they take to dirt well -LRB- so if you 're like me and do n't pay attention to where you 're stepping , opt for black -RRB- . As for how sturdy they actually are only time will tell . I 'll report back w / findings down the line , unless I forget or just dont feel like it . : -RRB- I 'm quite satisfied w / this product -- no complaints whatsoever as of right now .
 It takes a little while to get used to having all your toes in their own separate space , almost a little like wearing flip-flops , but after a bit it become the most natural thing in the world.They also work great with my new Vibram five finger shoes .
 I was on the fence about which size of sock to order , but I went with the SMALL rather than the medium and I think that was the right choice.My Vibrams are 40 's and the small fit perfectly with my foot and the shoes.I 've been using both steadily for about two weeks and have zero complaints.The socks are a must have to aid ease of use with the Vibrams , especially if you 're the parent of a very young child who wo n't wait around while you figure out which toe goes where .
 PROS : WHAT YOU 'RE THINKING
 I bought the toesocks to see if they could help straighten crooked toes . I think they do help a little . It 's too soon to tell but I have hope for them . If they work , I will buy the toeshoes . It takes patience to put them on over crooked toes but is worth the time if they help .
 THese socks changed my daughter 's skeletoes from gross to great . These are the answer for foot stink assiociated with this type of shoe .
 It 's great socks . Fit nicely to my feet . Good grip in the shoes . No much foul smell . comfortable too . Tried them on when go running . so far no complaints .
 These socks are the most comfortable socks that I have ever worn.I bought them for hiking however they are mighty comfy just wearing them around the house with a light pair of shoes.They take a bit getting use to regarding putting them on-start with your little toe and work up.Smashing product !
 This is a really nice sock for runners or joggers or even walkers of any distance . Having each toe individually wrapped in soft protective fabric prevents blisters , cuts from toenails digging into toes and moisture buildup between toes . A great product and a good idea .
 these socks are extremely comfortable , i really do recommend these to everyone , the keep your toes separated and are pretty affordable .
 Great for any type of training , however I feel it is expensive . Will buy more if I ever see them on sale .
 These are fine general performance socks , listed as standard weight . They are , in fact , a little thick if you 're looking for something to use with barefoot sports shoes for an endurance event . Thicker usually means more weight and more heat . If you 're training for an event where grams matter , get the lightweight performance series . Otherwise , these are great for general uses . Plush and comfortable .
 Got ta say , at $ 10 a pop , I was skeptical.First day wearing these socks in my Fila Skele-Toes , and I must say they 're great . Makes my shoes feel much more comfortable , they seem to fit better since they do n't run half sizes . And I do -LRB- embarrassingly enough -RRB- have moisture problems that these seem to control . If my back were n't out , I would see how they perform under running conditions , as I do feel as though I can run in my shoes now that they fit much better thanks to these wonderful , wonderful socks .
 AWESOME I love these they are the best they feel great and are extremely comfortable . I would recommend this product to all that are looking to buy them .
 I absolutely love my new socks and they look so pretty , I 'm very glad I got them ... They feel amazing and is great to see your fingers hahaha
 The socks are great but way over priced . I found a different company where I got 3 pairs for the same price as one here .
 Great toe socks , my sisters bf loves them . He wears them all the time with his toe shoes , and they are super soft .
 Love these socks . They are soft and work well . Would not recommend for someone with very little toes , mine are on the small side and I had a little extra , but not bad at all . Great for Skeletoes or related shoes .
 Fantastic Socks ! They have survived many washes and continue to stay strong and soft and comfy ! Definitely recommend to anyone that enjoys a little wiggle room with their toes ! : -RRB-
 The socks are pretty comfortable as they feel very soft , but yet look and feel very strong . Would have chosen the slightly longer pair if I had known that the Micro is very Micro .
 I was getting awful blisters between some of my toes while running , so I bought these as an expensive solution . They worked perfectly , as expected . I wish they were n't so expensive though ! I want to buy more eventually ...
 Finally some toe socks for guys withh big feet . These are wonderful and comfortable , will be getting more of these .
 These are a great product and work really well with my Vibram FiveFinger shoes . They help with the moisture and avoiding stinky shoes .
 These are the most comfortable socks I own . I originally bought them to use them with my Vibrams , which they are perfect for . But I also tried them in my regular golf shoes . Man that was a great idea . My toes feel better now that they are n't sweaty and touching each other . My feet just feel fresher .
 very good product , excellent time and attention me dieron respuestas a mis preguntas and get my order in the time ordered
 Item was Shipped fast and it was exactly what I expected and my son loved the socks thank you very much !
 These socks are too thin for me and actually cause my feet to overheat because they do n't fit well in my shoes . I do n't run with these socks anymore because they do n't cool my feet as well as my normal running socks causing blisters . However I do like these socks for when I am done running because they separate my toes from each other helping them not rub together .
 I have now purchased these several times and recommend them to all my friends . They are great . I use them with my Vibram 5 fingers shoes .
 I love these socks , they are so comfortable and work perfectly with my Vibram Five Fingers . I have 4 pair of these so far and I would highly recommend them !
 Good quality material , better than average construction especially in the seams and a good fit . They are the only socks that can be worn with those new &#34; toe shoes &#34; . For someone that has problems with their toes rubbing on each other , these socks are great
 These socks have completely solved any issues I had with my feet sweating in my Vibrams . They are comfortable to wear even with regular shoes and I find myself wearing them as every day socks . If they were n't so expensive , I 'd replace most of my sock collection with these . You dont even realize you are wearing toe socks if you wear them with standard sneakers . Overall a very comfortable feel .
 I bought a pair of these and a pair of the Injinji mini CoolMax socks . -LRB- I reviewed those also , so you can check that out if you want . -RRB- Both are excellent . The micros seem a little less durable , slightly thinner material , but that 's both a drawback and a benefit . I think the minis ' thicker fabric wicks moisture away from my feet a little better , but I 'm rating the micros five stars as well because I have no complaints with them . You 'll spend almost as much on a big , thick cushioning Thorlo or SmartWool sock , so the price really is n't unreasonable.The fit of the toes is excellent for me . -LRB- I have , I guess , pretty normally proportioned feet . -RRB- I wear a 10.5 -LRB- US size -RRB- shoe and I got the `` medium '' size socks because that 's where they fell on the chart . The fit is perfect , so no regrets there.Buy a pair and see for yourself . Or just trust me and buy two .
 I ordered these to reduce some rubbing in my Vibran FiveFingers and to keep my toes a bit warmer in cold weather . They work well in both regards . I would recommend these to friends .
 I really like this exact sock , I have bought about 10 pairs.They keep the toes from mashing against each other which can causes sweat.They do a great job of whisking the moisture away from the foot.I use them by themselves or as liners since they are very thin.I have a size 7 to 7.5 shoe size and buy the smalls.Toe size is spot on for the Performance Micro ` sThe crew and the over the calf work socks have added length to the toes but not enough to return them . I wish they would standardize the toe sizes across all their models .
 As soon as I put them on , I knew I needed to buy more . I 've actually told three friends about them in the last two days . It 's winter in New York , and they keep my feet really warm in men 's dress shoes and at home by themselves . Buying more right now .
 These socks involve a little bit of effort and dedication to put on but the result is a well-cushioned foot that is warm , especially in cold winter months.When running with these socks , I did n't feel as if sweat was pooling around my feet . Over the last several weeks since receiving them , I 've found that incidences of blisters have been diminished.When I wear socks for long periods , I find that may feet swell a little . As these socks are somewhat stretchy , the swelling was not an issue . I was able to wear these socks comfortably for 12 hours without an issue.These socks also wash well . I do throw them in a nylon safety washer bag , however , because they are a bit pricey to replace with frequency .
 Best price I could find anywhere ! I got each pair of medium black for $ 9.14 . Just tried them on and they feel great ! Ca n't wait to pair them with the Vibram 's I 'm getting for Christmas . I 'll bring it update after I 've worn them for awhile .
 I absolutely love these socks , they are the most comfortable socks I 've ever worn in boots or cross trainers . I need about 10 more pair .
 If you own Vibrams these are a must . Vibram sold toesocks are over priced . Injinji makes microfiber in all sizes compatible with Vibram socks and are more affordable . Especially since my Vibrams with shipping took me over 100 bones.-Sgt of Marines
 Excellent ! Super comfortable , cute , and slim fitting . Hand in hand with Vibram FiveFingers , these puppies will take you to another level in the urban jungle . My toes sometimes get cold or feel funny with fabric between them . Super easy to get used to . Injinji are outrageously priced regardless of where you obtain them , thanks to these sellers I have saved some money on some stellar socks .
 I wish these were n't so expensive . I would wear them all the time . . Also , these socks are great if you have any of the vibrams or other five finger shoes . Shipping was fast . I had them scheduled for 2 day shipping and they arrived in ONE day . Thanks guys .
 They keep my feet cool . No more toes rubbing together causing sweet . My toes rome free . Feels like your not warring socks at all .

 very comfortable and actually drive moisture away , after a long shift at y job , they were dry , happy with them , buying more
 Excellent addition for those who wear &#34; Toe &#34; shoes likeVibran , Fila , or AdidasWould recommend to anyone looking for atheletic socks .
 These socksare so fantastic I wear them with just about everything . I do plan on buying some more in the future . My only complaint is that I wish you could buy more at a time and they were a little bit cheaper .
 Bought these in size small for my gf who owns veebram shoes in size 7 in women 's . Fit perfect , ca n't see sock !
 Overall i found these to be pretty good socks to wear with my 5 fingers . Socks tend to wick ok and keep my feet warm so long as the ground is dry.Downside is that theyre kind of pricy . Right now u can get em 6 for $ 28 on groupon .
 Great socks . Also true to size and they fit great in shoes , Help with toe since had foot surgery . : -RRB-
 Love these socks . They work great with my Vibram 's . I 've even worn them alone around the house since I dislike wearing shoes at home . Have also worn them with my other shoes .
 My sister uses her vibrams on a daily basis and so I got her these as a Christmas gift . They 're pretty cool . I may or may not have tried them on . .
 Always wanted a pair of this and they are great . I highly recommend if you like fashion stuff and comfort .
 these socks are the best way i have found to prevent my Vibrams from developing foot stink . i always wear these socks with my Vibrams .
 These socks are perfect . They fit great and are really comfortable.The quality is good . Nothing special , but definitely not bad at all!They take some time to get used to putting them on , but I do n't think it 's too much of a hassle . I 've read some reviews that make it seem like putting on toesocks is rocket science . But they 're just probably impatient , spoiled idiots.This is my third pair . I still have the other two . I liked them so much I wanted more . I agree the price is a bit hot for socks , but what people do n't realise is , individual toes are not as easy to make as a regular sock . All in all I 'm very satisfied .
 I was having trouble with my pinkie toe painfully rubbing and these fixed the problem perfectly ! I depend on them for my long runs .
 I have Very long Toes and a size between 13-15 depending on shoe make . This fit very well , I have had them for a few months now , no sign of wear and tear . and i 'm wearing them right now ... Love this socks ... Great Buy !
 I am familiar with the Injinji toesocks and these were not a disappointment . They are well made and comfortable in use . Will buy again .
 I rated this product as I have because it exceded my expectations . Also , I would reccomend this product to others .
 I ordered these for my sister who has been looking for these type socks . She wears them all the time .
 LOVE THEM !! They feel soft on my feet . I definitely recommend these toesocks and I will definitely order more . Peace .
 I have used these socks 4 times , once a week . I ran my first official half-marathon , then a 25km trail run , a 30km run on the roads of Tijuana , and my first ever marathon and ultra marathon -LRB- 47.5 km -RRB- . My toes used to bleed and feet used to blister . Not anymore , I love these socks ! I know it 's only been four wears but it 's been over 123km . They are still in good shape . Love 'em . Worth the $ 12 .
 I bought them when i started working overseas due to the heat , i never had any problems with my feet after that .
 My girlfriend has taken up running , and ran her first mini marathon with her brother earlier in the spring . she showed me how one of her toes will rub the corner of the other , and caused some damage . I first suggested putting a band-aid on her toe before long runs , but then though about these toe socks . She uses them in regular running shoes , with no more discomfort , and loves them.Just wish they where a bit cheaper ...
 These are very comfortable socks and allow you to feel each toe as you walk which is a cool experience . The price is a bit steep for just one pair of socks though .
 My wife got very severe blisters on her toes from running . After she spoke to a friend that ran , she learned about the Injini Toe Socks . She will not run without them and no more blisters !!!
 I 've worn these socks for years with my Vibram Five Fingers . Recently , I got a new pair of VFFs and I decided it was probably a good idea to buy some new , clean socks to go along with them . After wearing injinji 's socks before with my previous pair , I knew I would n't be disappointed . They were just as comfortable and well fitting.I wear my VFF BIKILA 's everywhere , so having socks that excel at comfort is essential . They dry quickly , avoiding the smelly shoes that most people cringe at . Over the past 2-3 years , these things have not let me down.Only complaint would definitely have to be the price . However , if you take care of them and keep them clean , they should last a very long time . My 2-3 year old pair are just as comfortable as the new ones !
 When i first got them , i was interested by the overall look and feel . One thing that caught my eye is 70 % of it was made of coolmax which really wicks away the sweat . I also loved the feel of it on my feet which took some getting used to . It takes longer to put on because theyre basically gloves for ur feet . Got the original weight grey minicrew cut . They feel great with enough padding . These are now my official hiking socks .
 I received a pair of these socks for Christmas , just to try them out when I run . I absolutely love them ! My toes no longer rub together and form annoying blisters . I had to run this morning in my old regular socks , and the blister that is already on my toe is more than enough reason for me to order more of these Injinjis . All of my old socks are going to the recycling !
 I like the fit of these socks . The finishing on the distal aspect of the toes removes the horrible grinding sensation left by seams . A pleasure to wear . Wished the logo came on both socks and that the heel cup was more generous than merely effective . No reports as of yet concerning colorfast nature of the dyes .
 I was looking for something different to wear during workouts and running . These fit tight to the feet and separate the toes -LRB- as they were designed to do -RRB- .
 Never thought a pair of socks would make that much of a difference . So far I have logged around 40 miles in these socks and no blisters at all . Before I would run 5-6 miles and have huge blisters in the same spot on both feet and no more has this happend with the new socks . They are a little pricey but worth it .
 these socks are great . perfect for my vibram fivefingers . the only down side is the price . why are these socks $ 11 and those one-size-fits-all gloves , that appear to use the same technique to manufacture , are two pairs for $ 0.99 ? would have been five stars if it were n't for the price .
 Will be buying more so that I can wear them everyday ! Incredibly comfortable , and very cute in pink ! Not one complaint .
 These are good socks . They seemed a little snug at first , but I did n't notice that on my run . Keeping the toes separated does help keep your toes cooler . These are thinner than most socks I 've used and I noticed a bit pf slipping in my heels until my feet got warm . All in all a good run in a good pair of socks .
 They are great . Bought a couple for my Vibrams and i love them.My only problem is with the price , US$ 12 per sock , not a 3 pack ... or even 2 ... 1 in package . a bit too much since i plan to buy enough for everyday use . this purchase will end up costing more than the shoe itself.Great product over all .
 I wanted socks I could wear with sandals for my Caribbean vacation for when my feet get cold at night . These did the job and kept my feet warm . They are not the most comfortable , was not able to sleep comfortably in them .
 I ordered xl to match the 3 pairs that I bought just over 2 years ago with my vibram five fingers . The xl that I had previously bought fit my size 13 feet perfectly , however , the xl that I got this time were a bit on the large side . I 'm not sure if injinji has made the sizes to fit a more broad range of sizes or what , but next time I think I will order large instead . Overall great sock for use with vibram shoes or with any shoe for that fact . I would own only these if they were a little -LRB- or a lot -RRB- cheaper .
 I gave these to my sons for Christmas and although they had a good laugh over the &#34; twinkle-toe-socks &#34; from Mom they both wear them and like them . They come in handy for skiing too .
 The socks are very comfortableThe size information was very reliableI like the easy care convienceI would recommend them whole heartedly
 I bought these socks when I started training for a marathon . I 'm about 3/4 way through my training , and I wear these socks every time I have a longer distance -LRB- 12 + miles -RRB- run . They are great . I 've had trouble in the past with traditional running socks , getting blisters between my toes , and having bruised toenails . Since wearing these socks , I 've had less bruising , and NO blisters at all . I will be buying more if I continue to distance run after I finish this training program and run the marathon .
 I initally bought three pair of these . I am currently waiting on more to show up . I wear these socks each time I have to wear socks -LRB- which is all to often -RRB- . I run in them daily , and I have some of the tan ones for wear in uniform . I am the kind of person who prefers to be in sandals if given a choice . These socks -LRB- whether in running shoes or boots -RRB- replicate that sandal feeling more than anything else I 've ever tried . They prevent blisters and keep you feet drier than any other sock -LRB- which in my case in Iraq , is quite important -RRB- . They do take a little getting used to , however once you put that first pair on , you wo n't want to wear anything else -LRB- or you 'll immediately hate them and give them to a friend who 'll love you forever for it -RRB- . Toe shoes are quite the trend right now , and therefore these are as well . I do n't care about trends . I prefer common sense . It makes sense to me that if you place material between your toes , you 'll get less blisters and wick more moisture away . That 's why I initially bought them . Buy a pair , you 'll love them . If you do n't , feel free to send them to me .
 Gon na give another praise to how well these socks go with the Vibram Fivefingers . The socks allow for a very snug fit with the Vibrams -LRB- at least with my size 9 feet -RRB- so that things do n't feel loose when you 're running .
 I was having significant blister problems prior to purchasing these socks . Every time i ran I 'd get blisters by the 5 mile point . The blisters were significant on the bottoms of my feet and on several toes . I tried wearing multiple socks with no relief . After researching , i chose these synthetic toe socks and the difference was night and day . I have had NO blisters since wearing these socks . All i did was change to these socks . They are amazing and i would recommend them to any serious runners dealing with blisters .
 I just started getting into shoe-less running in the past 2 weeks , but like to wear socks for hygiene reasons . I was never a big runner before this . I have n't run farther than 3 miles because my feet were getting a little blistered since they are n't used to running , much less barefoot.Got the socks today and just ran 7 miles because I could just not stop . I LOVE these socks - sooo worth the money . My feet feel fantastic . It 's the farthest I 've ever run before and I only stopped because I was nervous that my feet were going to be blistered and I just was n't feeling it . Nope , they feel GREAT !! And I have super sweaty feet too -LRB- not with these socks though !! -RRB- . Have yet to buy the vibram fivefingers and try with those.The toes on the socks were a little long but nothing that bothered my running , and I have small feet.Read the book ` Born to Run ' , it inspired me into this whole bare-feet running trend and I LOVE it !!!
 I have had a pair of vibram five fingers KSO treks for about two months . I love the shoes which recently started causing blisters in certain areas . I broke down and started buying these socks which have not disappointed . They have eliminated the foot odor in these leather shoes as well as provided a comfortable snug fit for me . Granted , all feet are different and I tend to have some long skinny toes . These stretched to fit comfortably . They seem to be made of quality material.I would not run around sock-footed in these since carpet will ultimately wear holes in them . So far I have machine washed them multiple times and they have retained their shape without stretching . These socks are great to use even if you do not have a pair of vibrams . They work well in regular shoes . I have even worn them in insulated boots .
 They are comfortable and soft , but I 've noticed that these seem to stain much easier than other socks , so I make sure to habitually bleach these . Other than that -LRB- and the price -RRB- , they are very good quality .
 I almost always run in Vibrams with no socks . But when I hit a rugged trail , I prefer a little more protection for my feetsies and wear a regular trail running shoe . My toes have become so independent in the Vibrams ! I could n't force them to get along all of sudden . Ininji socks helped me out ! They feel good on the feet , the toes are happy , each snug in his little toe sack , not rubbing up against his brothers . Feeling good , blister free . I was a little surprised to see how quickly they wore through on my forefoot ... . But I 'll still buy them again . In fact , I bought two pair today while wearing one !
 I wore steel toe work boots for several years for my job . This was hard on my toes , they were starting to clump together in an odd fashion , even barefoot . I wanted something to separate and cushion my toes and these work . My knees and back are better for it and my posture too I think . I knew it was very good or bad when I first put them on . The feeling was almost pain , a constant itching and discomfort for about 10 hours . This was my nerve endings getting used to a different input I think . I would think corns and the like might benefit from these too.Expensive for one pair but these are worth it . You really should try this kind of sock if not this brand . My feet feel much better even though I did not know I had such issues . Looking at the shoes now but I think around the house only . The teasing at work would be too much lol .
 I bought these with the intent to use them for my Fila Skele-toes shoes . They work well , albeit they are a bit awkward to get on and off , but what would you expect ? It took a couple runs to break in to fit in the shoes well , as the fabric is a bit too thick for use with toe shoes that are properly fitted . However that being said once my shoes stretched out a little bit they are now working great . These are certainly essential for anyone with toe shoes who goes running , they have eliminated blistering and work fantastic for running on the beach .
 These socks provide maximum breathability and do n't take away from the feeling of my Fila Skel-e-toes ! Also , these socks keep you from having to wash your shoes ! Recommended for any ` barefoot ' type of shoe !
 Bought these for my 5 finger shoes , really helps for the comfort of the shoe and keeps odor at bay . Easy to get on and makes the shoes easier to get on also .
 i was happy to get this they feel good on my feet . they fit just right.they look good and they are soft . i thought they might bother my toes havingmy toes separated but i was wrong . happy with my injinji thank you
 These are really well made socks . They are very comfortable and fit very well . I purchased these socks to mainly use for my fila skele-toe shoes which work very well with . I now wear these socks with my normal shoes and/or walking around the house . The only reason I knocked it down one star because I feel that they are a little overpriced . Overall though they are very well made socks and feel really well on your feet . I 'm sure your feet will be happy wearing them .
 These socks have done exactly what I hoped they would - they keep me from getting blisters on my toes during my long walks ! Love them !
 I ordered two pairs if these Injini toe socks just to give them a try given all the rave reviews I 've been reading about them.I received them fairly quickly and as soon as I opened the package I gave them a go . They can be somewhat tricky to put on at first , you have to be sure to line all the toe sections up correctly , then after you stretch the sock over your heal , you 'll be able to go back in for some finishing touches on the toes , tucking them in neatly . I do miss the convenience of being able to slip on conventional socks in mere seconds whereas these take about two to four times longer to put on , but lem me tell you once they are on , wow ! They are extremely light and breathable , not to mention comfortable . You may feel some extra material between the toes but you quickly become accustomed to this once you have worn them for a few days . The socks also eliminate skin to skin contact between your toes and greatly reduces the risk of blisters , rashes , or fungus . They seem to break in quite well once you 've washed them a few times becoming slightly less firm and tight . I have noticed some string coming loose in the toe area inside of the sock , so I simply turned them inside out and snipped away the excess string with a nail clipper , nothing to it . It turns out it was just excess material from the knitting process . Other than that , the socks seem to be of good quality and I expect they will last a couple years at least . I have ordered 4 more of these since then , 2 white ones and 2 gray ones , and plan on replacing all of my socks with these . I recommend them for athletic or for regular daily use .
 I bought these for my wife and she really likes them a lot . They are super thin , it 's almost like not wearing socks , they keep your toes seperated and help a lot with blister prevention , etc.IF you like toe socks these are the way to go !
 Have the finger shoes and thought I would try these socks as well . They are awesome . Great to wear with regular running shoes as well . No blisters at all . Great product .
 My son has a `` curly toe '' -LRB- his toes overlap . -RRB- Because of this , he often gets chafed on his toes or feels like his toes are crammed into a sock . He loves these socks and wears them exclusively . It was great for our trip out west when we did lots of hiking !
 These socks are a must for every fitness fan.No more sticky toes rubbing against each other.I use these for Salsa classes and they are just wonderful.No more blisters or hurting toes from friction.Problems with sweat are greatly reduced as well.I like to wear these socks on long trips too as they give me a more relaxed feeling.Before these socks , I needed to take off my shoes on a plane , but not any more.They work ! recommended !
 Toesocks are not available everywhere . These are the first ones I have ever purchased and they are fine . If they were less expensive I would purchase a dozen.I use them with athletic shoes ... my feet sweat and my toes rub against each other , causing them to become calloused and hurt . This type of sock adds comfort .
 I love toe socks , and have purchased many pairs , but these are by far , THE BEST ! cool , comfortable , no rubbing ... . I ca n't imagine anything better .
 I ran the Chicago Marathon in October with these things . They are very comfortable , not too hot , low friction -LRB- I was having friction problems between the soles of my feet and my shoes -RRB- , and keep your toes from blistering .
 These are very comfortable socks . The socks fit nice and snug around the toes and does not even feel like you have them on . The seams are not big and bulky so you do n't feel them . I initially bought these for running but now I wear them everywhere . These have been great in preventing blisters when I run .
 If you have problem with Athletes foot , these socks help to keep your toes separated so they do n't get sweaty .2 nd time I have ordered for gifts .
 I bought these socks to wear with the Merrell barefoot model shoes and it was very conclusive . The toes feel great separated like this , it 's a bit like not having socks at all . I was afraid to be cold but after walking for a while my feet were hot and at ease .
 Amazing feeling with this wonderfull product . Special suited for toe shoes but also with others . Feel free walking slow or fast as you want . Very fast shipping .
 light socks , breath well , great for summer time , originally got my wife some , now i have a few . lol . The price is a little much , but worth it .
 I bought these for running after continuing to develop blisters in my toes . It could be me not running appropriately but these have eliminated the blister problems.I truly enjoy these socks.For reference on sizing , I wear a US9 in soccer cleats , US9 .5 in running shoes/sneakers , and the mediums fit me perfectly!Highly recommend these .
 This pair of socks is probably the best I have had . The only downside is its price . If they would cost less I would probably stock up and forget about regular socks lol ... Get this if your toes like a little freedom ! : -RRB-
 You ca n't even feel them under regular shoes . They feel great in my five-fingers ! Helps keep my feet warm in the five-fingers .
 took 4 pairs of these on a 6 month deployment to iraq to run in my vibram biklikas and helps soften the gravel i had to run on alot . no blisters the whole time .
 These T shirts are the best around , I 'm serious , they are very strong and very soft . A couple friends of mine work in the silkscreening business and told me that the `` Hanes Beefy T '' was THE best out there , so I ordered 6 of them on their advice . I 've never seen T shirts this nice , they are the most comfortable , strongest , and they feel like they will last forever . I 'm so happy with these shirts , they are awesome .
 I have been wearing these glasses everyday for 3 years now . They are just right in size , shape , color and fit . I use them for daily driving , in sun and snow . The ear pieces are thin enough so they do n't block peripheral vision . -LRB- Difficult to find as most styles have wide , bulky ear pieces . -RRB- The shape of the frame and the ear pieces makes them extremely comfortable . -LRB- Shaped to fit your head , not straight . -RRB- They are so comfortable , I can wear them all day long , I just slip them up onto my head when inside . I 'm lost if I leave home without my Bolle Zumas and I will turn around to go back for them .
 The Mens Sock Garters are fabulous . I purchased them for my ` senior ' father . He wears them daily , not just for a special occasion . He prefers his socks to be ` completely ' up and not sliding down all of the time . He likes the fit around the calf of his leg -LRB- adjustable -RRB- . The garter hook also holds the sock firmly in place . He is very happy with the Sock Garters .
 They are very confortable-no rolling . However , have a little problem with hooking them together . I 'm using them for heavy socks so having a problem getting to hook to socks but once on they are great . Would be great for light weight socks-not so great for heavy socks .
 I was tired of having my sox bag around my ankles , so someone suggested I try men 's sock garters . They work ! I placed my order shortly before Christmas and was told the product probably would n't arrive for 3-4 weeks . I had it within 6 days . I 'm very satisfied with the quality of the product and the service I received .
 I have been looking for this product for decades . Seriously . I did n't think they made them any more . I am so awesomely stoked to find this on Amazon . No more sagging socks for the properly dressed gentleman . The only reason I 'm giving it four stars is that the clip rubs on the front of my shin , leaving a sore after a few days . It maybe should have a little more padding on the back . That may be why this garment went out of fashion . Nevertheless , Im glad to have found them .
 Af first , I was skeptical but , then it occurred to me I would n't be wasting a lot of money if I did n't like it , so I decided to try them anyway.Good move . If I knew it , I 'd have bought them earlier . Socks stay in place the whole day . For some -LRB- unexplained -RRB- reason , some days , the metal clip hurts a little -LRB- little , I repeat -RRB- . It 's not like `` hurting '' , `` hurting '' , it 's more like there 's a ` pressing sensation ' on your legs . Maybe it 's because , yes , you do have something on your calves ... That should n't deter you in any case . The benefit of not having soggy socks on your ankles will compensate the minimum discomfort .
 Some things in the past were the best , and if you wanted to keep your socks up you put on your garters and it still hold true to day .
 I bought theses mens socks supports for my father and he loves them
 These are my first pair of sock garters , and I have to say they worked perfectly . I have no issues with them . They are comfortable .
 the sock garters work well.There is one clip on these to grab the sock . ...
 The men 's sock garters worked perfectly . No more sagging socks!color was not an issue so black was perfect for me .
 After years of falling socks , -LRB- I am 50 -RRB- , I in despiration decided to go out on a limb and purchase the sock garters . Am very pleased with product and the shipping was A-1 .
 This is a great product , I wear it every day , as a mater of fact I have it on right at this moment , and its been holding up my socks very good , thank you very much , and keep up the good work . ALOHA1111
 I am very picky when it comes to buying a purse . It 's difficult to buy things of this nature online because it 's not physically in front of you . I read the description of the product and it sounded as though it would work for me , so liking the looks , design and material I decided to order it . I received the purse earlier than the expected delivery date and was pleasantly surprised when I examined the purse in person . It is perfect for my needs and beautiful . It definitely exceeded my expectations . I liked it more than I thought I would , in fact I love it !
 These T shirts are the best around , I 'm serious , they are very strong and very soft . A couple friends of mine work in the silkscreening business and told me that the `` Hanes Beefy T '' was THE best out there , so I ordered 6 of them on their advice . I 've never seen T shirts this nice , they are the most comfortable , strongest , and they feel like they will last forever . I 'm so happy with these shirts , they are awesome .
 Perfect size to tie around the neck and pair with a nice work shirt . Color is very elegant . Fabric of good quality .
 I ordered seven of the 30x30 scarves . Not one of them was 30x30 . I measured each one . I had everything from 29x29 , 29.75 x30 to 29.75 x29 .75 so I am glad I went with the larger scarf . One scarf had a hole in it but I did not notice it until I went to use it . It is small but I was past the exchange date when I found it so I have one scarf with a small hole . The scarves are soft , shiny and very comfortable . I highly recommend going over the scarf more carefully upon arrival than I did so you can take advantage of the exchange policy if needed .
 This vibrant red scarf is 100 % polyester , but with the folds ironed out , it looks like a satin material . The quality of the scarf and of Wolfmark neckwear as a company I recommend . The 30 X 30 size is what works best for me , as I am able to tie it in many ways and to wear it with different looks . I found a very nice website tutorial that shows 21 different ways to tie a scarf . The 30 X 30 is probably the size to work best in trying all 21 . There is a black , sleeveless tank I wear that this with tied in cravat fashion . It 's also large enough to wear as a bandeau , not to mention how pretty it is as a standard wispy wrap for my neck . Thank you , Wolfmark !
 Great scarf ! I searched the web high and low before I came across this scarf
 Nice quality scarf . I can tell it will last a long time and it feels great . I got it in white , but if I needed another solid scarf to match a different outfit , I 'd get this brand . I like scarves and I 'm happy to confirm that I do n't have to spend $ 40 in a department store to get a good one .
 I love my new scarf . The item arrived as detailed and much sooner than I thought it would . The color is beautiful and I will surely order from this vendor again .
 I got this to use as part of a Fred -LRB- from Scooby Doo -RRB- costume . It 's fabulous . I think it 's worth the money regardless of the circumstance you 're planning for it .
 I was extremely satisfied with this product . The scarf has good texture . It shipped nicely . I ll buy more .
 I bought this scarf to cover a recent surgery scar on my upper neck.The scarf covers perfectly when tied in a knot on opposite side of scar.The black is jet black which I wanted .
 his pants in overall line is still very good , sturdy , feels soft to the touch on the skin , the profile legendary cutting adds a touch of elegance , and even after several washings the fabric remains the same and does not shrink , the only thing I did not like the pants is that they have deteriorated the quality of the clips and metal buttons , formerly of copper and bronze , and now this are of aluminum and does not look good , however I recommend buying them are very good at the price .
 These came a little long , maybe an inch or two . Seeing as many others have noticed this is a problem with this fit , I suggest going one inseam size lower . I ordered a 30 '' and they fit more like a 31-32 '' . Other than the sizing , they are great jeans , and still look great on me . The boot cut allows the extra length to bunch up a little around the shoes , so you do n't really notice it . It actually looks good.I wish they sold these in a low rise version , as I do n't like hiking them up to where you might put dress pants or khakis . They stopped selling the 517 in a low rise though , so I 'm happy to wear them as is , great fit .
 I have always appreciated the fit and quality of Levi jeans . The boot cut has a closer fit around the knee with comfortable room in the hips and waist . What Levi Strauss needs to understand is that there is a huge population of men out there that has a 31 inch inseam . Men between 5 ' 9 &#34; and 6 ' fall into this size range . My growth did not stop at 30 &#34; inseam , and did not make it to 32 &#34; . So I either buy high water jeans that show my socks , or I let the cuffs drag the floor which signicantly reduces the life of the jeans . I liked the fit enough that I spent an additional $ 10 to get them hemmed to 31 .
 product arrived as expected on time , the product was as expected and the quality was as you 'd expect to find in a brick & mortar store .
 Great fitting . I usually buy the 527 style but they did n't have black in that style . Ordered a 517 instead and love the fitting .
 The fit and look are great and I saved a few dollars . Will purchase more when the price is right
 love this jeans , the fabric is really good and the cut is impecable . it is original and the communication was really easy , i recieved really fast .
 These are the first jeans in a while that actually fit my waist size , inseam and the leg openings are perfect .
 These jeans fit well but the denim seems less hefty than the denim of the same 517s from 5 years ago .
 I received my pants very quickly . I was concerned that my size would be too short for boots . I was pleasantly surprised that the designer was thoughtful about the shape and length for this item &#34; after &#34; several washings . Pants are about 1/2 inch longer than the average pants which make them perfect for cowboy boots . Pants are also very comfortable . JCD
 Noticed that they even have an extra pair of belt loops compared to my previous order . They are sturdy & dependable .
 The jeans were great ! The price was right , they were delivered in a timely fashion , and I lost a few lbs to get in them and I look good . lol . I recommend this company .
 These are the only jeans my son likes . He is tall and I have trouble finding his size in local stores and I could not find a better price .
 The jean came very quickly . They were the proper color , size , and cut . The packaging was excellent , and so was the quality of the jeans .
 Perfect price and fit for my husband . I would recommend this jean to any &#34; baby boomer &#34; who loves boot cut jeans.The jean has not changed at all good quality material and the right color . Thank you .
 This pair of Levi 's fits perfectly and the indigo color is the same as the Levi 's I wore back in the day !
 I gave these Jeans to my daughter 's friend for Christmas and he really likes them.He is real thin and wears motorcycle boots.He likes how they fit and loves the boot cut.He especially likes the rugged material .
 Nice one . . Boot Cut with nice fit.Ordered the Jeans with 29L but got it 3inch longer . So I had to do alteration , usually I order my pants with 29L and it fits perfect on me .
 Levis 517 's fit me better than any other jeans that I 've bought . Gon na stick with them . I wear a 38 waist , 36 inseam . Have bought several pair over the past six months from various places and they all fit the same . Good quality control !
 BASTANTE BIEN . BUENA CALIDAD DEL PANTALON . ME QUEDO MUY BIEN . TANTO EL LARGO COMO EN CINTURA . EXCELENTE COMPRA A UDS . GRACIAS .
 The jeans are a good deep color . Wish they were n't quite as thin as jean material seems to be getting , but seems they are all like that now . Overall a good pair of jeans.These are hard to find in 36x36 , so I 'm glad Amazon carries them .
 Perfect fit right out of the box . Started wearing immediately , stitches , pockets , zipper perfectly in place . Survived several washes good as new .
 Good price , perfect quality . Very good model for young and old-aged people . Gorgeous color . Classic zipper . I 'm satisfied ! I recommend to buy it .
 These jeans fit me very well and look good . One thing I noticed however is that the denim has a more coarse feeling compared to other Levi 's jeans . I would buy these again .
 IL TELL YOU I HAVE BEEN WEARING LEVI 'S FOR YEARS ON END AND THE BEST DEAL I GOT ON THESE GREAT JEANS WAS FROM MY FAVORITE STORE AMAZON
 i traveled 80 miles one day looking for the jeans i like with no luck , it did make for a nice bike ride though ! then i went online looking and i found what i was looking for at amozon these jeans are hard to get in my hometown!Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut JeansWhat a nice pair of rugged jeans . And I got them so FAST !! Thanks again.Roxann Hill
 Good product , on time and as shown in Amazon.But ... years ago , ordering the same # jean and the same size always brought the exact same fit and look . Lately , the same length , for instance , some times is a bit too long -LRB- can be fixed -RRB- or a bit too short -LRB- bad news -RRB- . The price to be paid for savings by manufacturing offshore . Lets see if with the crisis we return to the memorable `` MADE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ''
 What can I say ? They are Levis . Perfect fit , excellent quality , and the most impressive thing was the price . Unbelievable !
 517 's are the best fit for me -LRB- I 'm a bit older and looking for just a little more comfort -RRB- . I wear boots most of the time , and these do a great job of dropping over the boot and still maintaining a nice line on the leg . Plus , the little red tag says you are a real Texan and not one of those $ 150.00 / pair wannabe 's .
 a la medida , tabla de medidas excelente ...
 These jeans come washed so they are soft , supple and ready to wear . They are pre-shrunk so order the size you wear . I choose boot-cut jeans because I wear 12 '' - shaft western boots . Levies are the only jeans I wear because they fit well , look good , and get better with age .
 These jeans are perfect for the guy who wants to wear boots and not look like a geek or a thug . Just the right combination of loose and fitted .
 This is my first pair of Levi 517 's and I have to say I am very impressed . They sit on my natural waist -LRB- not low-rise like the 527 's -RRB- , and are fitted in the seat and thigh , and then flare out below the knee to fall on the boot . I 'm 6 ' 3 '' 190lbs and have a 36 waist and 34 inseam and it fit perfectly . Hard to find jeans these days that sit on the waist ... I 'm not a fan of the low-rise look or feel , so these jeans were a great find .
 Came to Amazon to order these jeans for my husband since no one ever has his size , 36x36 . I was pleasantly surprised because I did order two of these in different colors , Rancher Light and Rinse , both of which were the perfect colors . Perfect light colored jean and perfect dark colored jean . My husband and I are very hard to fit in jeans and tops so when something works we often get multiples , the problem however is that sometimes we buy the exact same thing in a different color and they fit totally different . Not these ! These jeans were great and the same fit ! Some people might not be able to appreciate that as much as I , but I was very grateful . It was a risk I had to take since his size is so common , but with free returns I had to take advantage . The boot leg is also very subtle but incredibly flattering . He does wear boots but of course they are n't necessary . I would say they are very true to size and great quality . They are currently his `` good jeans '' ... . that is until he `` accidentally '' wears them to go work in the garage . But when that happens , because it will , I will be back to purchase more ! By the way he is just over 6 ' 3 '' about 230-240lbs .
 Fit well at the waist and look good . Last a lot longer than most most jeans and seem to get more and more comfortable the more you wear them .
 These are great jeans , they do tend to run a little big , both on length and waist . The color was a lot more bluer then it looks in the picture , so be weary of that it . It was too country , and I needed more rock and roll , if you know what I mean.Pros
 I was a bit concerned about this purchase . My husband likes the boot cut style and that was an excellent choice for my purchase . I have zero compliants other then I wish I 'd bought more !
 they were exactly what we were looking for . the orginal 517 , these are my hubby 's most favoritie , they also hold up better than the other styles seem to
 Will have to wash several times for them to fit . I buy this size all the time from other retailers and they are n't this big . Like the color and the style . They just run big I guess . Mainly in the length . Would buy again , just a smaller size .
 The fit is nice , the color is holding up through the wash . I am glad they have different sizes then the stores . Very hard to find 33 x 36 !
 I like the way these jeans fit.The are also comfortable.The ones I have purchased previously have been durable .
 d e m a r a v i l l a e s t e m o d e l o muy bueno
 They 're good sellers and the product is very good , I like so much this jean . Ellos son muy buenos vendedores , el producto llego rapido a mis manos y era el esperado , los recomiendo ampliamente .
 I wear Levi jeans every day . Levi 's are the only jeans I will wear.I have worn Levi jeans for the past twenty -LRB- 20 -RRB- years ... or longer.Levi jeans are great ... in fact , i 'm wearin 'em right now ...
 Sent me what I wanted . 15 more 12 more 11 more 9 more 7 more 5 more 3 more done
 This is a very good price for this product , it 's the second one I 've ordered for my son .
 If you have a problem with jeans bagging in the rear , then these jeans are for you ! They are a great fit and very comfortable ! My husband loves them !
 Well , its a good jean , everybody know the levi 's quality , the item arive in perfect conditions . . so nothing more to say . .
 Perfect fit , every time . 517 's are difficult for me to find locally , but buying on line thru Amazon is best for me .
 These are like they used to make them ! More belt loops , great fabric - love them ! Ca n't wait to order more of these !
 I was having a really hard time finding the boot cut Levis - no one seems to carry them anymore . These are just what I wanted . They look and fit good .
 Bought these for my husband and they fit true to size , maybe a little bit long but not so much that he wo n't wear them . He love them , they look good so I love them ! Great Pants !
 I ordered these jeans for my 16yo son & he really liked them . The only thing he would have preferred was a lower rise , but he 's wearing them without complaints . : -RRB-
 I bought 2 of these and man they are nice . I 'll admit the guy wearing the jean in the picture sold me . Like I went and look for all the style of Levi 's , and these attracted me the most . Although I would n't tuck in my shirt like that . But they sure look good with some chucks and or casual boots and a dress shirt , with a silver wrist watch , and a pair of shades . They are heavy , and for me kinda tight even though jean of a different brand and style with the same size , fit me perfectly . I do n't know I guess it the way they are made . But for the look , I 'll take the pain any day , yes these jean are so tight mostly in my thigh area and waist , that I do get a little discomfort pain in my lower back . I guess it the way they are design and the heaviness of the jean . Of course I am in the process of getting in shape again . So with time , these will be perfect . I do like to sag a little , but as of right now I ca n't with these . Until I lose some of that belly fat I accumulated over the years .
 These are the jeans I always buy , they are a great comfortable fit . It is also great that Amazon stocks the size I need , it 's impossible to get from the shops .

 My body was made for Levi 's brand jeans , and I 'd worn through a couple of pairs . I bought duplicate black 517s - soft but not washed out , dark , with a predictable fit . They are my new favorites . The process went smoothly . Who knew I 'd be buying clothes online ?
 I ordered these for Christmas for my 6 ' 2 '' grandson who had grown out of all his pants after checking stores and finding his size is almost impossible to find . They were perfect and he loved them .
 The Levi 's 517 Boot Cut were purchused as a replacement of the wrong ones bought at a local store , These ordered & delivered ; I was told fit greatly before & after ; washThe price for my buying , totaled out a nuff less even with shipping to come fromamazon , rather than a store , even on sale after my tax & shipping ; -LRB- as a late gift -RRB- Theonly guestion I got was about , they did not have the Levi 's cardboard shelf tagswe see on Jean 's in store .
 I love my levis . I was unaware they came in black . I bought a blue pair and black pair , Ilove them
 Just as described ! Fit & look exactly what he needed and wanted . And he said I could n't find this product ... LOLThanks !!! The Wife wrote the review ...
 These jeans fit great . The boot cut gives a good look without being sloppy . My husband looks hot in them .
 Got these as a gift for my brother , and they are the true blue classic with a great slim shape . Perfect `` date night '' jeans .
 These are the only jeans my husband will wear and we could not find them ANYWHERE . When i found them here i was happily suprised with the discount price and they look great . Would buy again from this seller .
 I love these jeans . For me they are perfect . Long enough to wear with or without boots and the fit is not too tight . How can you go wrong with Levi 's ?
 I got what I ordered promptly . I wish I had ordered a different color but -- my bad . No complaints . What else can I say ?
 The jeans was just perfect , the material , size and colour , nothing to complain about , and great timing too.They fit really well , and amazon 's size chart was very helpfull .
 Style & size stayed true since the last time I bought a pair , after gettingLevi 's Men 's 527 Low Rise Boot Cut Jeanthat are nothing like they used to be that 's all a shopper can ask .
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut . Black 42 waist / 30 length . If you are short , stocky and have a big butt . These pants are perfect . They wo n't bunch up at your fat knees and they will last a long time before the zipper explodes . I suggest you buy the next size up because they will shrink after 6 months of washing , drying and severe stretching in the seat area . Great pants .
 MY FAVORITE JEANS FOR 25 YEARS . I HAVE WORN MAINLY 501 MODEL , SO I READ MANY REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING THESE 517 JEANS.AFTER THINKING FOR A LONG TIME I DECIDED TO BUY ONE SIZE BIGGER THAN USUAL . IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE.THEY ARE JUST FINE , BLACK COLOR AND ZIPPER FLY WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DETAIL FOR ME !
 My husband 's body type includes slight pot belly and skinny hips and thighs . Almost impossible to find pants that fit well without being either too tight in the belly or looking baggy in the seat and thighs . He used to wear Levi 's Action Jeans which were boot cut jeans with slight stretch in fabric and a slight crease in the legs . These jeans always looked and fit great ; real snappy . Unfortunately they 're no longer available . Then went to wearing David Taylor Flexjeans from Sears which were almost as good . However , he now find that although Sears still sells jeans by this name , they are no longer the same . They are now made in China and are made from a crappy fabric and no longer fit the same . In desperation , he started looking thru available Levis products and found Levi 's 517 . Advertised as slim in seat and thighs . He did not expect much but was pleasantly surprised to find that they are indeed somewhat slim in the seat and thighs , even though the pants he bought had a waist size slightly larger than minimally necessary , thankfully allowing him to breathe . Bottom line was that he was very happy that these pants are not so tight in the waist that its hard to breathe , but still slim enough in the seat and thighs that they do n't look like old man 's jeans . Just wish they had the snappy look of the old Levi 's Action Jeans .
 I bought a pair of these in 29X34 and they are great . Fit perfect , really like the cut , lighter weight material but not too light , should hold up well . Just wish they would reduce the size of the internal tag -- I 've actually had to tuck it back into the pants a few times after putting them on !
 I 've always wanted a ` black 527 ' but found out I could only get that in rigid black.I decided to try 517 n whao I might just decide to continue with 517 even with other colors.Just the perfect fit I love .
 Is exactly what i was looking for . . i being using this model for years , and this pair of pant are excellent
 I am a creature of habit . Being of slim build I have found the 517 Boot cut to be the perfect jean for me . I also know my size so the fit was great as received . This is not always the case when ordering over the Internet . Service was great delivered on time as expected .
 These are the best jeans Levis has to offer in my opinion . They are not light and flimsy like some jeans Levis are making these days . The medium stonewash is a great even color . They do n't look faded on the seat and thighs or dingly and dirty like so many jeans do . These jeans are rugged , comfortable and last a long , long time . On top of that they look great . These are the only jeans I will buy .
 These jeans are everything they say they are . We will definately order these jeans again when the time comes . Thanks !
 100 % recomended , i have no doubt that i am going to buy another , it is really regular fit and boot cut
 This is the only jean my husband wears . He has the hardest time finding 36x29 . This is a perfect fit for him . When he needs more I will return to amazon .
 I finally found a pear of jeans that my wife said they look good on me and after being washed still fits great
 Great fit for my long legs ! Hard to find jeans my size but Levi 's always comes through for me ! a
 This pair of Levi 's fits perfectly and the indigo color is the same as the Levi 's I wore back in the day !
 I gave these Jeans to my daughter 's friend for Christmas and he really likes them.He is real thin and wears motorcycle boots.He likes how they fit and loves the boot cut.He especially likes the rugged material .
 My order arrived in a timely fashion , they fit good and look great ... I 'm gon na get a couple more pairs .
 Levi 's 517 ` sThese Levi 's were the perfect fit . I like the fact that they are pre rinsed , which makes the fabric softer .
 Many of us do n't want to wear our Levi 's half way up our bellies . 517s are the best answer for that !
 A well tried and true blue jean that I 've been wearing for decades . The fit , finish , and quality is a good as or better than ever .
 These seemed a bit darker in person than pictured but they were a great pair of jeans for my husband . This is his favorite style of jeans and he needed a new pair of &#34; dressy jeans . &#34; Same great jeans as in the past .
 All the Levi 's I purchased for my 16 year old son were ` made to fit ' ! From the straight to boot cut , they all were a perfect fit for his personal taste . They are well made and very stylish .
 Great jeans , great price , speedy delivery as promised ! Will definitely be ordering them again since my son is so tall and slim and this is one of the only places I can find his size .
 Great basic jeans in hard to find sizes . Not much to say otherwise . They have washed up well and held up well for my long and lanky teen .
 I ordered these jeans an exrta size longer becaause I wanted a high cuff . Got exactally that . Perfect !!! Now I 'm looking for a white pair
 Well , they 're Levi 's . There you go . Best jeans on the market . Last forever and fit great . The black does fade to gray quicker than I would like , but that 's probably because I wear only black , all the time . So ...
 I have worn Levi jenas for the last 16years , i am relatively tall guy and seldom get my size in the store , Amazon provides me my size and then quality as well .
 Purchased two pairs of Levi 's Boot Cut Jeans for my husband , the Jeans are very hard to find in the stores . Since my husband is tall , it is hard to find 36x36 .
 These pants are very well put together and I am a big fan of Levi 's pants durability which is what prompted me to purchase these .
 I am a woman but men 's jeans fit me better . These are very comfortable . My jeans do NOT get hung up on my boots as they do with jeans that are not boot cut .
 todo salio perfecto , tanto el envio como el paquete recibido , estan esplendidas , la hora de llegada fue la establecida por el vendedor
 Quality jeans , but not made in the USA.Arrived quickly and each pair were individually bagged in plastic.Good fit , for me .
 I like this style and they are getting very hard to find . The price here was the best I found , got in a timely manner . I 'm happy with my purchase .
 Purchased these jeans for my husband . They have a nice fit and look very good on . No baggy butt like the relaxed fit jeans .
 I usually have a hard time finding good bootcut jeans with the right fit in the retail stores . If the color/wash/fabric is right , the size isnt . If the size is right , the fit is too loose at the seat and thighs . Now that my favorite pair of jeans is past its prime , I started looking for a new pair to replace it . After hunting all stores in and around my area and trying all available bootcuts in my size , I was very disappointed . That is , until I found a pair of Levi 's 517 Blue Ox in the local Macy 's store . This was the first bootcut I found in the last 3 years that fit me perfectly . Since I already had a pair of jeans that was of a very similar color , I came online and started looking for the correct color in that fit . Unfortunately , it wasnt that easy finding one online . Kohls , Dillards and others had Levi 's 517s , but they werent the same ones I saw in the store . Apart from Macys and Amazon , no other site -LRB- including Levi 's own site -RRB- had the same fit in Rancher Light color I was looking for . I could have ordered at Macys website , but my past experience with Amazon was stellar and so it my first choice . Even then I was a little skeptical if the photos were close to how the jeans looked in reality . Since amazon had a free returns on this one , I went ahead with the order . The product , as always with Amazon , came 6 days ahead of their estimated delivery date . The jeans is , in fact , very close to the pictures on the website and the fit is PERFECT !! Thanks to Levi 's for the perfect color and fit and KUDOS to amazon for the perfect shopping experience !
 Finally Levi went back to 7 belt loops instead of the five . Makes a big difference for those of us that work for a living .
 I bought the 517 as I prefer this cut to any other one of the Levi 's catalog , I place it even above the so famous 501 . I 'm fully satisfied
 I love these jeans . The wash and fit are great . That being said , they did arrive with a hole in the seat and the seam is a little crooked on the inside left leg . I really do n't care though because they fit so good .
 It is hard to find male , black , slim fit , boot cut jeans . Believe me I searched many places both on-line and local retail outlets . Finally I found these on Amazon and they were just right . Great fit , looks good , and the price was reasonable . I highly recommend them .
 We will take these to alterations but they were about 5 inches too long . Otherwise they are very nice .
 True to size , did n't shrink , and minimal wrinkling . Love the variety of sizing - son is tall and thin , and hard to fit , but Levis 517 made it happen !
 Levis 517 Boot Cut Jeans are just as advertized . Good fit and a perfect boot cut . I highly recommend them for anyone who needs boot cut jeans .
 It 's a very good pant for my husband . Nothing too special or fancy ; he is very satisfied because he got what he expected
 execelente producto muy buena calidad , el pantalon vino en un excelente empaque y llego super rapido deverdad no tengo quejas lo recomiendo
 He looks hot in them , thanks ! What more can I say ? They did n't stay on for very long ... ca n't share any more details .
 I was somewhat hesitant to order Levi 's online but I could n't be happier with this order ! The jeans are exactly as described and fit perfectly . They are genuine Levi 's and are of the highest quality - not seconds . I ca n't recommend this seller highly enough .
 They 're good sellers and the product is very good , I like so much this jean . Ellos son muy buenos vendedores , el producto llego rapido a mis manos y era el esperado , los recomiendo ampliamente .
 I wear Levi jeans every day . Levi 's are the only jeans I will wear.I have worn Levi jeans for the past twenty -LRB- 20 -RRB- years ... or longer.Levi jeans are great ... in fact , i 'm wearin 'em right now ...
 The jeans were a Christmas gift and a style regularly worn by the recipient . They were a perfect fit . They are hard to find locally so we ordered from the Internet . The red tag on the back pocket did not say `` Levis '' and I have never seen this before . Is it significant ?
 Wow . These are great blue jeans , and they come in 38 long which is what he wears . HE wanted the boot cut , and a 34 waist was large enough . Usually he wears a 36 , , but I ordered 34 and they fit just right . Great looking , great price .
 I bought two pairs in two orders - both were perfect - exactly as I expected . On time . Good buy at a decent price .
 These jeans are tough but good looking and fit well . Amazon 's price is great , they are a good value for the money , and we always get prompt delivery and easy return if size is not right .
 the product is excellente , but needs to be taggedcorrectly , I order 34x30 tag say so , but real size was36x32 try buying them from differet source , and same thing never can get athe right size until i took a mesuring tape to the store and mesure before buing them !!
 I love those Jeans . . nice shape and denim . I ordered different colors from this pant and I love them all . it is comfortable , and have a nice leg openning that falls around the boot .
 I have been wearing 517 's for as long as I can remember . They fit perfectly and have remained unchanged for years .
 These boot cut jeans by my favorite jeans maker are exactly what I needed.When I ordered my Harley Davidson boots , I needed pants for when I wear them and these ones are the only ones that fit on the outside where others ca n't . Shopping local yields nothing like these , just junk not worth the money.Quality is what I 've come to expect from Levi 's , outstanding with fit absolutely perfect.More orders coming soon for these.Shipping was prompt , making this buyer very happy.Thank you to everyone for helping this lonely guy that hardly can get out to shop by bringing them to me.Again , THANK YOU VERY MUCH !!
 I thought these were more on the casual side , but after putting them on , they can pull off a nice look . Very comfy , one day to break in . No frays , quality zipper . Dimensions were perfect . Overall color is a shade or two darker than in the picture . Awesome , new favorite pair .
 I love being able to find the 517 's on line and not having to run all over town for the style and size I need .
 If you promise not to tell anybody , I wear lined jeans from eddie bauer or llbean when it gets cooler . I wear these when it gets warmer . True to size , do n't shrink too much .
 These were a secret gift for my brother-in-law . He keeps complaining that he must do laundry every other day because he only has one pair of work pants , but then he just will not go get more or let anyone buy him any ! So , I got the size off of the one pair of jeans he owns -LRB- laundry is at my house -RRB- and I bought several other pairs that were similarly worn . I sneak in a new pair about once a week and so far he has n't noticed that he now has three pair of work pants . When I slip in the new ones , I put them in the dirty clothes hamper he uses . I wonder if he knows his pants are multiplying yet ?
 They arived bfore time , APO adress , in Afghanistan ,1 week took it to arive here , im suprised , and they fit good , i dont hawe no words
 36 &#34; inseam jeans at a reasonable price are hard to find . I really like the fit of these jeans just wish there were other kinds in the same length .
 Just what I expected . After soaking and drying , the fit and feel was as anticipated ... just like the good , old days !!! -LRB- I would estimate that length and waist both shrunk by about one inch ... as Mama warned , some 50 years ago -RRB-
 I am happy with the jeans and how they fit , but usually when I get 517 's , they are really stiff and then I get to break them in . This pair was already like pre-washed , just differnt than what I am used to , but I still like them and will wear them . Maybe I have to look into differnt types and find exactly what I am looking for next time . Thank you
 I 've been wearing 517 's for a good , long time now , and I love 'em ! The problem is that most of my local stores that sell them -- and very few of them do -- price them highly and also drastically limit the selection compared to the more popular 501 's and 550 's . Additionally , these jeans are often skipped over when it comes to the big sales . Well , shopping for them on Amazon is a decision I should have made long ago . The price here is hard to beat.As for the jeans themselves , they are of the rugged quality that Levi 's is known for . They fit like the product photo shows
 Have had these jeans for a few weeks now & am very satisfied.The flair from the knee down is discrete and does not look like the 70 's bell-bottoms . The fit on top was precisely as marked . The length seems about 1/2 inch longer than sized on the 501 's . Was formerly utilizing 501 slim fit jeans but found that could not place them over motorcyle boots . The 501s were great for rainy rides , but look too much like a cowboy , when tucked into the boots .
 As always , good shopping at amazon.com . Its always a problem finding the right length jeans for me . I found that in this levi 517 Boot cut jean , it feels good to finally find a jean that is not too short . A fact that i would have loved to know before i bought this jeans , is the leg opening size . This jean is very tight around the thigh area . I would just like a bit more details on the product a next time round . Other than that , it always a good shopping experience on Amazon .
 The length and waist were perfect . The quality of Levi jeans was the same as they had always been , good
 I always had to keep pulling up my previous pairs of Levi 's -LRB- any model -RRB- because they only had FIVE belt loops . A key ring and cell phone are not that heavy . I remember growing up with Levi 's having SEVEN belt loops and a heavier canvas . I was pleasantly surprised to see the ` new ' Levi 's 517 now have seven belt loops again . I started to buy a different model , but they still only have the five loops.I just bought a couple of these pairs from Amazon . I did check online at Kohls and their current batch of 517 's still show 5 loops . I will have to wait until I go to the store to see if their stock has been updated . Kohls prices are higher than Amazon , but I will recheck when they go on sale . I still check Amazon first for almost all my purchases.Overall , I like my new Levi 's jeans . I will compare them with older ones to see if the canvas really is slightly thinner . Outsourcing manufacturing almost always results in poorer quality and non-standard sizing . It has 100 % results in putting Americans out of work . I try to buy American whenever I can -- hopefully it will catch on.There is another issue appearing after I washed my new jeans with my old ones . It should n't have made a difference , but the new ones are now covered with fine fluffy hairs . I will have to use a lint brush when I take them out of the dryer for now . Although it may just be a ` break in -- first washings ' issue.Overall , I rate these jeans 4 stars . I will have to wait for a few machine washings to see how the color holds up . I may be old fashioned , but buying jeans looking like they are 1/2 wore out or have holes in them is ` less than optimal ' .
 I ran around town to find my husband Levi 517 's in size 35x32 for Christmas . In the stores , there were stacks of all different sorts of Levi 's to go through . Finally I came home and ordered them through Amazon and received exactly what he wanted . These Levi 's fit perfectly and look great . Very happy they come in off size waists . Thank you for making my job easier and receiving nice fitting jeans .
 I 've grown up wearing Levi 's and in particular 517 's in my adult life . I do like that Levi has added additional belt loops in the past year or so . Over the years Levi has cut some corners in manufacturing , but not enough to discourage me from continuing to buy their stonewashed 517 's . I like the stonewashed jeans since they are ready to wear , unlike the rigid indigo Levi 's that have to be washed several times to soften them up.I am buying more and more items from Amazon for the free shipping and competitive prices . It just saves a lot of time going to a retailer only to find out they do n't have my size or what I want . Even with Amazon collecting California sales tax , I figure the time and gas saved from having to go to a retailer is well worth it .
 Levi 's are always the best jeans around . Levi 's Boot Cut are the only kind my husband will wear . Always a good fit .
 Very high quality . Several pairs have consistent fit . Have bought and worn these 517 boot cut jeans for several years .
 My husband LOVES these jeans . They are a GREAT FIT , especially in the seat . The legs are n't too wide in the thighs and the bootcut bottom make a terrific silhouette . I like how he looks in them and he says they are REALLY COMFORTABLE . They look best in the darker color and are a good pair of `` dress jeans '' as well as versatile . We are ordering more . Ladies , get him these jeans !
 I 've worn Levi 's for over 50 years . From the days when you had to roll up the cuffs because they only had one length to super bells in the 70 's and now my favorite 517 's . They are always true to size and the workmanship is always excellent . The service at Amazon is always great too . What more can I say , I am one satisfied customer .
 These boot cut Levis have always been my favorite jeans . I had not had any in a while , so when my order arrived I immediately tried them on . I forgot how well they fit , and they are really stylish . Awesome . Will be ordering more .
 Authentic , just as described . Fast delivery . I am very satisfied with purchase . Smooth , one stop purchase . Husband will be very happy on Christmas day ! Thank you .
 My husband has been wearing Levi 's since he was a teenager . They are the most durable jeans and he loves the boot cut .
 I 've been wearing these for years.They do tend to fade easily so wash them inside out and use a detergent product for black fabrics .
 I bought these as a gift for a friend who has worn this style for years . Good quality , good fit , good style .
 Great jeans.Classical style.Low price.Wearing only jeans , levis always loved.Happy New Year!Amazon Forever!I love it .
 This hard to find style arrived on time . These classic jeans fit just the way they should . Going back for more colors .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Slim Fit Jean is leg looks like so long , . . but lap so tight but leg looks like so long . .
 My husband like it . . although I have to cut the length a little bit . . He said he may buy more in the future . . Hopefully they have shorter length then .
 They are Levis what more needs to be said ? Theyre the only jeans im buying from now on . They fit great and last 2-5 times longer than any other jeans ive bought .
 I use to wear the Levis low boot cut , but they discontinue to sell the color I want . After I give this one a try , I like it so much .
 36 &#34; inseam jeans at a reasonable price are hard to find . I really like the fit of these jeans just wish there were other kinds in the same length .
 Just what I expected . After soaking and drying , the fit and feel was as anticipated ... just like the good , old days !!! -LRB- I would estimate that length and waist both shrunk by about one inch ... as Mama warned , some 50 years ago -RRB-
 i got two pairs for my husband . levis are the only thing that fit him right . They make him look like he has a butt !
 I like this product because it fits very well and is comfortable . I recommend it to others . Good for those who like to wear boots .
 Finally found levis that were the correct size , if they are still available I will order more in the future
 Great pants . I wish there was a size 33 by 35 . I always have a hard time with pants size . I can get a length 34 , which shrink after a wash or a 36 that drags because there too long . But there is no length 35 in pants , so I do n't have much of choice .
 Excellent product the product I come very well and it is what was waiting of , I come in time , good
 I bought they for my boyfriend who had lost a bit of weight and all his pants were falling down , but these fit and stay up -LRB- Thank God -RRB-
 My husband loves the fit and the price.Great deal.You can dress them up or down!Look no further.Great looking jean , for the price .
 Great black on black bootcut jeans . They have even gone back to adding two additional belt loops a feature that went away several years ago .
 Fits well , my husband loves them , quality control met , consistent sizing , and look good on . Will order more as needed
 My son wears a 36 Waist x 36 lenght which is very hard to find . The Levi 's Men 's 517 are about the only jeans he likes and these fit him perfectly . They were shipped very quickly and the price was excellent . They were a birthday gift and he loves them .
 The jeans were pre washed and fit just like I wanted . They were really softer than I expected . I would buy this product again .
 I was so happy with the quality and fit ; I ordered 3 more pairs ! I will be good on jeans for awhile . The price was good too .
 Great quality and a lower price , for me is like a tailored jean , I 'm happy with this product . No more to say thanks to all
 After numerous failed attempts at the 527 's on amazon I finally got a clue and got these jeans . They are PERFECT ... great fit ... weight ... etc. ... just like the jeans I wore in high school 20 years ago ... . I 'm already thinking about a second pair . The light rancher is the perfect color ... . As for the 527 's MADE IN BANGLADESH ... amazing they could ever bear the levis name ... perhaps they were counterfeit . Thanks amazon for my true and needed exchange . The original pair of jeans I ordered ... yes the 527 ... was complete trash . These 517 's are real jeans for real cowboys ... and I 'm not one ... but I do wear a ton of boots ...
 Exellent product
 Great fit for my long legs ! Hard to find jeans my size but Levi 's always comes through for me ! a
 Ordered these for my boyfriend , they run extremely small , he regularly wears a 32/34 had to send back and get a 36/34 . Other than that they 're great jeans .
 Finally a pair of Levi 's not only affordable , but a pair that is the real deal . . not seconds or blemished . . but cut perfectly . . The best I have bought in years . . Thanks . . and `` I 'll be back for more ''
 They fit just perfectly and I am very happy to not only get the bestdeal around but beat the sales tax . Good old Levi 's rigid , bootcut jeans have been my all-time favorite jeans my whole life , andI just turned 60 . Got 'em within a week , free shipping faster thanexpected , so that was cool , too . Amazon rules !
 The pants are great . I can not seem to find them in stores like Kohls or Target where I usually shop . I 'm not skinny as far as a skinny person goes but I have thinner legs than a lot of guys . These seem to be not as loose in the butt and thighs . I usually get the 505 's but they are cut a little bigger assuming tree trunk size legs . I have runners legs and these work . If you have big footballer legs , forget about it .
 Finally jeans that fit like the old Levis , these are the old quality heavy denim stuff not that wimpy pre-wash thin as paper junk denim . I would highly recommend these jeans to anyone who 's familiar with real Levis .
 Very easy shopping . I 'm familiar with the pants so it 's just a matter of price and convenience.Sitting at the desk for a few second beats driving to the store , finding out they do n't have the 517 in my size and driving back home . I 've always had trouble just finding the 517 at stores and shopping online sure makes things easier . The pants themselves are everything they 've always been , good fitting and tough.It 's nice to add the stonewash to my collection of darker denim so I do n't look the same every day.I was upprised how fast they came and that 's a big plus too .
 These jeans fit to size perfectly -LRB- for me -RRB- , are comfortable to wear , and have adequate material to reach a guy 's waist ... not hip-huggers . I 'll buy more of these ! Not a deal-breaker by any means but I would prefer them to not have the size label outside ... it seems Levi 's always does this .
 Amazon did not mentioned in the description that this pair of jeans is a Shrink-to-Fit fabric . No question on the quality . . it 's still an amazing jeans , the great Levi 's jeans , never goes out of style ... Take 31 '' waistline x 30 '' inseam if your size is 30 x 30 .
 Good quality but I wish I had done more research on the colors . Ordered rigid because of the look online however the denim itself is rigid .
 Yes , these Levi 's are everything I had hoped they would be and More . Perfect fit , and I 'm very pleased tofinally have a BLACK pair ! Amazon 's got another winner !
 My wife thinks it 's funny that I rate my jeans with numbers , but , as a former 505 's man , I now prefer the 517 's 'cause ride my horses more and were my boots more ... plus , they just , plain feel good when they 're on me ...
 Who does n't love Levis ? These are great ! My son was happy on Christmas day and so were we . Happy Holidays !
 It is great to find the exact size , color , and fit you want in a Levi 's jean , and also get it on time .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean , Medium Stonewash , 38x29They fit perfectly . Will probably order more in a couple months .
 Needed a size that few brick & mortar stores keep in stock . Amazon had style I wanted in the size that I wanted at a good price !
 These blue jeans where a great color and a perfect fit . Glad I ordered them . They were a present for my son
 My husband has been wearing Levi 's since he was a teenager . They are the most durable jeans and he loves the boot cut .
 It 's very good ! 100 % cottonThe higher rise sits comfortably at the waist.A fit you want from a brand you trustFit width & length ; !
 non common size request was delivered promply before Christmas . My son was very happy with the fit and color .
 Great product ... my dad was very pleased . He had not been able to find the 517 .
 These were a birthday gift for my son and I had them sent directly to him at college . He loved them and they fit great ! Good quality for the price . He liked the fit of the boot cut .
 These are great jeans for us gals , too , especially if you like to wear a true black color . I dress them up with a feminine camisole and heels , and have got many compliments on them .
 Exactly what my hubby wants . It 's difficult to find his size in our local stores . Very happy Amazon now has Levi 's in his size .
 I love my new bootcuts . I received them quickly , They fit perfectly . Thank you .
 I 've grown frustrated by the lack of good quality/reasonably priced jeans in the market today . At some point , the Levis brand started to suffer in terms of quality/value for the dollar . Do n't remember exactly when that happened , but I started to buy my jeans from Banana Republic . Over time , they stopped making the style I grew to rely on . This created a 7-10 stretch where I could n't seem to find a good pair of jeans . Most recently , I purchased a pair of Lucky jeans - ridiculously over priced . When those began to fail , I tried Levis again and bought these . For a third of the price of Lucky Jeans , these Levis boot-cut jeans are really nice . They have a really substantial feel/weight to them and I could n't be happier with the purchase . I was so pleased , I ended up buying a second pair .
 Finally figured out what cut and size I like , but the only place I can find them is the internet . Great pants .
 These were ordered off Amazon when I could not find them locally . I found the pants and they are describer perfectly and fit exactly as I had wanted them to . I will buy more in the future because they were perfect .
 Completamente satisfecha con el producto , exactamente igual a lo que ofrecieron . LLego en el tiempo estimado que prometieron . Ninguna queja , volveria a comprar de nuevo .
 The Levi jeans were just like I expected . The fit was perfect and received them in just a few days . Thanks !!
 The quality of the denim is lighter , so the good fit disappears by the end of the day . Otherwise , I like 'em !
 Hubby dearest was so happy to find boot cut Levi jeans at Amazon as it seems most stores have quit carrying this style of jean . He likes to wear boot cut jeans and Levi jeans are his favorite brand.No complaints about the fit or wearability either . Ordered two more pairs of jeans today as he 's a happy camper.Recommend .
 Good deal on the jeans and speedy shipping . My first pair of boot cut jeans . My girl friend really likes them on me . I got the dark blue -LRB- rinse -RRB- . Fit good and comfortable .
 My skinny son is 54 years old and will not wear any other jeans - only 517 , boot cut Levi 's so I know what to buy for Christmas and Birthdays . I found a perfect fit for my skinny husband also .
 I ordered these jeansLevi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jeanfor a Christmas gift a short time before Christmas . I knew the size . I was somewhat concerned that I would not get them on time for Christmas The package came just before Christmas , and the jeans were exactly as pictured , nicely packaged -LRB- each pair separately enclosed in plastic bag -RRB- , the right size and color . I was very pleased , as was the recipient of the gift !
 These T shirts are the best around , I 'm serious , they are very strong and very soft . A couple friends of mine work in the silkscreening business and told me that the `` Hanes Beefy T '' was THE best out there , so I ordered 6 of them on their advice . I 've never seen T shirts this nice , they are the most comfortable , strongest , and they feel like they will last forever . I 'm so happy with these shirts , they are awesome .
 I had some compression shirts from about 5 years ago . These new ones are not the same fabric quality as they used to be , fabric is lighter and less stretchy . Despite they fit perfectly and work fine , I 'm worried about the durabilty of the shirt .
 I ordered five of these for Christmas gifts ... all were happy with their pashminas . For southern California , this is the perfect weight -- enough to keep the chill off when used as a wrap , but light enough to be used as a scarf too . The extra width and length make it a good thing to take as a light blanket on a plane . Colors shown are true .

 perfect except the size did n't work for me . A little too warm for me but the ruggedness and the number of pockets makes it above any other product
 VERY well made and nearly bullet-proof ! Very warm and comfy . Obviously , a lot of thought went into the design of these and the materials and construction are truly excellent for the money . If I could make one improvement it would be the addition of shoulder-gussets . I sometimes almost feel claustrophobic when I 'm trying to accomplish something that requires alot of shoulder movement like pruning trees or shoveling snow . Other than that they are great and you will definitely like them .
 When I looked at the sizing charts - I bought a 38 - had to return it for a 42 - that fits perfectly !!! Now he is just waiting for the weather to get cold !! He loves them !!
 My husband loves how these coveralls fit and feel . They seem true to size , but I ca n't speak about their durability yet -LRB- I have no doubts -RRB-
 Super piece of clothing for the cold of winter when you are working outside . Keeps out the cold drafts as well since it is a once piece item .

 These pants are great for comfort . True value for the price . So said , there is no individual waist band . Also when you sit normally on a chair , the white fabric inside your side pockets is clearly visible . They could have used the same fabric as the color of the trousers . So , all in all I gave a 4 star .
 I bought two pair to test as work pants . I also bought two pair of another brand . It has been months now , and the pants seem to wear well , and they do not wrinkle . From the washing machine to the dryer , to me in the morning . They always look sharp , and they fit well . That 's all I asked for , and they delivered .
 Useful pants for almost every ocasion . Color does not fade easily . Nice fit .
 I do n't need to tell men over six feet tall or with waists greater than 38 '' that you can burn a ton of gas trying to find clothes that fit . Dockers is a known quantity . So once you find your size , it 's down hill from there . A good price rounds-out the experience .
 The pants are well made , and good quality . I was disappointed in the Individual Fit Waistband ... it hardly gives at all .
 These are great pants and at a great price . I usually have to drive a long way to find a store that has my size .
 There was a far greater ability to get the Dockers I wanted through this vendor than by going to ANY department store . And the prices were significantly better online . The delivery time was a bit slow -- but the time was known at the time I made the purchase -- no false promises of fast delivery . I 'm delighted with this transaction .
 I 've always been a Dockers fan.I love the fit of the flat front . The fabric does n't just crease any how . I love it .
 an excellent pant , comfortable , smooth , good packaging , the measure of pant in line with what the seller say .
 Just right ! It does n't matter how many times it 's been crumpled or washed , it does n't need to be ironed and the crease stays put . The waistline is n't too high , and it 's not too baggy or too tight . Formal enough for work , casual enough for anything else ; I 've even hiked in them -LRB- and the mud stains came right off in one cycle in the wash -RRB- . These are , hands-down , my favorite pants .
 These are the one and only , classic fit original khaki pants from Dockers . The Dockers label is the Kleenex of khaki pants . . the Rolls Royce ... the Xerox . The name is synonymous with the semi-casual look . These pants go great with a leather belt w / cell phone clipped , polo shirt , a clean shave and a crew cut .
 The item is well liked by my husband is one of his favorites since it fit adequately and comfortable .
 It 's nice to find a pair of pants that do n't need any work to fit me right out of the package ! Bought another pair in gray as soon as I used this ones for the first time .
 My teenaged son needs 30x34 pants - which are the dickens to find , even in the big department stores . This fits , and is comparable in price to what I find in the big stores on sale .
 The slacks arrived very quickly . They are a brand new , high-quality product in great shape .
 I have owned many pairs of Dockers Flat Front Original Khaki pants and have always loved them . They are the perfect casual work pant and are comfortable to wear . They do n't usually wrinkle much and they hold up well . I would consider these a good investment . The waist seems to run slightly smaller than many other pants so you may want to get one size larger than you normally would .
 I wo n't give them 5 stars because they 're not really as wrinkle-free as they advertised or as my similar Van Heusen khakis . Either way , they are still light and tr&eacute;s comfortable .
 These pants are wonderful , I have boxy hips and the flat front style takes away from that particular silhouette a and I like that
 Great quality , no time waisted and plenty of choices regarding sizes and color . I will never buy them at the store .
 fit great , feel great , durable , and it works well in both my professional and casual wardrobe

 I do n't need to tell men over six feet tall or with waists greater than 38 '' that you can burn a ton of gas trying to find clothes that fit . Dockers is a known quantity . So once you find your size , it 's down hill from there . A good price rounds-out the experience .
 The pants are well made , and good quality . I was disappointed in the Individual Fit Waistband ... it hardly gives at all .
 These are great pants and at a great price . I usually have to drive a long way to find a store that has my size .
 There was a far greater ability to get the Dockers I wanted through this vendor than by going to ANY department store . And the prices were significantly better online . The delivery time was a bit slow -- but the time was known at the time I made the purchase -- no false promises of fast delivery . I 'm delighted with this transaction .
 I wanted a wallet for my son who , like most boys , is totally into anything military . One of the interior pockets also secures with velcro , so there is a place to store change , a key , other small things . Great for kids who are n't in the practice of keeping their change in their pockets like `` grown men '' . We have n't had it for long , but the material seems very durable and the velcro seems strong . Great value !
 I bought this scarf to cover a recent surgery scar on my upper neck.The scarf covers perfectly when tied in a knot on opposite side of scar.The black is jet black which I wanted .
 Perfect size to tie around the neck and pair with a nice work shirt . Color is very elegant . Fabric of good quality .
 I ordered seven of the 30x30 scarves . Not one of them was 30x30 . I measured each one . I had everything from 29x29 , 29.75 x30 to 29.75 x29 .75 so I am glad I went with the larger scarf . One scarf had a hole in it but I did not notice it until I went to use it . It is small but I was past the exchange date when I found it so I have one scarf with a small hole . The scarves are soft , shiny and very comfortable . I highly recommend going over the scarf more carefully upon arrival than I did so you can take advantage of the exchange policy if needed .
 This vibrant red scarf is 100 % polyester , but with the folds ironed out , it looks like a satin material . The quality of the scarf and of Wolfmark neckwear as a company I recommend . The 30 X 30 size is what works best for me , as I am able to tie it in many ways and to wear it with different looks . I found a very nice website tutorial that shows 21 different ways to tie a scarf . The 30 X 30 is probably the size to work best in trying all 21 . There is a black , sleeveless tank I wear that this with tied in cravat fashion . It 's also large enough to wear as a bandeau , not to mention how pretty it is as a standard wispy wrap for my neck . Thank you , Wolfmark !
 Great scarf ! I searched the web high and low before I came across this scarf
 Nice quality scarf . I can tell it will last a long time and it feels great . I got it in white , but if I needed another solid scarf to match a different outfit , I 'd get this brand . I like scarves and I 'm happy to confirm that I do n't have to spend $ 40 in a department store to get a good one .
 I love my new scarf . The item arrived as detailed and much sooner than I thought it would . The color is beautiful and I will surely order from this vendor again .
 I got this to use as part of a Fred -LRB- from Scooby Doo -RRB- costume . It 's fabulous . I think it 's worth the money regardless of the circumstance you 're planning for it .
 I was extremely satisfied with this product . The scarf has good texture . It shipped nicely . I ll buy more .
 These T shirts are the best around , I 'm serious , they are very strong and very soft . A couple friends of mine work in the silkscreening business and told me that the `` Hanes Beefy T '' was THE best out there , so I ordered 6 of them on their advice . I 've never seen T shirts this nice , they are the most comfortable , strongest , and they feel like they will last forever . I 'm so happy with these shirts , they are awesome .

 I ordered the Ecko Unltd . Men 's Core Full-Zip Hoody for my son for Christmas . It is a heavy hoody and the quality is outstanding . Although pricy , it was what he wanted and most of the `` name brand '' hoodies are n't cheap . I found the best price here though and the shipping was n't outrageous . The item arrived in a timely manner , undamaged , and I was pleasantly surprised at it 's quality . I will order again from this company .
 Great Products - the pony tail scarf and glasses were the perfect final touch to my 50 's costume !! Fast Shipping along with the BEST Customer Service I have seen in years ! Thanks Viv !!
 These were perfect for my 50 's get up . They are sturdy and the arecomfortable . Had lots of compliments .

 These pants are great for comfort . True value for the price . So said , there is no individual waist band . Also when you sit normally on a chair , the white fabric inside your side pockets is clearly visible . They could have used the same fabric as the color of the trousers . So , all in all I gave a 4 star .
 I bought two pair to test as work pants . I also bought two pair of another brand . It has been months now , and the pants seem to wear well , and they do not wrinkle . From the washing machine to the dryer , to me in the morning . They always look sharp , and they fit well . That 's all I asked for , and they delivered .

 I 've always been a Dockers fan.I love the fit of the flat front . The fabric does n't just crease any how . I love it .
 an excellent pant , comfortable , smooth , good packaging , the measure of pant in line with what the seller say .
 Just right ! It does n't matter how many times it 's been crumpled or washed , it does n't need to be ironed and the crease stays put . The waistline is n't too high , and it 's not too baggy or too tight . Formal enough for work , casual enough for anything else ; I 've even hiked in them -LRB- and the mud stains came right off in one cycle in the wash -RRB- . These are , hands-down , my favorite pants .
 These are the one and only , classic fit original khaki pants from Dockers . The Dockers label is the Kleenex of khaki pants . . the Rolls Royce ... the Xerox . The name is synonymous with the semi-casual look . These pants go great with a leather belt w / cell phone clipped , polo shirt , a clean shave and a crew cut .
 The item is well liked by my husband is one of his favorites since it fit adequately and comfortable .
 It 's nice to find a pair of pants that do n't need any work to fit me right out of the package ! Bought another pair in gray as soon as I used this ones for the first time .
 My teenaged son needs 30x34 pants - which are the dickens to find , even in the big department stores . This fits , and is comparable in price to what I find in the big stores on sale .
 The slacks arrived very quickly . They are a brand new , high-quality product in great shape .
 I have owned many pairs of Dockers Flat Front Original Khaki pants and have always loved them . They are the perfect casual work pant and are comfortable to wear . They do n't usually wrinkle much and they hold up well . I would consider these a good investment . The waist seems to run slightly smaller than many other pants so you may want to get one size larger than you normally would .
 I wo n't give them 5 stars because they 're not really as wrinkle-free as they advertised or as my similar Van Heusen khakis . Either way , they are still light and tr&eacute;s comfortable .
 These pants are wonderful , I have boxy hips and the flat front style takes away from that particular silhouette a and I like that
 Great quality , no time waisted and plenty of choices regarding sizes and color . I will never buy them at the store .
 fit great , feel great , durable , and it works well in both my professional and casual wardrobe
 Gorgeous embroidery on beautiful but itchy sweater . Also , front embroidery lessens the overall give factor of the sweater , which may be a problem for the fuller-figured amongst us . Either get a bigger size or realize that it wo n't lie on you quite as nicely as it does on the petite model wearing the sweater in the picture .

 I have bought this costume for my 1 year old . He does n't like hats . When I got this I was worried that he may not like the head part of it.But it was so comfortable he did n't complain at all . I am very happy about the product except that it deffinitely does n't look like the picture . When I open the box I got little bit dissapointed because I was expecting something red color and furry like in the picture . But the costume was orange and it was a thin piece of cloth . No fures . Later , I was glad that it was thin cause the wheater was hot during Halloween . If you want to buy something budget but nice looking highly reccomend .
 Very cute , nice quality costume . Fits well . So buy the correct size . I love this costume would buy again & recoment to others

 There was a far greater ability to get the Dockers I wanted through this vendor than by going to ANY department store . And the prices were significantly better online . The delivery time was a bit slow -- but the time was known at the time I made the purchase -- no false promises of fast delivery . I 'm delighted with this transaction .
 I 've always been a Dockers fan.I love the fit of the flat front . The fabric does n't just crease any how . I love it .
 an excellent pant , comfortable , smooth , good packaging , the measure of pant in line with what the seller say .
 Just right ! It does n't matter how many times it 's been crumpled or washed , it does n't need to be ironed and the crease stays put . The waistline is n't too high , and it 's not too baggy or too tight . Formal enough for work , casual enough for anything else ; I 've even hiked in them -LRB- and the mud stains came right off in one cycle in the wash -RRB- . These are , hands-down , my favorite pants .
 These are the one and only , classic fit original khaki pants from Dockers . The Dockers label is the Kleenex of khaki pants . . the Rolls Royce ... the Xerox . The name is synonymous with the semi-casual look . These pants go great with a leather belt w / cell phone clipped , polo shirt , a clean shave and a crew cut .
 The item is well liked by my husband is one of his favorites since it fit adequately and comfortable .
 It 's nice to find a pair of pants that do n't need any work to fit me right out of the package ! Bought another pair in gray as soon as I used this ones for the first time .
 My teenaged son needs 30x34 pants - which are the dickens to find , even in the big department stores . This fits , and is comparable in price to what I find in the big stores on sale .
 The slacks arrived very quickly . They are a brand new , high-quality product in great shape .
 I have owned many pairs of Dockers Flat Front Original Khaki pants and have always loved them . They are the perfect casual work pant and are comfortable to wear . They do n't usually wrinkle much and they hold up well . I would consider these a good investment . The waist seems to run slightly smaller than many other pants so you may want to get one size larger than you normally would .
 I wo n't give them 5 stars because they 're not really as wrinkle-free as they advertised or as my similar Van Heusen khakis . Either way , they are still light and tr&eacute;s comfortable .
 These pants are wonderful , I have boxy hips and the flat front style takes away from that particular silhouette a and I like that
 Great quality , no time waisted and plenty of choices regarding sizes and color . I will never buy them at the store .
 fit great , feel great , durable , and it works well in both my professional and casual wardrobe

 The slacks arrived very quickly . They are a brand new , high-quality product in great shape .
 These pants are great for comfort . True value for the price . So said , there is no individual waist band . Also when you sit normally on a chair , the white fabric inside your side pockets is clearly visible . They could have used the same fabric as the color of the trousers . So , all in all I gave a 4 star .
 I bought two pair to test as work pants . I also bought two pair of another brand . It has been months now , and the pants seem to wear well , and they do not wrinkle . From the washing machine to the dryer , to me in the morning . They always look sharp , and they fit well . That 's all I asked for , and they delivered .
 Useful pants for almost every ocasion . Color does not fade easily . Nice fit .
 I do n't need to tell men over six feet tall or with waists greater than 38 '' that you can burn a ton of gas trying to find clothes that fit . Dockers is a known quantity . So once you find your size , it 's down hill from there . A good price rounds-out the experience .
 The pants are well made , and good quality . I was disappointed in the Individual Fit Waistband ... it hardly gives at all .
 These are great pants and at a great price . I usually have to drive a long way to find a store that has my size .

 These cases are much bigger than I expected which is great . The only downside I have noticed so far is with the zippers . They are hard to open and close because they get stuck . Other than that they seem like nice BIG bags ...
 Gorgeous embroidery on beautiful but itchy sweater . Also , front embroidery lessens the overall give factor of the sweater , which may be a problem for the fuller-figured amongst us . Either get a bigger size or realize that it wo n't lie on you quite as nicely as it does on the petite model wearing the sweater in the picture .

 These T shirts are the best around , I 'm serious , they are very strong and very soft . A couple friends of mine work in the silkscreening business and told me that the `` Hanes Beefy T '' was THE best out there , so I ordered 6 of them on their advice . I 've never seen T shirts this nice , they are the most comfortable , strongest , and they feel like they will last forever . I 'm so happy with these shirts , they are awesome .
 These are great t-shirts and my boys love them . They are active in sports and there is nothing better than having these shirts to wear . They take the wear and tear and come back for more ! I highly recommend them !

 Some shoe bags are extremely expensive and too small to fit a pair of running shoes . These are inexpensive , washable and expendable . I use one of the bags for international plugs and cell phone and laptop batteries , so they can be used for other things and not just shoes .
 I brought them for Christmas gifts for all of my staff . They all loved them . Thanks for getting them to me before Christmas .
 I am so glad I bought many of these shoe bags in both black and natural because I need alot when shoe boxes get banged up in the closet after time and it 's a nice drawstring bag for packing into luggage . Bag is also useful for many other small items such as toiletries/hair dryer/curling iron etc. . Nothing fancy just practical & I should have bought oodles of these sooner as it 's a must have all purpose storage/traveling/camping item . I was thinking of decorating a few bags to for crafting items as you can paint the canvas for gifts in these too . Possibilities are nearly endless . 5 stars
 Great Products - the pony tail scarf and glasses were the perfect final touch to my 50 's costume !! Fast Shipping along with the BEST Customer Service I have seen in years ! Thanks Viv !!
 These were perfect for my 50 's get up . They are sturdy and the arecomfortable . Had lots of compliments .
 Nice fit . Excellent material . Wore these to a recent gay pride pool party . Everyone loved them . From what -LSB- eople said , i think several will order their own colors . I own 4 pair in different colors and love them all . The colors are beautiful . Get a pair and enjoy them .
 I tryed ordering the swim suit listed on their web sight in the photo ad . Unfortunately I tried many times with specific instructions to make sure the color was that used in the ad photo , but never got that color . I do have many of the other colors of that swim brief and like them very much . I really wanted that color used in the ad photo , so I 'm very disappointed in that respect . The reason from the company Bonnie & Clyde was that the color dyes were too hard to match the one in the photo . Order was not the last order , but a previous order for the color Hawaiian Blue .
 Nice fitting suite and comfortable.Good looking and well made.Would recomend these to anyone interestedin bikini style swim wear .

 Excellent T shirt , soft and fits well . Good construction . Should last for the entire training year . Not much more I can say , its a good quality product .
 I ordered the Ecko Unltd . Men 's Core Full-Zip Hoody for my son for Christmas . It is a heavy hoody and the quality is outstanding . Although pricy , it was what he wanted and most of the `` name brand '' hoodies are n't cheap . I found the best price here though and the shipping was n't outrageous . The item arrived in a timely manner , undamaged , and I was pleasantly surprised at it 's quality . I will order again from this company .
 Grandson loves his railroad clothes . Wo n't wear anything else and loved this tshirt . Grandpa worked for BNSF and they do n't have a lot of kids tshirts . Amazon filled the bill .
 Perfect Silk Scarf.All my life my sisters and I have worn those little satin scarves from beauty stores or discount department stores like walmart and target . But with my new hair routine I 'm only using the best - the best products , best oils , and the best scarves . I knew that silk was the best I could do , so I searched the net and narrowed down my search to a scarf I found on ebay and on here . This one for its size is the best.The 30 by 30 in black for 24 dollars plus shipping is a steal . My hair retains so much moisture . I also purchased a silk pillow case -LRB- the pillowcase happened to be cheaper on ebay -RRB- . What I love most about this scarf is the size - it even fits when I sleep with big rollers -LRB- after setting my hair -RRB- - it still covers my hair nicely.Great buy and I feel all women of color should have a silk scarf for their hair , it retains so much more moisture , and this scarf will last substantially longer than those little satin scarves .
 The quality is excellent - exactly what I expected based on the product description . My order arrived quickly , but they had made a mistake and sent one scarf in the wrong color . I notified them via email . I told them I was returning the unwanted scarf and requested a replacement . They responded very quickly , informing me they were sending the correct color and told me to keep the other scarf . I was thrilled by the fact that I did not have to go to the post office to mail a package back to them . In the future I will always purchase my scarves from Wolfmark . It is convenient and the quality , price and customer service are excellent.I would like to comment on a review left by another customer who was disappointed in the packaging . The scarf was packaged in an unmarked , sealed plastic bag - adequate to protect the product and ensure it arrived undamaged . Vendors who use elaborate packaging must pass that cost on to the consumer . I prefer not to pay extra for packaging that I am going to throw away and believe that simple packaging is better for the environment . I prefer the quality to be in the product as opposed to the packaging .
 Written by recipient ; -RRB- There are other reviews which are somewhat critical of the packaging . Personally I do n't care about that . The silk was of good quality and the color was even and consistent - not always the case at this price point . The only real issue was the measurements . We would have liked a wider longer version and we would have given them 5 stars . 10-12 '' by 5 ft would be great . If you are small busted and petite then these will be GREAT for you , but if you have a serious bust then the simple knot will not work the ends will stick out on you .
 I ordered a Navy Blue scarf because I wanted something very dark but not entirely black . The scarf that they call `` navy blue '' is actually a `` royal blue '' - much brighter and lighter than I intended . The quality of the scarf is fine , but the color is not what I expected or thought I had ordered .
 I purchased this scarf as a gift . I decided to shop Amazon because I needed a white silk scarf and could n't find any in the department stores . The recipient seemed very pleased and wrapped it around her neck as soon as she opened it purring , oooh I like it .
 These came in beautiful condition . I purchased several in different colors . I have put them aside for use as I need them for accent .
 So seeing as how I am african american and I wrap my hair every night I 'm always on the hunt for a good scarf . This size and consistency is great . Obviously the only downside is that it has the tendency to slip off your hair at a more rapid rate than a cloth one but you ca n't beat the benefits it provides . I wish it was a little cheaper but I have n't found a better deal for the quality so I 'm probably going to be pruchasing another one . I purchased the 30 X 30 in black .
 I am a woman of color and purchased this silk scarf as a hair wrap . I love it . I finally found a 100 % silk scarf to use as part of my healthy hair care regimen . I read the previous reviews and was afraid to purchase because there seemed to be mixed feelings about it , but I am glad that I did . It 's great quality material and serves the purpose for which I purchased it for . Yes it came in a little plastic envelope , but I do n't care too much about the packaging . Great quality , good size , and a pretty good price . I think I made a good choice . I will say that the color was n't what I thought it would be . I ordered the 30 &#34; x30 &#34; in fuschia but it looked more like a bright pink . I still like it . If you 're looking for a good satin scarf for your hair I would definitely purchase it . I 'm even considering purchasing the longer one to use as maybe a winter scarf for further hair protection during the winter . Rather have silk rubbing against my nape than a cotton scarf . I hope this helped someone !
 It 's very pretty , but it puckers slightly on the edges where it 's stitched . However , I feel that it 's a good value .
 The color is a perfect green for me , not too light and not too dark . It feels soooooooo luxurious around my neck .
 This is not a large scarf but PERFECT for what I wanted . My wife loves it ... nice color , nice material . Perfect.WV Crockett
 These scarves are pretty nice - soft and vibrant color . However , they are a little small for me , so I could n't use them and had to give them away ! But they are nice items .
 These T shirts are the best around , I 'm serious , they are very strong and very soft . A couple friends of mine work in the silkscreening business and told me that the `` Hanes Beefy T '' was THE best out there , so I ordered 6 of them on their advice . I 've never seen T shirts this nice , they are the most comfortable , strongest , and they feel like they will last forever . I 'm so happy with these shirts , they are awesome .
 These are great t-shirts and my boys love them . They are active in sports and there is nothing better than having these shirts to wear . They take the wear and tear and come back for more ! I highly recommend them !
 I ordered the Ecko Unltd . Men 's Core Full-Zip Hoody for my son for Christmas . It is a heavy hoody and the quality is outstanding . Although pricy , it was what he wanted and most of the `` name brand '' hoodies are n't cheap . I found the best price here though and the shipping was n't outrageous . The item arrived in a timely manner , undamaged , and I was pleasantly surprised at it 's quality . I will order again from this company .

 Absolutely fabulous . I bought the Royal , the color is amazing . I paid around 3 times the cost of the bag for shipping , but really worth it . I will buy another.Please note it 's relatively small , see its dimensions and make sure it meets your needs .
 My son loves this shirt ! It was shipped quickly and arrived in excellent condition . Launders well .

 If you are going to buy a hat for the cold winter months , you might as well spend a little extra and get something that is well worth it . Soft , warm and comfortable .
 I absolutely love these scarves . I ordered the stripes and the polka dots . The print is beautiful , the silk is nice quality , but the scarves are so tiny ! I should have double checked since the measurements are indeed listed on the product page ... They still work fine and look wonderful when worn , but unless $ 20 is insignificant to you , just know for sure what you 'll be getting for the money . :-RRB- Thankfully , they only charged me the $ 5 shipping once even though I ordered two scarves . Nice !

 I purchased the Mighty Mouse stuffed animal along with the Mighty Mouse keychain as a Christmas gift for a friend who is nicknamed `` Mighty Mouse '' and it was definitely a hit !!! I was so glad to be able to actually find something pertaining to the old cartoon !! Loved it !! Thanks so very much !

 My son works as a welder/ship fitter on the north coast of Washington . He works outside most of the time in cold damp weather during the winter months . We bought the Carhartt Arctic Quilt Coverall for him as a Christmas gift . He is delighted and said that he does n't have to wear much more -LRB- except a hoodie for welding -RRB- and keeps nice and warm without feeling overly bulky . Nice product . .
 Nice fit . Excellent material . Wore these to a recent gay pride pool party . Everyone loved them . From what -LSB- eople said , i think several will order their own colors . I own 4 pair in different colors and love them all . The colors are beautiful . Get a pair and enjoy them .
 I tryed ordering the swim suit listed on their web sight in the photo ad . Unfortunately I tried many times with specific instructions to make sure the color was that used in the ad photo , but never got that color . I do have many of the other colors of that swim brief and like them very much . I really wanted that color used in the ad photo , so I 'm very disappointed in that respect . The reason from the company Bonnie & Clyde was that the color dyes were too hard to match the one in the photo . Order was not the last order , but a previous order for the color Hawaiian Blue .
 Nice fitting suite and comfortable.Good looking and well made.Would recomend these to anyone interestedin bikini style swim wear .
 These T shirts are the best around , I 'm serious , they are very strong and very soft . A couple friends of mine work in the silkscreening business and told me that the `` Hanes Beefy T '' was THE best out there , so I ordered 6 of them on their advice . I 've never seen T shirts this nice , they are the most comfortable , strongest , and they feel like they will last forever . I 'm so happy with these shirts , they are awesome .
 I loved this costume ! This truly had the best quality of any costume I ever ordered ! I ordered a medium and that fit perfect although I usually order a small so I would probably suggest going up a size . The costume was an adorable velvet and I just love it .
 I ordered the Ecko Unltd . Men 's Core Full-Zip Hoody for my son for Christmas . It is a heavy hoody and the quality is outstanding . Although pricy , it was what he wanted and most of the `` name brand '' hoodies are n't cheap . I found the best price here though and the shipping was n't outrageous . The item arrived in a timely manner , undamaged , and I was pleasantly surprised at it 's quality . I will order again from this company .
 I was thinking it of using it for my tennis . Unfortunately there was no clue saying it dint have pockets . Anyways its a good shorts for great price .
 If you go to the gym or play ball a lot and need a couple pair of shorts so you do n't need to do laundry every other day , these athletic shorts are perfect . They 're thin but durable . I got them on sale for like $ 10 so they do the trick . Do n't get me wrong its not like you 'll look like a dork at the gym , but if you 're looking for something super flashy , then these are n't them .
 Nice shorts that match almost everything . My boyfriend loves to wear them around the house . Great pair of shorts for an extremely great price ! So buy a couple pairs just to have around !
 no pockets , but yann will wear them all summer.yeehaw .
 My son likes these to sleep and wear under pants in winter . They are perfect , washing easily , and retaining their size and color .
 I like the shorts . The price is excellent . The shorts were a little thinner than I imagined . But I am very satisfied with the purchase .
 I have the scrimmage dazzle too they re thin but durable and for 10.00 cool ! no pockets ok for me , lightweight shortsexcellent and Roomy my favorites great price buying of couple more
 My boyfriend says that these are his favorite shorts . Nice and roomy with some breathing room .

 I 've been wearing Dickies painters pants for the last 10 years . They are very comfortable and durable . I used to buy them at a local uniform store until their prices were increased . I was so excited when I found them at an inexpensive price . Shipping time was really fast which is important to me , since I wear them everyday .
 Great quality for a great price . They fit right , and are both comfortable and functional . The order was also processed on time . I highly recomend them .
 My husband loved them . Shipped quickly and seller had great communication . Will shop again ! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA +
 These utility -LRB- painters -RRB- pants are excellent ! The sizing is accurate and the pants are very comfortable and exactly as described .
 An absolute necessity for the true Husker fan , these classic white Dickies make even huskermike the envy of Lincoln on game day .
 Everything about this order was exactly as I needed it to be . The sizes are accurate , the colors are correct and there are no flaws in workmanship that I have seen . The order shipped and arrived within the allotted time . I was much more satisfied with my online purchases than I was with my in-store ones this year . NO returns ! Yay ! Amazon was a holiday success that I will be using again .
 Most Excellent purchase . This was much better than expected . I would recommend to everyone , price was perfect , delivery was fast ... bought 2 pair
 priced , quality , delivery time i have no complaints . was not a &#34; pure white &#34; as i thought they would be which is what i needed so i dyed them blue and now i really love them
 I got these acutally as part of a Halloween costume , but I 'm glad I have them now . I will use them whenever I 'm doing work around the house or something that requires work-type pants .
 These pants are a little tight around the waist for me , but are otherwise perfect . The pants are well constructed and durable . It 's also worth more than I paid for .
 These are great pants . Nice relax fit , lots of pockets , good length , jeans like material , tough stitching and priced for sale . You can use them for what ever you feel like
 I love wearing white painter pants in the summer and while golfing too . Pockets to hold stuff , fit nicely and after a few washings become more soft .
 This is the perfect pair of pants if your kid has to wear white pants to an FFA , 4-H or other similar event . They are rugged and are kept clean easily as long as they are only soiled with dirt and other farm animal type waste .
 I have ordered 4 pair of these pants . They work for me very well . There are some variations in them when I order each of them at different times or dates . However the quality has always been good . When I say `` vaiations '' it is in regard to small differences concerning the making of the pants . Two pair of pants have thicker pocket matterial than the other two pair . Two pair have extra pockets that the other two pair did not have . Two pair have realy deep pockets , and the other two pair have `` less '' deep pockets . However , the differences are not in any way a problem for my use of the pants . They also shrink when washing the pants and drying them on a clothes line or in the dryer makes no difference . -LRB- The pants shrink -RRB- My 42 inch waist pants shrank to around 40 inches around the waist . Even when useing cold water the pants will shrink when they dry . So if you wear 40 inch waist size you should buy 42 size waiste.If 30 inch waist then buy 32 inch waist size or you might be in a tight situation . Great pants over all and good quality .
 The title says it all . This is my first ever purchase of a Dickies product , and I am very pleased with the fit and finish of the jeans .
 I 'm a women that works for a drywall and painting company . Everbody on both crews has at least 2 pairs of these . I 'm not the only women on the crews , there are 2 others . And these fit us as well as they do the men ! Which is amazing because the difference in our sizes . I 'm a 2 , one is an 8 , and another a 14 . They are n't tight fitting and immodest for work . They fit like you would expect good quality slacks to . They 're durable and are n't see through like most whites . With all the chemicals and paints I work with , my clothes have got to be tough . I would recommend these to anyone in any profession , even for just working at home , these are great !
 Medium weight cloth - sturdy but not too heavy . Use these pants in the summer while doing chores in the yard and woods . Good fit -- size was accurate , both length & waist were good . Not too tight . Like the natural color . Good quality & value .
 Okay , so this was a BIG issue for me.Of course , in nursing school , we have to wear uniform scrubs . Ours are a standard teal uniform top with white scrub pants and white shoes . This last summer I went to all the local medical supply shops to buy scrubs and was a bit overwhelmed . -LRB- Have you noticed how many different shades of `` teal '' there are ? -RRB- After a considerable hit to my starving student budget , I wound up with some of the most ill-fitting , `` unisex '' white pants you could ever imagine.I do n't know about you guys , but I am built like a typical middle aged guy . I got a little bit of a gut and pretty much nothing on the backside . These silly , drawstring pants are made for people with HIPS . Oh , and do n't forget , it 's only tighty-whities while wearing these things . Those boxer shorts with the hearts on them that you love so much are showing right through . And forget putting anything in the pockets . That just weighed them down more.I found myself spending my clinical days walking around the hospital with my binder in one hand and the other holding my pants up ! It became enough of an issue that I had to talk to my instructors to work something out.It was Sherwin-Williams to the rescue . Down at my local paint supply store I found the perfect solution . They were Dickies Relaxed Fit utility pants . I had to trim the Sherwin-Williams patch off the back pocket , but I think these things saved my sanity . They are sized to fit me both in the waist and the legs . They have BELT LOOPS . I can load up my pockets with anything I need without having to worry about the `` saggy britches syndrome . '' Most importantly , I can wear whatever underwear I want.I would encourage anyone , even the ladies , to try these out before spending more money on scrub pants . They are comparable in price , much more sturdy , and just as comfortable . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 I love these pants I bought in a local store , so wanted a couple more pairs . DO NOT order here from Andrew Christion . Terrible seller . I ordered twice and never got the pants . When I emailed there was always an excuse but no pants .
 I shop for quality & price , found these Dickies Men 's Utility Pant = Painters Pant to be an excellent bargain . Good fit , well made , quality materials and true to size . Lightweight enough and flexible for hot Florida sun temps .
 exactly what I wanted . not baggy , not to tight , fits just nicely on me and I 'm not super skinny , fat , or buff . -LRB- I 'm a martial artist -RRB- bought them for comic con , and for making several videos . the pants fit nicely , and are even comfortable for performing stunts .
 These seem to be fine painters pants , although I bought them for a costume/outfit that needed white pants . I am used to wearing loose fitting jeans , and these are not , so they are a bit tight in my legs . If I needed them for work pants , they would probably be too tight and I would instead return and order a larger size .
 The truth I can not review this product because I know much but my husband was fascinated and if you know much about that kind of pants and if he is happy what I can say is that the pants are well
 My son was in his high school musical this year , and needed a pair of white pants , and a pair of brown pants . Where DO you get odd colored jean-like pants ... for a boy ? -LRB- No girl jeans , Mom ! -RRB- Oh , right , Amazon . I got two pair , and dyed one pair brown . I felt the price was reasonable enough that it would n't leave a huge hole in the family budget , since I did n't think he 'd actually wear the things once the musical was over -LRB- like a bridesmaid dress ; does anyone ever get any use out of those ? -RRB- . I gave four stars , because the waistband on one pair was a full inch smaller than the other . Not a problem for a skinny teenager , but maybe an issue for someone with an adult metabolism .
 Nice fit . Excellent material . Wore these to a recent gay pride pool party . Everyone loved them . From what -LSB- eople said , i think several will order their own colors . I own 4 pair in different colors and love them all . The colors are beautiful . Get a pair and enjoy them .

 I absolutely love these scarves . I ordered the stripes and the polka dots . The print is beautiful , the silk is nice quality , but the scarves are so tiny ! I should have double checked since the measurements are indeed listed on the product page ... They still work fine and look wonderful when worn , but unless $ 20 is insignificant to you , just know for sure what you 'll be getting for the money . :-RRB- Thankfully , they only charged me the $ 5 shipping once even though I ordered two scarves . Nice !
 IT TOTALLY MET MY EXPECTATIONS SAME COLORS AS YOU SEE ON THE SCREEN 100 % SILK AMAZING FABRIC I HIGHLY RECOMENDED

 I got this pretty much because I like the colors . Of course being an Everlast product is also a plus . It 's comfortable and it looks good .
 Excellent , it is the perfect both formal and informal carry computer case . It 's strong , well designed . Just got it and like it very much . I hope it lasts . I was suprised for the well done design . I Recommend it .
 I was quite pleased with the quality of the garment . Very well made and fit is true to size . The gloves are a nice velour fabric ; lace inset at top and loop around middle finger add a nice touch . Comfortable to wear . I recommend this item as a playful addition to the wardrobe .
 this was an excellent piece . the material and the look were calssic and my wife loved it , which is ofcourse a bonus cuz i want to see it more . i would definitely suggest it .

 Perfect Silk Scarf.All my life my sisters and I have worn those little satin scarves from beauty stores or discount department stores like walmart and target . But with my new hair routine I 'm only using the best - the best products , best oils , and the best scarves . I knew that silk was the best I could do , so I searched the net and narrowed down my search to a scarf I found on ebay and on here . This one for its size is the best.The 30 by 30 in black for 24 dollars plus shipping is a steal . My hair retains so much moisture . I also purchased a silk pillow case -LRB- the pillowcase happened to be cheaper on ebay -RRB- . What I love most about this scarf is the size - it even fits when I sleep with big rollers -LRB- after setting my hair -RRB- - it still covers my hair nicely.Great buy and I feel all women of color should have a silk scarf for their hair , it retains so much more moisture , and this scarf will last substantially longer than those little satin scarves .
 The quality is excellent - exactly what I expected based on the product description . My order arrived quickly , but they had made a mistake and sent one scarf in the wrong color . I notified them via email . I told them I was returning the unwanted scarf and requested a replacement . They responded very quickly , informing me they were sending the correct color and told me to keep the other scarf . I was thrilled by the fact that I did not have to go to the post office to mail a package back to them . In the future I will always purchase my scarves from Wolfmark . It is convenient and the quality , price and customer service are excellent.I would like to comment on a review left by another customer who was disappointed in the packaging . The scarf was packaged in an unmarked , sealed plastic bag - adequate to protect the product and ensure it arrived undamaged . Vendors who use elaborate packaging must pass that cost on to the consumer . I prefer not to pay extra for packaging that I am going to throw away and believe that simple packaging is better for the environment . I prefer the quality to be in the product as opposed to the packaging .
 Written by recipient ; -RRB- There are other reviews which are somewhat critical of the packaging . Personally I do n't care about that . The silk was of good quality and the color was even and consistent - not always the case at this price point . The only real issue was the measurements . We would have liked a wider longer version and we would have given them 5 stars . 10-12 '' by 5 ft would be great . If you are small busted and petite then these will be GREAT for you , but if you have a serious bust then the simple knot will not work the ends will stick out on you .
 I ordered a Navy Blue scarf because I wanted something very dark but not entirely black . The scarf that they call `` navy blue '' is actually a `` royal blue '' - much brighter and lighter than I intended . The quality of the scarf is fine , but the color is not what I expected or thought I had ordered .
 I purchased this scarf as a gift . I decided to shop Amazon because I needed a white silk scarf and could n't find any in the department stores . The recipient seemed very pleased and wrapped it around her neck as soon as she opened it purring , oooh I like it .
 These came in beautiful condition . I purchased several in different colors . I have put them aside for use as I need them for accent .
 So seeing as how I am african american and I wrap my hair every night I 'm always on the hunt for a good scarf . This size and consistency is great . Obviously the only downside is that it has the tendency to slip off your hair at a more rapid rate than a cloth one but you ca n't beat the benefits it provides . I wish it was a little cheaper but I have n't found a better deal for the quality so I 'm probably going to be pruchasing another one . I purchased the 30 X 30 in black .
 I am a woman of color and purchased this silk scarf as a hair wrap . I love it . I finally found a 100 % silk scarf to use as part of my healthy hair care regimen . I read the previous reviews and was afraid to purchase because there seemed to be mixed feelings about it , but I am glad that I did . It 's great quality material and serves the purpose for which I purchased it for . Yes it came in a little plastic envelope , but I do n't care too much about the packaging . Great quality , good size , and a pretty good price . I think I made a good choice . I will say that the color was n't what I thought it would be . I ordered the 30 &#34; x30 &#34; in fuschia but it looked more like a bright pink . I still like it . If you 're looking for a good satin scarf for your hair I would definitely purchase it . I 'm even considering purchasing the longer one to use as maybe a winter scarf for further hair protection during the winter . Rather have silk rubbing against my nape than a cotton scarf . I hope this helped someone !
 It 's very pretty , but it puckers slightly on the edges where it 's stitched . However , I feel that it 's a good value .
 The color is a perfect green for me , not too light and not too dark . It feels soooooooo luxurious around my neck .
 This is not a large scarf but PERFECT for what I wanted . My wife loves it ... nice color , nice material . Perfect.WV Crockett
 These scarves are pretty nice - soft and vibrant color . However , they are a little small for me , so I could n't use them and had to give them away ! But they are nice items .

 These are great t-shirts and my boys love them . They are active in sports and there is nothing better than having these shirts to wear . They take the wear and tear and come back for more ! I highly recommend them !
 After trying it on I was pleasantly surprised . The fit was perfect . I have wide shoulders on a short body and I thought the fit would be snug around the shoulders and too long . I was wrong . I like it.Reginald
 Shirt is good quality material -LRB- love the microfiber -RRB- , comfortable , well fitted , and extremely low maintenence . Does NOT need ironing if you wash it and hang it up after a few minutes in the dryer . Wish it came in more colors !
 I wondered how good this shirt could be for $ 10 ??!! But , to my surprise this is a well made shirt and the material is microfiber so it feels very plush . I 'll probably buy a couple more .
 Nice shirt , unfortunately I paid attention to reviews that said that the shirt was oversized , I wear a M and ordered a S.My mistake , the shirt is too small for me . Do n't believe the reviewers ... the size is right !
 This is one nice shirt . I travel a lot and do n't like to iron my shirts after checking into a hotel . I had been looking for clothes that do not require ironing when I ran into this one . I purchased two . I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and the price was not bad at under $ 10 . Compare that to $ 40 and up for name brand `` wrinkle-free '' shirts . I only hope that I can find some more with a different color .
 - Great buy . - True to size . - Wash & dry well . - No iron needed !! Also purchased the below and they are great , too!Ron Chereskin Men 's Short Sleeve Woven Linen Rayon ShirtRon Chereskin Men 's Short Sleeve Linen Rayon Woven Shirt
 Thanks to the other reviewers who said they are oversized , b/c I ended up getting a small and it fits perfectly . I 'm 5 ' 7 '' and wear a size 40short suit coat . The material is soft but much sturdier than I expected . On a lot of button-down shirts , the button holes do n't line up perfectly and the placket looks out of whack . This one seems to be very slightly off , but still better than most . Came out of the dryer almost wrinkle-free .
 At under ten dollars this is a wonderful shirt . It is a soft comfortable fabric that needs no ironing if machine washed gentle cycle . It gets compliments for its looks . It seems to be true to size .
 I was thinking it of using it for my tennis . Unfortunately there was no clue saying it dint have pockets . Anyways its a good shorts for great price .
