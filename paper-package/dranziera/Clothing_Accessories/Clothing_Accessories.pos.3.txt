 Nice fit . Excellent material . Wore these to a recent gay pride pool party . Everyone loved them . From what -LSB- eople said , i think several will order their own colors . I own 4 pair in different colors and love them all . The colors are beautiful . Get a pair and enjoy them .
 I tryed ordering the swim suit listed on their web sight in the photo ad . Unfortunately I tried many times with specific instructions to make sure the color was that used in the ad photo , but never got that color . I do have many of the other colors of that swim brief and like them very much . I really wanted that color used in the ad photo , so I 'm very disappointed in that respect . The reason from the company Bonnie & Clyde was that the color dyes were too hard to match the one in the photo . Order was not the last order , but a previous order for the color Hawaiian Blue .
 Nice fitting suite and comfortable.Good looking and well made.Would recomend these to anyone interestedin bikini style swim wear .
 This is a very rugged roomy laptop bag with a lot of compartments . I fly every week for work and have had this case for three months now . It holds my laptop , ipod , headphones , sunglasses , book , and files with room to spare and still looks great.The only issues I have is that the case is too wide to roll down the aisle on airplanes . Also if you fly on a smaller commuter plane you 'll usually be forced to gate check the bag as it is considered too big to go on board with you .

 The side adjustment straps work well . I got these a little big but was able to adjust them down . Well made and great to wear all summer .
 These T shirts are the best around , I 'm serious , they are very strong and very soft . A couple friends of mine work in the silkscreening business and told me that the `` Hanes Beefy T '' was THE best out there , so I ordered 6 of them on their advice . I 've never seen T shirts this nice , they are the most comfortable , strongest , and they feel like they will last forever . I 'm so happy with these shirts , they are awesome .
 These are great t-shirts and my boys love them . They are active in sports and there is nothing better than having these shirts to wear . They take the wear and tear and come back for more ! I highly recommend them !

 If you go to the gym or play ball a lot and need a couple pair of shorts so you do n't need to do laundry every other day , these athletic shorts are perfect . They 're thin but durable . I got them on sale for like $ 10 so they do the trick . Do n't get me wrong its not like you 'll look like a dork at the gym , but if you 're looking for something super flashy , then these are n't them .
 Nice shorts that match almost everything . My boyfriend loves to wear them around the house . Great pair of shorts for an extremely great price ! So buy a couple pairs just to have around !
 no pockets , but yann will wear them all summer.yeehaw .
 My son likes these to sleep and wear under pants in winter . They are perfect , washing easily , and retaining their size and color .
 I like the shorts . The price is excellent . The shorts were a little thinner than I imagined . But I am very satisfied with the purchase .
 I have the scrimmage dazzle too they re thin but durable and for 10.00 cool ! no pockets ok for me , lightweight shortsexcellent and Roomy my favorites great price buying of couple more
 My boyfriend says that these are his favorite shorts . Nice and roomy with some breathing room .
 These are an excellent fit , great material , good craftsmanship . Especially for the price !
 When I first received these , a present for my 18 yr old son , I was rather surprised at the trim cut of the shearling . But he wore them and was very pleased . He 's very active outdoors and liked that they were thinner but warm , offering him a better grip . I wore them myself to shovel some snow once and they kept my hands nice and warm .
 these gloves are really nice quality , very soft both inside and out . The suede is smooth and pliable and the shearling is not too fluffy inside but definitely enough to keep your hands warm and it feels so nice to put your hands in these . I had a problem figuring out size so if it is any help , my husband tried them on and he is 5 ' 9 and wears a size large in clothing . I would say his hands are medium in size , a bit wide but average length of fingers and the medium glove fit perfectly . I hope that helps someone who is having trouble deciding on size , for me that was the hard part . The gloves came tagged with an Amazon hang tag listing the regular price as $ 79.99 so I am not sure where the price they show comes from but still a great deal . Ca n't comment on how warm they are since we live in Texas and these are for my father-in-law , who lives in a cold weather state , for next Christmas .

 I have owned many pairs of Dockers Flat Front Original Khaki pants and have always loved them . They are the perfect casual work pant and are comfortable to wear . They do n't usually wrinkle much and they hold up well . I would consider these a good investment . The waist seems to run slightly smaller than many other pants so you may want to get one size larger than you normally would .
 I wo n't give them 5 stars because they 're not really as wrinkle-free as they advertised or as my similar Van Heusen khakis . Either way , they are still light and tr&eacute;s comfortable .
 These pants are wonderful , I have boxy hips and the flat front style takes away from that particular silhouette a and I like that
 Great quality , no time waisted and plenty of choices regarding sizes and color . I will never buy them at the store .
 fit great , feel great , durable , and it works well in both my professional and casual wardrobe
 I 've always been a Dockers fan.I love the fit of the flat front . The fabric does n't just crease any how . I love it .
 an excellent pant , comfortable , smooth , good packaging , the measure of pant in line with what the seller say .
 Just right ! It does n't matter how many times it 's been crumpled or washed , it does n't need to be ironed and the crease stays put . The waistline is n't too high , and it 's not too baggy or too tight . Formal enough for work , casual enough for anything else ; I 've even hiked in them -LRB- and the mud stains came right off in one cycle in the wash -RRB- . These are , hands-down , my favorite pants .
 These are the one and only , classic fit original khaki pants from Dockers . The Dockers label is the Kleenex of khaki pants . . the Rolls Royce ... the Xerox . The name is synonymous with the semi-casual look . These pants go great with a leather belt w / cell phone clipped , polo shirt , a clean shave and a crew cut .
 The item is well liked by my husband is one of his favorites since it fit adequately and comfortable .
 It 's nice to find a pair of pants that do n't need any work to fit me right out of the package ! Bought another pair in gray as soon as I used this ones for the first time .
 My teenaged son needs 30x34 pants - which are the dickens to find , even in the big department stores . This fits , and is comparable in price to what I find in the big stores on sale .
 The slacks arrived very quickly . They are a brand new , high-quality product in great shape .
 These pants are great for comfort . True value for the price . So said , there is no individual waist band . Also when you sit normally on a chair , the white fabric inside your side pockets is clearly visible . They could have used the same fabric as the color of the trousers . So , all in all I gave a 4 star .
 I bought two pair to test as work pants . I also bought two pair of another brand . It has been months now , and the pants seem to wear well , and they do not wrinkle . From the washing machine to the dryer , to me in the morning . They always look sharp , and they fit well . That 's all I asked for , and they delivered .
 Useful pants for almost every ocasion . Color does not fade easily . Nice fit .
 I do n't need to tell men over six feet tall or with waists greater than 38 '' that you can burn a ton of gas trying to find clothes that fit . Dockers is a known quantity . So once you find your size , it 's down hill from there . A good price rounds-out the experience .
 The pants are well made , and good quality . I was disappointed in the Individual Fit Waistband ... it hardly gives at all .
 These are great pants and at a great price . I usually have to drive a long way to find a store that has my size .
 There was a far greater ability to get the Dockers I wanted through this vendor than by going to ANY department store . And the prices were significantly better online . The delivery time was a bit slow -- but the time was known at the time I made the purchase -- no false promises of fast delivery . I 'm delighted with this transaction .

 I bought these coveralls for my son-in-law for Christmas . He was totally satisfied and said they fit perfectly and are very warm and comfortable . Other brands are not as insulated and require wearing heavier clothing with them . This is the second pair of Carhartt coveralls I 've purchased in a couple of years and these were less expensive . I was very happy with this selection and especially the price and quality of the garment .
 These coveralls seem to be as good as advertised . Only had a week and no sub zero temps yet BUT with a pair of Duofold Heavy Thermals underneath , I have been very warm in temps that have dipped into the low 30 's already . STRONG word of advice-find a store that carries these locally to try on for size BEFORE you order . These run Long since I am 5 ' 9 '' and 185 lbs and I needed a 46 SHORT and they are still a tad long . I could 've got a 44 but went big to play it safe for layering . I also saved well over $ 50 by buying them online .
 I am unsure if this is amazons mistake or the sellers , but what the title and description said is that this was a tall . When I recieved the product and before when I was tracking it what had actually went through was a regular . So yes do buy this item , it is great . Just make sure you get the correct size before finalizing your sale . Have a great day !
 I am a facility director in Vermont and I boughty these for my crew to stay warm when working on our open tractor in the winter . They love them and it keeps them on the equipment longer .
 I just ordered this amazing waterproof , super warm coverall . Just had our first over half a foot blizzard and did n't feel a thing . I had to order a short because the regular was to long and to big , but this coverall is the warmest and most durable clothing I own . Foot of snow ? no problem . Single digits outside and thirty mile winds ? no problem . Been there done that . I would recommend this product to anyone who loves the outdoors even in cold temps or like being prepared . I know I do . Just make sure to go try on one first . They fit much larger than normal .
 Small is not underrated in this item . You better be very short from the waist to the shoulder . I got stuck in it , like a straight jacket , when I tried it on !! I was alone , and nearly had a panic attack , trying to get it off . LOL . They still are very well made !!
 I 'm 5.7 and 215 lbs . Fit great and super warm . I would recommend to anyone . Durable , the hood that you can get separate does n't snap very well though . Not sure if the issue is the carharts or hood . Will stay on , just unsnaps too easily .
 I have n't tried it on yet and I am already blown away by everything about it . Guys at work have had anything Carhartt for around 30 years and are still working - heavy duty work - comfortably thanks to Carhartt ! Plus the fabric is n't really ripped or faded much anywhere . I am looking forward to 30 + years of use .
 I purchased this for cold weather riding on my motorcycle . The cold weather has not yet begun , so I do not yet know for sure how warm it will keep me . However , the fit is good -LRB- I am 5 ' 9 '' and 180 lbs . -RRB- and there is a little extra room for additional layering should I need it . I can move comfortably in it and the zippers and snaps all work very well . From what I can see so far , I think it will do the job I need it to do .

 The title says it all . This is my first ever purchase of a Dickies product , and I am very pleased with the fit and finish of the jeans .
 I 've been wearing Dickies painters pants for the last 10 years . They are very comfortable and durable . I used to buy them at a local uniform store until their prices were increased . I was so excited when I found them at an inexpensive price . Shipping time was really fast which is important to me , since I wear them everyday .
 Great quality for a great price . They fit right , and are both comfortable and functional . The order was also processed on time . I highly recomend them .
 My husband loved them . Shipped quickly and seller had great communication . Will shop again ! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA +
 These utility -LRB- painters -RRB- pants are excellent ! The sizing is accurate and the pants are very comfortable and exactly as described .
 An absolute necessity for the true Husker fan , these classic white Dickies make even huskermike the envy of Lincoln on game day .
 My son was in his high school musical this year , and needed a pair of white pants , and a pair of brown pants . Where DO you get odd colored jean-like pants ... for a boy ? -LRB- No girl jeans , Mom ! -RRB- Oh , right , Amazon . I got two pair , and dyed one pair brown . I felt the price was reasonable enough that it would n't leave a huge hole in the family budget , since I did n't think he 'd actually wear the things once the musical was over -LRB- like a bridesmaid dress ; does anyone ever get any use out of those ? -RRB- . I gave four stars , because the waistband on one pair was a full inch smaller than the other . Not a problem for a skinny teenager , but maybe an issue for someone with an adult metabolism .
 Everything about this order was exactly as I needed it to be . The sizes are accurate , the colors are correct and there are no flaws in workmanship that I have seen . The order shipped and arrived within the allotted time . I was much more satisfied with my online purchases than I was with my in-store ones this year . NO returns ! Yay ! Amazon was a holiday success that I will be using again .
 Most Excellent purchase . This was much better than expected . I would recommend to everyone , price was perfect , delivery was fast ... bought 2 pair
 priced , quality , delivery time i have no complaints . was not a &#34; pure white &#34; as i thought they would be which is what i needed so i dyed them blue and now i really love them
 I got these acutally as part of a Halloween costume , but I 'm glad I have them now . I will use them whenever I 'm doing work around the house or something that requires work-type pants .
 These pants are a little tight around the waist for me , but are otherwise perfect . The pants are well constructed and durable . It 's also worth more than I paid for .
 These are great pants . Nice relax fit , lots of pockets , good length , jeans like material , tough stitching and priced for sale . You can use them for what ever you feel like
 I love wearing white painter pants in the summer and while golfing too . Pockets to hold stuff , fit nicely and after a few washings become more soft .
 This is the perfect pair of pants if your kid has to wear white pants to an FFA , 4-H or other similar event . They are rugged and are kept clean easily as long as they are only soiled with dirt and other farm animal type waste .
 I have ordered 4 pair of these pants . They work for me very well . There are some variations in them when I order each of them at different times or dates . However the quality has always been good . When I say `` vaiations '' it is in regard to small differences concerning the making of the pants . Two pair of pants have thicker pocket matterial than the other two pair . Two pair have extra pockets that the other two pair did not have . Two pair have realy deep pockets , and the other two pair have `` less '' deep pockets . However , the differences are not in any way a problem for my use of the pants . They also shrink when washing the pants and drying them on a clothes line or in the dryer makes no difference . -LRB- The pants shrink -RRB- My 42 inch waist pants shrank to around 40 inches around the waist . Even when useing cold water the pants will shrink when they dry . So if you wear 40 inch waist size you should buy 42 size waiste.If 30 inch waist then buy 32 inch waist size or you might be in a tight situation . Great pants over all and good quality .
 I 'm a women that works for a drywall and painting company . Everbody on both crews has at least 2 pairs of these . I 'm not the only women on the crews , there are 2 others . And these fit us as well as they do the men ! Which is amazing because the difference in our sizes . I 'm a 2 , one is an 8 , and another a 14 . They are n't tight fitting and immodest for work . They fit like you would expect good quality slacks to . They 're durable and are n't see through like most whites . With all the chemicals and paints I work with , my clothes have got to be tough . I would recommend these to anyone in any profession , even for just working at home , these are great !
 Medium weight cloth - sturdy but not too heavy . Use these pants in the summer while doing chores in the yard and woods . Good fit -- size was accurate , both length & waist were good . Not too tight . Like the natural color . Good quality & value .
 Okay , so this was a BIG issue for me.Of course , in nursing school , we have to wear uniform scrubs . Ours are a standard teal uniform top with white scrub pants and white shoes . This last summer I went to all the local medical supply shops to buy scrubs and was a bit overwhelmed . -LRB- Have you noticed how many different shades of `` teal '' there are ? -RRB- After a considerable hit to my starving student budget , I wound up with some of the most ill-fitting , `` unisex '' white pants you could ever imagine.I do n't know about you guys , but I am built like a typical middle aged guy . I got a little bit of a gut and pretty much nothing on the backside . These silly , drawstring pants are made for people with HIPS . Oh , and do n't forget , it 's only tighty-whities while wearing these things . Those boxer shorts with the hearts on them that you love so much are showing right through . And forget putting anything in the pockets . That just weighed them down more.I found myself spending my clinical days walking around the hospital with my binder in one hand and the other holding my pants up ! It became enough of an issue that I had to talk to my instructors to work something out.It was Sherwin-Williams to the rescue . Down at my local paint supply store I found the perfect solution . They were Dickies Relaxed Fit utility pants . I had to trim the Sherwin-Williams patch off the back pocket , but I think these things saved my sanity . They are sized to fit me both in the waist and the legs . They have BELT LOOPS . I can load up my pockets with anything I need without having to worry about the `` saggy britches syndrome . '' Most importantly , I can wear whatever underwear I want.I would encourage anyone , even the ladies , to try these out before spending more money on scrub pants . They are comparable in price , much more sturdy , and just as comfortable . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 I love these pants I bought in a local store , so wanted a couple more pairs . DO NOT order here from Andrew Christion . Terrible seller . I ordered twice and never got the pants . When I emailed there was always an excuse but no pants .
 I shop for quality & price , found these Dickies Men 's Utility Pant = Painters Pant to be an excellent bargain . Good fit , well made , quality materials and true to size . Lightweight enough and flexible for hot Florida sun temps .
 exactly what I wanted . not baggy , not to tight , fits just nicely on me and I 'm not super skinny , fat , or buff . -LRB- I 'm a martial artist -RRB- bought them for comic con , and for making several videos . the pants fit nicely , and are even comfortable for performing stunts .
 These seem to be fine painters pants , although I bought them for a costume/outfit that needed white pants . I am used to wearing loose fitting jeans , and these are not , so they are a bit tight in my legs . If I needed them for work pants , they would probably be too tight and I would instead return and order a larger size .
 The truth I can not review this product because I know much but my husband was fascinated and if you know much about that kind of pants and if he is happy what I can say is that the pants are well
 The side adjustment straps work well . I got these a little big but was able to adjust them down . Well made and great to wear all summer .
 These coveralls seem to be as good as advertised . Only had a week and no sub zero temps yet BUT with a pair of Duofold Heavy Thermals underneath , I have been very warm in temps that have dipped into the low 30 's already .

 I 've always been a Dockers fan.I love the fit of the flat front . The fabric does n't just crease any how . I love it .
 an excellent pant , comfortable , smooth , good packaging , the measure of pant in line with what the seller say .
 Just right ! It does n't matter how many times it 's been crumpled or washed , it does n't need to be ironed and the crease stays put . The waistline is n't too high , and it 's not too baggy or too tight . Formal enough for work , casual enough for anything else ; I 've even hiked in them -LRB- and the mud stains came right off in one cycle in the wash -RRB- . These are , hands-down , my favorite pants .
 These are the one and only , classic fit original khaki pants from Dockers . The Dockers label is the Kleenex of khaki pants . . the Rolls Royce ... the Xerox . The name is synonymous with the semi-casual look . These pants go great with a leather belt w / cell phone clipped , polo shirt , a clean shave and a crew cut .
 The item is well liked by my husband is one of his favorites since it fit adequately and comfortable .
 It 's nice to find a pair of pants that do n't need any work to fit me right out of the package ! Bought another pair in gray as soon as I used this ones for the first time .
 My teenaged son needs 30x34 pants - which are the dickens to find , even in the big department stores . This fits , and is comparable in price to what I find in the big stores on sale .
 The slacks arrived very quickly . They are a brand new , high-quality product in great shape .
 Nice fit . Excellent material . Wore these to a recent gay pride pool party . Everyone loved them . From what -LSB- eople said , i think several will order their own colors . I own 4 pair in different colors and love them all . The colors are beautiful . Get a pair and enjoy them .
 I tryed ordering the swim suit listed on their web sight in the photo ad . Unfortunately I tried many times with specific instructions to make sure the color was that used in the ad photo , but never got that color . I do have many of the other colors of that swim brief and like them very much . I really wanted that color used in the ad photo , so I 'm very disappointed in that respect . The reason from the company Bonnie & Clyde was that the color dyes were too hard to match the one in the photo . Order was not the last order , but a previous order for the color Hawaiian Blue .
 Nice fitting suite and comfortable.Good looking and well made.Would recomend these to anyone interestedin bikini style swim wear .
 These pants are great for comfort . True value for the price . So said , there is no individual waist band . Also when you sit normally on a chair , the white fabric inside your side pockets is clearly visible . They could have used the same fabric as the color of the trousers . So , all in all I gave a 4 star .
 I bought two pair to test as work pants . I also bought two pair of another brand . It has been months now , and the pants seem to wear well , and they do not wrinkle . From the washing machine to the dryer , to me in the morning . They always look sharp , and they fit well . That 's all I asked for , and they delivered .
 Useful pants for almost every ocasion . Color does not fade easily . Nice fit .
 I do n't need to tell men over six feet tall or with waists greater than 38 '' that you can burn a ton of gas trying to find clothes that fit . Dockers is a known quantity . So once you find your size , it 's down hill from there . A good price rounds-out the experience .
 The pants are well made , and good quality . I was disappointed in the Individual Fit Waistband ... it hardly gives at all .
 These are great pants and at a great price . I usually have to drive a long way to find a store that has my size .
 There was a far greater ability to get the Dockers I wanted through this vendor than by going to ANY department store . And the prices were significantly better online . The delivery time was a bit slow -- but the time was known at the time I made the purchase -- no false promises of fast delivery . I 'm delighted with this transaction .

 I have owned many pairs of Dockers Flat Front Original Khaki pants and have always loved them . They are the perfect casual work pant and are comfortable to wear . They do n't usually wrinkle much and they hold up well . I would consider these a good investment . The waist seems to run slightly smaller than many other pants so you may want to get one size larger than you normally would .
 I wo n't give them 5 stars because they 're not really as wrinkle-free as they advertised or as my similar Van Heusen khakis . Either way , they are still light and tr&eacute;s comfortable .
 These pants are wonderful , I have boxy hips and the flat front style takes away from that particular silhouette a and I like that
 Great quality , no time waisted and plenty of choices regarding sizes and color . I will never buy them at the store .
 fit great , feel great , durable , and it works well in both my professional and casual wardrobe
 My boyfriend says that these are his favorite shorts . Nice and roomy with some breathing room .
 I was thinking it of using it for my tennis . Unfortunately there was no clue saying it dint have pockets . Anyways its a good shorts for great price .
 If you go to the gym or play ball a lot and need a couple pair of shorts so you do n't need to do laundry every other day , these athletic shorts are perfect . They 're thin but durable . I got them on sale for like $ 10 so they do the trick . Do n't get me wrong its not like you 'll look like a dork at the gym , but if you 're looking for something super flashy , then these are n't them .
 Nice shorts that match almost everything . My boyfriend loves to wear them around the house . Great pair of shorts for an extremely great price ! So buy a couple pairs just to have around !
 no pockets , but yann will wear them all summer.yeehaw .
 My son likes these to sleep and wear under pants in winter . They are perfect , washing easily , and retaining their size and color .
 I like the shorts . The price is excellent . The shorts were a little thinner than I imagined . But I am very satisfied with the purchase .
 I have the scrimmage dazzle too they re thin but durable and for 10.00 cool ! no pockets ok for me , lightweight shortsexcellent and Roomy my favorites great price buying of couple more

 These T shirts are the best around , I 'm serious , they are very strong and very soft . A couple friends of mine work in the silkscreening business and told me that the `` Hanes Beefy T '' was THE best out there , so I ordered 6 of them on their advice . I 've never seen T shirts this nice , they are the most comfortable , strongest , and they feel like they will last forever . I 'm so happy with these shirts , they are awesome .

 Overall this Money Clip is a huge space saver , sometimes I forget I have it with me . You can fit 2 cards per slot but it 'll be a tight fit . . I also fin some other small cards/papers that I have to carry with me in the ID center slot . I havent had a bill fall out yet but their edges will stick out over the sides especially you have more than one bill , the picture is really depicting that . I currently have 5 cards in the front and still got room for 1 , maybe 2 more . Good buy overall
 Plenty of slots and slim , minimalist look is perfect for not having to bulk up your wallet unnecessarily . very good leather quality
 I bought these coveralls for my son-in-law for Christmas . He was totally satisfied and said they fit perfectly and are very warm and comfortable . Other brands are not as insulated and require wearing heavier clothing with them . This is the second pair of Carhartt coveralls I 've purchased in a couple of years and these were less expensive . I was very happy with this selection and especially the price and quality of the garment .
 These coveralls seem to be as good as advertised . Only had a week and no sub zero temps yet BUT with a pair of Duofold Heavy Thermals underneath , I have been very warm in temps that have dipped into the low 30 's already . STRONG word of advice-find a store that carries these locally to try on for size BEFORE you order . These run Long since I am 5 ' 9 '' and 185 lbs and I needed a 46 SHORT and they are still a tad long . I could 've got a 44 but went big to play it safe for layering . I also saved well over $ 50 by buying them online .
 I am unsure if this is amazons mistake or the sellers , but what the title and description said is that this was a tall . When I recieved the product and before when I was tracking it what had actually went through was a regular . So yes do buy this item , it is great . Just make sure you get the correct size before finalizing your sale . Have a great day !
 I am a facility director in Vermont and I boughty these for my crew to stay warm when working on our open tractor in the winter . They love them and it keeps them on the equipment longer .
 I just ordered this amazing waterproof , super warm coverall . Just had our first over half a foot blizzard and did n't feel a thing . I had to order a short because the regular was to long and to big , but this coverall is the warmest and most durable clothing I own . Foot of snow ? no problem . Single digits outside and thirty mile winds ? no problem . Been there done that . I would recommend this product to anyone who loves the outdoors even in cold temps or like being prepared . I know I do . Just make sure to go try on one first . They fit much larger than normal .
 Small is not underrated in this item . You better be very short from the waist to the shoulder . I got stuck in it , like a straight jacket , when I tried it on !! I was alone , and nearly had a panic attack , trying to get it off . LOL . They still are very well made !!
 I 'm 5.7 and 215 lbs . Fit great and super warm . I would recommend to anyone . Durable , the hood that you can get separate does n't snap very well though . Not sure if the issue is the carharts or hood . Will stay on , just unsnaps too easily .
 I have n't tried it on yet and I am already blown away by everything about it . Guys at work have had anything Carhartt for around 30 years and are still working - heavy duty work - comfortably thanks to Carhartt ! Plus the fabric is n't really ripped or faded much anywhere . I am looking forward to 30 + years of use .
 I purchased this for cold weather riding on my motorcycle . The cold weather has not yet begun , so I do not yet know for sure how warm it will keep me . However , the fit is good -LRB- I am 5 ' 9 '' and 180 lbs . -RRB- and there is a little extra room for additional layering should I need it . I can move comfortably in it and the zippers and snaps all work very well . From what I can see so far , I think it will do the job I need it to do .
 Comfortable , cool and functional . Product is well stitched and easy to put on and take off . Sent this to Florida for my mother . She is really pleased with it .

 These are great t-shirts and my boys love them . They are active in sports and there is nothing better than having these shirts to wear . They take the wear and tear and come back for more ! I highly recommend them !
 I ordered this thinking it would be a thicker sock . This is more of a thin white dress sock .
 I bought one pair , and then came back to buy three more after I wore them . They are very smooth and soft . I like them because when they come out of the dryer , they retain their shape and fold easily . These are worth the money . Save yourself a step , go ahead a buy several pairs as I am sure you will like them as much as I do .
 I like these socks , but at $ 10 , they were a bit overpriced . Prob my fault , if I had waited , they 'd gone down ...
 I Love these socks . They are thin , comfortable , stay up and wash after wash , look like new.I love all HUE socks , but these are my favorite .
 This product is pretty good . It 's a comfortable material , the socks go up to a good height , and they look professional . There are just two problems . First , if you get caught in the rain with these socks on , then your feet will turn blue with the dye . Second , they fall down to around your ankle after a few hours of wearing them , like almost all other socks do . Other than that , these socks are great .

 I bought two pair to test as work pants . I also bought two pair of another brand . It has been months now , and the pants seem to wear well , and they do not wrinkle . From the washing machine to the dryer , to me in the morning . They always look sharp , and they fit well . That 's all I asked for , and they delivered .
 Useful pants for almost every ocasion . Color does not fade easily . Nice fit .
 I do n't need to tell men over six feet tall or with waists greater than 38 '' that you can burn a ton of gas trying to find clothes that fit . Dockers is a known quantity . So once you find your size , it 's down hill from there . A good price rounds-out the experience .
 The pants are well made , and good quality . I was disappointed in the Individual Fit Waistband ... it hardly gives at all .
 These are great pants and at a great price . I usually have to drive a long way to find a store that has my size .
 There was a far greater ability to get the Dockers I wanted through this vendor than by going to ANY department store . And the prices were significantly better online . The delivery time was a bit slow -- but the time was known at the time I made the purchase -- no false promises of fast delivery . I 'm delighted with this transaction .
 I 've always been a Dockers fan.I love the fit of the flat front . The fabric does n't just crease any how . I love it .
 an excellent pant , comfortable , smooth , good packaging , the measure of pant in line with what the seller say .
 Just right ! It does n't matter how many times it 's been crumpled or washed , it does n't need to be ironed and the crease stays put . The waistline is n't too high , and it 's not too baggy or too tight . Formal enough for work , casual enough for anything else ; I 've even hiked in them -LRB- and the mud stains came right off in one cycle in the wash -RRB- . These are , hands-down , my favorite pants .
 These are the one and only , classic fit original khaki pants from Dockers . The Dockers label is the Kleenex of khaki pants . . the Rolls Royce ... the Xerox . The name is synonymous with the semi-casual look . These pants go great with a leather belt w / cell phone clipped , polo shirt , a clean shave and a crew cut .
 The item is well liked by my husband is one of his favorites since it fit adequately and comfortable .
 It 's nice to find a pair of pants that do n't need any work to fit me right out of the package ! Bought another pair in gray as soon as I used this ones for the first time .
 My teenaged son needs 30x34 pants - which are the dickens to find , even in the big department stores . This fits , and is comparable in price to what I find in the big stores on sale .
 The slacks arrived very quickly . They are a brand new , high-quality product in great shape .
 I have owned many pairs of Dockers Flat Front Original Khaki pants and have always loved them . They are the perfect casual work pant and are comfortable to wear . They do n't usually wrinkle much and they hold up well . I would consider these a good investment . The waist seems to run slightly smaller than many other pants so you may want to get one size larger than you normally would .
 I wo n't give them 5 stars because they 're not really as wrinkle-free as they advertised or as my similar Van Heusen khakis . Either way , they are still light and tr&eacute;s comfortable .
 These pants are wonderful , I have boxy hips and the flat front style takes away from that particular silhouette a and I like that
 Great quality , no time waisted and plenty of choices regarding sizes and color . I will never buy them at the store .
 fit great , feel great , durable , and it works well in both my professional and casual wardrobe

 The side adjustment straps work well . I got these a little big but was able to adjust them down . Well made and great to wear all summer .
 Nice fit . Excellent material . Wore these to a recent gay pride pool party . Everyone loved them . From what -LSB- eople said , i think several will order their own colors . I own 4 pair in different colors and love them all . The colors are beautiful . Get a pair and enjoy them .
 I tryed ordering the swim suit listed on their web sight in the photo ad . Unfortunately I tried many times with specific instructions to make sure the color was that used in the ad photo , but never got that color . I do have many of the other colors of that swim brief and like them very much . I really wanted that color used in the ad photo , so I 'm very disappointed in that respect . The reason from the company Bonnie & Clyde was that the color dyes were too hard to match the one in the photo . Order was not the last order , but a previous order for the color Hawaiian Blue .
 Nice fitting suite and comfortable.Good looking and well made.Would recomend these to anyone interestedin bikini style swim wear .
 This is a great jacket made with quality fabric . It 's the crisp , shiny kind of wool , not the itchy , fuzzy kind . The three-button design and the sculpted fit suit my frame well . Great blazer for tall guys .

 I 'm a women that works for a drywall and painting company . Everbody on both crews has at least 2 pairs of these . I 'm not the only women on the crews , there are 2 others . And these fit us as well as they do the men ! Which is amazing because the difference in our sizes . I 'm a 2 , one is an 8 , and another a 14 . They are n't tight fitting and immodest for work . They fit like you would expect good quality slacks to . They 're durable and are n't see through like most whites . With all the chemicals and paints I work with , my clothes have got to be tough . I would recommend these to anyone in any profession , even for just working at home , these are great !
 Medium weight cloth - sturdy but not too heavy . Use these pants in the summer while doing chores in the yard and woods . Good fit -- size was accurate , both length & waist were good . Not too tight . Like the natural color . Good quality & value .
 Okay , so this was a BIG issue for me.Of course , in nursing school , we have to wear uniform scrubs . Ours are a standard teal uniform top with white scrub pants and white shoes . This last summer I went to all the local medical supply shops to buy scrubs and was a bit overwhelmed . -LRB- Have you noticed how many different shades of `` teal '' there are ? -RRB- After a considerable hit to my starving student budget , I wound up with some of the most ill-fitting , `` unisex '' white pants you could ever imagine.I do n't know about you guys , but I am built like a typical middle aged guy . I got a little bit of a gut and pretty much nothing on the backside . These silly , drawstring pants are made for people with HIPS . Oh , and do n't forget , it 's only tighty-whities while wearing these things . Those boxer shorts with the hearts on them that you love so much are showing right through . And forget putting anything in the pockets . That just weighed them down more.I found myself spending my clinical days walking around the hospital with my binder in one hand and the other holding my pants up ! It became enough of an issue that I had to talk to my instructors to work something out.It was Sherwin-Williams to the rescue . Down at my local paint supply store I found the perfect solution . They were Dickies Relaxed Fit utility pants . I had to trim the Sherwin-Williams patch off the back pocket , but I think these things saved my sanity . They are sized to fit me both in the waist and the legs . They have BELT LOOPS . I can load up my pockets with anything I need without having to worry about the `` saggy britches syndrome . '' Most importantly , I can wear whatever underwear I want.I would encourage anyone , even the ladies , to try these out before spending more money on scrub pants . They are comparable in price , much more sturdy , and just as comfortable . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 I love these pants I bought in a local store , so wanted a couple more pairs . DO NOT order here from Andrew Christion . Terrible seller . I ordered twice and never got the pants . When I emailed there was always an excuse but no pants .
 I shop for quality & price , found these Dickies Men 's Utility Pant = Painters Pant to be an excellent bargain . Good fit , well made , quality materials and true to size . Lightweight enough and flexible for hot Florida sun temps .
 exactly what I wanted . not baggy , not to tight , fits just nicely on me and I 'm not super skinny , fat , or buff . -LRB- I 'm a martial artist -RRB- bought them for comic con , and for making several videos . the pants fit nicely , and are even comfortable for performing stunts .
 These seem to be fine painters pants , although I bought them for a costume/outfit that needed white pants . I am used to wearing loose fitting jeans , and these are not , so they are a bit tight in my legs . If I needed them for work pants , they would probably be too tight and I would instead return and order a larger size .
 My son was in his high school musical this year , and needed a pair of white pants , and a pair of brown pants . Where DO you get odd colored jean-like pants ... for a boy ? -LRB- No girl jeans , Mom ! -RRB- Oh , right , Amazon . I got two pair , and dyed one pair brown . I felt the price was reasonable enough that it would n't leave a huge hole in the family budget , since I did n't think he 'd actually wear the things once the musical was over -LRB- like a bridesmaid dress ; does anyone ever get any use out of those ? -RRB- . I gave four stars , because the waistband on one pair was a full inch smaller than the other . Not a problem for a skinny teenager , but maybe an issue for someone with an adult metabolism .
 Everything about this order was exactly as I needed it to be . The sizes are accurate , the colors are correct and there are no flaws in workmanship that I have seen . The order shipped and arrived within the allotted time . I was much more satisfied with my online purchases than I was with my in-store ones this year . NO returns ! Yay ! Amazon was a holiday success that I will be using again .
 Most Excellent purchase . This was much better than expected . I would recommend to everyone , price was perfect , delivery was fast ... bought 2 pair
 priced , quality , delivery time i have no complaints . was not a &#34; pure white &#34; as i thought they would be which is what i needed so i dyed them blue and now i really love them
 I got these acutally as part of a Halloween costume , but I 'm glad I have them now . I will use them whenever I 'm doing work around the house or something that requires work-type pants .
 These pants are a little tight around the waist for me , but are otherwise perfect . The pants are well constructed and durable . It 's also worth more than I paid for .
 These are great pants . Nice relax fit , lots of pockets , good length , jeans like material , tough stitching and priced for sale . You can use them for what ever you feel like
 I love wearing white painter pants in the summer and while golfing too . Pockets to hold stuff , fit nicely and after a few washings become more soft .
 This is the perfect pair of pants if your kid has to wear white pants to an FFA , 4-H or other similar event . They are rugged and are kept clean easily as long as they are only soiled with dirt and other farm animal type waste .
 I have ordered 4 pair of these pants . They work for me very well . There are some variations in them when I order each of them at different times or dates . However the quality has always been good . When I say `` vaiations '' it is in regard to small differences concerning the making of the pants . Two pair of pants have thicker pocket matterial than the other two pair . Two pair have extra pockets that the other two pair did not have . Two pair have realy deep pockets , and the other two pair have `` less '' deep pockets . However , the differences are not in any way a problem for my use of the pants . They also shrink when washing the pants and drying them on a clothes line or in the dryer makes no difference . -LRB- The pants shrink -RRB- My 42 inch waist pants shrank to around 40 inches around the waist . Even when useing cold water the pants will shrink when they dry . So if you wear 40 inch waist size you should buy 42 size waiste.If 30 inch waist then buy 32 inch waist size or you might be in a tight situation . Great pants over all and good quality .
 The title says it all . This is my first ever purchase of a Dickies product , and I am very pleased with the fit and finish of the jeans .
 I 've been wearing Dickies painters pants for the last 10 years . They are very comfortable and durable . I used to buy them at a local uniform store until their prices were increased . I was so excited when I found them at an inexpensive price . Shipping time was really fast which is important to me , since I wear them everyday .
 Great quality for a great price . They fit right , and are both comfortable and functional . The order was also processed on time . I highly recomend them .
 My husband loved them . Shipped quickly and seller had great communication . Will shop again ! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA +
 These utility -LRB- painters -RRB- pants are excellent ! The sizing is accurate and the pants are very comfortable and exactly as described .
 An absolute necessity for the true Husker fan , these classic white Dickies make even huskermike the envy of Lincoln on game day .
 I 'm a women that works for a drywall and painting company . Everbody on both crews has at least 2 pairs of these . I 'm not the only women on the crews , there are 2 others . And these fit us as well as they do the men ! Which is amazing because the difference in our sizes . I 'm a 2 , one is an 8 , and another a 14 . They are n't tight fitting and immodest for work . They fit like you would expect good quality slacks to . They 're durable and are n't see through like most whites . With all the chemicals and paints I work with , my clothes have got to be tough . I would recommend these to anyone in any profession , even for just working at home , these are great !
 Medium weight cloth - sturdy but not too heavy . Use these pants in the summer while doing chores in the yard and woods . Good fit -- size was accurate , both length & waist were good . Not too tight . Like the natural color . Good quality & value .
 Okay , so this was a BIG issue for me.Of course , in nursing school , we have to wear uniform scrubs . Ours are a standard teal uniform top with white scrub pants and white shoes . This last summer I went to all the local medical supply shops to buy scrubs and was a bit overwhelmed . -LRB- Have you noticed how many different shades of `` teal '' there are ? -RRB- After a considerable hit to my starving student budget , I wound up with some of the most ill-fitting , `` unisex '' white pants you could ever imagine.I do n't know about you guys , but I am built like a typical middle aged guy . I got a little bit of a gut and pretty much nothing on the backside . These silly , drawstring pants are made for people with HIPS . Oh , and do n't forget , it 's only tighty-whities while wearing these things . Those boxer shorts with the hearts on them that you love so much are showing right through . And forget putting anything in the pockets . That just weighed them down more.I found myself spending my clinical days walking around the hospital with my binder in one hand and the other holding my pants up ! It became enough of an issue that I had to talk to my instructors to work something out.It was Sherwin-Williams to the rescue . Down at my local paint supply store I found the perfect solution . They were Dickies Relaxed Fit utility pants . I had to trim the Sherwin-Williams patch off the back pocket , but I think these things saved my sanity . They are sized to fit me both in the waist and the legs . They have BELT LOOPS . I can load up my pockets with anything I need without having to worry about the `` saggy britches syndrome . '' Most importantly , I can wear whatever underwear I want.I would encourage anyone , even the ladies , to try these out before spending more money on scrub pants . They are comparable in price , much more sturdy , and just as comfortable . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 I love these pants I bought in a local store , so wanted a couple more pairs . DO NOT order here from Andrew Christion . Terrible seller . I ordered twice and never got the pants . When I emailed there was always an excuse but no pants .
 I shop for quality & price , found these Dickies Men 's Utility Pant = Painters Pant to be an excellent bargain . Good fit , well made , quality materials and true to size . Lightweight enough and flexible for hot Florida sun temps .
 exactly what I wanted . not baggy , not to tight , fits just nicely on me and I 'm not super skinny , fat , or buff . -LRB- I 'm a martial artist -RRB- bought them for comic con , and for making several videos . the pants fit nicely , and are even comfortable for performing stunts .
 These seem to be fine painters pants , although I bought them for a costume/outfit that needed white pants . I am used to wearing loose fitting jeans , and these are not , so they are a bit tight in my legs . If I needed them for work pants , they would probably be too tight and I would instead return and order a larger size .
 The truth I can not review this product because I know much but my husband was fascinated and if you know much about that kind of pants and if he is happy what I can say is that the pants are well
 My son was in his high school musical this year , and needed a pair of white pants , and a pair of brown pants . Where DO you get odd colored jean-like pants ... for a boy ? -LRB- No girl jeans , Mom ! -RRB- Oh , right , Amazon . I got two pair , and dyed one pair brown . I felt the price was reasonable enough that it would n't leave a huge hole in the family budget , since I did n't think he 'd actually wear the things once the musical was over -LRB- like a bridesmaid dress ; does anyone ever get any use out of those ? -RRB- . I gave four stars , because the waistband on one pair was a full inch smaller than the other . Not a problem for a skinny teenager , but maybe an issue for someone with an adult metabolism .
 Everything about this order was exactly as I needed it to be . The sizes are accurate , the colors are correct and there are no flaws in workmanship that I have seen . The order shipped and arrived within the allotted time . I was much more satisfied with my online purchases than I was with my in-store ones this year . NO returns ! Yay ! Amazon was a holiday success that I will be using again .
 Most Excellent purchase . This was much better than expected . I would recommend to everyone , price was perfect , delivery was fast ... bought 2 pair
 priced , quality , delivery time i have no complaints . was not a &#34; pure white &#34; as i thought they would be which is what i needed so i dyed them blue and now i really love them
 I got these acutally as part of a Halloween costume , but I 'm glad I have them now . I will use them whenever I 'm doing work around the house or something that requires work-type pants .
 These pants are a little tight around the waist for me , but are otherwise perfect . The pants are well constructed and durable . It 's also worth more than I paid for .
 These are great pants . Nice relax fit , lots of pockets , good length , jeans like material , tough stitching and priced for sale . You can use them for what ever you feel like
 I love wearing white painter pants in the summer and while golfing too . Pockets to hold stuff , fit nicely and after a few washings become more soft .
 This is the perfect pair of pants if your kid has to wear white pants to an FFA , 4-H or other similar event . They are rugged and are kept clean easily as long as they are only soiled with dirt and other farm animal type waste .
 I have ordered 4 pair of these pants . They work for me very well . There are some variations in them when I order each of them at different times or dates . However the quality has always been good . When I say `` vaiations '' it is in regard to small differences concerning the making of the pants . Two pair of pants have thicker pocket matterial than the other two pair . Two pair have extra pockets that the other two pair did not have . Two pair have realy deep pockets , and the other two pair have `` less '' deep pockets . However , the differences are not in any way a problem for my use of the pants . They also shrink when washing the pants and drying them on a clothes line or in the dryer makes no difference . -LRB- The pants shrink -RRB- My 42 inch waist pants shrank to around 40 inches around the waist . Even when useing cold water the pants will shrink when they dry . So if you wear 40 inch waist size you should buy 42 size waiste.If 30 inch waist then buy 32 inch waist size or you might be in a tight situation . Great pants over all and good quality .
 The title says it all . This is my first ever purchase of a Dickies product , and I am very pleased with the fit and finish of the jeans .
 I 've been wearing Dickies painters pants for the last 10 years . They are very comfortable and durable . I used to buy them at a local uniform store until their prices were increased . I was so excited when I found them at an inexpensive price . Shipping time was really fast which is important to me , since I wear them everyday .
 Great quality for a great price . They fit right , and are both comfortable and functional . The order was also processed on time . I highly recomend them .
 My husband loved them . Shipped quickly and seller had great communication . Will shop again ! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA +
 These utility -LRB- painters -RRB- pants are excellent ! The sizing is accurate and the pants are very comfortable and exactly as described .
 An absolute necessity for the true Husker fan , these classic white Dickies make even huskermike the envy of Lincoln on game day .
 The side adjustment straps work well . I got these a little big but was able to adjust them down . Well made and great to wear all summer .
 These pants are great for comfort . True value for the price . So said , there is no individual waist band . Also when you sit normally on a chair , the white fabric inside your side pockets is clearly visible . They could have used the same fabric as the color of the trousers . So , all in all I gave a 4 star .
 I bought two pair to test as work pants . I also bought two pair of another brand . It has been months now , and the pants seem to wear well , and they do not wrinkle . From the washing machine to the dryer , to me in the morning . They always look sharp , and they fit well . That 's all I asked for , and they delivered .
 Useful pants for almost every ocasion . Color does not fade easily . Nice fit .
 I do n't need to tell men over six feet tall or with waists greater than 38 '' that you can burn a ton of gas trying to find clothes that fit . Dockers is a known quantity . So once you find your size , it 's down hill from there . A good price rounds-out the experience .
 The pants are well made , and good quality . I was disappointed in the Individual Fit Waistband ... it hardly gives at all .
 These are great pants and at a great price . I usually have to drive a long way to find a store that has my size .
 There was a far greater ability to get the Dockers I wanted through this vendor than by going to ANY department store . And the prices were significantly better online . The delivery time was a bit slow -- but the time was known at the time I made the purchase -- no false promises of fast delivery . I 'm delighted with this transaction .
 I 've always been a Dockers fan.I love the fit of the flat front . The fabric does n't just crease any how . I love it .
 an excellent pant , comfortable , smooth , good packaging , the measure of pant in line with what the seller say .
 Just right ! It does n't matter how many times it 's been crumpled or washed , it does n't need to be ironed and the crease stays put . The waistline is n't too high , and it 's not too baggy or too tight . Formal enough for work , casual enough for anything else ; I 've even hiked in them -LRB- and the mud stains came right off in one cycle in the wash -RRB- . These are , hands-down , my favorite pants .
 These are the one and only , classic fit original khaki pants from Dockers . The Dockers label is the Kleenex of khaki pants . . the Rolls Royce ... the Xerox . The name is synonymous with the semi-casual look . These pants go great with a leather belt w / cell phone clipped , polo shirt , a clean shave and a crew cut .
 The item is well liked by my husband is one of his favorites since it fit adequately and comfortable .
 It 's nice to find a pair of pants that do n't need any work to fit me right out of the package ! Bought another pair in gray as soon as I used this ones for the first time .
 My teenaged son needs 30x34 pants - which are the dickens to find , even in the big department stores . This fits , and is comparable in price to what I find in the big stores on sale .
 The slacks arrived very quickly . They are a brand new , high-quality product in great shape .
 I have owned many pairs of Dockers Flat Front Original Khaki pants and have always loved them . They are the perfect casual work pant and are comfortable to wear . They do n't usually wrinkle much and they hold up well . I would consider these a good investment . The waist seems to run slightly smaller than many other pants so you may want to get one size larger than you normally would .
 I wo n't give them 5 stars because they 're not really as wrinkle-free as they advertised or as my similar Van Heusen khakis . Either way , they are still light and tr&eacute;s comfortable .
 These pants are wonderful , I have boxy hips and the flat front style takes away from that particular silhouette a and I like that
 Great quality , no time waisted and plenty of choices regarding sizes and color . I will never buy them at the store .
 fit great , feel great , durable , and it works well in both my professional and casual wardrobe
 Nice fit . Excellent material . Wore these to a recent gay pride pool party . Everyone loved them . From what -LSB- eople said , i think several will order their own colors . I own 4 pair in different colors and love them all . The colors are beautiful . Get a pair and enjoy them .
 I tryed ordering the swim suit listed on their web sight in the photo ad . Unfortunately I tried many times with specific instructions to make sure the color was that used in the ad photo , but never got that color . I do have many of the other colors of that swim brief and like them very much . I really wanted that color used in the ad photo , so I 'm very disappointed in that respect . The reason from the company Bonnie & Clyde was that the color dyes were too hard to match the one in the photo . Order was not the last order , but a previous order for the color Hawaiian Blue .
 Nice fitting suite and comfortable.Good looking and well made.Would recomend these to anyone interestedin bikini style swim wear .

 My boyfriend says that these are his favorite shorts . Nice and roomy with some breathing room .
 I was thinking it of using it for my tennis . Unfortunately there was no clue saying it dint have pockets . Anyways its a good shorts for great price .
 If you go to the gym or play ball a lot and need a couple pair of shorts so you do n't need to do laundry every other day , these athletic shorts are perfect . They 're thin but durable . I got them on sale for like $ 10 so they do the trick . Do n't get me wrong its not like you 'll look like a dork at the gym , but if you 're looking for something super flashy , then these are n't them .
 Nice shorts that match almost everything . My boyfriend loves to wear them around the house . Great pair of shorts for an extremely great price ! So buy a couple pairs just to have around !
 no pockets , but yann will wear them all summer.yeehaw .
 My son likes these to sleep and wear under pants in winter . They are perfect , washing easily , and retaining their size and color .
 I like the shorts . The price is excellent . The shorts were a little thinner than I imagined . But I am very satisfied with the purchase .
 I have the scrimmage dazzle too they re thin but durable and for 10.00 cool ! no pockets ok for me , lightweight shortsexcellent and Roomy my favorites great price buying of couple more
 This shirt fits well and is really comfortable . The lettering with Glock spelled out is just a bonus . Wear it all the time

 My daughter wore this for Halloween . The costume had a slight flaw , which someone repaired with a type of fabric tape . It was serviceable and there were some nice details like glittery eyes on the skull borders in the sleeves . Hoped it would at least come with the eye patch , but we were able to find one at Target on clearance .
 I purchased this costume at the last possible minute after purchasing a different costume from another retailer ; -LRB- that turned out to be a catastrophe !! Wrong size shipped , did n't have the right size to replace it , etc. -RRB- ANYWAY-Rubies not only SAVED my child from utter disappointment but the costume is absolutely lovely ! It arrived with time to spare and fit like a dream ! Not too big , she was n't swallowed up . Not too small , or short . It runs true to size . I was VERY VERY happy with this purchase .
 The side adjustment straps work well . I got these a little big but was able to adjust them down . Well made and great to wear all summer .

Two pair have realy deep pockets , and the other two pair have `` less '' deep pockets . However , the differences are not in any way a problem for my use of the pants . They also shrink when washing the pants and drying them on a clothes line or in the dryer makes no difference . -LRB- The pants shrink -RRB- My 42 inch waist pants shrank to around 40 inches around the waist . Even when useing cold water the pants will shrink when they dry . So if you wear 40 inch waist size you should buy 42 size waiste.If 30 inch waist then buy 32 inch waist size or you might be in a tight situation . Great pants over all and good quality .
 The title says it all . This is my first ever purchase of a Dickies product , and I am very pleased with the fit and finish of the jeans .
 These pants are great for comfort . True value for the price . So said , there is no individual waist band . Also when you sit normally on a chair , the white fabric inside your side pockets is clearly visible . They could have used the same fabric as the color of the trousers . So , all in all I gave a 4 star .
 I bought two pair to test as work pants . I also bought two pair of another brand . It has been months now , and the pants seem to wear well , and they do not wrinkle . From the washing machine to the dryer , to me in the morning . They always look sharp , and they fit well . That 's all I asked for , and they delivered .
 Useful pants for almost every ocasion . Color does not fade easily . Nice fit .
 I do n't need to tell men over six feet tall or with waists greater than 38 '' that you can burn a ton of gas trying to find clothes that fit . Dockers is a known quantity . So once you find your size , it 's down hill from there . A good price rounds-out the experience .
 The pants are well made , and good quality . I was disappointed in the Individual Fit Waistband ... it hardly gives at all .
 These are great pants and at a great price . I usually have to drive a long way to find a store that has my size .
 There was a far greater ability to get the Dockers I wanted through this vendor than by going to ANY department store . And the prices were significantly better online . The delivery time was a bit slow -- but the time was known at the time I made the purchase -- no false promises of fast delivery . I 'm delighted with this transaction .
 I have owned many pairs of Dockers Flat Front Original Khaki pants and have always loved them . They are the perfect casual work pant and are comfortable to wear . They do n't usually wrinkle much and they hold up well . I would consider these a good investment . The waist seems to run slightly smaller than many other pants so you may want to get one size larger than you normally would .
 I wo n't give them 5 stars because they 're not really as wrinkle-free as they advertised or as my similar Van Heusen khakis . Either way , they are still light and tr&eacute;s comfortable .
 These pants are wonderful , I have boxy hips and the flat front style takes away from that particular silhouette a and I like that
 Great quality , no time waisted and plenty of choices regarding sizes and color . I will never buy them at the store .
 fit great , feel great , durable , and it works well in both my professional and casual wardrobe
 I 've always been a Dockers fan.I love the fit of the flat front . The fabric does n't just crease any how . I love it .
 an excellent pant , comfortable , smooth , good packaging , the measure of pant in line with what the seller say .
 Just right ! It does n't matter how many times it 's been crumpled or washed , it does n't need to be ironed and the crease stays put . The waistline is n't too high , and it 's not too baggy or too tight . Formal enough for work , casual enough for anything else ; I 've even hiked in them -LRB- and the mud stains came right off in one cycle in the wash -RRB- . These are , hands-down , my favorite pants .
 These are the one and only , classic fit original khaki pants from Dockers . The Dockers label is the Kleenex of khaki pants . . the Rolls Royce ... the Xerox . The name is synonymous with the semi-casual look . These pants go great with a leather belt w / cell phone clipped , polo shirt , a clean shave and a crew cut .
 The item is well liked by my husband is one of his favorites since it fit adequately and comfortable .
 It 's nice to find a pair of pants that do n't need any work to fit me right out of the package ! Bought another pair in gray as soon as I used this ones for the first time .
 My teenaged son needs 30x34 pants - which are the dickens to find , even in the big department stores . This fits , and is comparable in price to what I find in the big stores on sale .
 The slacks arrived very quickly . They are a brand new , high-quality product in great shape .
 I had to send back the first pair I ordered -LRB- 38 reg -RRB- , too small . It 's a guessing game with these suckers . I 'm 5 ' 11 &#34; , 175 and ended up with a 40 regular . If you want to wear several layers -LRB- sweat shirt and vest with a heavy shirt and long johns -RRB- , you may want the 42 regular . Amazon pays for shipping so you can get it right . Good luck .
 I use these for both the bike and the boat , and I have never been cold . All I ware underneath is long underwear , and I am roasting . I am 5 ' 11 '' ; and 180bls . I got size 44 and there is plenty of room for layering . Very mobile also .
 I 'm a horsewoman , and steeling myself some days and nights to go out in the coldest , nastiest , wettest weather to care for my animals can be daunting . Once I 'm suited up in my thermal coveralls , I feel ready for anything . I stay warm , dry and comfortable in the worst of weather -- the fabric is incredibly tough and substantial , but still affords me plenty of mobility . Plenty of pockets conveniently placed , and fairly easy to don the suit , thanks to zippers AND snaps . Plenty of width in the pant leg for tall heavy muck boots . My only beef is that Carhartt does n't carry this item for women -LRB- at least I have n't seen one on their site -RRB- . Women need the same protection and warmth as do men working outdoors , so I find the omission pretty strange . It 's not a big deal -- I jut simply order a smaller men 's size , and it works fine for me . The coveralls last and last , they are just so tough . And so waterproof , I did n't even feel it the other day when my rambunctious toddler turned the water hose on my back , full blast . I just do n't see working in the cold and wet outdoors without them -- would n't do it any other way ! Expect them to last for years . WELL worth the price .
 Bought this because it was the heaviest coverall I could find . Lots of pockets , lots of vents , legs zip up . Looks like it will last for years .
 I 've went through a few sets of carhartt coveralls over the years . I recently needed a new pair and decided I 'd try these . Let me tell YOU , they are very WARM and DURABLE . If you want to own the best , buy these !!!!
 My Dad loves hunting and fishing and these work really well in cold weather . A friend recomended this product , I found it on Amazon , I had it shipped straight to him . Shipping was fast . Thanks !!!!!!!
 This mite b the best suit on da market nice a thick an keeps u warm all day an its water proof its well worth the money if u spend lotz of time outside working dont go buy a cheap coverall an still b cold so u will have wasted ur money this is the best u can get besize one of the fireman suits
 When I purchased this item it was starting to get `` cold '' here in Southern Arizona ... I know , I know it 's relative to where you are . But I 've got over 2 feet of Titanium 13mm Rods in my lower spine , 3 Verterbreal Cages of laminated Titanium and something else , plus 12 Titanium pins to hold all of that mess together , and when I get cold it takes a long time for me to warm up , and I love to ride my motorcycle anytime of the year , so I do n't need to get cold , 'cause it takes literally hours for me to warm back up ... see what I mean , anyway this suit is fantastically `` suited '' for just my needs , although they size it larger than what I expected even with jeans and Combat Boots it 's still long and large , I selected a 42 Regular since that 's my Dress Jacket Size but it 's WAY WAY TOO LARGE AND TOO LONG , I 'm 5 ' 10 '' and weigh 162 pounds , the suit that I recieved is made for someone about 6 ' 2 '' 195 pounds , fortunately that the perfect size of my son who is Active Duty ARMY , he 's got a bike too and wears it daily to work and back . I 'm told by him that when he puts this thing on he 's sweating in less than 5 minutes , and he stays that way , he now has orders for Ft. Drum , Ny . so the suit will work perfectly up there . In the mean time I bought another pair of coveralls size 36 `` Short '' and they fit perfectly , I have great fun riding in the `` wintertime '' here in Arizona .
 I use this while snowblowing in Alaska . Nice and toasty inside , wearing pants and a T-Shirt . Impermeable to wind and snow . Tough.Sizing is tricky , I used other 's reviews to guess my size -LRB- sizing charts are all over the place and even Carharrt 's website is not that helpful -RRB- . I am 6ft tall and 160lbs . 36 Regular fits absolutely perfectly .
 I bought these primarily as motorcycle cold weather gear . Today it was 24F out so thought it would be a good day for a test ride . The Extreme Coveralls were fantastic ! I stayed very comfortable wearing only my normal clothes -LRB- blue jeans and a long sleeve shirt -RRB- . I am confident the temperature will never stop me from riding . They are a little bulky but I do n't feel uncomfortable at all . I have a 32-inch inseam and ordered a regular ; maybe a half-inch too long at times but otherwise the fit is just what I expected . Amazon had a great price and the product is everything I wanted for riding , snow-shoveling , and any other cold weather activity .
 Got this for my hubby that works at the local Zoo . He can be out in the weather for hours on end , often in damp conditions and needed a warmer pair of overalls for some days . He used these twice so far and they have been very warm and resist water somewhat although not made for it . They are very stiff and need to be washed before wearing , and they run large and do not shrink upon washing . I wish I had known before they ran a bit larger , presumable to allow for layering but with these in our weather they are enough to have jeans underneath . Very easy to get on and off , even with clunky heavy shoes .
 Rugged and comfortable these are the carharts we use in Tok alaska , the coldest inhabited place in North America . Carhart products are quality products , they do n't shrink up and fall apart .
 I 'm 6 ' tall and 140lbs . I bought a 36regular , but should have gotten a 36long . I do n't think Amazon sells the long . They fit good unless I put my hands above my shoulders , then they get tight between the crotch and shoulders . They 'd be great to wear outside , but when on my motorcycle , the pants come up 2-3inchest and do n't cover my boots anymore . They block the wind very well on a bike , but you 'll need a t-shirt and warm long sleeve on as well as thermal underwear and pants if you 're going to ride below 40degrees -LRB- in my opinion -RRB- . I 've had no problem wearing them in temps down to 30degrees and staying warm . They retain body heat very well . I rode thru light rain for about 4 miles and they repelled it very well . If you 're 5 '10 or under , a regular would be fine for a bike.Carhartt 's web-site recommends a long if you 're 6 ' or taller , and they 're right there.Got for about $ 125 on Amazon . Carhartt.com has them for $ 200 .
 Read some reviews on this product and some , or should I say most said that the fit was large . Large ??? . . Loose ?? ... Baggy ?? . . Put all three together and it would still be conservative ! My other Carhartt coverall -LRB- reg -RRB- is a 46 and the fit is good for my 5 ' -10 &#34; and 200 pound frame.When I ordered the Extremes model , I thought 46 would do ... tried it and shipped it back , ordered a 44 , a 42 reg and a 42 short ... 42 short is good for a guy my height if you like capri pants or like to show off your calves on the job site !! So I was left with the 42 reg which fit well for my upper body but was way too baggy from the waist down . Had to return that too . As far as quality goes , this is a fine piece of work clothes . . the fabric , pockets and zippers are what u would expect from Carhartt . . since I own close to 20 pairs of Carhartt bibs , lined and unlined , pants , jeans , coveralls and sweatshirts , I will still recommend this product . . meanwhile , I cant help but wonder how much money Carhartt would save by cutting a couple of inches of fabric on the lower portion of their Extremes coverall .
 I was very happy with these coveralls ... . very warm and durable . The size runs a little large . Sorry I did n't buy this after the price dropped .
 My husband is 200lb and 6 ' 1 &#34; . Broad shoulders . Usually a size 34L or 36 . Ended up purchasing a 40L in these coveralls and the extra sleeve and pant length is n't too much , but he is very happy with them .
 It turned into my favorite T-Shirt and I absolutely love it ! But it did have a flaw . The seem in the bottom in the back ripped out on the their wearing of the shirt . But I still love it ! Yay Rammstein !
 I purchased this top for my daughter who loves the German metal group Rammstein . She is 15 years old and looks adorable in this top . She wore it last week while on a cruise to the western caribbean , and not only did many folks complement her on the top , they also voiced their appreciation for the music of Rammstein . My daughter has other Rammstein shirts , but this one is unique and quite eye catching . I highly recommend it!A mom in St. Pete , Florida
 I was thinking it of using it for my tennis . Unfortunately there was no clue saying it dint have pockets . Anyways its a good shorts for great price .
 If you go to the gym or play ball a lot and need a couple pair of shorts so you do n't need to do laundry every other day , these athletic shorts are perfect . They 're thin but durable . I got them on sale for like $ 10 so they do the trick . Do n't get me wrong its not like you 'll look like a dork at the gym , but if you 're looking for something super flashy , then these are n't them .
 Nice shorts that match almost everything . My boyfriend loves to wear them around the house . Great pair of shorts for an extremely great price ! So buy a couple pairs just to have around !
 no pockets , but yann will wear them all summer.yeehaw .
 My son likes these to sleep and wear under pants in winter . They are perfect , washing easily , and retaining their size and color .
 I like the shorts . The price is excellent . The shorts were a little thinner than I imagined . But I am very satisfied with the purchase .
 I have the scrimmage dazzle too they re thin but durable and for 10.00 cool ! no pockets ok for me , lightweight shortsexcellent and Roomy my favorites great price buying of couple more
 My boyfriend says that these are his favorite shorts . Nice and roomy with some breathing room .

 Nice fit . Excellent material . Wore these to a recent gay pride pool party . Everyone loved them . From what -LSB- eople said , i think several will order their own colors . I own 4 pair in different colors and love them all . The colors are beautiful . Get a pair and enjoy them .
 I tryed ordering the swim suit listed on their web sight in the photo ad . Unfortunately I tried many times with specific instructions to make sure the color was that used in the ad photo , but never got that color . I do have many of the other colors of that swim brief and like them very much . I really wanted that color used in the ad photo , so I 'm very disappointed in that respect . The reason from the company Bonnie & Clyde was that the color dyes were too hard to match the one in the photo . Order was not the last order , but a previous order for the color Hawaiian Blue .
 Nice fitting suite and comfortable.Good looking and well made.Would recomend these to anyone interestedin bikini style swim wear .

 I 've been trying to find a cross between a money clip and wallet that I could keep in my front pocket without a bulge.This money clip wallet is almost perfect . It holds 7 or 8 bills -LRB- ones or 100 's , does n't matter -RRB- still has enough room and pockets for the usual credit cards . The two outside pockets are ingenious and help keep its slim profile.Would be nice if one of the outside pockets had a clear plastic front so that I could show my ID without having to pull it out.Otherwise , it 's a quality product and meets my needs for a thin wallet that works like a money clip without the bulk of the other wallets I 've seen .
 This is awesome for driver 's license , 4 credit cards , medical card and some cash . I keep receipts in the side pocket . It has a lot in it , but it is n't bulky . The leather has molded into a nice thin packet that I keep in any pocket .
 I expected a narrower wallet -LRB- for US sized bills -RRB- , but was pleasantly surprised that I liked the larger format . It allows for another row of credit card pockets . I do n't like the similar wallets that have an ID window on the outside , and this is perfect .
 I never thought I would get excited enough about a wallet to write a review , but this thing is sweet . Perfect front pocket wallet solution for those of us who choose not to carry a ton of items . I got the lime green one and it looks great .
 I purchased this as a gift for my husband as he saw a friend of his have one similar and liked it . I 'm glad I read through the reviews prior to purchasing because some of the other similar wallet clips indicated the dollar bills were larger than the actual wallet size whereas this one was larger . The good part about the wallet is that it is larger so the dollar bills easily fit inside however , if you put more than 1 credit card and your driver 's license in it , the wallet tends to get thick . All in all , my husband really likes it as he was using a money clip previously . It is a great transition between a traditional wallet and a money clip .
 This item is exactely what I ws looking for after my old one of 20 years finally cracked and died . Took a while to find one in leather and at a good price . I am very satisfied . Recommend to other men looking for just a money holder and not a heavy clip .
 The wallet is well made , with a very secure money clip in the fold . There are enough pockets for a couple of cards , ID , etc , w/o being bulky . I had a money clip style wallet that was n't as well constructed and the money clip was basically a spring - loaded folding clip , not securely sewn into the wallet binding -LRB- like this one -RRB- . The clip spring started to lose its tensioning and fell off , several times , until it finally fell off , lost for good.This wallet 's clip is integrated into the wallet construction and ca n't detach from the wallet , so cash is secure , but easily accessible.Nice product for the $ .
 I love this wallet . Great build quality and it 's pretty slim.My dad loved it so much that he wanted to get one , too . I bought another one and had it shipped to him . Highly recommended .
 The Royce Cash Clip is perfect for me . In recent years I moved to the front pocket cash clip wallets . This Royce has the advantage of being small enough for the front pocket but also allowing me to lay out my most often used cards -LRB- fast and easy selection -RRB- . Great design.Regards , ATRoyce Leather Men 's Cash Clip Wallet
 Perfect for keeping in your front pocket . Slim and the leather appears to be of quality .
 This is a great money clip . It is replacing a hand crafted leather clip that I purchased many years ago in Cape May , New Jersey . I used that clip until it literally fell apart since I could not find a replacement that came even close . Then along came this beauty . It actually is just as good , and quite possibly better . The credit card holders overlap one another , making it easier to grab the card you want without hunting . It is slim and very attractive . I recommend it with no reservations .
 Bought this money clip slim wallet as I always wanted one . Can not seems to get in any department store.Read the other reviews , I bought 2 , one all black and one black/Lime green . Insert 6 cards altogether , feels good in the front pocket . If insert 8 cards as there in 8 pocket , I felt it to be too bulky to my liking.Another point to note is that it is not 100 % genuine leather . I did not like leather anyway , so cheers.Update Jan 2010The wallet is still functional , after daily abuse . No peeling/ripping what so ever anywhere . Compare to some wallet I paid much more for , this tops the durability chart.I 'm worried I might not get a chance to use the other wallets ... since this wallet is going to last .
 Product was exactly as he wanted . I looked in several local dept stores and could not find anything like it . Will be ordering another as a spare
 Perfect wallet , just what my Dad wanted for Christmas . Having money clip inside the fold of the wallet keeps bills organized and easily accessible . Several card slots for drivers license , debit and credit cards . Great quality .
 I had to cut down on what I was carrying to fit it in this wallet , but the whole point was for a thinner front pocket wallet.Its thinner with my 6 most important cards , and my DL and some cash than my old wallet was completely emptyThe cash clip thing works well , most of the time I have one or two bills and it still holds them snugWould definitely recommend this wallet to someone looking for a thin wallet that looks nice
 This wallet is significantly smaller and only slightly less functional than a standard bi-fold . Cons : It does n't have a window for an ID , but to be honest I ca n't remember the last time someone checked my ID and did n't require that I remove it first . Also the pockets in a standard wallet are a bit more functional than the clip . This wallet is n't well suited to small receipts and coins.Pros : This wallet can hold a pretty substantial stack of bills without becoming uncomfortable and the outside card slots are quite convenient . In my opinion the slot on the outside is more convenient than a standard ID window.This is a reasonable quality wallet at a reasonable price . Although I do wish the interior slots were made of cloth rather than leather to reduce width , you ca n't really wish for everything . I would definitely recommend this wallet to anyone who is used to using a bi-fold .
 Looked all over to find a wallet with a money clip in the middle . This wallet was the closet to what I was looking for and it is looking like this wallet will be better than what it replaced . Nicely made . Looks nice . Ca n't ask for better .
 I bought this because I was looking for a slim wallet and have been happy with it . Including the exterior slots , you can very easily fit 8 credit cards , along with whatever bills you 're carrying . It is a little wider than I thought it would be , but seems to be made well .
 This wallet is exactly what I was looking for ... something simple , can hold a couple of basic cards -LRB- license , credit card -RRB- and some cash . It 's great . Slender . No more bulging wallet . No need to carry it all for an evening outing . Light . Comfortable . Cash is easy to get to . Good quality for the price .
 Bought this money clip as a gift for my husband . He does n't like bulky wallets and rarely carries lot of cash around . You can easily fit in 6 credit cards and clip in a few bills without any hassle .
 It works , it 's not cheap , and is leather . Not `` the solution '' to bulky wallets and money handling I was looking for , but something different that I 'm happy to be trying out .
 construcred good , hold down clip is strong and the pockets fit the cards snug so they cant fall out . the color of the leather is brilliant . They delivery of the product came at the same time posted .
 I love the outer slots - that way I do n't have to open my wallet to pull out my most frequently accessed cards - my Metro card and my ATM card . Perfect for me .
 Awesome wallet ! ... Holds more than I expected ... the leather inside is soft and flexible which makes it easier to get your cards in and out of the slots . Absolutely LOVE this wallet .
 Looked at many wallets and glad I chose this one . It 's made we 'll , looks good , and just enough pockets . It looks so neat and my husband likes it !
 I bough this as a present . So far so good . It was supposedly leather , but after smelling it I 'm not so sure . It had a hint of cheap plastic phone holster smell if you know what I mean . It smelled more like pleather than leather . Not couting any off for this only because I dont know if they started using some other chemical that causes it to stink that way . All the parts seemed to be as advertised though .
 I bought this for a gift . . looked just as it was advertised . . So with that said i will rate it a 4 star . .
 My husband loves it ! It fits in his front pocket and is good quality leather and stitching.three more words
 I have had a very similar wallet before and I loved it . I had to replace it eventually because the money clip became loose after long period of usage . I love this wallet as much as my last one . It is just a bit different but same concept . I hope this money clip last longer than last one .
 This item turned out to be just what I needed . I like the usefulness and quality of this wallet . I would definitely recommend this item to other men .
 I like this front pocket wallet with concealed money clip and room for credit cards versus the wallet I had that exposed everything.My ID is inside and my money and credit cards too . The money has a tentancy to slide out of the clip , but other than that , it is great .
 For the last decade or so I 've bought numerous wallets . I usually buy them specifically for the removable flip-out panel with ID window and credit card pockets . I do n't like bulky wallets , but the plastic windows always tear , and when I carry cash -LRB- which I 'm trying to do more now -RRB- I did n't have a place to hold it securely.This is the best of both worlds , and is attractive as well.The only complaints I have are that it 's slightly larger than I was hoping -LRB- but still smaller than a bifold -RRB- and that it ` flares out ' slightly at the edges . I 'm hoping the latter will be fixed after I 've sat on it long enough to break it in.Overall , I 'm pleased .
 The leather has great quality . if scratched , you can rub it and the natural oils from your hands smooth out the scratches . Great color and it holds sooo much without it being bulky . Excellency purchase and fabulous gift !
 Just what I needed ? Slim with enough credit card slots . A must for men who want to place their financial needs in order .
 The clip wallet is great ; absolutely easy to use and it is very safe in storing your money . I have not had any problems with it and I am very happy and satisfied with the purchase .
 Beautiful wallet ! So much more than I expected . Top quality ! A unique concept . Very easy access to all your personal needs inside and outside the wallet . Perfect size !
 Looks , feels , and works great had it for months and the clip still works great . I bought the black one . still lookes great after months of use .
 This wallet is great . I replaced an old , bulky leather wallet with a flip id flap . This wallet , fully stocked , is half the size and lets me sit down without half falling over from the size . It has 6 slots for cards as well as two openings for more on each side of its exterior . All together I am carrying 9 cards in it with ease . The interior money clip slides right into an opening on the back of the wallet allowing you to swap whether it clips your cash from the top or the bottom . My only gripe is actually a positive and that is that I cant ' tell if it 's in my pocket or not when I am walking around . If you need something simple and stylish I would definitely recommend this wallet .
 The wallet was a little larger than I thought but it has turned out to be eminently practical . The out side pockets are convenient and the inside sleeves are a good storage place where I can see the cards and documents I do not need to use regularly . Very attractive contrasting stiching & lining . I purchased the blue/black model .
 Really clever design with the two pockets on the outside - I have my ID and my CC there and that 's usually all I need . The metal clip thing that holds the bills is a bit weak though and pops up a bit too easily , but it 's a slick looking wallet that does n't tale up much space in your pocket . If I lost it I 'd probably buy the same one again .
 I rate it five stars , but really it should be 500 . These are AMAZING . I 'd always hated thongs , but these are so soft , stretchy , sexy and so very well cut I changed my mind . -LRB- They machine wash too -RRB- You 'll love them - buy several!P.S . I 'm a lingerie junkie -- I ' v bought and tried everything from La Perla to victoria 's secret and back again ; just so you know I mean it when I say
 I hate thongs . DESPISE them . Would much rather go commando . I read once in a medical publication that physicians warn against g-strings and thongs that wedge themselves in you-know-where because the fabric acts as a wick for bacteria to migrate forward . -LRB- Try not to vomit . -RRB- Well , I 'm one of those people who ca n't get a picture like that out of her mind once it , er , wedges itself in there , so I was about as anti-thong as a person could be . But sometimes you ca n't -LRB- or do n't dare -RRB- go commando . In that case , a thong is mandatory . What to do ?? A salesperson sold me on the Hanky Panky thong , and I 'm thrilled to say that she did n't misguide me . The fit is loose -LRB- I know , a loose thong ? -- but that 's the best way I can describe it -RRB- so the fabric skims the outside of your body and does n't wedge itself in . They 're the ONLY comfortable thong I 've ever worn . So
 These are very pretty lace , but they stay put , and really are one size fits most . I throw them in the gentle wash and low temp dry , heck with the hand washing business . These are convenient , I would buy them again .
 This product is worth the price . My first experiences with Hanky Panky lace thongs were with the original and the low-rise . For a thong , I ca n't imagine them being made any more comfortably . They serve the purpose of not exposing those terrible panty lines . The soft , stretchy lace lays gently along the hip area and does n't cause any bulging -LRB- for those who may have some extra padding in that area -RRB- causing that `` muffin-top '' look . Low-rise skinny jeans are a staple for me , so having panties that do n't peak out the back is very important . While both the original style 4811 -LRB- 5 '' rise -RRB- and especially the low-rise style 4911 -LRB- 3.5 '' rise -RRB- provide that hidden coverage , for my body type the mid-rise style 6334 is best for me . They 're not too long and not too short , just right at 4.5 '' rise . From now on , I 'll be purchasing the mid-rise . That 's not to say that I still do n't love the original and low rises I own ; they will still be used !
 I absolutely love these sexy , silky lace thongs by Hanky Panky ... I ca n't get enough ! To be quite honest , I have been an avid `` commando '' girl for years ; opting to not wear any underwear at all because any brand or style was unsightly AND uncomfortable . If I did need to wear something , I purchased g-strings for minimal discomfort and as little material as necessary . Luckily , these thongs are perfect and actual fit and feel better than any g-string . I purchased my first at an expensive lingerie boutique , and I have been in love with it since the first day . The style is sexy and sophisticated , with more than enough colors for every outfit . The fit is just as wonderful , it truly does fit all sizes . The material is stretchy and sits nicely on the hips without digging in or chafing . The style is just as noteworthy . My fiance loves these on me , from when I was a size 12/14 when I first purchased ... until now back down to a size 6 . Whomever said they do not fit the larger bodies well was absolutely wrong . At my biggest , I was 5 ' 2 '' and 171 !!! They felt great and also made me FEEL attractive . Best part , unlike normal clothes ... these do stretch and grow with you so even a slight weigh adjustment will not cause you to have to buy a whole new intimate wardrobe . I bet you could even wear these throughout 9 months of pregnancy with ease ! Just great . I am ordering a bunch of other colors today . Ca n't wait !!! : -RRB-
 A friend bought me a Hanky Panky thong . She was bound and determined to convert me into the sisterhood of the thong wearers.I was totally skeptical , but graciously accepted the gift . The next week ... I ordered three more on my own ! These really ARE comfortable -- and I have tried thongs before and had always rolled my eyes at anyone who said a thong was `` comfortable . '' These really are . The only downside for me is the sizing . They are `` one size '' and supposed to fit from size 2 to 14 -- that 's a heck of a range . I wear a size 10 ~ 12 and I would prefer that they be just a bit bigger - they are n't tight , but they 're be better if they were bigger .
 I am 8 months pregnant with twins and have worn Hanky Panky thongs during my entire pregnancy ! They are soft , comfortable , and stretch as I stretch .
 This is for the guys who shop for their spouses and so 's -LRB- significant other 's -RRB- - get the girl a bunch of Hanky Panky 's - just do it !
 It is like these thongs are not even made of material at all ... invisible to touch ... great underneath clothing and very easy to care for - DO NOT DRY !!!
 I am a size 8 and middle aged I love thongs because they are generally comfy and leave a smooth silhouette . But lately all the thongs I find are low rise . I wanted some mid rise thongs for a leaner look . These panties provide that , but they still are fun and sexy . The lace is soft too . I hate scratchy lace . I am now buying the 5 pack !
 I purchased these as a gift for my girlfriend and she was excited since these are her favorite brand and style . Just a happy face on my girlfriend told me these were great and i might buy her a few more soon . Seller and shipping was awesome , was surprised when i opened the package and all that came out was a lacy thing no bigger a half dollar
 originally got hooked on this because of an article i read in the wall street journal claiming that the two women who started this company were revolutionizing thong panties ... and boy did they ! by far the most comfortable thong ever ! they sit low on hips and come in every color imaginable !!
 the hanky panky 4811 is the best . hands down . this is the * only * underwear worth buying .
 Once you wear a pair of the Hanky Panky panties , you will never want to wear another brand ever again ! I was skeptical at first because they are one size fits all , but they really are so comfortable ... I ca n't even tell I am wearing them ! They are VERY sexy , which comfort and sexy usually do n't belong in the same sentence when it comes to underwear !!! You will not be disappointed ! I wear a lot of low rise jeans and they are well hidden underneath ! They come in so many beautiful colors and cuts if you do n't want the low rise fit .
 I 've worn thongs for years and recently had to switch over to cotton underwear . I bought an extensive selection of what was available . -LRB- Unfortunately , cotton thongs are not nearly as fanciful or sexy for the most part . -RRB- These were by far the most comfortable and the sexiest ! I love them and my fiance loves them too ! I highly recommend them ! I am a size 8 .
 I , like many many others , ordered the 4811 and 4911 when I read the article . I ordered directly through herroom.com on 6/24 . I knew it was going to be a long wait , and they also sent me 3 e-mails during the summer to let me know that they had n't forgotten my order , but the delays were significant due to the heavy demand . They always gave me the option of cancelling my order , since they do n't charge my card until they ship out the order . I almost did , but my order finally came 9/10 , and I must say that they really are the most comfortable thongs I 've ever worn . I 've already placed another large order , as Christmas gifts for my friends !!
 Love these hanky panky 's ! They are pretty , comfortable and made well . They do n't fall apart like inexpensive thongs do over time .
 Feel like they are arely there . So comfy , I will be buying more . I can even wear through my pregnancy
 These are my favorites ! Have many pair now and highly recommend toanyone who wants comfortable yet sexy lingerie . Buy them in many colors !
 I have been wearing Hanky Panky for a few years and continue to be satisfies with the fit and comfort as well as the look . A bit pricey , I think , but that seems to be about the cost of nice thongs found in department stores .
 My wife loved these . Not only did she enjoy the look but finds these to be so comfortable that she will wear them daily . Whether you want to impress before bedtime or feel comfortable and sexy during the day , these will fit your needs !
 Have been wearing thong panties forever but was getting ready to change to boy shorts because I could n't find a comfortable thong . Read about these panties on Yahoo News , checked out the reviews on Amazon , ordered 2 pairs and LOVE THEM !! They really are the most comfortable panties ever and so well made !! They are a little expensive , but for some things , you really do get what you pay for !!! I want a comfortable thong panty and have no problem paying $ 20/pair for just that !!! I LOVE THESE PANTIES and am going to order more .
 These are the most comfortable thongs around ! Instead of feeling like you have a wedgy it feels like you have nothing on . Highly recommended !
 Bought this for my wife for Valentines . She 's loves 'em ! . They fit differently than other thongs so they are much more comfortable . She looks great in them and feels sexy !
 Very sexy and confortable panty . This is ideal for use under thight pants.Also while you are at it why do n't buy your man a thong ? Thongs look incredibly sexy and masculine on men . all my girfriends convinced their men to use thongs and now they love it .
 These pants are great for comfort . True value for the price . So said , there is no individual waist band . Also when you sit normally on a chair , the white fabric inside your side pockets is clearly visible . They could have used the same fabric as the color of the trousers . So , all in all I gave a 4 star .
 I bought two pair to test as work pants . I also bought two pair of another brand . It has been months now , and the pants seem to wear well , and they do not wrinkle . From the washing machine to the dryer , to me in the morning . They always look sharp , and they fit well . That 's all I asked for , and they delivered .
 Useful pants for almost every ocasion . Color does not fade easily . Nice fit .
 I do n't need to tell men over six feet tall or with waists greater than 38 '' that you can burn a ton of gas trying to find clothes that fit . Dockers is a known quantity . So once you find your size , it 's down hill from there . A good price rounds-out the experience .
 The pants are well made , and good quality . I was disappointed in the Individual Fit Waistband ... it hardly gives at all .
 These are great pants and at a great price . I usually have to drive a long way to find a store that has my size .
 There was a far greater ability to get the Dockers I wanted through this vendor than by going to ANY department store . And the prices were significantly better online . The delivery time was a bit slow -- but the time was known at the time I made the purchase -- no false promises of fast delivery . I 'm delighted with this transaction .
 I 've always been a Dockers fan.I love the fit of the flat front . The fabric does n't just crease any how . I love it .
 an excellent pant , comfortable , smooth , good packaging , the measure of pant in line with what the seller say .
 Just right ! It does n't matter how many times it 's been crumpled or washed , it does n't need to be ironed and the crease stays put . The waistline is n't too high , and it 's not too baggy or too tight . Formal enough for work , casual enough for anything else ; I 've even hiked in them -LRB- and the mud stains came right off in one cycle in the wash -RRB- . These are , hands-down , my favorite pants .
 These are the one and only , classic fit original khaki pants from Dockers . The Dockers label is the Kleenex of khaki pants . . the Rolls Royce ... the Xerox . The name is synonymous with the semi-casual look . These pants go great with a leather belt w / cell phone clipped , polo shirt , a clean shave and a crew cut .
 The item is well liked by my husband is one of his favorites since it fit adequately and comfortable .
 It 's nice to find a pair of pants that do n't need any work to fit me right out of the package ! Bought another pair in gray as soon as I used this ones for the first time .
 My teenaged son needs 30x34 pants - which are the dickens to find , even in the big department stores . This fits , and is comparable in price to what I find in the big stores on sale .
 The slacks arrived very quickly . They are a brand new , high-quality product in great shape .
 I have owned many pairs of Dockers Flat Front Original Khaki pants and have always loved them . They are the perfect casual work pant and are comfortable to wear . They do n't usually wrinkle much and they hold up well . I would consider these a good investment . The waist seems to run slightly smaller than many other pants so you may want to get one size larger than you normally would .
 I wo n't give them 5 stars because they 're not really as wrinkle-free as they advertised or as my similar Van Heusen khakis . Either way , they are still light and tr&eacute;s comfortable .
 These pants are wonderful , I have boxy hips and the flat front style takes away from that particular silhouette a and I like that
 Great quality , no time waisted and plenty of choices regarding sizes and color . I will never buy them at the store .
 fit great , feel great , durable , and it works well in both my professional and casual wardrobe

 I was thinking it of using it for my tennis . Unfortunately there was no clue saying it dint have pockets . Anyways its a good shorts for great price .
 If you go to the gym or play ball a lot and need a couple pair of shorts so you do n't need to do laundry every other day , these athletic shorts are perfect . They 're thin but durable . I got them on sale for like $ 10 so they do the trick . Do n't get me wrong its not like you 'll look like a dork at the gym , but if you 're looking for something super flashy , then these are n't them .
 Nice shorts that match almost everything . My boyfriend loves to wear them around the house . Great pair of shorts for an extremely great price ! So buy a couple pairs just to have around !
 no pockets , but yann will wear them all summer.yeehaw .
 My son likes these to sleep and wear under pants in winter . They are perfect , washing easily , and retaining their size and color .
 I like the shorts . The price is excellent . The shorts were a little thinner than I imagined . But I am very satisfied with the purchase .
 I have the scrimmage dazzle too they re thin but durable and for 10.00 cool ! no pockets ok for me , lightweight shortsexcellent and Roomy my favorites great price buying of couple more
 My boyfriend says that these are his favorite shorts . Nice and roomy with some breathing room .
 Nice fit . Excellent material . Wore these to a recent gay pride pool party . Everyone loved them . From what -LSB- eople said , i think several will order their own colors . I own 4 pair in different colors and love them all . The colors are beautiful . Get a pair and enjoy them .
 I tryed ordering the swim suit listed on their web sight in the photo ad . Unfortunately I tried many times with specific instructions to make sure the color was that used in the ad photo , but never got that color . I do have many of the other colors of that swim brief and like them very much . I really wanted that color used in the ad photo , so I 'm very disappointed in that respect . The reason from the company Bonnie & Clyde was that the color dyes were too hard to match the one in the photo . Order was not the last order , but a previous order for the color Hawaiian Blue .
 Nice fitting suite and comfortable.Good looking and well made.Would recomend these to anyone interestedin bikini style swim wear .

 I 'm a women that works for a drywall and painting company . Everbody on both crews has at least 2 pairs of these . I 'm not the only women on the crews , there are 2 others . And these fit us as well as they do the men ! Which is amazing because the difference in our sizes . I 'm a 2 , one is an 8 , and another a 14 . They are n't tight fitting and immodest for work . They fit like you would expect good quality slacks to . They 're durable and are n't see through like most whites . With all the chemicals and paints I work with , my clothes have got to be tough . I would recommend these to anyone in any profession , even for just working at home , these are great !
 Medium weight cloth - sturdy but not too heavy . Use these pants in the summer while doing chores in the yard and woods . Good fit -- size was accurate , both length & waist were good . Not too tight . Like the natural color . Good quality & value .
 Okay , so this was a BIG issue for me.Of course , in nursing school , we have to wear uniform scrubs . Ours are a standard teal uniform top with white scrub pants and white shoes . This last summer I went to all the local medical supply shops to buy scrubs and was a bit overwhelmed . -LRB- Have you noticed how many different shades of `` teal '' there are ? -RRB- After a considerable hit to my starving student budget , I wound up with some of the most ill-fitting , `` unisex '' white pants you could ever imagine.I do n't know about you guys , but I am built like a typical middle aged guy . I got a little bit of a gut and pretty much nothing on the backside . These silly , drawstring pants are made for people with HIPS . Oh , and do n't forget , it 's only tighty-whities while wearing these things . Those boxer shorts with the hearts on them that you love so much are showing right through . And forget putting anything in the pockets . That just weighed them down more.I found myself spending my clinical days walking around the hospital with my binder in one hand and the other holding my pants up ! It became enough of an issue that I had to talk to my instructors to work something out.It was Sherwin-Williams to the rescue . Down at my local paint supply store I found the perfect solution . They were Dickies Relaxed Fit utility pants . I had to trim the Sherwin-Williams patch off the back pocket , but I think these things saved my sanity . They are sized to fit me both in the waist and the legs . They have BELT LOOPS . I can load up my pockets with anything I need without having to worry about the `` saggy britches syndrome . '' Most importantly , I can wear whatever underwear I want.I would encourage anyone , even the ladies , to try these out before spending more money on scrub pants . They are comparable in price , much more sturdy , and just as comfortable . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 I love these pants I bought in a local store , so wanted a couple more pairs . DO NOT order here from Andrew Christion . Terrible seller . I ordered twice and never got the pants . When I emailed there was always an excuse but no pants .
 I shop for quality & price , found these Dickies Men 's Utility Pant = Painters Pant to be an excellent bargain . Good fit , well made , quality materials and true to size . Lightweight enough and flexible for hot Florida sun temps .
 exactly what I wanted . not baggy , not to tight , fits just nicely on me and I 'm not super skinny , fat , or buff . -LRB- I 'm a martial artist -RRB- bought them for comic con , and for making several videos . the pants fit nicely , and are even comfortable for performing stunts .
 These seem to be fine painters pants , although I bought them for a costume/outfit that needed white pants . I am used to wearing loose fitting jeans , and these are not , so they are a bit tight in my legs . If I needed them for work pants , they would probably be too tight and I would instead return and order a larger size .
 The truth I can not review this product because I know much but my husband was fascinated and if you know much about that kind of pants and if he is happy what I can say is that the pants are well
 The title says it all . This is my first ever purchase of a Dickies product , and I am very pleased with the fit and finish of the jeans .
 I 've been wearing Dickies painters pants for the last 10 years . They are very comfortable and durable . I used to buy them at a local uniform store until their prices were increased . I was so excited when I found them at an inexpensive price . Shipping time was really fast which is important to me , since I wear them everyday .
 Great quality for a great price . They fit right , and are both comfortable and functional . The order was also processed on time . I highly recomend them .
 My husband loved them . Shipped quickly and seller had great communication . Will shop again ! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA +
 These utility -LRB- painters -RRB- pants are excellent ! The sizing is accurate and the pants are very comfortable and exactly as described .
 An absolute necessity for the true Husker fan , these classic white Dickies make even huskermike the envy of Lincoln on game day .
 My son was in his high school musical this year , and needed a pair of white pants , and a pair of brown pants . Where DO you get odd colored jean-like pants ... for a boy ? -LRB- No girl jeans , Mom ! -RRB- Oh , right , Amazon . I got two pair , and dyed one pair brown . I felt the price was reasonable enough that it would n't leave a huge hole in the family budget , since I did n't think he 'd actually wear the things once the musical was over -LRB- like a bridesmaid dress ; does anyone ever get any use out of those ? -RRB- . I gave four stars , because the waistband on one pair was a full inch smaller than the other . Not a problem for a skinny teenager , but maybe an issue for someone with an adult metabolism .
 Everything about this order was exactly as I needed it to be . The sizes are accurate , the colors are correct and there are no flaws in workmanship that I have seen . The order shipped and arrived within the allotted time . I was much more satisfied with my online purchases than I was with my in-store ones this year . NO returns ! Yay ! Amazon was a holiday success that I will be using again .
 Most Excellent purchase . This was much better than expected . I would recommend to everyone , price was perfect , delivery was fast ... bought 2 pair
 priced , quality , delivery time i have no complaints . was not a &#34; pure white &#34; as i thought they would be which is what i needed so i dyed them blue and now i really love them
 I got these acutally as part of a Halloween costume , but I 'm glad I have them now . I will use them whenever I 'm doing work around the house or something that requires work-type pants .
 These pants are a little tight around the waist for me , but are otherwise perfect . The pants are well constructed and durable . It 's also worth more than I paid for .
 These are great pants . Nice relax fit , lots of pockets , good length , jeans like material , tough stitching and priced for sale . You can use them for what ever you feel like
 I love wearing white painter pants in the summer and while golfing too . Pockets to hold stuff , fit nicely and after a few washings become more soft .
 This is the perfect pair of pants if your kid has to wear white pants to an FFA , 4-H or other similar event . They are rugged and are kept clean easily as long as they are only soiled with dirt and other farm animal type waste .
 I have ordered 4 pair of these pants . They work for me very well . There are some variations in them when I order each of them at different times or dates . However the quality has always been good . When I say `` vaiations '' it is in regard to small differences concerning the making of the pants . Two pair of pants have thicker pocket matterial than the other two pair . Two pair have extra pockets that the other two pair did not have . Two pair have realy deep pockets , and the other two pair have `` less '' deep pockets . However , the differences are not in any way a problem for my use of the pants . They also shrink when washing the pants and drying them on a clothes line or in the dryer makes no difference . -LRB- The pants shrink -RRB- My 42 inch waist pants shrank to around 40 inches around the waist . Even when useing cold water the pants will shrink when they dry . So if you wear 40 inch waist size you should buy 42 size waiste.If 30 inch waist then buy 32 inch waist size or you might be in a tight situation . Great pants over all and good quality .
 The item arrived fast and was a gift for my 13 yr old niece . It was a bit small so they returned it for a different one . The return process was painless.Excellent experience
 These pants are great for comfort . True value for the price . So said , there is no individual waist band . Also when you sit normally on a chair , the white fabric inside your side pockets is clearly visible . They could have used the same fabric as the color of the trousers . So , all in all I gave a 4 star .
 I bought two pair to test as work pants . I also bought two pair of another brand . It has been months now , and the pants seem to wear well , and they do not wrinkle . From the washing machine to the dryer , to me in the morning . They always look sharp , and they fit well . That 's all I asked for , and they delivered .
 Useful pants for almost every ocasion . Color does not fade easily . Nice fit .
 I do n't need to tell men over six feet tall or with waists greater than 38 '' that you can burn a ton of gas trying to find clothes that fit . Dockers is a known quantity . So once you find your size , it 's down hill from there . A good price rounds-out the experience .
 The pants are well made , and good quality . I was disappointed in the Individual Fit Waistband ... it hardly gives at all .
 These are great pants and at a great price . I usually have to drive a long way to find a store that has my size .
 There was a far greater ability to get the Dockers I wanted through this vendor than by going to ANY department store . And the prices were significantly better online . The delivery time was a bit slow -- but the time was known at the time I made the purchase -- no false promises of fast delivery . I 'm delighted with this transaction .
 I have owned many pairs of Dockers Flat Front Original Khaki pants and have always loved them . They are the perfect casual work pant and are comfortable to wear . They do n't usually wrinkle much and they hold up well . I would consider these a good investment . The waist seems to run slightly smaller than many other pants so you may want to get one size larger than you normally would .
 I wo n't give them 5 stars because they 're not really as wrinkle-free as they advertised or as my similar Van Heusen khakis . Either way , they are still light and tr&eacute;s comfortable .
 These pants are wonderful , I have boxy hips and the flat front style takes away from that particular silhouette a and I like that
 Great quality , no time waisted and plenty of choices regarding sizes and color . I will never buy them at the store .
 fit great , feel great , durable , and it works well in both my professional and casual wardrobe
 I 've always been a Dockers fan.I love the fit of the flat front . The fabric does n't just crease any how . I love it .
 an excellent pant , comfortable , smooth , good packaging , the measure of pant in line with what the seller say .
 Just right ! It does n't matter how many times it 's been crumpled or washed , it does n't need to be ironed and the crease stays put . The waistline is n't too high , and it 's not too baggy or too tight . Formal enough for work , casual enough for anything else ; I 've even hiked in them -LRB- and the mud stains came right off in one cycle in the wash -RRB- . These are , hands-down , my favorite pants .
 These are the one and only , classic fit original khaki pants from Dockers . The Dockers label is the Kleenex of khaki pants . . the Rolls Royce ... the Xerox . The name is synonymous with the semi-casual look . These pants go great with a leather belt w / cell phone clipped , polo shirt , a clean shave and a crew cut .
 The item is well liked by my husband is one of his favorites since it fit adequately and comfortable .
 It 's nice to find a pair of pants that do n't need any work to fit me right out of the package ! Bought another pair in gray as soon as I used this ones for the first time .
 My teenaged son needs 30x34 pants - which are the dickens to find , even in the big department stores . This fits , and is comparable in price to what I find in the big stores on sale .
 The slacks arrived very quickly . They are a brand new , high-quality product in great shape .
 I was thinking it of using it for my tennis . Unfortunately there was no clue saying it dint have pockets . Anyways its a good shorts for great price .
 If you go to the gym or play ball a lot and need a couple pair of shorts so you do n't need to do laundry every other day , these athletic shorts are perfect . They 're thin but durable . I got them on sale for like $ 10 so they do the trick . Do n't get me wrong its not like you 'll look like a dork at the gym , but if you 're looking for something super flashy , then these are n't them .
 Nice shorts that match almost everything . My boyfriend loves to wear them around the house . Great pair of shorts for an extremely great price ! So buy a couple pairs just to have around !
 no pockets , but yann will wear them all summer.yeehaw .
 My son likes these to sleep and wear under pants in winter . They are perfect , washing easily , and retaining their size and color .
 I like the shorts . The price is excellent . The shorts were a little thinner than I imagined . But I am very satisfied with the purchase .
 I have the scrimmage dazzle too they re thin but durable and for 10.00 cool ! no pockets ok for me , lightweight shortsexcellent and Roomy my favorites great price buying of couple more
 My boyfriend says that these are his favorite shorts . Nice and roomy with some breathing room .

 When I recieved mine , I fell in love with the printed outside and the cute green inside . I carry it everywhere ... it 's big enough to carry a brush and other necessities , but subtle enough that it does n't add `` bulk . '' My favorite part , though , is that it can be merely a beach bag , or it can be a nice bag for shopping or going out . The only feature I deduct from it is the pocket on the printed side . It kind of sticks out .

 Nice fit . Excellent material . Wore these to a recent gay pride pool party . Everyone loved them . From what -LSB- eople said , i think several will order their own colors . I own 4 pair in different colors and love them all . The colors are beautiful . Get a pair and enjoy them .
 I tryed ordering the swim suit listed on their web sight in the photo ad . Unfortunately I tried many times with specific instructions to make sure the color was that used in the ad photo , but never got that color . I do have many of the other colors of that swim brief and like them very much . I really wanted that color used in the ad photo , so I 'm very disappointed in that respect . The reason from the company Bonnie & Clyde was that the color dyes were too hard to match the one in the photo . Order was not the last order , but a previous order for the color Hawaiian Blue .
 Nice fitting suite and comfortable.Good looking and well made.Would recomend these to anyone interestedin bikini style swim wear .
 My boyfriend says that these are his favorite shorts . Nice and roomy with some breathing room .

 The retail price listed on the tag -LRB- $ 88 -RRB- is a fantasy price . These pants are not lined , a fact more noticeable given the thinness of the fabric . But they fit well . They are not as ridiculously generously cut for the size as some of the newer Jones of New York and Lauren by Ralph Lauren stuff -LRB- size is just a number but it is supposed to convery some consistency that is completely missing from the new clothing marketing framework -RRB- . These pants are well worth Amazon 's selling price -LRB- $ 17 -RRB- but not the list price .
 These pants met my expectations . They fit well and the fabric quality and workmanship are both good . I would n't say they are incredible or above my expectations , but they definitely were a good price for good basic pants . The length is perfect for me -LRB- I 'm 5 ' 8 '' -RRB- . Oddly enough the gray pair fit a tiny bit more snuggly than the black pair . Not enough of a difference to say they are mis-sized or cut incorrectly but just enough to notice a little difference in fit when I put them on .
 i liked the pants ... esp for the cost ... but i do agree that the the pant does n't look the original price of $ 88 ... it has a comfort fit and no prob with fitting ...
 These are very comfortable , good looking business type pants . The cut is really good , the fabric and finish are decent , they came in the size I ordered and fit just right . What I do n't know is , why they are supposed to cost originally $ 88.00 . No way in hell or heaven they are worth that price . Do n't be fooled if you are looking for an upper class type of a garment . I am giving them 5 stars , because for this price they are worth every penny and more . -LRB- I paid $ 12.99 -RRB-
 I ordered the black - and these are nice dress pants . Just washed them this morning -LRB- yes , machine washable -RRB- , and due to the bit of spandex/stretch , they did n't wrinkle either . A good fit , slightly low waisted and not tapered at the ankle - so they are styled a little more `` hip '' than a lot of ladies dress pants . The fabric is quite lightweight , but I prefer that for year-round use . I got them around $ 12-13 from Amazon - the retail price is ridiculous . I may buy some other colors .
 What a great pant for the price . Quality fabric and style . They feel luxurious . I purchased every color that was in my size . You should too or you 'll be making a second order after you see that they are a fantastic buy .
 I had to send back the first pair I ordered -LRB- 38 reg -RRB- , too small . It 's a guessing game with these suckers . I 'm 5 ' 11 &#34; , 175 and ended up with a 40 regular . If you want to wear several layers -LRB- sweat shirt and vest with a heavy shirt and long johns -RRB- , you may want the 42 regular . Amazon pays for shipping so you can get it right . Good luck .
 I use these for both the bike and the boat , and I have never been cold . All I ware underneath is long underwear , and I am roasting . I am 5 ' 11 '' ; and 180bls . I got size 44 and there is plenty of room for layering . Very mobile also .
 I 'm a horsewoman , and steeling myself some days and nights to go out in the coldest , nastiest , wettest weather to care for my animals can be daunting . Once I 'm suited up in my thermal coveralls , I feel ready for anything . I stay warm , dry and comfortable in the worst of weather -- the fabric is incredibly tough and substantial , but still affords me plenty of mobility . Plenty of pockets conveniently placed , and fairly easy to don the suit , thanks to zippers AND snaps . Plenty of width in the pant leg for tall heavy muck boots . My only beef is that Carhartt does n't carry this item for women -LRB- at least I have n't seen one on their site -RRB- . Women need the same protection and warmth as do men working outdoors , so I find the omission pretty strange . It 's not a big deal -- I jut simply order a smaller men 's size , and it works fine for me . The coveralls last and last , they are just so tough . And so waterproof , I did n't even feel it the other day when my rambunctious toddler turned the water hose on my back , full blast . I just do n't see working in the cold and wet outdoors without them -- would n't do it any other way ! Expect them to last for years . WELL worth the price .
 Bought this because it was the heaviest coverall I could find . Lots of pockets , lots of vents , legs zip up . Looks like it will last for years .
 I 've went through a few sets of carhartt coveralls over the years . I recently needed a new pair and decided I 'd try these . Let me tell YOU , they are very WARM and DURABLE . If you want to own the best , buy these !!!!
 My Dad loves hunting and fishing and these work really well in cold weather . A friend recomended this product , I found it on Amazon , I had it shipped straight to him . Shipping was fast . Thanks !!!!!!!
 This mite b the best suit on da market nice a thick an keeps u warm all day an its water proof its well worth the money if u spend lotz of time outside working dont go buy a cheap coverall an still b cold so u will have wasted ur money this is the best u can get besize one of the fireman suits
 When I purchased this item it was starting to get `` cold '' here in Southern Arizona ... I know , I know it 's relative to where you are . But I 've got over 2 feet of Titanium 13mm Rods in my lower spine , 3 Verterbreal Cages of laminated Titanium and something else , plus 12 Titanium pins to hold all of that mess together , and when I get cold it takes a long time for me to warm up , and I love to ride my motorcycle anytime of the year , so I do n't need to get cold , 'cause it takes literally hours for me to warm back up ... see what I mean , anyway this suit is fantastically `` suited '' for just my needs , although they size it larger than what I expected even with jeans and Combat Boots it 's still long and large , I selected a 42 Regular since that 's my Dress Jacket Size but it 's WAY WAY TOO LARGE AND TOO LONG , I 'm 5 ' 10 '' and weigh 162 pounds , the suit that I recieved is made for someone about 6 ' 2 '' 195 pounds , fortunately that the perfect size of my son who is Active Duty ARMY , he 's got a bike too and wears it daily to work and back . I 'm told by him that when he puts this thing on he 's sweating in less than 5 minutes , and he stays that way , he now has orders for Ft. Drum , Ny . so the suit will work perfectly up there . In the mean time I bought another pair of coveralls size 36 `` Short '' and they fit perfectly , I have great fun riding in the `` wintertime '' here in Arizona .
 I use this while snowblowing in Alaska . Nice and toasty inside , wearing pants and a T-Shirt . Impermeable to wind and snow . Tough.Sizing is tricky , I used other 's reviews to guess my size -LRB- sizing charts are all over the place and even Carharrt 's website is not that helpful -RRB- . I am 6ft tall and 160lbs . 36 Regular fits absolutely perfectly .
 I bought these primarily as motorcycle cold weather gear . Today it was 24F out so thought it would be a good day for a test ride . The Extreme Coveralls were fantastic ! I stayed very comfortable wearing only my normal clothes -LRB- blue jeans and a long sleeve shirt -RRB- . I am confident the temperature will never stop me from riding . They are a little bulky but I do n't feel uncomfortable at all . I have a 32-inch inseam and ordered a regular ; maybe a half-inch too long at times but otherwise the fit is just what I expected . Amazon had a great price and the product is everything I wanted for riding , snow-shoveling , and any other cold weather activity .
 Got this for my hubby that works at the local Zoo . He can be out in the weather for hours on end , often in damp conditions and needed a warmer pair of overalls for some days . He used these twice so far and they have been very warm and resist water somewhat although not made for it . They are very stiff and need to be washed before wearing , and they run large and do not shrink upon washing . I wish I had known before they ran a bit larger , presumable to allow for layering but with these in our weather they are enough to have jeans underneath . Very easy to get on and off , even with clunky heavy shoes .
 Rugged and comfortable these are the carharts we use in Tok alaska , the coldest inhabited place in North America . Carhart products are quality products , they do n't shrink up and fall apart .
 I 'm 6 ' tall and 140lbs . I bought a 36regular , but should have gotten a 36long . I do n't think Amazon sells the long . They fit good unless I put my hands above my shoulders , then they get tight between the crotch and shoulders . They 'd be great to wear outside , but when on my motorcycle , the pants come up 2-3inchest and do n't cover my boots anymore . They block the wind very well on a bike , but you 'll need a t-shirt and warm long sleeve on as well as thermal underwear and pants if you 're going to ride below 40degrees -LRB- in my opinion -RRB- . I 've had no problem wearing them in temps down to 30degrees and staying warm . They retain body heat very well . I rode thru light rain for about 4 miles and they repelled it very well . If you 're 5 '10 or under , a regular would be fine for a bike.Carhartt 's web-site recommends a long if you 're 6 ' or taller , and they 're right there.Got for about $ 125 on Amazon . Carhartt.com has them for $ 200 .
 Read some reviews on this product and some , or should I say most said that the fit was large . Large ??? . . Loose ?? ... Baggy ?? . . Put all three together and it would still be conservative ! My other Carhartt coverall -LRB- reg -RRB- is a 46 and the fit is good for my 5 ' -10 &#34; and 200 pound frame.When I ordered the Extremes model , I thought 46 would do ... tried it and shipped it back , ordered a 44 , a 42 reg and a 42 short ... 42 short is good for a guy my height if you like capri pants or like to show off your calves on the job site !! So I was left with the 42 reg which fit well for my upper body but was way too baggy from the waist down . Had to return that too . As far as quality goes , this is a fine piece of work clothes . . the fabric , pockets and zippers are what u would expect from Carhartt . . since I own close to 20 pairs of Carhartt bibs , lined and unlined , pants , jeans , coveralls and sweatshirts , I will still recommend this product . . meanwhile , I cant help but wonder how much money Carhartt would save by cutting a couple of inches of fabric on the lower portion of their Extremes coverall .
 I was very happy with these coveralls ... . very warm and durable . The size runs a little large . Sorry I did n't buy this after the price dropped .
 My husband is 200lb and 6 ' 1 &#34; . Broad shoulders . Usually a size 34L or 36 . Ended up purchasing a 40L in these coveralls and the extra sleeve and pant length is n't too much , but he is very happy with them .
 These pants are great for comfort . True value for the price . So said , there is no individual waist band . Also when you sit normally on a chair , the white fabric inside your side pockets is clearly visible . They could have used the same fabric as the color of the trousers . So , all in all I gave a 4 star .
 I bought two pair to test as work pants . I also bought two pair of another brand . It has been months now , and the pants seem to wear well , and they do not wrinkle . From the washing machine to the dryer , to me in the morning . They always look sharp , and they fit well . That 's all I asked for , and they delivered .
 Useful pants for almost every ocasion . Color does not fade easily . Nice fit .
 I do n't need to tell men over six feet tall or with waists greater than 38 '' that you can burn a ton of gas trying to find clothes that fit . Dockers is a known quantity . So once you find your size , it 's down hill from there . A good price rounds-out the experience .
 The pants are well made , and good quality . I was disappointed in the Individual Fit Waistband ... it hardly gives at all .
 These are great pants and at a great price . I usually have to drive a long way to find a store that has my size .
 There was a far greater ability to get the Dockers I wanted through this vendor than by going to ANY department store . And the prices were significantly better online . The delivery time was a bit slow -- but the time was known at the time I made the purchase -- no false promises of fast delivery . I 'm delighted with this transaction .
 I 've always been a Dockers fan.I love the fit of the flat front . The fabric does n't just crease any how . I love it .
 an excellent pant , comfortable , smooth , good packaging , the measure of pant in line with what the seller say .
 Just right ! It does n't matter how many times it 's been crumpled or washed , it does n't need to be ironed and the crease stays put . The waistline is n't too high , and it 's not too baggy or too tight . Formal enough for work , casual enough for anything else ; I 've even hiked in them -LRB- and the mud stains came right off in one cycle in the wash -RRB- . These are , hands-down , my favorite pants .
 These are the one and only , classic fit original khaki pants from Dockers . The Dockers label is the Kleenex of khaki pants . . the Rolls Royce ... the Xerox . The name is synonymous with the semi-casual look . These pants go great with a leather belt w / cell phone clipped , polo shirt , a clean shave and a crew cut .
 The item is well liked by my husband is one of his favorites since it fit adequately and comfortable .
 It 's nice to find a pair of pants that do n't need any work to fit me right out of the package ! Bought another pair in gray as soon as I used this ones for the first time .
 My teenaged son needs 30x34 pants - which are the dickens to find , even in the big department stores . This fits , and is comparable in price to what I find in the big stores on sale .
 The slacks arrived very quickly . They are a brand new , high-quality product in great shape .
 I have owned many pairs of Dockers Flat Front Original Khaki pants and have always loved them . They are the perfect casual work pant and are comfortable to wear . They do n't usually wrinkle much and they hold up well . I would consider these a good investment . The waist seems to run slightly smaller than many other pants so you may want to get one size larger than you normally would .
 I wo n't give them 5 stars because they 're not really as wrinkle-free as they advertised or as my similar Van Heusen khakis . Either way , they are still light and tr&eacute;s comfortable .
 These pants are wonderful , I have boxy hips and the flat front style takes away from that particular silhouette a and I like that
 Great quality , no time waisted and plenty of choices regarding sizes and color . I will never buy them at the store .
 fit great , feel great , durable , and it works well in both my professional and casual wardrobe
 I usually wear Hue 's Jeans socks but wanted to try something new . These are nice but only come up to barely the top of my ankle bone .
 These socks are really well-made and super comfortable . I bought some for me and then gave some to my mom , who gets marks on her legs from the top of most sock cuffs . These , she said , were perfectly comfortable and still did n't fall down . I want more !
 I love these socks . The first ones I got I received as a gift and they came from a local department store . when I went to buy more , they did n't carry them . What a disappointment . But then I found them on Amazon . Woo hoo ! If you do n't like socks biting into your ankles or falling down and getting sucked into your shoes . these are the socks for you . I ca n't praise them enough . And they wear like iron .
 Since I live in the desert , I do n't like wearing bulky socks . These socks are thin but sturdy , and they 're very comfortable .
 outstanding product but peculiar pricing on some of the colors . would have been a 5 but for that .
 I never wear socks . I bought these because I needed a pair of white socks for something . They are so soft and comfortable I will be buying more in different colors .
 The socks are really soft ~ And the red color looks so cute . It suit perfectly with my red pants and shoes !
 Product arrived on time and is perfect for summer recreational activities . It is lightweight , comfortable , compressible , and fast-drying .
 These socks are really soft and very comfortable . I love them and highly recommend them .
 These are great glasses , I usually mark mine up with scratches right away but these last . They feel and look good . Good purchase I think , especially for the price .
 I bought this as a birthday present for someone and he loved it . It fit him perfectly .
 Nice fit . Excellent material . Wore these to a recent gay pride pool party . Everyone loved them . From what -LSB- eople said , i think several will order their own colors . I own 4 pair in different colors and love them all . The colors are beautiful . Get a pair and enjoy them .
 I tryed ordering the swim suit listed on their web sight in the photo ad . Unfortunately I tried many times with specific instructions to make sure the color was that used in the ad photo , but never got that color . I do have many of the other colors of that swim brief and like them very much . I really wanted that color used in the ad photo , so I 'm very disappointed in that respect . The reason from the company Bonnie & Clyde was that the color dyes were too hard to match the one in the photo . Order was not the last order , but a previous order for the color Hawaiian Blue .
 Nice fitting suite and comfortable.Good looking and well made.Would recomend these to anyone interestedin bikini style swim wear .
 This is so funny . I got it for my best friend and she loves it . Too funny and cute for sure .
 I bought this shirt on a whim for my Husband for Father 's Day !! When he tried on the shirt and found out the price , he promptly ordered two more !! It feels good and fits good !! He loves it and the price is GREAT !!
 Since any day is Hawaiian shirt day , this is a nice addition to my husband 's wardrobe . Rayon needs touchup ironing on the collar and placket -LRB- ?? where the buttons and button holes are -RRB- but is almost as comfortable as cotton which does need ironing.Really nice blue , well made shirt .
 Nice shirt - looks good , wears well . Only one negative - tends to wrinkle real easily . The price was well worth it !
 Does n't get much better ! Initially bought one as a ` backup ' for my husband 's scant wardrobe , and , since then , ordered three more . The styling , fabric , color , pattern , really impressive . Very flattering fit ; quality construction ; extremely comfortable , cool . Extraordinary value . Washes wonderfully . If there are any left , I recommend highly ! Hope more like this are offered . Will buy in every color , etc. .
 This shirt reminded me of the 70 's beach scene attire and I was not disappointed . It looks great with long shorts and gives a sofisticated casual air . My husband is taking this with us on our cruise in Sept. and I know will look great !
 Very nice fit ; smooth , comfortable feel ; works great in hot weather . And the wife even likes it on me -LRB- she was amazed that I picked it out -RRB- .
 I got this for my husband in tan.He wore it to church Wed. night with khaki shorts and said it was very comfortable and cool.He looked great too!Excellent value here !
 The side adjustment straps work well . I got these a little big but was able to adjust them down . Well made and great to wear all summer .
 I 'm a women that works for a drywall and painting company . Everbody on both crews has at least 2 pairs of these . I 'm not the only women on the crews , there are 2 others . And these fit us as well as they do the men ! Which is amazing because the difference in our sizes . I 'm a 2 , one is an 8 , and another a 14 . They are n't tight fitting and immodest for work . They fit like you would expect good quality slacks to . They 're durable and are n't see through like most whites . With all the chemicals and paints I work with , my clothes have got to be tough . I would recommend these to anyone in any profession , even for just working at home , these are great !
 Medium weight cloth - sturdy but not too heavy . Use these pants in the summer while doing chores in the yard and woods . Good fit -- size was accurate , both length & waist were good . Not too tight . Like the natural color . Good quality & value .
 Okay , so this was a BIG issue for me.Of course , in nursing school , we have to wear uniform scrubs . Ours are a standard teal uniform top with white scrub pants and white shoes . This last summer I went to all the local medical supply shops to buy scrubs and was a bit overwhelmed . -LRB- Have you noticed how many different shades of `` teal '' there are ? -RRB- After a considerable hit to my starving student budget , I wound up with some of the most ill-fitting , `` unisex '' white pants you could ever imagine.I do n't know about you guys , but I am built like a typical middle aged guy . I got a little bit of a gut and pretty much nothing on the backside . These silly , drawstring pants are made for people with HIPS . Oh , and do n't forget , it 's only tighty-whities while wearing these things . Those boxer shorts with the hearts on them that you love so much are showing right through . And forget putting anything in the pockets . That just weighed them down more.I found myself spending my clinical days walking around the hospital with my binder in one hand and the other holding my pants up ! It became enough of an issue that I had to talk to my instructors to work something out.It was Sherwin-Williams to the rescue . Down at my local paint supply store I found the perfect solution . They were Dickies Relaxed Fit utility pants . I had to trim the Sherwin-Williams patch off the back pocket , but I think these things saved my sanity . They are sized to fit me both in the waist and the legs . They have BELT LOOPS . I can load up my pockets with anything I need without having to worry about the `` saggy britches syndrome . '' Most importantly , I can wear whatever underwear I want.I would encourage anyone , even the ladies , to try these out before spending more money on scrub pants . They are comparable in price , much more sturdy , and just as comfortable . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 I love these pants I bought in a local store , so wanted a couple more pairs . DO NOT order here from Andrew Christion . Terrible seller . I ordered twice and never got the pants . When I emailed there was always an excuse but no pants .
 I shop for quality & price , found these Dickies Men 's Utility Pant = Painters Pant to be an excellent bargain . Good fit , well made , quality materials and true to size . Lightweight enough and flexible for hot Florida sun temps .
 exactly what I wanted . not baggy , not to tight , fits just nicely on me and I 'm not super skinny , fat , or buff . -LRB- I 'm a martial artist -RRB- bought them for comic con , and for making several videos . the pants fit nicely , and are even comfortable for performing stunts .
 These seem to be fine painters pants , although I bought them for a costume/outfit that needed white pants . I am used to wearing loose fitting jeans , and these are not , so they are a bit tight in my legs . If I needed them for work pants , they would probably be too tight and I would instead return and order a larger size .
 The truth I can not review this product because I know much but my husband was fascinated and if you know much about that kind of pants and if he is happy what I can say is that the pants are well
 My son was in his high school musical this year , and needed a pair of white pants , and a pair of brown pants . Where DO you get odd colored jean-like pants ... for a boy ? -LRB- No girl jeans , Mom ! -RRB- Oh , right , Amazon . I got two pair , and dyed one pair brown . I felt the price was reasonable enough that it would n't leave a huge hole in the family budget , since I did n't think he 'd actually wear the things once the musical was over -LRB- like a bridesmaid dress ; does anyone ever get any use out of those ? -RRB- . I gave four stars , because the waistband on one pair was a full inch smaller than the other . Not a problem for a skinny teenager , but maybe an issue for someone with an adult metabolism .
 Everything about this order was exactly as I needed it to be . The sizes are accurate , the colors are correct and there are no flaws in workmanship that I have seen . The order shipped and arrived within the allotted time . I was much more satisfied with my online purchases than I was with my in-store ones this year . NO returns ! Yay ! Amazon was a holiday success that I will be using again .
 Most Excellent purchase . This was much better than expected . I would recommend to everyone , price was perfect , delivery was fast ... bought 2 pair
 priced , quality , delivery time i have no complaints . was not a &#34; pure white &#34; as i thought they would be which is what i needed so i dyed them blue and now i really love them
 I got these acutally as part of a Halloween costume , but I 'm glad I have them now . I will use them whenever I 'm doing work around the house or something that requires work-type pants .
 These pants are a little tight around the waist for me , but are otherwise perfect . The pants are well constructed and durable . It 's also worth more than I paid for .
 These are great pants . Nice relax fit , lots of pockets , good length , jeans like material , tough stitching and priced for sale . You can use them for what ever you feel like
 I love wearing white painter pants in the summer and while golfing too . Pockets to hold stuff , fit nicely and after a few washings become more soft .
 This is the perfect pair of pants if your kid has to wear white pants to an FFA , 4-H or other similar event . They are rugged and are kept clean easily as long as they are only soiled with dirt and other farm animal type waste .
 I have ordered 4 pair of these pants . They work for me very well . There are some variations in them when I order each of them at different times or dates . However the quality has always been good . When I say `` vaiations '' it is in regard to small differences concerning the making of the pants . Two pair of pants have thicker pocket matterial than the other two pair . Two pair have extra pockets that the other two pair did not have . Two pair have realy deep pockets , and the other two pair have `` less '' deep pockets . However , the differences are not in any way a problem for my use of the pants . They also shrink when washing the pants and drying them on a clothes line or in the dryer makes no difference . -LRB- The pants shrink -RRB- My 42 inch waist pants shrank to around 40 inches around the waist . Even when useing cold water the pants will shrink when they dry . So if you wear 40 inch waist size you should buy 42 size waiste.If 30 inch waist then buy 32 inch waist size or you might be in a tight situation . Great pants over all and good quality .
 The title says it all . This is my first ever purchase of a Dickies product , and I am very pleased with the fit and finish of the jeans .
 I 've been wearing Dickies painters pants for the last 10 years . They are very comfortable and durable . I used to buy them at a local uniform store until their prices were increased . I was so excited when I found them at an inexpensive price . Shipping time was really fast which is important to me , since I wear them everyday .
 Great quality for a great price . They fit right , and are both comfortable and functional . The order was also processed on time . I highly recomend them .
 My husband loved them . Shipped quickly and seller had great communication . Will shop again ! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA +
 These utility -LRB- painters -RRB- pants are excellent ! The sizing is accurate and the pants are very comfortable and exactly as described .
 An absolute necessity for the true Husker fan , these classic white Dickies make even huskermike the envy of Lincoln on game day .
 I find this shirt to have a great quaility , I bought one for my husband and my son . I would purchase again .
 The side adjustment straps work well . I got these a little big but was able to adjust them down . Well made and great to wear all summer .
 These are my favorites ! Have many pair now and highly recommend toanyone who wants comfortable yet sexy lingerie . Buy them in many colors !
 I have been wearing Hanky Panky for a few years and continue to be satisfies with the fit and comfort as well as the look . A bit pricey , I think , but that seems to be about the cost of nice thongs found in department stores .
 My wife loved these . Not only did she enjoy the look but finds these to be so comfortable that she will wear them daily . Whether you want to impress before bedtime or feel comfortable and sexy during the day , these will fit your needs !
 Have been wearing thong panties forever but was getting ready to change to boy shorts because I could n't find a comfortable thong . Read about these panties on Yahoo News , checked out the reviews on Amazon , ordered 2 pairs and LOVE THEM !! They really are the most comfortable panties ever and so well made !! They are a little expensive , but for some things , you really do get what you pay for !!! I want a comfortable thong panty and have no problem paying $ 20/pair for just that !!! I LOVE THESE PANTIES and am going to order more .
 These are the most comfortable thongs around ! Instead of feeling like you have a wedgy it feels like you have nothing on . Highly recommended !
 Bought this for my wife for Valentines . She 's loves 'em ! . They fit differently than other thongs so they are much more comfortable . She looks great in them and feels sexy !
 Very sexy and confortable panty . This is ideal for use under thight pants.Also while you are at it why do n't buy your man a thong ? Thongs look incredibly sexy and masculine on men . all my girfriends convinced their men to use thongs and now they love it .
 It is like these thongs are not even made of material at all ... invisible to touch ... great underneath clothing and very easy to care for - DO NOT DRY !!!
 I am a size 8 and middle aged I love thongs because they are generally comfy and leave a smooth silhouette . But lately all the thongs I find are low rise . I wanted some mid rise thongs for a leaner look . These panties provide that , but they still are fun and sexy . The lace is soft too . I hate scratchy lace . I am now buying the 5 pack !
 I purchased these as a gift for my girlfriend and she was excited since these are her favorite brand and style . Just a happy face on my girlfriend told me these were great and i might buy her a few more soon . Seller and shipping was awesome , was surprised when i opened the package and all that came out was a lacy thing no bigger a half dollar
 originally got hooked on this because of an article i read in the wall street journal claiming that the two women who started this company were revolutionizing thong panties ... and boy did they ! by far the most comfortable thong ever ! they sit low on hips and come in every color imaginable !!
 the hanky panky 4811 is the best . hands down . this is the * only * underwear worth buying .
 Once you wear a pair of the Hanky Panky panties , you will never want to wear another brand ever again ! I was skeptical at first because they are one size fits all , but they really are so comfortable ... I ca n't even tell I am wearing them ! They are VERY sexy , which comfort and sexy usually do n't belong in the same sentence when it comes to underwear !!! You will not be disappointed ! I wear a lot of low rise jeans and they are well hidden underneath ! They come in so many beautiful colors and cuts if you do n't want the low rise fit .
 I 've worn thongs for years and recently had to switch over to cotton underwear . I bought an extensive selection of what was available . -LRB- Unfortunately , cotton thongs are not nearly as fanciful or sexy for the most part . -RRB- These were by far the most comfortable and the sexiest ! I love them and my fiance loves them too ! I highly recommend them ! I am a size 8 .
 I , like many many others , ordered the 4811 and 4911 when I read the article . I ordered directly through herroom.com on 6/24 . I knew it was going to be a long wait , and they also sent me 3 e-mails during the summer to let me know that they had n't forgotten my order , but the delays were significant due to the heavy demand . They always gave me the option of cancelling my order , since they do n't charge my card until they ship out the order . I almost did , but my order finally came 9/10 , and I must say that they really are the most comfortable thongs I 've ever worn . I 've already placed another large order , as Christmas gifts for my friends !!
 Love these hanky panky 's ! They are pretty , comfortable and made well . They do n't fall apart like inexpensive thongs do over time .
 Feel like they are arely there . So comfy , I will be buying more . I can even wear through my pregnancy
 I rate it five stars , but really it should be 500 . These are AMAZING . I 'd always hated thongs , but these are so soft , stretchy , sexy and so very well cut I changed my mind . -LRB- They machine wash too -RRB- You 'll love them - buy several!P.S . I 'm a lingerie junkie -- I ' v bought and tried everything from La Perla to victoria 's secret and back again ; just so you know I mean it when I say
 I hate thongs . DESPISE them . Would much rather go commando . I read once in a medical publication that physicians warn against g-strings and thongs that wedge themselves in you-know-where because the fabric acts as a wick for bacteria to migrate forward . -LRB- Try not to vomit . -RRB- Well , I 'm one of those people who ca n't get a picture like that out of her mind once it , er , wedges itself in there , so I was about as anti-thong as a person could be . But sometimes you ca n't -LRB- or do n't dare -RRB- go commando . In that case , a thong is mandatory . What to do ?? A salesperson sold me on the Hanky Panky thong , and I 'm thrilled to say that she did n't misguide me . The fit is loose -LRB- I know , a loose thong ? -- but that 's the best way I can describe it -RRB- so the fabric skims the outside of your body and does n't wedge itself in . They 're the ONLY comfortable thong I 've ever worn . So
 These are very pretty lace , but they stay put , and really are one size fits most . I throw them in the gentle wash and low temp dry , heck with the hand washing business . These are convenient , I would buy them again .
 This product is worth the price . My first experiences with Hanky Panky lace thongs were with the original and the low-rise . For a thong , I ca n't imagine them being made any more comfortably . They serve the purpose of not exposing those terrible panty lines . The soft , stretchy lace lays gently along the hip area and does n't cause any bulging -LRB- for those who may have some extra padding in that area -RRB- causing that `` muffin-top '' look . Low-rise skinny jeans are a staple for me , so having panties that do n't peak out the back is very important . While both the original style 4811 -LRB- 5 '' rise -RRB- and especially the low-rise style 4911 -LRB- 3.5 '' rise -RRB- provide that hidden coverage , for my body type the mid-rise style 6334 is best for me . They 're not too long and not too short , just right at 4.5 '' rise . From now on , I 'll be purchasing the mid-rise . That 's not to say that I still do n't love the original and low rises I own ; they will still be used !
 I absolutely love these sexy , silky lace thongs by Hanky Panky ... I ca n't get enough ! To be quite honest , I have been an avid `` commando '' girl for years ; opting to not wear any underwear at all because any brand or style was unsightly AND uncomfortable . If I did need to wear something , I purchased g-strings for minimal discomfort and as little material as necessary . Luckily , these thongs are perfect and actual fit and feel better than any g-string . I purchased my first at an expensive lingerie boutique , and I have been in love with it since the first day . The style is sexy and sophisticated , with more than enough colors for every outfit . The fit is just as wonderful , it truly does fit all sizes . The material is stretchy and sits nicely on the hips without digging in or chafing . The style is just as noteworthy . My fiance loves these on me , from when I was a size 12/14 when I first purchased ... until now back down to a size 6 . Whomever said they do not fit the larger bodies well was absolutely wrong . At my biggest , I was 5 ' 2 '' and 171 !!! They felt great and also made me FEEL attractive . Best part , unlike normal clothes ... these do stretch and grow with you so even a slight weigh adjustment will not cause you to have to buy a whole new intimate wardrobe . I bet you could even wear these throughout 9 months of pregnancy with ease ! Just great . I am ordering a bunch of other colors today . Ca n't wait !!! : -RRB-
 A friend bought me a Hanky Panky thong . She was bound and determined to convert me into the sisterhood of the thong wearers.I was totally skeptical , but graciously accepted the gift . The next week ... I ordered three more on my own ! These really ARE comfortable -- and I have tried thongs before and had always rolled my eyes at anyone who said a thong was `` comfortable . '' These really are . The only downside for me is the sizing . They are `` one size '' and supposed to fit from size 2 to 14 -- that 's a heck of a range . I wear a size 10 ~ 12 and I would prefer that they be just a bit bigger - they are n't tight , but they 're be better if they were bigger .
 I am 8 months pregnant with twins and have worn Hanky Panky thongs during my entire pregnancy ! They are soft , comfortable , and stretch as I stretch .
 This is for the guys who shop for their spouses and so 's -LRB- significant other 's -RRB- - get the girl a bunch of Hanky Panky 's - just do it !
 These pants are great for comfort . True value for the price . So said , there is no individual waist band . Also when you sit normally on a chair , the white fabric inside your side pockets is clearly visible . They could have used the same fabric as the color of the trousers . So , all in all I gave a 4 star .
 I bought two pair to test as work pants . I also bought two pair of another brand . It has been months now , and the pants seem to wear well , and they do not wrinkle . From the washing machine to the dryer , to me in the morning . They always look sharp , and they fit well . That 's all I asked for , and they delivered .
 Useful pants for almost every ocasion . Color does not fade easily . Nice fit .
 I do n't need to tell men over six feet tall or with waists greater than 38 '' that you can burn a ton of gas trying to find clothes that fit . Dockers is a known quantity . So once you find your size , it 's down hill from there . A good price rounds-out the experience .
 The pants are well made , and good quality . I was disappointed in the Individual Fit Waistband ... it hardly gives at all .
 These are great pants and at a great price . I usually have to drive a long way to find a store that has my size .
 There was a far greater ability to get the Dockers I wanted through this vendor than by going to ANY department store . And the prices were significantly better online . The delivery time was a bit slow -- but the time was known at the time I made the purchase -- no false promises of fast delivery . I 'm delighted with this transaction .
 I 've always been a Dockers fan.I love the fit of the flat front . The fabric does n't just crease any how . I love it .
 an excellent pant , comfortable , smooth , good packaging , the measure of pant in line with what the seller say .
 Just right ! It does n't matter how many times it 's been crumpled or washed , it does n't need to be ironed and the crease stays put . The waistline is n't too high , and it 's not too baggy or too tight . Formal enough for work , casual enough for anything else ; I 've even hiked in them -LRB- and the mud stains came right off in one cycle in the wash -RRB- . These are , hands-down , my favorite pants .
 These are the one and only , classic fit original khaki pants from Dockers . The Dockers label is the Kleenex of khaki pants . . the Rolls Royce ... the Xerox . The name is synonymous with the semi-casual look . These pants go great with a leather belt w / cell phone clipped , polo shirt , a clean shave and a crew cut .
 The item is well liked by my husband is one of his favorites since it fit adequately and comfortable .
 It 's nice to find a pair of pants that do n't need any work to fit me right out of the package ! Bought another pair in gray as soon as I used this ones for the first time .
 My teenaged son needs 30x34 pants - which are the dickens to find , even in the big department stores . This fits , and is comparable in price to what I find in the big stores on sale .
 The slacks arrived very quickly . They are a brand new , high-quality product in great shape .
 I have owned many pairs of Dockers Flat Front Original Khaki pants and have always loved them . They are the perfect casual work pant and are comfortable to wear . They do n't usually wrinkle much and they hold up well . I would consider these a good investment . The waist seems to run slightly smaller than many other pants so you may want to get one size larger than you normally would .
 I wo n't give them 5 stars because they 're not really as wrinkle-free as they advertised or as my similar Van Heusen khakis . Either way , they are still light and tr&eacute;s comfortable .
 These pants are wonderful , I have boxy hips and the flat front style takes away from that particular silhouette a and I like that
 Great quality , no time waisted and plenty of choices regarding sizes and color . I will never buy them at the store .
 fit great , feel great , durable , and it works well in both my professional and casual wardrobe
 Nice fit . Excellent material . Wore these to a recent gay pride pool party . Everyone loved them . From what -LSB- eople said , i think several will order their own colors . I own 4 pair in different colors and love them all . The colors are beautiful . Get a pair and enjoy them .
 I tryed ordering the swim suit listed on their web sight in the photo ad .

I do have many of the other colors of that swim brief and like them very much . I really wanted that color used in the ad photo , so I 'm very disappointed in that respect . The reason from the company Bonnie & Clyde was that the color dyes were too hard to match the one in the photo . Order was not the last order , but a previous order for the color Hawaiian Blue .
 Nice fitting suite and comfortable.Good looking and well made.Would recomend these to anyone interestedin bikini style swim wear .
 20 '' of snow in Albuquerque ... most in the history of the city and I had my snow bibs ... Hurray !
 My son-in-law loved the quality of the wallet and I liked the price and the service I received in getting the wallet

 I bought these coveralls for my son-in-law for Christmas . He was totally satisfied and said they fit perfectly and are very warm and comfortable . Other brands are not as insulated and require wearing heavier clothing with them . This is the second pair of Carhartt coveralls I 've purchased in a couple of years and these were less expensive . I was very happy with this selection and especially the price and quality of the garment .
 These coveralls seem to be as good as advertised . Only had a week and no sub zero temps yet BUT with a pair of Duofold Heavy Thermals underneath , I have been very warm in temps that have dipped into the low 30 's already . STRONG word of advice-find a store that carries these locally to try on for size BEFORE you order . These run Long since I am 5 ' 9 '' and 185 lbs and I needed a 46 SHORT and they are still a tad long . I could 've got a 44 but went big to play it safe for layering . I also saved well over $ 50 by buying them online .
 I am unsure if this is amazons mistake or the sellers , but what the title and description said is that this was a tall . When I recieved the product and before when I was tracking it what had actually went through was a regular . So yes do buy this item , it is great . Just make sure you get the correct size before finalizing your sale . Have a great day !
 I am a facility director in Vermont and I boughty these for my crew to stay warm when working on our open tractor in the winter . They love them and it keeps them on the equipment longer .
 I just ordered this amazing waterproof , super warm coverall . Just had our first over half a foot blizzard and did n't feel a thing . I had to order a short because the regular was to long and to big , but this coverall is the warmest and most durable clothing I own . Foot of snow ? no problem . Single digits outside and thirty mile winds ? no problem . Been there done that . I would recommend this product to anyone who loves the outdoors even in cold temps or like being prepared . I know I do . Just make sure to go try on one first . They fit much larger than normal .
 Small is not underrated in this item . You better be very short from the waist to the shoulder . I got stuck in it , like a straight jacket , when I tried it on !! I was alone , and nearly had a panic attack , trying to get it off . LOL . They still are very well made !!
 I 'm 5.7 and 215 lbs . Fit great and super warm . I would recommend to anyone . Durable , the hood that you can get separate does n't snap very well though . Not sure if the issue is the carharts or hood . Will stay on , just unsnaps too easily .
 I have n't tried it on yet and I am already blown away by everything about it . Guys at work have had anything Carhartt for around 30 years and are still working - heavy duty work - comfortably thanks to Carhartt ! Plus the fabric is n't really ripped or faded much anywhere . I am looking forward to 30 + years of use .
 I purchased this for cold weather riding on my motorcycle . The cold weather has not yet begun , so I do not yet know for sure how warm it will keep me . However , the fit is good -LRB- I am 5 ' 9 '' and 180 lbs . -RRB- and there is a little extra room for additional layering should I need it . I can move comfortably in it and the zippers and snaps all work very well . From what I can see so far , I think it will do the job I need it to do .
 I 've always been a Dockers fan.I love the fit of the flat front . The fabric does n't just crease any how . I love it .
 an excellent pant , comfortable , smooth , good packaging , the measure of pant in line with what the seller say .
 Just right ! It does n't matter how many times it 's been crumpled or washed , it does n't need to be ironed and the crease stays put . The waistline is n't too high , and it 's not too baggy or too tight . Formal enough for work , casual enough for anything else ; I 've even hiked in them -LRB- and the mud stains came right off in one cycle in the wash -RRB- . These are , hands-down , my favorite pants .
 These are the one and only , classic fit original khaki pants from Dockers . The Dockers label is the Kleenex of khaki pants . . the Rolls Royce ... the Xerox . The name is synonymous with the semi-casual look . These pants go great with a leather belt w / cell phone clipped , polo shirt , a clean shave and a crew cut .
 The item is well liked by my husband is one of his favorites since it fit adequately and comfortable .
 It 's nice to find a pair of pants that do n't need any work to fit me right out of the package ! Bought another pair in gray as soon as I used this ones for the first time .
 My teenaged son needs 30x34 pants - which are the dickens to find , even in the big department stores . This fits , and is comparable in price to what I find in the big stores on sale .
 The slacks arrived very quickly . They are a brand new , high-quality product in great shape .
 I have owned many pairs of Dockers Flat Front Original Khaki pants and have always loved them . They are the perfect casual work pant and are comfortable to wear . They do n't usually wrinkle much and they hold up well . I would consider these a good investment . The waist seems to run slightly smaller than many other pants so you may want to get one size larger than you normally would .
 I wo n't give them 5 stars because they 're not really as wrinkle-free as they advertised or as my similar Van Heusen khakis . Either way , they are still light and tr&eacute;s comfortable .
 These pants are wonderful , I have boxy hips and the flat front style takes away from that particular silhouette a and I like that
 Great quality , no time waisted and plenty of choices regarding sizes and color . I will never buy them at the store .
 fit great , feel great , durable , and it works well in both my professional and casual wardrobe
 These pants are great for comfort . True value for the price . So said , there is no individual waist band . Also when you sit normally on a chair , the white fabric inside your side pockets is clearly visible . They could have used the same fabric as the color of the trousers . So , all in all I gave a 4 star .
 I bought two pair to test as work pants . I also bought two pair of another brand . It has been months now , and the pants seem to wear well , and they do not wrinkle . From the washing machine to the dryer , to me in the morning . They always look sharp , and they fit well . That 's all I asked for , and they delivered .
 Useful pants for almost every ocasion . Color does not fade easily . Nice fit .
 I do n't need to tell men over six feet tall or with waists greater than 38 '' that you can burn a ton of gas trying to find clothes that fit . Dockers is a known quantity . So once you find your size , it 's down hill from there . A good price rounds-out the experience .
 The pants are well made , and good quality . I was disappointed in the Individual Fit Waistband ... it hardly gives at all .
 These are great pants and at a great price . I usually have to drive a long way to find a store that has my size .
 There was a far greater ability to get the Dockers I wanted through this vendor than by going to ANY department store . And the prices were significantly better online . The delivery time was a bit slow -- but the time was known at the time I made the purchase -- no false promises of fast delivery . I 'm delighted with this transaction .
 Nice fit . Excellent material . Wore these to a recent gay pride pool party . Everyone loved them . From what -LSB- eople said , i think several will order their own colors . I own 4 pair in different colors and love them all . The colors are beautiful . Get a pair and enjoy them .
 I tryed ordering the swim suit listed on their web sight in the photo ad . Unfortunately I tried many times with specific instructions to make sure the color was that used in the ad photo , but never got that color . I do have many of the other colors of that swim brief and like them very much . I really wanted that color used in the ad photo , so I 'm very disappointed in that respect . The reason from the company Bonnie & Clyde was that the color dyes were too hard to match the one in the photo . Order was not the last order , but a previous order for the color Hawaiian Blue .
 Nice fitting suite and comfortable.Good looking and well made.Would recomend these to anyone interestedin bikini style swim wear .

 Had to use extra eyelash glue for the moustache , but otherwise it was a big hit !
 My grandson was delighted with this Einstein costume which was received in time for him to participate in a class project . The mustache , however , did n't have enough sticking power and kept falling off .
 Not bad for the price ! My son was Albert Einstein in a living wax museum at his elementary school . The white crazy wig and mustache were just what he needed to complete his costume . The mustache could have used some extra glue or sticky tape but otherwise it was just fine .
 We used this for our Christmas program . It is n't the highest quality but for the price it was perfect . I was impressed that the mustache stayed on our little actor even when she was playing with it .
 My son had a great time with this costume . We bought it for a classroom presentation he was giving , and it was just perfect . The only issue , as other reviewers have mentioned , is the mustache . It does n't adhere very well . The manufacturer should consider including some other piece of tape or adhesive to improve wear . Otherwise , we really enjoyed this product and recommend it for other Jr. . Einsteins !
 this worked great - adhesive was fine despite other rvws on site . got lots of compliments !

 I purchased this as an accessory for my 10 yr niece , Rayna , who was `` Jeannie '' for Halloween . The bottle was adorable and so was Jeannie . Great buy/Happy Jeannie
 This is perfect for Dorthy costume and the price can not be beat . The only thing is the weird teeth on the dog ... kinda scary looking like the dog has rabies . However , the teeth are made of felt material . So , I was able just to cut them off and you could not even tell and the dog looked cute again :--RRB- I would recommend !

 This headpiece is exactly what I expected . A quality product . The only downfall was that the material was in a package which put creases into the foam type material that was impossible for me to iron or straighten out . If the piece was shipped with cardboard in it to hold the shape of the hat it would be a much better look . I ended up taking the hair out of the headpiece and using it with the hat that came with my costume .

 I have always found it impossible to get jeans to fit - I am 5 ' 2 '' and a size 4 - so jeans always have the waist , hips and knees in the wrong place , BUT ! A friend recommended Mavi jeans to me , and I have never looked back ! Minnie jeans are the best fit I have ever found ... the difficult bit is tracking them down ...

 I bought this for the cold/snow environment . I ordered for my size , but had to return it because it was to small . Think about ordering a size or two bigger . Very comfortable . Keeps me toasty warm .
 Think I reviewed before , but if you can figure out correct size they are worth it . Husband 200lb , 6 ' 1 '' , wears a 36 and ended up getting a 40L in these coveralls after 2 attempts .
 Bought this for a friend , and it was too big for him . We decided to give it as a gift to another friend who has trouble finding coveralls he can carry when he trucks cross country . They fit him perfectly , and he was ecstatic to get them .
 I bought the XL for my husband -LRB- a size up from what he normally wears -RRB- and it was incredibly small . He was bummed ... other than that , it was perfect .
 Everything was very good about this product except the zippers ; they were very , very stiff and difficult to open and close , especially the colder it got outside ... Would stick in several places !
 This is a great suit nice an warm its a lil tricky to find the rite size to fit cuz of how they r made but this mite b the best coverall on the market for u if u work out in the freezing cold allday

 These pants are wonderful , I have boxy hips and the flat front style takes away from that particular silhouette a and I like that
 Great quality , no time waisted and plenty of choices regarding sizes and color . I will never buy them at the store .
 fit great , feel great , durable , and it works well in both my professional and casual wardrobe
 I 've always been a Dockers fan.I love the fit of the flat front . The fabric does n't just crease any how . I love it .
 an excellent pant , comfortable , smooth , good packaging , the measure of pant in line with what the seller say .
 Just right ! It does n't matter how many times it 's been crumpled or washed , it does n't need to be ironed and the crease stays put . The waistline is n't too high , and it 's not too baggy or too tight . Formal enough for work , casual enough for anything else ; I 've even hiked in them -LRB- and the mud stains came right off in one cycle in the wash -RRB- . These are , hands-down , my favorite pants .
 These are the one and only , classic fit original khaki pants from Dockers . The Dockers label is the Kleenex of khaki pants . . the Rolls Royce ... the Xerox . The name is synonymous with the semi-casual look . These pants go great with a leather belt w / cell phone clipped , polo shirt , a clean shave and a crew cut .
 The item is well liked by my husband is one of his favorites since it fit adequately and comfortable .
 It 's nice to find a pair of pants that do n't need any work to fit me right out of the package ! Bought another pair in gray as soon as I used this ones for the first time .
 My teenaged son needs 30x34 pants - which are the dickens to find , even in the big department stores . This fits , and is comparable in price to what I find in the big stores on sale .
 The slacks arrived very quickly . They are a brand new , high-quality product in great shape .
 These Calvin Klein Jeans are the most comfortable jeans that I have owned in years . They are a size 8 and they fit great . They are roomy in the hips and tapered in the legs .
 Glad to find a pair of jeans that is long enough . Why wo n't the stores in San Fransisco area carry jeans for women with long legs . I bought a pair in Seattle while traveling but came back to the San Francisco bay area and NO store had these in LONG . Macy 's actually told me they do n't carry the size I need and that they could not order them . Yet Seattle had lots in stock . Even Macy 's web site did n't have them . I do n't think it 's fair that I also have to pay more than other women - I have to pay for shipping and fat chance I could ever find a pair of jeans that fits on sale . Gone are the days of costumer service .
 I have finally found the perfect pair of jeans . I tried these on at a store in NYC and mistakenly only bought one pair , so I just ordered the same exact pair through Amazon . The reason they are perfect is because after wearing jeans all day , usually the top of them stretch out and I 'm constantly pulling them up because they tend to sag . These jeans maintained their fit perfectly all day . No , I did not even need a belt , but for some reason , when I wear other jeans that are a size 4 and fit me perfectly when I first put them on , by the middle of the day , they stretch out at the top and I have to constantly pull them up . These are perfect and extremely sexy . I got many compliments on them !
 It is hard to find good jeans in any of the stores now but I have always loved Calvin Klein 's skinny jeans . They fit fantastic and I am so thrilled with my purchase !
 I love these jeans . I was a little wary buying jeans without trying them on , but they are true to size and very comfortable , they also wash up nicely .
 I purchased a pair of Calvin Klein Stretch Skinny Jeans and they fit wonderful . The denim is so comfortable . This is my first pair of Calvin Klein jeans and I will be purchasing them from now on . I wear a size 16 and they fit me true to size , I absolutely love the fit . I received so many compliments while wearing them . I would highly recommend these jeans for women of all sizes .
 Wish I 'd bought several more pairs . They are true to size -LRB- I got a 10X30 -RRB- and they are literally perfect . They do n't lose shape , bag out , stretch too much . They are comfy and flattering . The fabric is nice - not scratchy and they do n't make my behind look big nor do they cut into my waist.Also , and this is why these are sort of the Holy Grail of jeans , they do not GAP in the back ! This is a problem with tons of jeans for me . These do n't . Hallelujah !
 THESE ARE WORTH THE MONEY . FLATTERING AND COMFORTABLE . MAKE ME LOOK SUPER TRIM AND SLIM .
 These are great jeans ! I used to be a big CK jeans fan in the 80s-90s , then got caught up in the hype of THE NEW jeans that promised a more flattering fit , look skinnier , etc and cost about three times as much ! If you want a comfortable and flattering pair of jeans that wo n't break the bank -LRB- like NYDJ or Seven jeans -RRB- , then I highly recommend these jeans . I 'm a 40-year old mom of a toddler and I love how these jeans fit and look on me . I do n't understand why the new jeans cost over $ 200 a pair ! Come on , they 're JEANS made of DENIM ! Of course it 's a status thing . I could care less . These are comfortable , fit great , look good and are priced just right under $ 50 - these will last a long time . Buy these jeans ! You wo n't be disappointed .
 I ordered these in size 4 because I had previously purchased Calvin Kline black skinny jeans and liked the fit . These jeans live up to my expectations . Not only is the fabric very soft but it has enough stretch in it to keep them feeling comfortable all day . As others have said these are not skinny jeans , just narrow straight legs . They are actually a bit roomy in the thigh for me , but I have skinny legs . Everything about these jeans works
 my son loves this product and I am disappointed that I was unable to get the pants to go with the shirts but according to the seller lthey were unable to get them .
 This costume was so cute . I saw another review that suggested getting a size smaller than what you think you need . So true . Our baby girl was wearing a 9 month regular size but we got the newborn size . It was still huge . The `` hair '' for sure is very big and if you buy this plan on taking it in a little and maybe a chin strap . Other than that really great . So funny to see a little baby without hair suddenly with hair .
 I bought this costume for my daughter , and it is SO cute on her . It 's well made and comfortable for a small child to wear . She wore it when she was almost 1 , and I ordered the infant size . I believe this was the correct size to order because the dimensions of the dress/robe were right for her , but there were some size issues that I had to fix . First , the belt is crazy tight for a baby . It attaches at the back with velcro , but I had to cut off the ends and sew the belt at the sides of the robe , creating a faux belt . It did n't affect the fit because the waist is elasticized anyway , so no big deal . Second , the headpiece was insanely big for a baby . My daughter does n't have a small head ... her head circumference is 90th percentile , but this was way too large . I had to go all the way around the bottom , folding it under and sewing to make it fit well enough . All this being said , the extra work was worth it because she looked great in the costume and we got lots of compliments . She was instantly recognizable as Princess Leia .
 I was very impressed overall with this costume . I purchased this for my 9 month old daughter for Halloween . Previous reviews stated that the costume was larger than the stated size and I did not find this to be true . I bought the infant size -LRB- 6-12 mo -RRB- and found that it fit my 20lb baby perfectly . The material is a soft fleece , perfect for layering on a cold night of trick-or-treating . The headpiece fit my daughter well and I did not have to pin it as others did . It fit like a soft hat and must have been comfortable because my daughter did n't pull it off once that night . I was very happy with this purchase and received many compliments .
 Adorable ! Worth the money for the reaction she got ! I would buy the toddler one for the year after next .
 Nice fit . Excellent material . Wore these to a recent gay pride pool party . Everyone loved them . From what -LSB- eople said , i think several will order their own colors . I own 4 pair in different colors and love them all . The colors are beautiful . Get a pair and enjoy them .
 I tryed ordering the swim suit listed on their web sight in the photo ad . Unfortunately I tried many times with specific instructions to make sure the color was that used in the ad photo , but never got that color . I do have many of the other colors of that swim brief and like them very much . I really wanted that color used in the ad photo , so I 'm very disappointed in that respect . The reason from the company Bonnie & Clyde was that the color dyes were too hard to match the one in the photo . Order was not the last order , but a previous order for the color Hawaiian Blue .
 Nice fitting suite and comfortable.Good looking and well made.Would recomend these to anyone interestedin bikini style swim wear .
 These pants are great for comfort . True value for the price . So said , there is no individual waist band . Also when you sit normally on a chair , the white fabric inside your side pockets is clearly visible . They could have used the same fabric as the color of the trousers . So , all in all I gave a 4 star .
 I bought two pair to test as work pants . I also bought two pair of another brand . It has been months now , and the pants seem to wear well , and they do not wrinkle . From the washing machine to the dryer , to me in the morning . They always look sharp , and they fit well . That 's all I asked for , and they delivered .
 Useful pants for almost every ocasion . Color does not fade easily . Nice fit .
 I do n't need to tell men over six feet tall or with waists greater than 38 '' that you can burn a ton of gas trying to find clothes that fit . Dockers is a known quantity . So once you find your size , it 's down hill from there . A good price rounds-out the experience .
 The pants are well made , and good quality . I was disappointed in the Individual Fit Waistband ... it hardly gives at all .
 These are great pants and at a great price . I usually have to drive a long way to find a store that has my size .
 There was a far greater ability to get the Dockers I wanted through this vendor than by going to ANY department store . And the prices were significantly better online . The delivery time was a bit slow -- but the time was known at the time I made the purchase -- no false promises of fast delivery . I 'm delighted with this transaction .
 I have owned many pairs of Dockers Flat Front Original Khaki pants and have always loved them . They are the perfect casual work pant and are comfortable to wear . They do n't usually wrinkle much and they hold up well . I would consider these a good investment . The waist seems to run slightly smaller than many other pants so you may want to get one size larger than you normally would .
 I wo n't give them 5 stars because they 're not really as wrinkle-free as they advertised or as my similar Van Heusen khakis . Either way , they are still light and tr&eacute;s comfortable .
 These pants are wonderful , I have boxy hips and the flat front style takes away from that particular silhouette a and I like that

 The slacks arrived very quickly . They are a brand new , high-quality product in great shape .
 This tie should be priced much higher - it has all the makings and quality of high priced designer ties - City of London makes some of the trendiest ties i 've come across . Nothing but compliments on all of their ties . A must !
 I usually wear Hue 's Jeans socks but wanted to try something new . These are nice but only come up to barely the top of my ankle bone .
 These socks are really well-made and super comfortable . I bought some for me and then gave some to my mom , who gets marks on her legs from the top of most sock cuffs . These , she said , were perfectly comfortable and still did n't fall down . I want more !
 I love these socks . The first ones I got I received as a gift and they came from a local department store . when I went to buy more , they did n't carry them . What a disappointment . But then I found them on Amazon . Woo hoo ! If you do n't like socks biting into your ankles or falling down and getting sucked into your shoes . these are the socks for you . I ca n't praise them enough . And they wear like iron .
 Since I live in the desert , I do n't like wearing bulky socks . These socks are thin but sturdy , and they 're very comfortable .
 outstanding product but peculiar pricing on some of the colors . would have been a 5 but for that .
 I never wear socks . I bought these because I needed a pair of white socks for something . They are so soft and comfortable I will be buying more in different colors .
 The socks are really soft ~ And the red color looks so cute . It suit perfectly with my red pants and shoes !
 Product arrived on time and is perfect for summer recreational activities . It is lightweight , comfortable , compressible , and fast-drying .
 These socks are really soft and very comfortable . I love them and highly recommend them .
 I ordered these tanks in 6 colors . I am 5 ' 8 '' , usually a 12/14 and was seeking a longer tank to layer under shorter tops I already owned . They are exactly as pictured , although I would describe the ` stone ' as more of a traditional ` nude ' and the ` neon pink ' as a bright pink coral -LRB- but not neon -RRB- . They are long enough to comfortably layer and light as a feather . The fabric clings and gathers in all the right places with plenty of stretch . The shipping was quick , I could not be happier with this purchase and wo n't hesitate to order more . I highly recommend this tank to big and tall women that have trouble finding tops that are long enough .
 These camis are amazing ! They are stretchy , long enough for peeking out the bottom when layering , have no side-seams so they are really comfortable , and they wash well with no fading at all . The have no built-in bra , which I love , because those never lay right , they either leave ugly seams , pull at the neckline causing puckering , etc. . These have enough stretch to provide some support anyway . The black is truly a rich , dark black , the red is vibrant , the white one is really bright white . I love them , I want one in every color .
 Wearing this under your shirt , turns any shirt into a nursing shirt . It 's very stretchy , so if you wear a low-cut shirt , you can just pull it down and nurse . Or you can pull your shirt up over your chest , pull the tank top down , and your belly stays covered . Nice and long , stays tucked in , and seems to kind of hold your skin in . I searched forever for the right undershirt for nursing , and this one meets my every desire .
 i ordered this cami to use under a dress , and it worked okay . this is truly a one-size fits all ; it came out of the box looking like something that MIGHT fit my size 4 cousin , but when i put it on -LRB- i 'm size 14 -RRB- it fit beautifully ! it has a smooth , silky feel , making it fun to wear . you can stretch it incredibly far , and it always springs back.pros : - one-size fits all-VERY versital-warm enough for layering , cool enough to wear in the summer-virtually ANY color avalible-i just wash mine with all my other laundry , has n't affected the quality -LRB- you do n't need to hand wash it -RRB- cons : - it has a tendency to `` roll up '' at the bottom ... gets a little annoying to keep pulling it down...-the straps are pretty long , and not adjustable . i tied mine up to keep it from being too lowoverall , this is a very good bargain for the price ; i wear mine layered with virtually every shirt in my closet , everywhere i go . i got a brown one first , then added a black and a white . the white is slightly see-thru when stretched to far.the black is true black , one of the only camis i could find that are true black and do n't become see-thru when stretched.the brown is chocolate brown , and is a very warm , soft color . i love it!these are great !!
 I am 5 ' 4 '' and a size 6 . I bought these for layering , and they are great . The length is perfect , enough to peek out from the bottom if you want or long enough to stay tucked in for rear coverage with those low-waisted pants . The colors are rich and colorfast in the wash . The straps stay up , and chest and side-boob coverage is excellent , making these my first choice for layering under casual dresses and cardigans . They also make great sleepwear.I do experience some rolling up with these around the belly , but maybe that 's just because of my post-baby pooch . They also are lint magnets in the wash , so I have to use the lint roller regularly . I deducted one star for these reasons .
 I bought two of these , teal and purple . Now , I 'm a taller bigger and busty gal -LRB- 5 ' 10 '' , size 14 and 36E -RRB- and when I opened up the package I thought ` One size fits all ? HA ! ' But low and behold , they fit great ! Fit over my child bearing hips and it does n't ride up , hits just under my hips and I have a long torso . It layers nicely under a tight fitting shirt . I 'm pretty particular about fabric that 's not natural and I think these feel pretty good , very soft . Depending on how they wash up , I 'll definitely buy more ! Great colors !
 I always wear a tank top underneath my shirts . These are long so they are great for layering . The fabric is soft and feels great . I 'm already thinking about ordering more !
 I ordered these tanks in 6 colors . I am 5 ' 8 '' , usually a 12/14 and was seeking a longer tank to layer under shorter tops I already owned . They are exactly as pictured , although I would describe the ` stone ' as more of a traditional ` nude ' and the ` neon pink ' as a bright pink coral -LRB- but not neon -RRB- . They are long enough to comfortably layer and light as a feather . The fabric clings and gathers in all the right places with plenty of stretch . The shipping was quick , I could not be happier with this purchase and wo n't hesitate to order more . I highly recommend this tank to big and tall women that have trouble finding tops that are long enough .
 I have a very long torso and wear a size 2 . So it is really hard to find undershirts that fit and are long enough to cover the few inches that usually stick out between my shirt and pants . These tanks fit perfectly even on a small frame , although they do show every bump and roll . They also stay in place better than other tanks I have tried , so you do not have to keep pulling them down every time you move . The fabric is soft , there is no annoying built in bra , and the variety of colors is great .
 I was a little skeptical about `` one size '' since I am a size zero , but not small chested . These tanks are great ! They are long enough to wear under even the lowest cut bottoms , and you can pull them halfway to your knees if you stretch . There is a surprising amount of support , I can even go without a bra -LRB- on a casual day , or under a layer -RRB- I only have dark colors , so I do n't know if a light color would be transparent . The fabric is stretchy , sturdy , and washes well without losing it 's spring . But it is clingy enough that nipples can show through.UPDATE : I 'm nor a fan of handwashing or hangdrying because , well , I 'm lazy . But I imagine these would last longer and get fewer fuzzies if I had . At this price , I might consider continuing my lazy ways and buying more next summer .
 These shirts are awesome . They fit nicely over any curves and are very long . I love them ! I 'd buy one in every color if they were n't so expensive !
 This is definetly my favorite cami . Its so smooth and seamless . It basically goes great with every outfit ! I am definetly getting one in EVERY color !
 I was skeptical about ordering these at first because I bought five at a time , but I really am very happy with my purchases . The shipping was SO FAST , I literally got them about two days later . they really are one size fits all and my favorite kind of stretchy ! will be ordering more in the future !
 Ordered several of these for my sister . . KEPT them ... Now have to order more . They are comfortable and actually warm for layering . Long enough for layered look.Can pull it up so boobies not hang out . . Or pull down lower for clevage veiw . Eather way they are the best.Also I can wear them under my scrubs at work .
 these are the best cami 's ever . i got a white , brown , tan and black ; they are long enough . very comfortable also
 Tall women will love this one ... long enough to tuck in pants and stay . Fabric is form fitting and it washes without fading . At this price , you can order them in all different colors !
 I got these in several different colors for layering . I was hesitant with the One Size issue but based on other reviews I figured I 'd be ok and I was right ! These are super stretchy and long ! The colors are all bright and bold . I love them !
 these are the best undershirts ever!i love them , i love them i have a few colors and will keep getting them untill i have 2 of each color.perfect fits and are long great for layering or sleeping in . great buy and company thanks
 i wear these cami 's all the time . sooo comfortable and great quality . i bought a white , tan , brown and black one . love them all
 Not only does it look good but its very comfortable . It 's long enough for layering and has a snug fit without feeling and looking too tight . I bought brown and white and both are great .
 I really like this Full Tilt Seamless Cami . It is so comfortable . And it washes so nicely . I plan on getting more .
 I love all the shirts i bought BUT the white one seriously the string broke i was so not ok with this but what the hell im not a picky costumer i will sew it cause other then that the shirts are PERFECT fit like a charm and look HOTT :-RRB- but come on TILT sew the strings better please im sure other costumers would complain a lot !!!!!!!
 The seemless part is really nice because I do n't have to worry about seems in the side which means there is no tag that bothers my side . I also like that it is stretchable and long .
 Honestly , I am really picky when it comes to my camis - I wear them under everything and need them to fit comfortably and stylishly , without interfering with my outfit of choice . These are perfect . Being the snob that I am , I assumed these would be cheap but quick -LRB- I was in a time crunch when I ordered them -RRB- , but I will absolutely be ordering more of these , and telling my friends about them . They are incredibly soft , very stretchy , and even though the straps are not adjustable -LRB- which I originally thought would mean I would have to get really creative or toss them -RRB- , they are the perfect length , a feat no cami has accomplished before for me . I would not personally wear these as a tank by themselves -LRB- expect for sleeping in or hanging around the house -RRB- since they do cling to every little bump ! But for layering camis , which is what I was hoping for , these are my surprise favorites .
 You can have one in every color with these prices . Got me and my daughters a half-dozen -LRB- each -RRB- 2 years ago for Christmas . Am ordering more now .
 I bought three at first -LRB- light pink , white and black -RRB- and as soon as I received them I literally bought eight more . I am 5 ' 7 '' , under 120 pounds and these are hands down the best cami 's I have ever bought . The material is soft , silky and stretchy . They actually can stretch below my rear -LRB- which is great for leggings or yoga pants -RRB- . They layer well -LRB- they DO get static-y sometimes but nothing a dryer sheet can not solve -RRB- . They hold up well in the wash and the straps are sturdy . They also come in an an amazing array of colors and you can dress them up or down . A staple for any wardrobe for sure . Will definitely buy more of these when I can .
 These are great - I 'm usually between a small and a medium and these fit perfectly . They 're not too `` sticky '' but not super slick - as in , sweaters wo n't stick up on it like some camisoles . It 's really long , but not too long . I 've washed it about 5 times and so far , so good , which is more than I can say about the $ 30 ones I bought -LRB- and returned -RRB- at Nordstrom 's last month . Shipping was very quick .
 My package came surprisingly fast which I like . I bought a black , white , and rock colored Cami . I was looking for undershirts that have no hooks or stuff on the straps or inserted bra I find those things uncomfortable and annoying and I searched everywhere for just plain old fashioned undershirts and nothing I wanted turned up . I then found these and they looked promising . I have to say I love them they are so soft and comfortable , no uncomfortable or annoying things in or on them . I 'm happy with the colors as well . I will definitely buy more .
 Love these tanks . Have them in 5 colors . the one size fits all should not worry you . they stretch . Only reason I do not give it a 5 is that it is a little long
 I 've purchased NikiBiki shirts before , but hated paying the $ 25 + price for them . These are the same style , quality , and fitting as the more expense brand -LRB- in a rainbow of colors , too ! -RRB- ... for less money ! These are awesome . Do n't hesitate .
 I ordered three of these tops , a bit nervous about the sizing . I 'm usually not a fan of `` all size fits all '' due to my bust size -LRB- G cup -RRB- . I tried them on and they fit well . Even for larger , full-busted women , these shirts stay up with no tugging needed . They are perfect for under those low-cut blouses . I 'll be getting more .
 These are the perfect layering camis ! I love them , I have already bought 3 of them and am back for more colors ! They are so comfortable , I was nervous about a `` one-size-fits-all '' shirt , I have a large chest , and typically wear a large or x-large , but i still fit really really well ! I love them .
 I ordered 2 of these and would order more ! I have sent this link to my friends/dancers/dance teachers for them to order . Great material - rich color quality - ca n't beat the price - arrived quickly . Do n't be afraid of the `` one size '' - material and design are stretchy , but form fitting .
 I love these little camis , especially for the money . That being said , they are not made for wearing alone unless you do n't have an ounce of fat around your middle . They leave nothing to the imagination , and that 's not what I was looking for . That 's okay though . I love them and I will wear them all the time for layering .
 I ordered the iris -LRB- purple -RRB- cami and it is exactly the color on the screen . I am 5 ' 4 and am smaller sized . These cami 's fit so well everywhere ! i bought it to add another color to my layering options for summer time ! Its size is stretchable and lays wherever i pull it or tuck it . AND THE BEST PART ... . Theyre sooooo incredibly soft !! One thing that would be a con is that its made of `` that material that shows every nook and cranny '' if wearing it alone BUT perfection for under layering ! Highly recommend buying these ! Shipped in 2 days ! Hope this helps ... ENJOY !!
 These camis are one of my favorite finds on Amazon . I was hesitant of the one size fits all , but I am 5 ' 4 '' and weigh about 115 pounds and these fit perfectly . Initially , I ordered them in two colors . Four of five months later , they still look great . The colors I have are pretty and bold , so it is easy to add something extra to the outfit by layering . They have held up to wear and washing without fading , stretching , or knotting . A pet peeve of mine is material that collects lint and these camis pass the test with flying colors .
 I 'm a plus size -LRB- 20W -RRB- girl and I have been looking for a simple , basic tank to wear under blouses that are either too sheer or a little too low cut . Most of the ones I have found are either ridiculously expensive or they have a shelf-bra which I hate . When I found this cami I thought it was just what I was looking for until I saw the `` one size fits all '' . Yeah , right ! But I read a review from another plus-size woman who said it fit , and I figured for $ 10 it was worth a try . Boy am I happy I ordered it!It is made from a stretchy nylon material ; at first I did n't like this , as I prefer cotton , but the material is really stretchy , so it fits like a glove . The material is substantial , but not too thick , which is important if you are wearing it under something else . I would n't wear this by itself , mainly because the straps are super skinny , and thus leave any bra straps in plain sight which is not a look I like . I gave the cami 4 out 5 stars because the bottom does have a tendency to roll up , which can be annoying , but I have found that tucking the bottom into my pants solves that problem . The good news is that the length of this cami is generous ; it easily covers 1/2 of my hip area , so there is plenty to tuck in.I will be buying this in a bunch of colors - great layering piece !
 These are so comfortable . The perfect solution to staying warm in the office without the bulk of a sweater . Great for those chili days when you do n't want to wear a jacket , but need a little something
 These are by far the best camis I have ever purchased !! I love all the colors and want one of each . They dont have adjustable straps but they hit at just the right spot and you can still do a little adjusting yourself . The only negative thing I have to say it that I just ordered these last week and came back to get more and they have raised the price $ 2 ... thats sucks but just may order more anyway because I like them so much .
 I bought this in the neon pink color . WOW it is blindingly bright and pink . Which , I like . The fit is awesome , I was a little skeptical about the one size but it works . It has a lot of stretch , and is super comfortable . I love to know that if I fluctuate in weight , I 'll have at least one shirt that will stay with me . It 's long enough to just peek out from the edge of the FULL TILT V-neck tee I ordered along with it . I plan on ordering more of both . Very happy .
 Things i like :1 . I love how LONG this cami is ! Right now I can pull it down over part of my bottom .2 . The neckline is perfect for me . I 'm in my 4th month and coverage is good . I do n't know how it will be later on in the pregnancy , but it works for now .3 . It seems to have enough stretch for me to grow into . If this changes , I will update my review.Things I do n't like : I ca n't think of anything !
 This is a top I wear all the time , under sweaters , open jackets . Good looking enough to layer . Great stretch , neutral color . The bad news ? It pilled quickly . I washed it delicate cold and air dried . I will still wear it , but was surprised to see the material age so fast .
 As others have said , do n't be discouraged by the &#34; one size &#34; option . I 'll be honest
 I love the fit of this cami . It has a higher neck line and does n't show any cleavage . It 's a long cami and I can tuck in into my jeans without it coming out . I 'm 5 ' 6 &#34; with a long torso , so this is probably going to be too long for a shorter person . I also like that it does not have a built in shelf bra as I like to wear my own and those always seem to interfere . It does not have adjustable straps . The fabric feels like really thick tights .
 I love love love this tank top , they are so soft and long enough where it does n't ride up at all . The price is great and it 's always shipped on time . Try out a few colors .
 fast shipping true to size and color I will buy more in other colors very comfortable Im so glad I choose this product
 I like the fit of this cami . However , the straps on it because loose the first day that I wore it . I hate when that happens with my camis because even with an adjustor on the straps , the straps will always feel loose .
 these are great camis ! i bought 2 , and then came back and bought 4 more in a variety of colors to wear under pregnancy shirts which are notoriously low cut.i am 5 ' 6 '' and -LRB- was -RRB- 142lbs prior to pregnancy - these camis are one size fits all.they are long . normally , i prefer a shorter cami , and i will see if i will continue wearing them afterwards , but for the time being these are perfect.currently at 28 weeks and with a sizable belly , these fit very very comfortably with lots more length to go - they should easily last the entire pregnancy . they are of a good quality , and CHEAP - especially when compared to maternity camis . the colors are vibrant . they form-fit very well , and stretch great . they do not feel tight or loose in any way , just comfortable . i am very happy with my purchase.update
 I ordered these tanks in 6 colors . I am 5 ' 8 '' , usually a 12/14 and was seeking a longer tank to layer under shorter tops I already owned . They are exactly as pictured , although I would describe the ` stone ' as more of a traditional ` nude ' and the ` neon pink ' as a bright pink coral -LRB- but not neon -RRB- . They are long enough to comfortably layer and light as a feather . The fabric clings and gathers in all the right places with plenty of stretch . The shipping was quick , I could not be happier with this purchase and wo n't hesitate to order more . I highly recommend this tank to big and tall women that have trouble finding tops that are long enough .
 This cami is the only one I 've ever owned to deserve the description `` buttery soft . '' There 's no better word for the smooth , gorgeous texture of this top . The fit is sublime , it hugs without being see-through or trashy-looking ; a perfect piece under your work cardigans!As another reviewer mentioned , the length is perfect for tall women . It goes all the way to the mid-hip area easily , but does n't look like it 's supposed to be a dress.I personally prefer slightly wider straps , but only because they offer more bra-strap coverage . The straps on this top are wide-set enough to hit the same spot as bra straps , but keep in mind that they are thin enough that they will not lie even with or conceal them.The color on my cami -LRB- brown -RRB- was velvety , dark and rich . Definitely a coffee or chocolate color.I am completely satisfied with this cami and will probably buy a second and third!IMPORTANT NOTE -LRB- EDIT -RRB- Dear fellow Full Tilt Cami lovers!If at all possible , wear clear deodorant with your cami . The other day I wore regular stick deodorant -LRB- the white kind -RRB- and because of the soft nature of the cami a huge swath of white particles stuck to the side of my shirt . I had to change .
 I layer my shirts and tanks all the time and this is a must have ! It truly is one size fits all ! I am a bigger woman and it fits awesomely !
 Super comfortable ! I am average height and wear a size 6 normally . This cami was the perfect length and cut to wear as an undershirt . I usually find that other camisoles I have bought ride up or are too low cut , but I did not have those issues with this one .
 I purchased another cami on line and it ran too small . These run true to size and have a nice silky fell . They do not have a shelf but I did n't want a shelf as those seem to feel binding . Great colors , rich and great under clothes as well as alone
 I received my camisole and was stunned by how it fit especially for the price . Love it ! It keeps me warm and is plenty long enough . Now just need to get some in more colors .
 I have a few of these and love them . I 'm 5 ' 11 '' and they 're long enough even for my frame -LRB- it 's hard to find tanks that do n't ride up my long torso and leave my stomach bare ; these stay put -RRB- . The colors are vibrant and remain colorfast ; I 've had them for over a year , wear them constantly , and they 're all still bright even using warm water wash/heavy detergent -LRB- I do n't baby anything - if it ca n't handle rough washing , it does n't belong in my closet ! -RRB- . The fabric is n't flimsy and does n't sag out over time . The stretch is flattering , and the fabric is thick enough to not feel cheap . I think they 're a bargain .
 This is a nice casual cami to have around for lounging or sleeping . It 's comfortable and stretchy . Keep in mind that the neon pink really is NEON , more so than pictured ! Think bright - like the neon green one shown .
 I absolutely love this camisole . I ordered it on Monday and it was at my door by Friday . I have the dark blue one and let me tell you
 I love Seamless Camis ' . This cami is a real nice one . The price is good . The fabric is soft and comfortable . It is exactly as the picture shows it ...
 Love the cami - it is long - but not too long and a thick jersey cotton . Washes well and for the price I will be stocking up for the spring and summer . Great layering piece .
 the pink is really pink but its super cute and stylish ! Great product and fast shipping ! Stock up on all the colors these cami 's are great and do not have built in bras which is awesome and super comfortable . awesome shirt !
 I was a little leary of the `` one size fits all '' label but I thought I 'd give it a try . This truly is one size fits all . I bought 10 of them in different colors . I lost 25lbs and they still fit me perfectly . I also was n't sure about buying something that was labeled `` hand wash . '' What I have found is I can wash lighter colors in the washing machine with no problems but the darker colors need to be hand washed because they bleed . My only complaint is that these camis roll up a little bit if they are not tucked in .
 These camis are very soft and comfortable . They are great for layering and nursing discreetly . They are stretchy if need be , but soon return to their original shape . They are also longer than the average cami which just looks better . They do seem to roll up a tad bit at the bottom occasionally . Great product overall !

 Nice fit . Excellent material . Wore these to a recent gay pride pool party . Everyone loved them . From what -LSB- eople said , i think several will order their own colors . I own 4 pair in different colors and love them all . The colors are beautiful . Get a pair and enjoy them .
 I tryed ordering the swim suit listed on their web sight in the photo ad . Unfortunately I tried many times with specific instructions to make sure the color was that used in the ad photo , but never got that color . I do have many of the other colors of that swim brief and like them very much . I really wanted that color used in the ad photo , so I 'm very disappointed in that respect . The reason from the company Bonnie & Clyde was that the color dyes were too hard to match the one in the photo . Order was not the last order , but a previous order for the color Hawaiian Blue .
 Nice fitting suite and comfortable.Good looking and well made.Would recomend these to anyone interestedin bikini style swim wear .
 Rubies has an excellent selection and our daughter made a great Princess Leia is this costume . Halloween is so much fun around here , and this costume and accessories just made it even better .
 Costume is exactly as described . Wig runs a little small , but my daughter does n't wear it anyway .
 I bought this for the cold/snow environment . I ordered for my size , but had to return it because it was to small . Think about ordering a size or two bigger . Very comfortable . Keeps me toasty warm .
 Think I reviewed before , but if you can figure out correct size they are worth it . Husband 200lb , 6 ' 1 '' , wears a 36 and ended up getting a 40L in these coveralls after 2 attempts .
 Bought this for a friend , and it was too big for him . We decided to give it as a gift to another friend who has trouble finding coveralls he can carry when he trucks cross country . They fit him perfectly , and he was ecstatic to get them .
 I bought the XL for my husband -LRB- a size up from what he normally wears -RRB- and it was incredibly small . He was bummed ... other than that , it was perfect .
 Everything was very good about this product except the zippers ; they were very , very stiff and difficult to open and close , especially the colder it got outside ... Would stick in several places !
 This is a great suit nice an warm its a lil tricky to find the rite size to fit cuz of how they r made but this mite b the best coverall on the market for u if u work out in the freezing cold allday
 I have owned many pairs of Dockers Flat Front Original Khaki pants and have always loved them . They are the perfect casual work pant and are comfortable to wear . They do n't usually wrinkle much and they hold up well . I would consider these a good investment . The waist seems to run slightly smaller than many other pants so you may want to get one size larger than you normally would .
 I wo n't give them 5 stars because they 're not really as wrinkle-free as they advertised or as my similar Van Heusen khakis . Either way , they are still light and tr&eacute;s comfortable .
 These pants are wonderful , I have boxy hips and the flat front style takes away from that particular silhouette a and I like that
 Great quality , no time waisted and plenty of choices regarding sizes and color . I will never buy them at the store .
 fit great , feel great , durable , and it works well in both my professional and casual wardrobe
 I 've always been a Dockers fan.I love the fit of the flat front . The fabric does n't just crease any how . I love it .
 an excellent pant , comfortable , smooth , good packaging , the measure of pant in line with what the seller say .
 Just right ! It does n't matter how many times it 's been crumpled or washed , it does n't need to be ironed and the crease stays put . The waistline is n't too high , and it 's not too baggy or too tight . Formal enough for work , casual enough for anything else ; I 've even hiked in them -LRB- and the mud stains came right off in one cycle in the wash -RRB- . These are , hands-down , my favorite pants .
 These are the one and only , classic fit original khaki pants from Dockers . The Dockers label is the Kleenex of khaki pants . . the Rolls Royce ... the Xerox . The name is synonymous with the semi-casual look . These pants go great with a leather belt w / cell phone clipped , polo shirt , a clean shave and a crew cut .
 The item is well liked by my husband is one of his favorites since it fit adequately and comfortable .
 It 's nice to find a pair of pants that do n't need any work to fit me right out of the package ! Bought another pair in gray as soon as I used this ones for the first time .
 My teenaged son needs 30x34 pants - which are the dickens to find , even in the big department stores . This fits , and is comparable in price to what I find in the big stores on sale .
 The slacks arrived very quickly . They are a brand new , high-quality product in great shape .
 These pants are great for comfort . True value for the price . So said , there is no individual waist band . Also when you sit normally on a chair , the white fabric inside your side pockets is clearly visible . They could have used the same fabric as the color of the trousers . So , all in all I gave a 4 star .
 I bought two pair to test as work pants . I also bought two pair of another brand . It has been months now , and the pants seem to wear well , and they do not wrinkle . From the washing machine to the dryer , to me in the morning . They always look sharp , and they fit well . That 's all I asked for , and they delivered .
 Useful pants for almost every ocasion . Color does not fade easily . Nice fit .
 I do n't need to tell men over six feet tall or with waists greater than 38 '' that you can burn a ton of gas trying to find clothes that fit . Dockers is a known quantity . So once you find your size , it 's down hill from there . A good price rounds-out the experience .
 The pants are well made , and good quality . I was disappointed in the Individual Fit Waistband ... it hardly gives at all .
 These are great pants and at a great price . I usually have to drive a long way to find a store that has my size .
 There was a far greater ability to get the Dockers I wanted through this vendor than by going to ANY department store . And the prices were significantly better online . The delivery time was a bit slow -- but the time was known at the time I made the purchase -- no false promises of fast delivery . I 'm delighted with this transaction .

 A very fine pair of trousers.The workmanship is superb as is the drape when worn with suspenders . The brace buttons are ideal for me as I wear suspenders with all my trousers.These days it is rather difficult to find trousers that have suspender buttons but J.Bank trousers give you this option.Very rare in the retail community .

 Ok , so I got this in plenty of time for halloween this year . I 'm a soldier in Iraq , and when the people in my company got a sight of me in skin tight spandex . . well . . hilarity ensued . . I would definately recommend a jock strap and cup , because I had to place my junk in a sock so that there would be no genital definition . . wife made me :-RRB- I 'm about 6 ' 2 , and the costume was way too short for me . . but it 'd be good for the average guy of 5 ' 9 , or 5 ' 10 . . but for the laughs I got , it was totally worth the $ 30 . . seeing as I won $ 50 in our costume contest . . there was a little danving involved , had to shake my stuff . . and until you see a tall , skinny white guy shakin his groove thing in a skin tight spiderman costume . . well . . you just have n't lived . .
 I ordered this for my boyfriend for Halloween . It runs a bit small but he was like a giddy little kid when he put it on and got compliments all night .

 absolutely the best -LRB- excetp for the thick waistband but that 's a small shortcomeing . -RRB-
 These Boxers are comfortable while also being snug at the same time . The front flap is also buttoned which is a nice touch . The boxers are also pretty substantial . In fact , if it was n't for the lack of a zipper in front you could almost pass these boxers off as shorts .
 These are Tommy Hilfiger 's best boxers yet . They are comfortable and the material is n't too heavy like other Tommy boxers I have bought . They breath and fit great .
 I bought this shirt for my mama for Mother 's Day . She 's an avid poker player in the DC area , even at the young age of 56 ! She must play 3-4 nights a week ! She loves the shirt and even wears it to poker tournaments where players bet her for it . Service from Benny 's Aloha Shirts in California was great . I would have no problem buying from then again .
 I bought this on Casual Male 's website and I love it . the only downside is . the hood is a little to big . however , great jacket .
 I was very pleased with the item I purchased and the service rendered .

 There was a mix-up with the shipping on the shirt , but the seller straightened everything out . The woman I spoke to on the phone was very helpful and reassuring . Their service is excellent and I will continue to buy from them .

Unfortunately I tried many times with specific instructions to make sure the color was that used in the ad photo , but never got that color . I do have many of the other colors of that swim brief and like them very much . I really wanted that color used in the ad photo , so I 'm very disappointed in that respect . The reason from the company Bonnie & Clyde was that the color dyes were too hard to match the one in the photo . Order was not the last order , but a previous order for the color Hawaiian Blue .
 Nice fitting suite and comfortable.Good looking and well made.Would recomend these to anyone interestedin bikini style swim wear .

 It is a great shirt and if I could get him to take it off for a minute I could say more , but my guy lives in it !

 I bought this on Casual Male 's website and I love it . the only downside is . the hood is a little to big . however , great jacket .
 I was very pleased with the item I purchased and the service rendered .
 Very nice robe ! Worth the money . Thick , high quality cotton . Delivery prompt ; packaging was good ; product was described & displayed .
 Nice , long , warm , heavy , comfy robe . The sleeves are long enough to help keep warm , but short enough not to drag in things like other long-sleeved robes.On the down-side , thousands of loose threads after a year or so of use and washings that did n't affect similar bath towels loaded in the same loads as this.Still serviceable , though .
 Little big for smaller kid , but for the price its great . Good for bitrhdays and gift in partys . I bought this for my daughter firt b-day .
 This was a cute flashing headband . I put it with a dress up gift to my neaces at Christmas . I made a great edition and they loved the flashing light on the head band .

 This got to me - very quickly ! I appreciated it ! My 9 y/0 daughter looked adorable in this costume , this last Halloween of 2012 . I had no problems whatsoever with it ! Thanks again ! Have a great new year ! ~ Jen

 I am very pleased wiht the backpack and will definitely use this supplier for such items in the future.I know our Granddaughter will be tickled to get it for her birthday .
 I 've always been a Dockers fan.I love the fit of the flat front . The fabric does n't just crease any how . I love it .
 an excellent pant , comfortable , smooth , good packaging , the measure of pant in line with what the seller say .
 Just right ! It does n't matter how many times it 's been crumpled or washed , it does n't need to be ironed and the crease stays put . The waistline is n't too high , and it 's not too baggy or too tight . Formal enough for work , casual enough for anything else ; I 've even hiked in them -LRB- and the mud stains came right off in one cycle in the wash -RRB- . These are , hands-down , my favorite pants .
 These are the one and only , classic fit original khaki pants from Dockers . The Dockers label is the Kleenex of khaki pants . . the Rolls Royce ... the Xerox . The name is synonymous with the semi-casual look . These pants go great with a leather belt w / cell phone clipped , polo shirt , a clean shave and a crew cut .
 The item is well liked by my husband is one of his favorites since it fit adequately and comfortable .
 It 's nice to find a pair of pants that do n't need any work to fit me right out of the package ! Bought another pair in gray as soon as I used this ones for the first time .
 My teenaged son needs 30x34 pants - which are the dickens to find , even in the big department stores . This fits , and is comparable in price to what I find in the big stores on sale .
 The slacks arrived very quickly . They are a brand new , high-quality product in great shape .
 I have owned many pairs of Dockers Flat Front Original Khaki pants and have always loved them . They are the perfect casual work pant and are comfortable to wear . They do n't usually wrinkle much and they hold up well . I would consider these a good investment . The waist seems to run slightly smaller than many other pants so you may want to get one size larger than you normally would .
 I wo n't give them 5 stars because they 're not really as wrinkle-free as they advertised or as my similar Van Heusen khakis . Either way , they are still light and tr&eacute;s comfortable .
 These pants are wonderful , I have boxy hips and the flat front style takes away from that particular silhouette a and I like that
 Great quality , no time waisted and plenty of choices regarding sizes and color . I will never buy them at the store .
 fit great , feel great , durable , and it works well in both my professional and casual wardrobe
 These pants are great for comfort . True value for the price . So said , there is no individual waist band . Also when you sit normally on a chair , the white fabric inside your side pockets is clearly visible . They could have used the same fabric as the color of the trousers . So , all in all I gave a 4 star .
 I bought two pair to test as work pants . I also bought two pair of another brand . It has been months now , and the pants seem to wear well , and they do not wrinkle . From the washing machine to the dryer , to me in the morning . They always look sharp , and they fit well . That 's all I asked for , and they delivered .
 Useful pants for almost every ocasion . Color does not fade easily . Nice fit .
 I do n't need to tell men over six feet tall or with waists greater than 38 '' that you can burn a ton of gas trying to find clothes that fit . Dockers is a known quantity . So once you find your size , it 's down hill from there . A good price rounds-out the experience .
 The pants are well made , and good quality . I was disappointed in the Individual Fit Waistband ... it hardly gives at all .
 These are great pants and at a great price . I usually have to drive a long way to find a store that has my size .
 There was a far greater ability to get the Dockers I wanted through this vendor than by going to ANY department store . And the prices were significantly better online . The delivery time was a bit slow -- but the time was known at the time I made the purchase -- no false promises of fast delivery . I 'm delighted with this transaction .
 i bought these in size small , navy , 100 % cotton . the color is darker than the photo shows . after washing and drying on low heat , the shorts did shrink quite a bit but they still fit okay . i definitely would n't wear these shorts in public - the leg openings are pretty baggy and the shorts are pretty daggy , overall . the waistband is comfortable but ugly , and the shorts are n't particularly flattering . having said all that , they are very comfortable for wearing around the house . for $ 10 i do n't expect much more .
 I already had 3 pair and I just ordered 6 more for summer . They are cool , comfortable , affordable and they look nice on anyone . -LRB- Do n't let the product pics fool you - they look really nice on a real person -RRB- My sister also ordered 3 pair to wear to the gym . I wear them around the house , to go walking or run errands . Love 'em .
 These are a nice standard drawstring gym short . The ones I used to by were discontinued and I bought one pair of these to try them out . Loose and comfy . Better designed for someone slim than rounded/curvy .
 I bought these shorts because they are the only ones I can find that do n't have a wide elastic waistband that presses uncomfortable against my stomach . I also like the absorbent and comfortable cotton.I am 5 ' 4 '' and weigh 110 ; so I am not big . But I buy the large because it is the most comfortable . The only workout shorts I will wear .
 These shorts are beyond comfortable and just the right length - not too short and not too long . Great for wearing around the house or for running errands on hot summer days .
 These comfortable , soft shorts are exactly what I wanted ... they wash beautifully and they are Russell quality .
 I bought these and enjoy wearing them . They are very comfortable and easy to wash . I highly recommend them !
 Ordering clothing sight-unseen and without trying on is always a bit iffy . But I ordered this in Navy , large ; and the fit and all is just fine . And the price was low . So I 'm a happy camper .
 These are so very soft and comfie . They may be a bit on the short side for the gym , and with leggings would probably bunch a little between the legs , but for around the house they are IDEAL . They are like your most comfortable tee shirt . I love sleeping in them or just wearing them around the house .
 I love these shorts . . they wear well and will last a while . . I 've had another pair for 2 years and no sign of wearing out . .
 Excellent shorts without that thick uncomfortable waistband or tight legs that most shorts have today . I highly recommend !
 Comfortable ! 100 % cotton ! Economical ! Easy to order ! I bought two pairs of these shorts at a swanky sports outfitters store 2 or 3 years ago and realy liked them . When I went back to get more that store did n't carry them -LRB- or almost anything else cotton -RRB- anymore . I was realy disappointed . Then I was on-line looking for some workout pants for my father and noticed the name `` Russell '' which gave me the idea to buy them on-line . There was just what I wanted and all kinds of discounts . And I did n't have to do a lot of driving or walking to get them .
 These are so incredibly soft , and they fit just right . Think of how your most comfortable tee shirt feels , and these will likely compare . They are n't too baggie around my thighs , as many of these types of shorts are on me . The elastic in the waist is very comfortable - not too tight , not too loose . They are also true to size.They are quite flattering , and long enough that if you needed to run into a grocery store or something , you are covered well enough . You could wear them with or without bike shorts underneath at the gym . You might want the biker shorts if doing a lot of kicks , but otherwise you could probably get away with just these . They are great for wearing around the house as your comfie every day shorts . A very good all around soft short !
 These shorts are the best buy ever . I like them so much , I have ordered them more than once . They are long lasting , easy to care for and you canot beat the price . I lounge in them every afternoon . They are so comfortable , I sometimes even sleep in them .
 I was very pleased with this purchase . The shorts fit true to size and I love having the drawstring waistband to ensure a good fit . They hit mid-length on the thigh , so good coverage -- not too long , not too short . Essential Apparel had my order to me in under a week and I 'm on the opposite coast , so that was a nice surprise .
 These are just the style of gym shorts I like , and the price is great ! I only purchased the cotton blend colors -LRB- graphite and grey -RRB- , so as not to have the shrinking issues the other reviewer spoke of . I am very pleased !
 Since I 've purchased Russell Athletic apparel before , I know that their togs are very basic -LRB- okay for ` round the house -RRB- . They shrink - buy ` up ' a size or two . So these shorts are about what you can expect ... except they would be more appropriately priced at $ 5.99 or $ 6.99 tops .

Also when you sit normally on a chair , the white fabric inside your side pockets is clearly visible . They could have used the same fabric as the color of the trousers .

 My son wanted to be something `` spooky '' , but not too spooky for Halloween . After seeing this on Amazon , he decided he had to have it.The costume looked great on him ! He 's 6 years old , but wears a 5 & this fit him perfectly.I 'm very glad I bought it .
 Got a lot of comments about this one . Not to be worn around skiddish dogs , toddlers , or the faint of heart ... Seriously .
 this costume was scarier than the picture . . lol . . i bought this for my 10yr old son and my daughter flipped out over the mask the picture is true to what the costume looks like the only thing i did n't like was the gloves that come with it would n't fit my son 's hands they were way to small but we stretched them out long enough for pictures then he took them off but this was worth the $ $
 My son just loved being this scary skeleton . It was easy to put on and easy to put warm clothes underneath .
 This costume looks great but I will say that the mask and hood were an awkward fit for my 6 year old and the gloves were entirely useless . But it definitely did the trick and my son loved it .
 We were happy with the robe and the mask was super cool . The hood was too small for my seven year olds head . We had to Velcro it to the mask so that it would n't fly off his head . All and all it worked out just fine .
 Costume is lightweight and fit my grandson -- a slim 8-yr-old -- quite well . The hood does need to be taped to the plastic mask to keep it from sliding off ; but that 's a small issue , and overall I am very happy with this purchase .
 -LRB- Size
 My daughter is looking forward to wearing this costume for Halloween . The mask is quite scary . She especially loves the gloves . The length is perfect . Happy Halloween to all !
 We loved this costume for halloween . The face mask is a bit scary and the medium fit my slim nine year old great . It was not made of see through cheap cloth and a great price .
 I bought this on Casual Male 's website and I love it . the only downside is . the hood is a little to big . however , great jacket .
 I was very pleased with the item I purchased and the service rendered .
 A very fine pair of trousers.The workmanship is superb as is the drape when worn with suspenders . The brace buttons are ideal for me as I wear suspenders with all my trousers.These days it is rather difficult to find trousers that have suspender buttons but J.Bank trousers give you this option.Very rare in the retail community .
 SMOOTH , nice fit , easy to wear . found the item to be at least as nice as pictured . I love the bright colors.Company was quick and shipping was fast and reasonable . I will definitely use them agaain
 So far , I have worn this skirt to several restaurants , a concert , the theater , a cocktail party and a couple of funerals . It fits extremely well , is very comfortable and easy to dress up or down . An excellent deal for the price , too . I wish it came in more colors !
 Nice fit and feel . Have n't tried washing it yet , but so far so good .
 Not easy to find these in stores , only the ugly ones with the metal clip closure . This was nice looking real leather , and is exactly as shown in the picture ... the red was really nice !!
 This product has lasted me a long time and i still own it even though i do n't smoke anymore . i use it for cards and license now .

 I ordered this sweater for my dad and he says is great ! Well worth the money . Should keep him warm with no problem .
 I was looking for a top that would be comparable to my comfortable fleece pants . It seems this is a hard item to find as a shirt -LRB- as opposed to a fleece jacket that has a 1/4 zipper or full zipper that you would not want to wear as a shirt -RRB- . Eventually my girlfriend did find a prefect fleece shirt at REI . This is a decent sweatshirt though .
 Eh , it 's a cheap sweatshirt . The only reason it did n't get 5 stars was the elastic stretched out pretty quick . Otherwise , you get what you pay for !

 Nice fit . Excellent material . Wore these to a recent gay pride pool party . Everyone loved them . From what -LSB- eople said , i think several will order their own colors . I own 4 pair in different colors and love them all . The colors are beautiful . Get a pair and enjoy them .
 I tryed ordering the swim suit listed on their web sight in the photo ad . Unfortunately I tried many times with specific instructions to make sure the color was that used in the ad photo , but never got that color . I do have many of the other colors of that swim brief and like them very much . I really wanted that color used in the ad photo , so I 'm very disappointed in that respect . The reason from the company Bonnie & Clyde was that the color dyes were too hard to match the one in the photo . Order was not the last order , but a previous order for the color Hawaiian Blue .
 Nice fitting suite and comfortable.Good looking and well made.Would recomend these to anyone interestedin bikini style swim wear .
 Pretty color and design . My son is very confortable and happy wearing it . Perfect time of delivery and service . Thanks

They do n't usually wrinkle much and they hold up well . I would consider these a good investment . The waist seems to run slightly smaller than many other pants so you may want to get one size larger than you normally would .
 I wo n't give them 5 stars because they 're not really as wrinkle-free as they advertised or as my similar Van Heusen khakis . Either way , they are still light and tr&eacute;s comfortable .
 These pants are wonderful , I have boxy hips and the flat front style takes away from that particular silhouette a and I like that
 Great quality , no time waisted and plenty of choices regarding sizes and color . I will never buy them at the store .
 fit great , feel great , durable , and it works well in both my professional and casual wardrobe
 I 've always been a Dockers fan.I love the fit of the flat front . The fabric does n't just crease any how . I love it .
 an excellent pant , comfortable , smooth , good packaging , the measure of pant in line with what the seller say .
 Just right ! It does n't matter how many times it 's been crumpled or washed , it does n't need to be ironed and the crease stays put . The waistline is n't too high , and it 's not too baggy or too tight . Formal enough for work , casual enough for anything else ; I 've even hiked in them -LRB- and the mud stains came right off in one cycle in the wash -RRB- . These are , hands-down , my favorite pants .
 These are the one and only , classic fit original khaki pants from Dockers . The Dockers label is the Kleenex of khaki pants . . the Rolls Royce ... the Xerox . The name is synonymous with the semi-casual look . These pants go great with a leather belt w / cell phone clipped , polo shirt , a clean shave and a crew cut .
 The item is well liked by my husband is one of his favorites since it fit adequately and comfortable .
 It 's nice to find a pair of pants that do n't need any work to fit me right out of the package ! Bought another pair in gray as soon as I used this ones for the first time .
 My teenaged son needs 30x34 pants - which are the dickens to find , even in the big department stores . This fits , and is comparable in price to what I find in the big stores on sale .
 The slacks arrived very quickly . They are a brand new , high-quality product in great shape .
 These pants are great for comfort . True value for the price . So said , there is no individual waist band . Also when you sit normally on a chair , the white fabric inside your side pockets is clearly visible . They could have used the same fabric as the color of the trousers . So , all in all I gave a 4 star .
 I bought two pair to test as work pants . I also bought two pair of another brand . It has been months now , and the pants seem to wear well , and they do not wrinkle . From the washing machine to the dryer , to me in the morning . They always look sharp , and they fit well . That 's all I asked for , and they delivered .
 Useful pants for almost every ocasion . Color does not fade easily . Nice fit .
 I do n't need to tell men over six feet tall or with waists greater than 38 '' that you can burn a ton of gas trying to find clothes that fit . Dockers is a known quantity . So once you find your size , it 's down hill from there . A good price rounds-out the experience .
 The pants are well made , and good quality . I was disappointed in the Individual Fit Waistband ... it hardly gives at all .
 These are great pants and at a great price . I usually have to drive a long way to find a store that has my size .
 There was a far greater ability to get the Dockers I wanted through this vendor than by going to ANY department store . And the prices were significantly better online . The delivery time was a bit slow -- but the time was known at the time I made the purchase -- no false promises of fast delivery . I 'm delighted with this transaction .

 This is a very good diaper bag . I have had it for a few weeks , and love the pockets and the handy wipe dispenser on the front . There are a couple of points that I want to bring up ... 1 . The entire front flap of the bag -LRB- the part that is blue and has the flowers , or whatever design you get -RRB- is velcroed onto the top of the bag . Its a little weird , it seems like they want you to buy multiple bags and you can change the design by switching the front flaps .2 . I paid about $ 80 for this bag , and was a little disappointed by the quality . The fabric on the front looks a little plastic-y when you get it in person . I guess some people like this because its easy to wipe off . Its still a good bag , but if you saw this in the store and it was 80 bucks you would probably say `` yeah right . `` 3 . The loops on the sides of the bag for attaching to a stroller are made out of a flimsy material -LRB- like a ribbon -RRB- . Mine has n't broken or anything , but it does seem concerning , since my bag is usually stuffed and weighs like 20 lbs .4 . The changing pad that comes with this bag is garbage ... it is super thin and small-I got rid of it and used a different one .5 . Not a lot of small pockets for parent stuff -LRB- wallet , phone , etc. -RRB- . But it has a big zippered pocket on the front flap.Overall , I gave the bag a rather high rating because I like the design , it is much cooler than most of the other diaper bags that I see out there , also it is unisex -LRB- my husband and I both like it a lot -RRB- , and has a lot of room .
 I bought this as a gift for my grandmother and she loved it . She wears it all the time when she goes out with her friends to show it off . Very pretty pattern and good quality .
 SMOOTH , nice fit , easy to wear . found the item to be at least as nice as pictured . I love the bright colors.Company was quick and shipping was fast and reasonable . I will definitely use them agaain
 I thought I had gone overboard in purchasing mountaineering pants for an 11 day sea kayak expedition in Greenland . After living in these pants with lightweight SmartWool underneath and 10-year-old Cannondale bike rain paints over them whilst in the kayak , I stayed warm , comfortable and dry the whole time . This included a flooded Featherlight kayak , a 28 hour long 45 mph wind/rain storm , and climing from sea level to 760 meters -LRB- unzipped to stay cool while climbing , zipped up warm and snug at the top -RRB- .
 I love these pants . They are great . They are allowing me to take one less layer on a winter expedition because I can use them as a wind proof shell as well as a heavy base layer . If it 's snowing I can put a water proof shell over them . The drawback is they do n't fit body types that are not long and slender . I am in great shape but I 'm shorter and stocky . So I paid a local seamstress to take my larges Waist 34-36 up about 4 inches for a better fit . Now I 'm warm wearing a custom pair of Windstopper 34 waist 30 inseam pants . Other brands offer a short or a long version of their products which would work well when companies start making pants in S , M , L , XL , hint , hint Mountain Hardware

 Seems polyester stringer tank tops are hard to find . I had an Otomix tank top of similar design that I 've had for years , but lost it on vacation . Bought one of these in a Medium -LRB- same size as the old Otomix -RRB- and it fits great . -LRB- I have about a 42 '' chest and 29 inch waist -RRB- . The material is polyester with zero stretch , so it has a thin sports Jersey feel to it , rather than being form-fitting . I prefer the looser fit for workouts , and it hangs as pictured . As far as the tag - I cut it off , now it 's tagless .
 the stringer/tank top has a good fit . the feel is better than most under armor .
 This is a great tank top and it does n't shrink because it is 100 % polyester . Make sure you wash it with cold water and dry it with very low heat .
 Perfect fit ... like people said , they run big . With that said , I 'm normally an XL and purchased this in a Large after reading other reviews . The fit is dead on - any smaller would be TOO small , any larger would look sloppy.Great material , great fit , great colors ! Will order again !
 Great breathable tank for yoga . I do n't agree that it runs large and wish I had ordered my normal XL size . The L is OK but the top is somewhat fitted . I prefer.looser clothing for exercise . The quality is fine . I did the same thing as another reviewer and cut the tag out so that the top is tagless .
 If you have the body , you have to wear one of these ! I got complimented the first day I wore it ! It 's a little loose on me , but I want to grow into it . Overall , I still look swole when I wear this . I 'm 150lb with a lean muscular build . It wo n't shrink on you like cotton materials .
 Only one problem is that if you were velcro weight lifting gloves or straps , these can pull on the shirts causing them to fray . In the gym is really the only time I wear them , so I may have to switch to the cotton ones .
 What can I say - if you work out and have muscles ... this is the Tank Top you want to have!Great quality , does not get in the way while working out , simply a great product at a fair price.I will buy this one again !
 String tanks with a `` medium '' arm opening -LRB- not clear to your waist -RRB- are hard enough to find ... but with such great quality and design ? The feel of the fabric is light to the hand , and VERY supple ... which not only feels great on the body , but like all poly , hangs and moves with the body MUCH better than cotton does . I 've a 44 '' ch/31 '' w , so am right between a M and L in most cases ... got the 2 blue tanks here in L , and they fit perfectly . I like the swale -LRB- longer -RRB- front and back , too . The `` navy '' is really the nicest color ... it 's a bit less `` shocking '' than the true blue , and since I feel a little pretentious just by wearin ' the thing to begin with , I really do n't like to being `` over the top '' by making SURE everyone sees me . I 'm back to get another navy and a white ... these are great quality , and God knows how long they 'll be available !
 I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it !!!! Its stylish yet great for the gym !!!! Going to buy him more !
 I think the reviews on here indicate the quality . The material is really nice , the fit is perfect , and it looks great . I would recommend a size down as well . I usually wear L t-shirts , XL sweatshirts , but a M in this is perfect .
 High quality fabric . Was worried about how the medium would fit me -LRB- 5 ' 8 '' 170lb with a 45inch chest . Mediums usually do n't fit me well but I was afraid a large would have been too long . This fits just right for my build .
 these are awesome ... i ca n't stand wearing cotton to the gym and it 's difficult to find non-cotton tank tops in the stores in my area . These fit really well and are very comfortable . i definitly recommend them .
 My husband loves this shirt to work out in . It keeps him dry even during the most intense workout . The only draw back is the price and lack of variety . It is not cheap and there are only a few colors offered . I have not seen them sold anywhere else either except amazon and the manufacturer website where they are a bit cheaper .
 I purchased these in size Large one size smaller than I usually order XL in cotton version of Pitbull and Otomix because this material has zero shrinking unlike cotton . If you like how Pitbull and Otomix cotton tanks look on these will look even better just order 1 size smaller than you usually do unless you like the tank to have a loose fit . I have tried every tank top from every brand over the last 20 years and these are the best I have ever come across . They wash up like new and will look great year 's later unlike cotton tanks . They also do n't stretch out of shape like cotton tanks do ; so toward the end of your back workout they still look great and not completely stretched out of shape .
 I 've had two cotton stingers for over five years now . I love the fit and feel during my workouts and just to lounge around in . Needless to say , they 're old and fadey and have a few holes in them . While I was browsing through Amazon recently , I came across this Poly Stringer and decided to give it a try . I just received my first tank a few days ago and was extremely pleased with it 's fit and feel - much better than my old cotton ones for sure . In fact , I liked it sooo much that I just ordered my back up yesterday . I highly recommend this item to anyone who does any form of exercise - it 's very cool and comfortable ... almost as if you do n't have a shirt on at all .
 I 've always been a Dockers fan.I love the fit of the flat front . The fabric does n't just crease any how . I love it .
 an excellent pant , comfortable , smooth , good packaging , the measure of pant in line with what the seller say .
 Just right ! It does n't matter how many times it 's been crumpled or washed , it does n't need to be ironed and the crease stays put . The waistline is n't too high , and it 's not too baggy or too tight . Formal enough for work , casual enough for anything else ; I 've even hiked in them -LRB- and the mud stains came right off in one cycle in the wash -RRB- . These are , hands-down , my favorite pants .
 These are the one and only , classic fit original khaki pants from Dockers . The Dockers label is the Kleenex of khaki pants . . the Rolls Royce ... the Xerox . The name is synonymous with the semi-casual look . These pants go great with a leather belt w / cell phone clipped , polo shirt , a clean shave and a crew cut .
 The item is well liked by my husband is one of his favorites since it fit adequately and comfortable .
 It 's nice to find a pair of pants that do n't need any work to fit me right out of the package ! Bought another pair in gray as soon as I used this ones for the first time .
 My teenaged son needs 30x34 pants - which are the dickens to find , even in the big department stores . This fits , and is comparable in price to what I find in the big stores on sale .
 The slacks arrived very quickly . They are a brand new , high-quality product in great shape .
 I have owned many pairs of Dockers Flat Front Original Khaki pants and have always loved them . They are the perfect casual work pant and are comfortable to wear . They do n't usually wrinkle much and they hold up well . I would consider these a good investment . The waist seems to run slightly smaller than many other pants so you may want to get one size larger than you normally would .
 I wo n't give them 5 stars because they 're not really as wrinkle-free as they advertised or as my similar Van Heusen khakis . Either way , they are still light and tr&eacute;s comfortable .
 These pants are wonderful , I have boxy hips and the flat front style takes away from that particular silhouette a and I like that
 Great quality , no time waisted and plenty of choices regarding sizes and color . I will never buy them at the store .
 fit great , feel great , durable , and it works well in both my professional and casual wardrobe
 These pants are great for comfort . True value for the price . So said , there is no individual waist band . Also when you sit normally on a chair , the white fabric inside your side pockets is clearly visible . They could have used the same fabric as the color of the trousers . So , all in all I gave a 4 star .
 I bought two pair to test as work pants . I also bought two pair of another brand . It has been months now , and the pants seem to wear well , and they do not wrinkle . From the washing machine to the dryer , to me in the morning . They always look sharp , and they fit well . That 's all I asked for , and they delivered .
 Useful pants for almost every ocasion . Color does not fade easily . Nice fit .
 I do n't need to tell men over six feet tall or with waists greater than 38 '' that you can burn a ton of gas trying to find clothes that fit . Dockers is a known quantity . So once you find your size , it 's down hill from there . A good price rounds-out the experience .
 The pants are well made , and good quality . I was disappointed in the Individual Fit Waistband ... it hardly gives at all .
 These are great pants and at a great price . I usually have to drive a long way to find a store that has my size .
 There was a far greater ability to get the Dockers I wanted through this vendor than by going to ANY department store . And the prices were significantly better online . The delivery time was a bit slow -- but the time was known at the time I made the purchase -- no false promises of fast delivery . I 'm delighted with this transaction .

 Seems polyester stringer tank tops are hard to find . I had an Otomix tank top of similar design that I 've had for years , but lost it on vacation . Bought one of these in a Medium -LRB- same size as the old Otomix -RRB- and it fits great . -LRB- I have about a 42 '' chest and 29 inch waist -RRB- . The material is polyester with zero stretch , so it has a thin sports Jersey feel to it , rather than being form-fitting . I prefer the looser fit for workouts , and it hangs as pictured . As far as the tag - I cut it off , now it 's tagless .
 the stringer/tank top has a good fit . the feel is better than most under armor .
 This is a great tank top and it does n't shrink because it is 100 % polyester . Make sure you wash it with cold water and dry it with very low heat .
 Perfect fit ... like people said , they run big . With that said , I 'm normally an XL and purchased this in a Large after reading other reviews . The fit is dead on - any smaller would be TOO small , any larger would look sloppy.Great material , great fit , great colors ! Will order again !
 If you have the body , you have to wear one of these ! I got complimented the first day I wore it ! It 's a little loose on me , but I want to grow into it . Overall , I still look swole when I wear this . I 'm 150lb with a lean muscular build . It wo n't shrink on you like cotton materials .

 As soon as this jacket arrived and I tried it on , I ordered one in another color . The fit is very , very flattering , the fabric is good quality , and the price ca n't be beat . It will span the seasons , too , and look good with khakis in the warmer months . I just wish it came in at least one more color .
 I bought this jacket in black . It has a nice look and feel to it , and looks better than the price I paid . The only down side for me is that it 's a little shorter than I 'd like , but I kept it because it 's worth it .

 The pants are well made , and good quality . I was disappointed in the Individual Fit Waistband ... it hardly gives at all .

 I got this backpack for my birthday . I requested it because of the amount of space and the hidden laptop compartment . It has turned out to be the most comfortable backpack I 've ever had . Both the straps and back are padded well and the straps are wide and curved to fit comfortably . They do n't dig into my shoulders at all . My laptop weighs a little over 8lbs and I ca n't even feel it in the pack.My only complaint is that there is no padding at the bottom of the laptop compartment . There is a decent amount of padding around the sides , but absolutely none at the bottom or the top . I 'll make modifications , but if you 're really concerned about this , you should try a different backpack .
 I 've thoroughly used this bag for almost a year and a half and have had nothing but a great experience . Please do n't pay attention to the person who said this bag is made out of cheap material . She hurt her own credibility by stating that she just got the bag , how can you make a decision on the quality and how long it will last if you have n't used it?I 've commutted to law school everyday with this bag filled with large books and my laptop for a long time now and have been rewarded with a quality bag.Only cons are the weak padding and the fact that the CD player apocket is not protected to kep water from getting through the zipper.Highly recommended .
 SMOOTH , nice fit , easy to wear . found the item to be at least as nice as pictured . I love the bright colors.Company was quick and shipping was fast and reasonable . I will definitely use them agaain
 I thought I had gone overboard in purchasing mountaineering pants for an 11 day sea kayak expedition in Greenland . After living in these pants with lightweight SmartWool underneath and 10-year-old Cannondale bike rain paints over them whilst in the kayak , I stayed warm , comfortable and dry the whole time . This included a flooded Featherlight kayak , a 28 hour long 45 mph wind/rain storm , and climing from sea level to 760 meters -LRB- unzipped to stay cool while climbing , zipped up warm and snug at the top -RRB- .
 I love these pants . They are great . They are allowing me to take one less layer on a winter expedition because I can use them as a wind proof shell as well as a heavy base layer . If it 's snowing I can put a water proof shell over them . The drawback is they do n't fit body types that are not long and slender . I am in great shape but I 'm shorter and stocky . So I paid a local seamstress to take my larges Waist 34-36 up about 4 inches for a better fit . Now I 'm warm wearing a custom pair of Windstopper 34 waist 30 inseam pants . Other brands offer a short or a long version of their products which would work well when companies start making pants in S , M , L , XL , hint , hint Mountain Hardware

This included a flooded Featherlight kayak , a 28 hour long 45 mph wind/rain storm , and climing from sea level to 760 meters -LRB- unzipped to stay cool while climbing , zipped up warm and snug at the top -RRB- .
 I love these pants . They are great . They are allowing me to take one less layer on a winter expedition because I can use them as a wind proof shell as well as a heavy base layer . If it 's snowing I can put a water proof shell over them . The drawback is they do n't fit body types that are not long and slender . I am in great shape but I 'm shorter and stocky . So I paid a local seamstress to take my larges Waist 34-36 up about 4 inches for a better fit . Now I 'm warm wearing a custom pair of Windstopper 34 waist 30 inseam pants . Other brands offer a short or a long version of their products which would work well when companies start making pants in S , M , L , XL , hint , hint Mountain Hardware
 I 've always been a Dockers fan.I love the fit of the flat front . The fabric does n't just crease any how . I love it .
 an excellent pant , comfortable , smooth , good packaging , the measure of pant in line with what the seller say .
 Just right ! It does n't matter how many times it 's been crumpled or washed , it does n't need to be ironed and the crease stays put . The waistline is n't too high , and it 's not too baggy or too tight . Formal enough for work , casual enough for anything else ; I 've even hiked in them -LRB- and the mud stains came right off in one cycle in the wash -RRB- . These are , hands-down , my favorite pants .
 These are the one and only , classic fit original khaki pants from Dockers . The Dockers label is the Kleenex of khaki pants . . the Rolls Royce ... the Xerox . The name is synonymous with the semi-casual look . These pants go great with a leather belt w / cell phone clipped , polo shirt , a clean shave and a crew cut .
 The item is well liked by my husband is one of his favorites since it fit adequately and comfortable .
 It 's nice to find a pair of pants that do n't need any work to fit me right out of the package ! Bought another pair in gray as soon as I used this ones for the first time .
 My teenaged son needs 30x34 pants - which are the dickens to find , even in the big department stores . This fits , and is comparable in price to what I find in the big stores on sale .
 The slacks arrived very quickly . They are a brand new , high-quality product in great shape .
 I have owned many pairs of Dockers Flat Front Original Khaki pants and have always loved them . They are the perfect casual work pant and are comfortable to wear . They do n't usually wrinkle much and they hold up well . I would consider these a good investment . The waist seems to run slightly smaller than many other pants so you may want to get one size larger than you normally would .
 I wo n't give them 5 stars because they 're not really as wrinkle-free as they advertised or as my similar Van Heusen khakis . Either way , they are still light and tr&eacute;s comfortable .
 These pants are wonderful , I have boxy hips and the flat front style takes away from that particular silhouette a and I like that
 Great quality , no time waisted and plenty of choices regarding sizes and color . I will never buy them at the store .
 fit great , feel great , durable , and it works well in both my professional and casual wardrobe
 These pants are great for comfort . True value for the price . So said , there is no individual waist band . Also when you sit normally on a chair , the white fabric inside your side pockets is clearly visible . They could have used the same fabric as the color of the trousers . So , all in all I gave a 4 star .
 I bought two pair to test as work pants . I also bought two pair of another brand . It has been months now , and the pants seem to wear well , and they do not wrinkle . From the washing machine to the dryer , to me in the morning . They always look sharp , and they fit well . That 's all I asked for , and they delivered .
 Useful pants for almost every ocasion . Color does not fade easily . Nice fit .
 I do n't need to tell men over six feet tall or with waists greater than 38 '' that you can burn a ton of gas trying to find clothes that fit . Dockers is a known quantity . So once you find your size , it 's down hill from there . A good price rounds-out the experience .
 The pants are well made , and good quality . I was disappointed in the Individual Fit Waistband ... it hardly gives at all .
 These are great pants and at a great price . I usually have to drive a long way to find a store that has my size .
 There was a far greater ability to get the Dockers I wanted through this vendor than by going to ANY department store . And the prices were significantly better online . The delivery time was a bit slow -- but the time was known at the time I made the purchase -- no false promises of fast delivery . I 'm delighted with this transaction .
 I used to be a very loyal Jansport buyer , but when the time came for a new backpack , I decided to see what else was out there . I am very glad I did.I knew this was the backpack for me when I was in a store examining the various models and trying them on for comfort . After about half an hour of this I decided to go do some other shopping when my daughter pointed out I still had one on my shoulder ! It fit so well that I had stopped noticing I even had it on . So I bought it!The Pros : - Two very roomy main compartments that inhale a stack of books and notebooks with no problem . Since there are two , it let me be a little more organized about what contents go in which one . - Padded notebook sleeve . I 've only carried mine a few times in there , but it felt reasonably padded from routine handling , but I 'd still take care in tossing the backpack around . - Convenient set of various pockets on the front . I quickly assigned each of these specific roles -LRB- cell phone in the top one ; pda in another ; spare batteries , keys , and bus map in a third , etc. -RRB- Being able to go right to a specific compartment was nicer than rummaging around for stuff . - Comfy top handle . It has a very nice rubberized top handle for those times when you do n't want to or ca n't shoulder-carry it , the handgrip is nice and cozy . In my opinion it 's far nicer than merely padded hand straps that still cut into your hands after a while . - Rugged ! I 've loaded rather large piles of computer science books into it and was likely to have my back itself give out before the backpack would . I used to go through a Jansport every few semesters -LRB- usually from splitting at the seams somewhere -RRB- but this Eastpak still looks new after a year of daily use.The Con : - It lacks any sort of water-bottle holder . If you have something insulated that does n't sweat , you could put it inside , but that 's not always an option . It 's just a shame they did n't add some netted ones on the sides . It would have made this an ultimate backpack if it just had that.So I 've found my new favorite backpack from this -LRB- and I 've been through a dozen or so in my life -RRB- and become a new Eastpak fan in the process . For the price , I have n't found anything on the market that comes close to this for my needs .
 I just got this backpack because I needed a good bag to carry my laptop in . The non-backpack kind really hurt my shoulders but this is a very ergonomic bag . It is very roomy as well and the picture does n't do it justice . I travel often and now I am prepared for long trips ...
 It could use more laptop protection , but otherwise I have no complaints . Perfect for a college student/part time pro . It can carry your laptop , notes , books , odds and ends , w/o much weight on your shoulders.I am getting ready to go back to school , and this is exactly what doctor ordered . Certainly , an excellent buy .
 I love everything about this bag . I am a nursing student and have lots of books and binders to carry in addition to my laptop -LRB- Apple iBook . -RRB- On a day with a heavy work load I can usually carry three books , each about 1.5 inches thick , as well as three 1 inch binders , all at one time . There is also plenty of compartment storage for everything from pencils to calculators . I especially like the clip located inside one of the pockets so that you can attach your keys to avoid them getting lost in your bag . I do wish there was more padding in the back so heavy loads were n't felt as much . I do n't have problems with the straps slipping off , although the material on the inside of the strap is a little smoother than that of my other backpacks . Overall , you ca n't beat the price of this pack for the amount of space you get . I would definately buy another if the need arose .
 this is an awesome pack ! i am a 6th grader and i am in love with it !!! even though i dont have a laptop , i use that pocket for my 2 notebooks ! it has so much room ! i keep my school suplies in the bigger compartment and my junk in the 2nd one . amazing space ! this pack also holds up well in rain , i have walked home in the rain for 30 min . and nothing was moist ! u should by this pack ! it feels really light , and i wear it really low on my back ! what more could u ask for ? the only down side is theres no pocket for ur cellphone but i keep that in the little pocket near the top.i would by it again if i needed to , but i dont think i will!its just a must by !

 This specific pulse brief produced by 2 -LRB- x -RRB- ist is perhaps my favorite in over all the various styles out there . The fabric selection is actually very smooth , and does n't have the small `` cotton lumps '' that many fabrics tend to develop over many washings . There are actually a huge selection in colors -LRB- tomato , blue , black , white , green , red , etc. . . -RRB- to choose from , and along with the dominating PULSE waistband , it 's rather hard to be unnoticeable when paired off with low rise jeans . These briefs also have a tendency to help produce a `` lift '' , but not to the point where it looks as if you had surgery . Very comfortable and trendy looking . Definitely an addition to the wardrobe .
 This item was shipped in a timely manner and the fit is great

 It 's nice to find a pair of pants that do n't need any work to fit me right out of the package ! Bought another pair in gray as soon as I used this ones for the first time .
 My teenaged son needs 30x34 pants - which are the dickens to find , even in the big department stores . This fits , and is comparable in price to what I find in the big stores on sale .
 The slacks arrived very quickly . They are a brand new , high-quality product in great shape .
 These pants are great for comfort . True value for the price . So said , there is no individual waist band . Also when you sit normally on a chair , the white fabric inside your side pockets is clearly visible . They could have used the same fabric as the color of the trousers . So , all in all I gave a 4 star .
 I bought two pair to test as work pants . I also bought two pair of another brand . It has been months now , and the pants seem to wear well , and they do not wrinkle . From the washing machine to the dryer , to me in the morning . They always look sharp , and they fit well . That 's all I asked for , and they delivered .
 Useful pants for almost every ocasion . Color does not fade easily . Nice fit .
 I do n't need to tell men over six feet tall or with waists greater than 38 '' that you can burn a ton of gas trying to find clothes that fit . Dockers is a known quantity . So once you find your size , it 's down hill from there . A good price rounds-out the experience .
 The pants are well made , and good quality . I was disappointed in the Individual Fit Waistband ... it hardly gives at all .
 These are great pants and at a great price . I usually have to drive a long way to find a store that has my size .
 There was a far greater ability to get the Dockers I wanted through this vendor than by going to ANY department store . And the prices were significantly better online . The delivery time was a bit slow -- but the time was known at the time I made the purchase -- no false promises of fast delivery . I 'm delighted with this transaction .
 I found this bra in Kohl 's and I just love it . So comfy , and the cups do n't get bent out of shape in the wash . I could n't ever seem to find them in black , so I purchased them on Amazon.com .

 I have owned many pairs of Dockers Flat Front Original Khaki pants and have always loved them . They are the perfect casual work pant and are comfortable to wear . They do n't usually wrinkle much and they hold up well . I would consider these a good investment . The waist seems to run slightly smaller than many other pants so you may want to get one size larger than you normally would .
 I wo n't give them 5 stars because they 're not really as wrinkle-free as they advertised or as my similar Van Heusen khakis . Either way , they are still light and tr&eacute;s comfortable .
 These pants are wonderful , I have boxy hips and the flat front style takes away from that particular silhouette a and I like that
 Great quality , no time waisted and plenty of choices regarding sizes and color . I will never buy them at the store .
 fit great , feel great , durable , and it works well in both my professional and casual wardrobe
 I 've always been a Dockers fan.I love the fit of the flat front . The fabric does n't just crease any how . I love it .
 an excellent pant , comfortable , smooth , good packaging , the measure of pant in line with what the seller say .
 Just right ! It does n't matter how many times it 's been crumpled or washed , it does n't need to be ironed and the crease stays put . The waistline is n't too high , and it 's not too baggy or too tight . Formal enough for work , casual enough for anything else ; I 've even hiked in them -LRB- and the mud stains came right off in one cycle in the wash -RRB- . These are , hands-down , my favorite pants .
 These are the one and only , classic fit original khaki pants from Dockers . The Dockers label is the Kleenex of khaki pants . . the Rolls Royce ... the Xerox . The name is synonymous with the semi-casual look . These pants go great with a leather belt w / cell phone clipped , polo shirt , a clean shave and a crew cut .
 The item is well liked by my husband is one of his favorites since it fit adequately and comfortable .

 I got this backpack for college , beacause I wanted a backpack that would also protect my laptop as well as carry my textbooks ! When I got this backpack , it looked a little small , but once I loaded it up with books , its not a problem at all ! The cell phone pocket is extremely convienent , and I now like how the second main compartment is open , so things are easily accessible . I highly recommend this backpack for someone who wants to carry around their books and computer safely . -LRB- Another plus

The name is synonymous with the semi-casual look . These pants go great with a leather belt w / cell phone clipped , polo shirt , a clean shave and a crew cut .
 The item is well liked by my husband is one of his favorites since it fit adequately and comfortable .
 It 's nice to find a pair of pants that do n't need any work to fit me right out of the package ! Bought another pair in gray as soon as I used this ones for the first time .
 My teenaged son needs 30x34 pants - which are the dickens to find , even in the big department stores . This fits , and is comparable in price to what I find in the big stores on sale .
 The slacks arrived very quickly . They are a brand new , high-quality product in great shape .
 I have owned many pairs of Dockers Flat Front Original Khaki pants and have always loved them . They are the perfect casual work pant and are comfortable to wear . They do n't usually wrinkle much and they hold up well . I would consider these a good investment . The waist seems to run slightly smaller than many other pants so you may want to get one size larger than you normally would .
 I wo n't give them 5 stars because they 're not really as wrinkle-free as they advertised or as my similar Van Heusen khakis . Either way , they are still light and tr&eacute;s comfortable .
 These pants are wonderful , I have boxy hips and the flat front style takes away from that particular silhouette a and I like that
 Great quality , no time waisted and plenty of choices regarding sizes and color . I will never buy them at the store .
 fit great , feel great , durable , and it works well in both my professional and casual wardrobe
 These pants are great for comfort . True value for the price . So said , there is no individual waist band . Also when you sit normally on a chair , the white fabric inside your side pockets is clearly visible . They could have used the same fabric as the color of the trousers . So , all in all I gave a 4 star .
 I bought two pair to test as work pants . I also bought two pair of another brand . It has been months now , and the pants seem to wear well , and they do not wrinkle . From the washing machine to the dryer , to me in the morning . They always look sharp , and they fit well . That 's all I asked for , and they delivered .
 Useful pants for almost every ocasion . Color does not fade easily . Nice fit .
 I do n't need to tell men over six feet tall or with waists greater than 38 '' that you can burn a ton of gas trying to find clothes that fit . Dockers is a known quantity . So once you find your size , it 's down hill from there . A good price rounds-out the experience .
 The pants are well made , and good quality . I was disappointed in the Individual Fit Waistband ... it hardly gives at all .
 These are great pants and at a great price . I usually have to drive a long way to find a store that has my size .
 There was a far greater ability to get the Dockers I wanted through this vendor than by going to ANY department store . And the prices were significantly better online . The delivery time was a bit slow -- but the time was known at the time I made the purchase -- no false promises of fast delivery . I 'm delighted with this transaction .
 I have the tote and I love it . When flying , I put my purse in this bag along with a portable dvd player , book , toiletries and camera . it 's really spacious and has compartmens on the inside to make organizing a breeze.if you have the roll bag as welll , you can simply slip this over the extended handle and be on your way . no pulling one bag with the other on your shoulder.oh ... and the green really stands out at baggage claim . i 've gotten tons of compliments .
 SMOOTH , nice fit , easy to wear . found the item to be at least as nice as pictured . I love the bright colors.Company was quick and shipping was fast and reasonable . I will definitely use them agaain

 I 've always been a Dockers fan.I love the fit of the flat front . The fabric does n't just crease any how . I love it .
 an excellent pant , comfortable , smooth , good packaging , the measure of pant in line with what the seller say .
 Just right ! It does n't matter how many times it 's been crumpled or washed , it does n't need to be ironed and the crease stays put . The waistline is n't too high , and it 's not too baggy or too tight . Formal enough for work , casual enough for anything else ; I 've even hiked in them -LRB- and the mud stains came right off in one cycle in the wash -RRB- .

 I got this backpack for college , beacause I wanted a backpack that would also protect my laptop as well as carry my textbooks ! When I got this backpack , it looked a little small , but once I loaded it up with books , its not a problem at all ! The cell phone pocket is extremely convienent , and I now like how the second main compartment is open , so things are easily accessible . I highly recommend this backpack for someone who wants to carry around their books and computer safely . -LRB- Another plus
 I bought this for a metal loving friend for Christmas . It was every bit as cool as I imagined , and arrived very fast -LRB- and we live in Hong Kong -RRB- . I would definitely recommend both the seller and the product .

 I bought this shirt a while ago for my 50 + year-old Mom , who loves to dance . She said it fit great and she wanted to buy them for her friends .

 QUICK DELIVERY . GREAT PRODUCT . ONLY ONE PROBLEM . SHOULD HAVE BIASE AROUND THE LAYERS OF THE CRINOLINE . THE BOTTOM LAYER SCRATCHED MY LEGS ALL UP .
 I purchase this item to wear under a 40 's / 50 's style dress . It worked perfectly for my tea-length dress . The waist is a string-tie , so that was a bit of a surprise , but it allowed you to easily adjust it . It has a liner on the inside , so the crinoline does n't scratch your legs . I like the black color , but I would purchase another one in a different color just for variety .
 The slip arrived as it was shown in the photos . The cost was on par with others I had seen online .
 My review doesnt deal with the product itself -LRB- which is excellent -RRB- It deals with the service offered by koyono themselves . I ordered 1 blackCoat-T shirt not knowing what the expect . The shirt arrived , it was excellent quality and worked well . However , within 2 weeks one of the seems began to unravel.I emailed koyono expecting that I would have to try to convince them I didnt rip it accidentally and fight to get it fixed . Wrong , not only were they polite they promptly sent me 2 shirts to replace the one defective shirt I recieved.I am very happy with the service I recieved from koyono and I will be purchasing from them in the future . I suggest you do the same .
 Not only is it a shirt to hold small gadgets , it is made very well . The material that holds your electronics is a microfiber that wicks perspiration instead of cotton that stays damp . Pulling my ipod out of the pocket was n't too bad the first couple of times . After a while it gets faster . I do n't have to take it out often since I can clip the ipod remote to my button down shirt . I 'm very happy and will be ordering more .
 When I first got the glove , I found that it was really accurately made according to the anime/manga . I 've already taken it to a few conventions , and so far it 's really holding out for me . The only thing is that it 's a bit larger than I thought it would be , so it does n't perfectly fit my hand , but other than that it 's great .
 well it does n't quite fit as well as I would like.But i have made several friends with people who see me walking around wearing this thing , and they say `` OH , is that like from bleach ?! Where did you get that ? `` So , yeah , its like a homing device.The stitching is okay . Not too worried about it coming apart . And it 's gone through the wash a few times , and it 's still fine . The padding is nice too.It 's a good collectors item for anyone who loves bleach .
 It 's a glove ; not much you can say about it . I guess the sewing could be neater , but I do n't really expect much . I only really put it on once and would say it 's generally comfortable .
 I bought this item a while ago , and when I received it I was very excited . The shipping did n't take too long , a week or two if I remember correctly . But right whenever I opened the package , I was very disappointed because it was way too large . I have very small , petite hands , even for a girl , and I was confused why the glove was so big whenever the glove is made for someone who is dressing up as a high school girl . This glove literally fits on a 43 year old man 's hand . But after I got past the size , the glove is pretty good . I really like how the design on the front appears to be a lot like the anime , and it 's pretty comfortable to wear . It 's not too hot if you 're cosplaying in a summer day , and it 's made very well.Just , for girls with small hands like me ; Beware the glove is a one-size-fits-all , so it 's going to be larger than you 're hand . Much larger . But it 's not to the point were it looks horrible , or feels bad or anything.Overall , it 's a great product for the price .
 I just got this in the mail today , and i love it ! But when I got it , it was huge ! I had to pin part of it to fit my hand ... And it makes my hand look quite fat.But the quality is very good ! It looks kinda of weird because of the 2 types of fabrics , but overall , it is worth your money if you are a bleach fan or want to cosplay Rukia ! : -RRB-
 I got this bra in black and white . I was suprised to see that it had cup definition to it when I got it but was glad it did . It had hooks in the back that made it easy to adjust the shoulder straps to the fit you need . It is a little hard to get on if you have a larger chest and use the zipper . If you un-zip it and then put it on , you have to hold your breasts together to get the zipper to close . Just a little weird -- nothing to make you not buy it . It holds really well for a larger chested woman . I run with it on and feel great . The tags that came on the bra said it was supposed to be $ 35 , so I say this is a great buy !
 I did n't realize they made a sports bar that could hold all of me . This bra was great . It has a wide band at the bottom that holds the bra in place and the formed cups do n't just ` squish ' you , they hold you in place . There was very little jiggling during my workout . I will be buying a few more of these today . The price is amazing .
 this bra is great , the straps are adjustable in the back , it has a zipper -LRB- my favorite feature -RRB- in the front so you do n't have to get a cramp some place trying to remove your sports bra after a workout , the cups are padded so if it 's a little cold , nobody will know * winks * ... overall well made sports bra .
 I ` lll be buying a couple more of these sports bras . The bra is cute , it stays in place when I work out , and it FITS . I like the zipper opening in the front - it 's easy to put on the bra , and it 's a classy look . I will be ordering more of these .
 Really like the design and the support . Wish I 've got the black one though . .
 Nice support , great style . Love the zipper and contrast piping . A bit low-cut for a sports bra . If you have well-developed lat muscles , you may bulge out a bit between the outer side of your breast and your armpit . Also , even on the shortest strap setting , the straps are a bit too long for my 5 ' 3 '' frame . Still a good deal .
 SMOOTH , nice fit , easy to wear . found the item to be at least as nice as pictured . I love the bright colors.Company was quick and shipping was fast and reasonable . I will definitely use them agaain
 I do n't tan so I needed a hat that would keep the sun off me without keeping the heat in , but some of your more `` fashionably focussed '' friends may have objections .
 Fit me real good & comfortable ! Seem to be built well too . 8 more words required ... overall satisfied ! End
 Excellent product , as is specified so ... congratulations . Indeed the product is what I needed , and as well as I said look I found and sent in perfect condition
 Bought these for my husband - he loves them . Comfortable with enough give to fit the inevitable up 5 lbs , down 5lbs cycle ...
 These jeans are good quality and fit well . My husband likes them because they give him a little more room in the legs .
 This is the second pair of George Strait jeans I have purchased for my husband from Amazon . He just loves them and they fit to a tee .
 I have several different types of wranglers , and even cinch jeans.But these are the most comfortable jeans I have ever worn . They are now my favorite . I have a feeling my closet will contain nothing but these .
 Fantastic jeans , my husband is going to be very happy Christmas morning when he sees them . He is a huge George Strait fan and these are perfect .

 This is a quality shirt that will hold up well . The cotton is thick and it has not faded much after repeated washings in cold water . The fit is pretty normal on the XL . I 'm very happy with this shirt .

 I have seen this outfit at the African tailor shop in my community at twice the price . The quality fabric feels soft on your body and it is very well made . The price is definitely right . Good purchase .
 When I got this , I discovered that the `` insert '' was a heavily sequined v-shape , attached only at the each end . It laid okay but I thought it was weird , especially for wearing to work . So I simply snipped it out without a problem ! I wear a white lace trim camisole underneath , since the v neck is deep and it looks really great with black trousers and a charcoal skirt . Its a comfortable and colorful outfit and I always get compliments when I wear it . And turquoise jewelry accents go great with it .
 I just want to say this costume fit perfectly ... like it was made for me . The only thing I did not like about it was the fake glued on flowers which I removed very easily and then the costume looked more authentic.I love the saloon girl look , and decided to purchase this costume for fun . I wanted to dress up last year to take my 3 year old son out trick or treating in style.I even entered a costume contest and won `` Prettiest Costume '' so I would have to say this was worth the money.It was also shipped to me very quickly , it arrived sooner then I expected .
 These are so incredibly soft , and they fit just right . Think of how your most comfortable tee shirt feels , and these will likely compare . They are n't too baggie around my thighs , as many of these types of shorts are on me . The elastic in the waist is very comfortable - not too tight , not too loose . They are also true to size.They are quite flattering , and long enough that if you needed to run into a grocery store or something , you are covered well enough . You could wear them with or without bike shorts underneath at the gym . You might want the biker shorts if doing a lot of kicks , but otherwise you could probably get away with just these . They are great for wearing around the house as your comfie every day shorts . A very good all around soft short !
 These shorts are the best buy ever . I like them so much , I have ordered them more than once . They are long lasting , easy to care for and you canot beat the price . I lounge in them every afternoon . They are so comfortable , I sometimes even sleep in them .
 I was very pleased with this purchase . The shorts fit true to size and I love having the drawstring waistband to ensure a good fit . They hit mid-length on the thigh , so good coverage -- not too long , not too short . Essential Apparel had my order to me in under a week and I 'm on the opposite coast , so that was a nice surprise .
 These are just the style of gym shorts I like , and the price is great ! I only purchased the cotton blend colors -LRB- graphite and grey -RRB- , so as not to have the shrinking issues the other reviewer spoke of . I am very pleased !
 Since I 've purchased Russell Athletic apparel before , I know that their togs are very basic -LRB- okay for ` round the house -RRB- . They shrink - buy ` up ' a size or two . So these shorts are about what you can expect ... except they would be more appropriately priced at $ 5.99 or $ 6.99 tops .
 These are so very soft and comfie . They may be a bit on the short side for the gym , and with leggings would probably bunch a little between the legs , but for around the house they are IDEAL . They are like your most comfortable tee shirt . I love sleeping in them or just wearing them around the house .
 I love these shorts . . they wear well and will last a while . . I 've had another pair for 2 years and no sign of wearing out . .
 Excellent shorts without that thick uncomfortable waistband or tight legs that most shorts have today . I highly recommend !
 Comfortable ! 100 % cotton ! Economical ! Easy to order ! I bought two pairs of these shorts at a swanky sports outfitters store 2 or 3 years ago and realy liked them . When I went back to get more that store did n't carry them -LRB- or almost anything else cotton -RRB- anymore . I was realy disappointed . Then I was on-line looking for some workout pants for my father and noticed the name `` Russell '' which gave me the idea to buy them on-line . There was just what I wanted and all kinds of discounts . And I did n't have to do a lot of driving or walking to get them .
 i bought these in size small , navy , 100 % cotton . the color is darker than the photo shows . after washing and drying on low heat , the shorts did shrink quite a bit but they still fit okay . i definitely would n't wear these shorts in public - the leg openings are pretty baggy and the shorts are pretty daggy , overall . the waistband is comfortable but ugly , and the shorts are n't particularly flattering . having said all that , they are very comfortable for wearing around the house . for $ 10 i do n't expect much more .
 I already had 3 pair and I just ordered 6 more for summer . They are cool , comfortable , affordable and they look nice on anyone . -LRB- Do n't let the product pics fool you - they look really nice on a real person -RRB- My sister also ordered 3 pair to wear to the gym . I wear them around the house , to go walking or run errands . Love 'em .
 These are a nice standard drawstring gym short . The ones I used to by were discontinued and I bought one pair of these to try them out . Loose and comfy . Better designed for someone slim than rounded/curvy .
 I bought these shorts because they are the only ones I can find that do n't have a wide elastic waistband that presses uncomfortable against my stomach . I also like the absorbent and comfortable cotton.I am 5 ' 4 '' and weigh 110 ; so I am not big . But I buy the large because it is the most comfortable . The only workout shorts I will wear .
 These shorts are beyond comfortable and just the right length - not too short and not too long . Great for wearing around the house or for running errands on hot summer days .
 These comfortable , soft shorts are exactly what I wanted ... they wash beautifully and they are Russell quality .
 I bought these and enjoy wearing them . They are very comfortable and easy to wash . I highly recommend them !
 Ordering clothing sight-unseen and without trying on is always a bit iffy . But I ordered this in Navy , large ; and the fit and all is just fine . And the price was low . So I 'm a happy camper .
 I love this arm / wrist wallet . Unlike the others I had own previously , this one has enough space for my car or house keys , some loose change and even a small power-bar , so I can hit the road for a running with everything I need.All the wrist wallet i bought before did n't last because of the limited space and quality of them .
 I have owned and used this brand En-Route Security Arm Pocket -LRB- I call mine a wrist wallet -RRB- for the past two years or so for my daily walks in warm weather when I do n't wear much besides a tank , shorts and shoes . It 's comfortable next to my skin , sort of silky , which is a big deal to me because I 'm sensitive , or as my father used to call me , I am `` The Princess with the Pea . '' The main area holds several cards
 I use the en-route wrist wallet when traveling to safely stash cash , credit & debit cards , tickets and coins.There is no worry about pick pockets or lost purses with this item.It is large enough to hold 8 credit/debit cards , 500 euros & still comfortable enough to wear all day.Everything is secure with the velcro pocket and 2 small zipper pockets . It looks like a sweat band yet is soft and comfortable.The en-route wrist wallet is well made & holds it shape after many uses.I highly recommend the product to anyone .
 My wife loves this arm wallet . No need to carry a purse and good security .
 I bought this recently because I needed something to put my keycard in for work since the strap of my keycard broke . This works perfectly . It 's a little snug but it 's comfortable and I am happy with this product . If you are walking or jogging and need to put away your keys or something , this works .
 The problem with most wrist wallets is that unless you have a huge wrist , when you fasten them to your wrist , the wallet contours to your wrist and you do n't have much continuous FLAT space to accommodate 3 '' car key . The result is not only uncomfortable , unsightly , but also untenable because the pointed end of the key is bound to make a hole in the fabric sooner or later.This is the only wrist wallet Amazon carries that lists its actual width as being 3.75 '' -- which would be ample for 95 % of keys out there . Do n't know if it has a terry liner to soak up sweat while exercising though , since it 's not being marketed as a `` sports '' accessory but more of a travel accessory .
 the reason this underwear is so expensive is because it is the best.once you wear Hanro Men 's Cotton Stretch Boxer Brief you will immediatelyunderstand this and regret not buying some sooner .

 These glove liners may not look like much but they certainly keep my hands warm . I put them under a pair of 180s and my hands stay warm for the 5-8 hours I am outside at work .
 I wore these in the Marines ... they are awesome . I wear them under my regular gloves and when you need your fingers for minor things like buttons or zippers these keep your hands warm with your gloves off . Love em .
 These work great under my leather gloves when it 's too warm to wear the heavy motorcycle gloves .
 These polypro glove liners are the BOMB , so to speak ! As a former member of the 6th I.D. -LRB- Light -RRB- Ft. Wainwright , Alaska , -LRB- Deactivated 1994 -RRB- I learned quite a bit about arctic survival . These gloves were among the recommended gloves to wear as a base layer to keep your fingers warm , I owned a pair or two and they work great . Down here in the lower 48 , you could wear these almost as a glove by themselves , if it were not for the material easily able to rip under heavy work conditions . So , not good for working , however a great liner for an outer glove to keep hands warm while working . I would hightly recommend this glove liner to anyone , and sizes are correct and they do stretch to fit properly . Great glove , I bought three more recently for my survival pack !
 Single glove size did fit my large hands and seem to be excellent quality . The material is sewn nicely and did not have any cosmetic problems . These are nice to have and can be used in a range of weather conditions . I use them as a base layer when the temperature is near freezing or colder . The gloves which no other covering are adequate for 45-50 degree Fahrenheit as long is it is not too windy or wet .
 very nice warm gloves that are described in the product details . I recieved them on time with no problems love it
 This is a really nice shirt . I thought the fit was excellent . Looks good after washing several times . Getting 2 more for gifts.I really like the slightly longer placket with 4 buttons.When I wore the first one for the first time , 3 people in my group for dinner made nice comments about how they liked my shirt .
 Thanks Amazon for introducing a new American Cottons style.The mini houndstooth check is really very nice . Good colors and wash very well .
 excelent quality - true to size and quick delivery - how could you ask for more . Shirts are long but I am tall so I LOVED it
 Nice shirt for the price !
 These are great shirts . I say that they run big.These are 100 percent cotton . If you live on the coast these are great shirts . The colors and the shirt looks better in person . I purchased five of these myself . The good thing is they do not shrink in the dryer
 It 's worth for the price . It will be nice , if there is one packet .

 So while I do wear them , I 'm not the biggest fan of two-toned Tool T 's . While the fabric of the shirt is breathable yet heavy enough to stand up to repeated washing without noticeable stress , the graphics do tend to fade with more rapidity then the shirts sporting multicolored designs . I 'd still recommend buying this shirt if you 're a Tool fan who 's got to have all of the T 's , or an aesthete who wants to own a mass-produced piece of Alex Grey 's sacred psychedelic artwork .
 This is a top notch top hat for a young boy or girl - perfect for the aspiring magician ! I got this for my 7 yr old boy for Christmas and he loves it - it 's so nice because it 's collapsible . It also fits my head so there 's plenty of room in the hat as they grow . I 'm glad I spent the extra money and got this good quality chapeau - he 'll have it a long , long time !
 The Wolfwood Cross Punisher necklace is amazing . Once I got past the initial awe of having it right in my hands , I was dazzled by how well detailed it was . The designer kept everything , including the skull-shaped handle in the center of the cross , and little dots along the cross where the nails were . There were only two problems I had . 1
 I bought this having a much different image in mind . It 's made with durable , heavy metal . The detail is beautiful , but the back side is dissapointing . There is no detail whatsoever on the backside , just a flat surface . It doesnt look anywhere near as cool when the cross flips over and all you see is the flat side.The chain it was on was very nice , and it looks very durable . If both sides had been detailed so beautiful , I would have given it a 5 . Overall , I 'm happy with my purchase , but it could of been better .
 I bought this just because I wanted something to remind me of the Trigun series besides the series themselves . I like the detail and the chain but I was expecting it to have the same amount of detail on the back of the cross . It 's nothing more then a flat smooth piece on the back .
 Amazing looking necklace , the chain is more on the cheap side mine broke after getting caught a handle for a window , however the cross itself is amazing over time the coating will come off however so take care of it and clean it . Overall astethically pleasing piece would definitly recommend for someone thats a fan of the anime or manga , or just someone that is into more industrial , dark , or kind of brooding style but is a christian that would like the symbolizim of the cross .
 I bought this necklace at an anime convention . Beautiful necklace . My only problem is when I let my brother wear it , it looked like he was wearing a chocker . The chain is too short !
 This shirt has held up well to washing and still looks gorgeous . The only complaint I have is the high cost of shipping .
 This shirt is awesome . The color and print are great . I received my shirts with a few days of ordering . I gave this as a gift to a friend and she loves it . It looks good on her . The material is good quality and the price is great . I also bought a wolf print for my son and it is one of favorite shirts now . Thank you for the good shirts . I will be purchasing more in the future .
 First I thought the sweater was very thin . It is very good and is made of Acrylic and made in India . I loved the sweater . Keeps me warm .
 It 's worth for the price . It will be nice , if there is one packet .

 Very comfortable and good quality , especially for $ 16.99 . I would have paid $ 40 in the store for these .
 Pretty color and design . My son is very confortable and happy wearing it . Perfect time of delivery and service . Thanks
 Came in on time . No spots or blemishes . The quality is great . Have no complaints . Espeically my wife who wears it every Saturday night to go dancing ! Wink ! Wink !
 These pants were a great deal ! The insulation is really thick , and the material is as well . I can send my husband off nice and warm in the mornings . I also purchased 2 pair of flannel lined Carhartt work pants at the same time I got these , and these are far better , and a better bargain .
 I own a pair of these for using at the range on cold days . They keep me warm , fit well , and are durable . These are a great product .

 I have never written a review before , but wanted to after reading the reviews before I bought this costume . It seemed most people were complaining about the size ... but it fit my 18-month old daughter perfectly . She 's in the 50th percentile for height and weight , and the costume fit like a glove . It was n't tight on her arms at all -LRB- did n't even leave marks or anything -RRB- and I did n't have to cut it . It did differ slightly from the picture , but was super cute anyways . Everyone loved it on her . I googled the costume before purchasing and one of the halloween sites that had the costume had a size chart posted . I would recommend checking that out before buying , just to be sure about the size ... but it fit my daughter and she looked great.Also , it was only one piece ... so if you are planning on having your little one in the costume for any length of time , diaper changes might be difficult . Since we were only using it for trick-or-treating , it was n't an issue .
 I recived the order in a timley mannor with no problems . The price was cheaper than I had seen on other sites.The qulity was not as good as the disney store , however ; it was slightly cheaper . my 1 year old daughter looked very cute and recived many compliments . I would reccomend this product , and company .
 My daughter was just a touch petite for her age of 22 months when she wore this for Halloween last year . It fit fine , even with the addition of a white turtleneck and black tights . Not only did those help for warmth , but it looked great AND helped prevent any scratchiness from the many unfinished edges on the underside of the costume . A quality product , this is not , but it * is * very cute on , and served it 's purpose as a costume for the night . In fact , she still plays with the headband -LRB- which is also absolutely adorable as well -RRB- .
 My daughter wore this for her first Halloween , and it could not have been cuter . I got the bigger size because she is very tall for her age , and it fit just fine . She was 10 months old on Halloween . I guess the only comment I would make is that she , of course , did not want to leave the ears alone so many of our pictures did not feature the cute ears on top .
 We were so happy with the quality of this outfit . It got here speedy and in excellent shape . Can hardly wait .
 I dug this costume out the other day , and decided to write a review -LRB- despite it being 9 years later ! -RRB- . I was impressed at how well it its held up . I gave it to my friend and his wife for their daughter and it looks great on her just like it did on my daughter 9 years prior.The material is just what you would expect from a costume
 I loved this . I used it for a camp Halloween so it was warm outside . Would consider something warmer in cold weather or order size bigger for extra room under it . Sizing seems to be right on !
 This dress is just like the ad . It fit perfect and my baby girl looked so cute , I 'll remember it forever .
 Purchased for my 18mo old for Halloween and it fit good and she did n't squirm around in it . Too Cute on .
 My 16 month old wore this for Halloween this year and was adorable . The only feedback I would offer future buyers is that this product runs small . My daughter has been running small for her age in sizes but the size 12-18 month that I bought for her was really snug .
 This costume was super cute on my little girl , but the sequins kept falling off and the headband came apart . -LRB- I was able to fix it with super glue -RRB- She is 17 months old and about 23 pounds and it was a bit snug on her . If your child is any bigger I would definitely suggest the next size up . All that being said the price was great , the shipping was fast and it is an adorable costume !
 My daughter looked so cute in this costume !! The only negative was the tulle on the sleeves was a little itchy so I just put a long sleeve black shirt under and she was happy : - -RRB- Thanks !
 I wanted to get this for my daughter for her first halloween this year but I was debating for months after reading all of the mixed reviews on it . My daughter is big for her age . She 'll be 1 next week and she is already 24lbs and a little over 30 '' . Alot of people kept complaining about this costume being too small for their kid but if you check the sizing chart you 'll be able to see if it will fit your infant or not . 12-18mth says it fit up to 26lbs and 32 '' so I took a chance and ordered it and it fits her fine . When I opened it I did think it looked small but I tried it in her and it looks good and fit her perfect . If she was any bigger maybe it would n't fit . I also added a pair of black tights under the dress and it looks really cute .
 This is an adorable costume for little kids . Any little kid is sure to look adorable in this Minnie Mouse costume ! The headband is made to fit most heads . I like the sequin-y dress .
 It was the perfect costume for my granddaughter on her first halloween she looked absolutely adorable
 Fit me real good & comfortable ! Seem to be built well too . 8 more words required ... overall satisfied ! End
 Excellent product , as is specified so ... congratulations . Indeed the product is what I needed , and as well as I said look I found and sent in perfect condition
 Bought these for my husband - he loves them . Comfortable with enough give to fit the inevitable up 5 lbs , down 5lbs cycle ...
 These jeans are good quality and fit well . My husband likes them because they give him a little more room in the legs .
 This is the second pair of George Strait jeans I have purchased for my husband from Amazon . He just loves them and they fit to a tee .
 I have several different types of wranglers , and even cinch jeans.But these are the most comfortable jeans I have ever worn . They are now my favorite . I have a feeling my closet will contain nothing but these .
 Fantastic jeans , my husband is going to be very happy Christmas morning when he sees them . He is a huge George Strait fan and these are perfect .
 I bought this item for a 50s birthday party . This item was very prettyand the guality of the dress for the money was excellent . I would buyagain . It one first prize at the party .
 Wore this to school all day great fun - great way to celebrate our schools fiftieth birthday.Well made and it got to me fast .
 Under Armour is a great alternative to a T-shirt . I 'm used to wearing just my uniform for baseball and it gets all wet but the Under Armour prevents that from hapening any more .
 I love this bag , it has 2 inner pockets on for my iconia tab/nook and one for my other stuff . As well as a smaller pocket which fits my keys , cell phone and chap stick . Plus the bag is very well made out of heavy heavy canvas , I think it will last a long time . Thanks for quick shipping and a reasonable price too .

 very sexy , goes all the way up the arm . bit annoying taking em off
 I think these are a really sexy statement . I feel hot and my boyfriend says I look hot when I wear them . They are well made . And the photo does n't do them justice . Along with other acoutrements , I can feel like I am sizzlin when that ` time ' comes along . Great present and if anyone is looking for something like this , you could n't do better . The only sad thing was that they were supposed to be a surprise . My boy friend had gotten them along with several other items for my Birthday . But one item just never showed until I had to go online and make some noise . Then I saw all of the things that were supposed to surprise me . But that said , these finger gloves really lived up to the photo . They came right on time in the mail . I have had lace gloves , and they do n't last very long . These are going to last a long , long time . Good quality . Hope this helps anyone looking at them and wondering if they are just hype or as good as they look .
 This is the second time I have bought this jacket . I wore the first one out ! I am an attorney and it is becoming difficult to find tailored clothes to fit a mature woman . I plan to buy this jacket in some other colors now that I have the proper size . This is a great easy wearing piece for any professional woman young or old .
 These are very nice looking , and the cloth , ribbon-like belt is a stylish touch . It makes them look just feminine enough , but not overboard . I 've gotten compliments and had people ask me where I got them.I like their length , and I like the color , too . I would recommend these .
 I purchased these at a terrific price , however , even at full price they would have been a great buy . These are very comfortable , stylish and true to size .
 Pretty color and design . My son is very confortable and happy wearing it . Perfect time of delivery and service . Thanks
 The product is great and i havent had one since i was real young and the fact it arrived so soon made it even more awsome
 My son loves this hat ! It makes him feel like he has dreads without the actual commitment . It 's a real ice breaker and many people have come up to talk to him just because he 's wearing this hat . Great buy and my son thanks you !
 I bought these for my wife 's wonder woman costume . All the corsets seemed to be boned for smashing in her guts , but kind of smushed in her cleavage as well . These tucked in there pushed her boobs up nicely to fill out the costume .
 I have gone through brand after brand in t shirts to fine something will stand up to well water , and with these shirts I definitely found that . Almost 15 washes in and the shirts still hold up well .
 I ordered a shirt - had it sent directly to my grandson in Barrington , ILIt arrived quickly and was exactly what I ordered - good quality.A satisfied customer
 Very stylish and warm . A great buy . It was bought for a gift , and was very well received . A great buy !
 Bought this as a gift to replace the one I hmm -LRB- took over -RRB- . Seems warn and confy like the one I took over .
 Understand that these Katahdin fleece products are unisex in size . The original order was too large as I was using a women 's sizing chart so I exchanged for a size smaller . If you have long arms , this is the jacket for you ! I love that they did n't scrimp on the length of the sleeves . I bought this product as well as the Katahdin half zip fleece and it fits the same.I have it on now and am toasty .
 But I am now ! its great , great fabric , great light weight-ness , those who suggested sizing down , kudos , arrived in good time and is incredibly warm -LRB- wisconsin -RRB-
 The fleece jacket was as describe and is very warm . Reasonably priced with quick shipping . I would buy here again .
 I 've enjoyed owning the fleece so far . I took it on a week-long trip overseas , and it held up very well . I think it performs well at a much wider range of temperatures than other fleeces I have owned . Even when the temperature started to climb , I did n't feel uncomfortable as long as I rolled the sleeves up . The only negative things so far are that , as others have noted , it would be best to wash the item before your first wearing . Otherwise , it will thoroughly coat your shirt in fuzzy lint . Also , the zipper can be a bit rough at times . I 've been careful with it , but it feels like it might break or come off track if I were less careful . All things considered , though , I 'm very pleased with this item .
 This beautiful jacket was good quality , soft fleece , washes and drys well , good price , shipped in a timely manner and in excellent condition . This is not to heavy but will keep you warm and draft free indoors .
 I have n't had a new coat in 15 years -LRB- live in the desert -RRB- and this is just perfect ! It 's so soft , fits great ... great price -LRB- got it on sale -RRB- . Picked up two - one for me and one for my husband . Hope it gets cold enough to wear !
 I bought this as a present for my brother . I had been looking all over for this exact product in all the stores I went to . This was the only place I could find it in the right color and size . I was also extremely pleased with the service and the fast delivery time .
 Nice jacket but a little smaller than I thought it would be . . But should be nice to wear when it gets really COLD in S.Calif . maybe in the 50 's . . lol

 But I am now ! its great , great fabric , great light weight-ness , those who suggested sizing down , kudos , arrived in good time and is incredibly warm -LRB- wisconsin -RRB-
 The fleece jacket was as describe and is very warm . Reasonably priced with quick shipping . I would buy here again .
 I 've enjoyed owning the fleece so far . I took it on a week-long trip overseas , and it held up very well . I think it performs well at a much wider range of temperatures than other fleeces I have owned . Even when the temperature started to climb , I did n't feel uncomfortable as long as I rolled the sleeves up . The only negative things so far are that , as others have noted , it would be best to wash the item before your first wearing . Otherwise , it will thoroughly coat your shirt in fuzzy lint . Also , the zipper can be a bit rough at times . I 've been careful with it , but it feels like it might break or come off track if I were less careful . All things considered , though , I 'm very pleased with this item .
 This beautiful jacket was good quality , soft fleece , washes and drys well , good price , shipped in a timely manner and in excellent condition . This is not to heavy but will keep you warm and draft free indoors .
 I have n't had a new coat in 15 years -LRB- live in the desert -RRB- and this is just perfect ! It 's so soft , fits great ... great price -LRB- got it on sale -RRB- . Picked up two - one for me and one for my husband . Hope it gets cold enough to wear !
 I bought this as a present for my brother . I had been looking all over for this exact product in all the stores I went to . This was the only place I could find it in the right color and size . I was also extremely pleased with the service and the fast delivery time .
 Nice jacket but a little smaller than I thought it would be . . But should be nice to wear when it gets really COLD in S.Calif . maybe in the 50 's . . lol
 I got this for my grandson about 3 years ago and he loved it . It 's held up real well for all the sword practice he has given it . It 's hard enough to feel like he 's holding something worth swinging but soft enough so that he wo n't bash me into the doctor . The point and edges are really blunt , no worries about lost eyes . A fun toy and a great price-buy 2 and start an armory .
 My 9 year old grandson was happy with the sword . He likes that it snaps intothe scabbard so it wo n't fall out and has a place to put a string through tofasten to his belt loop .
 Looks great . I bought two swords for my twins . For now both of swords are broken : -RRB- Can not hold side to side move . broken on connection place with handl. : -RRB-
 I gave this to my grandson and he immediately removed the sheath and tried making the sword longer . Once he gets a belt to hold the sheath , he will hang it at his side . My grandson played with the sword for an hour , never tiring of ways to use it . Sturdy , yet light weight .
 i love this sword even my neighbors wanted it it is hard and does not break easily if you want good quality then buy this you will love it it does come with a cover it ships really fast i was so excited when i got this i love it i have had it for a month and it is still in fine condition i reccomend buying this .
 I bought this for my 4 year old grandson who 's really into Vikings right now . He has a horned helmet and now his sword to `` run off the bad guys '' . Great boys toy !
 Could n't ask for a better weapon to use in battle with my son . As Kyoshi once said , `` Parry is key , but weapon is everything . ''
 I have gone through brand after brand in t shirts to fine something will stand up to well water , and with these shirts I definitely found that . Almost 15 washes in and the shirts still hold up well .
 I am very happy with the t-shirt which is a very good quality with a great message .
 It feels very smooth and soft.Hubby looks so regal when he wears it ... I feel it is a unisex garment . He is about 5 8 '' and it almost reaches his anklesI wish it had loops for the sash to go through -LRB- though am sure Kimonos are not meant to have loops -RRB- to hold it in placeOverall , I 'd recommend this to anyone that enjoys uniqueness !
 i love this kimono . i think its beautiful . do you mind if you keep me posted on all the kimonos you people get ??
 Understand that these Katahdin fleece products are unisex in size . The original order was too large as I was using a women 's sizing chart so I exchanged for a size smaller .

 Very stylish and warm . A great buy . It was bought for a gift , and was very well received . A great buy !
 Bought this as a gift to replace the one I hmm -LRB- took over -RRB- . Seems warn and confy like the one I took over .
 This little keychain makes a perfect gift ! The quality of the leather is great , and the keychain comes in a beautiful packaged box . Outstanding workmanship , overall .
 It is a great shirt and does what it should do and that is to cloth someone . Maybe if we could create more places to make these shirts here at home we would be able to employee someone . With jobs drugs and crime go down . O have no trouble with the shirt but it is n't made in the USA
 The shirt is very thin , great under shirt . Not the best fit but it gets the job done . Works well for airsoft in the summer heat .
 I am very happy with the t-shirt which is a very good quality with a great message .

 This was the easiest way to buy jeans ! Perfect fit and fast service . Did n't have to waste gas shopping the stores .
 According to my wife , who I bought these jeans for , She says , `` These jeans are rugged and roomy . The front pockets are deep . As far as I can tell the design has not changed since I started buying these several years ago . ''
 CUMPLIO CON LAS ESPECTATIVAS PARA LA COMPRA DE ROPA POR INTERNET , LA FACILIDAD PARA LA ESCOGENCIA DELAS TALLAS Y EL MODELO .
 este producto es muy bueno diria q excelente asi que muchas gracias por todo es una buena mercancia y medida esperada
 The fit of these is so good . The waist is a true size and the seat has just enough room .
 These jeans are just as described ; a little heavier than normal but very comfortable . Delivered on time and without a problem .
 Jeans fit great . They are exactlly as advertised . ON line purchase is great for the longer lengths I need .
 I was afraid to buy the pants on-line . But I got it in my house , it fits perfectly , better than at the store . My size is very uncommon in the stores , and I often have to buy it in small sizes because they do n't usually have it in stock.Right now I will be more at Amazon.com.Recommended.You can buy with no worries .
 It is nice to get exactly what you expect . I use to purchase this product from a local retailer who no longer carries this size . Happy to find that it is still available .
 Service from Amazon was , as usual , exemplary . These are really comfortable , well-fitting , and correctly sized , which can be a problem in today 's market . Great price , also . Definitely recommend .
 the are the 4th pair of jeans I have purchased the the value is outstanding . If I ever need another pair I will be back .
 My husband has always had short legs . He wears a 29 in length . I drove all over to Walmart , Kmart , Pennys , Boscovs no one had 36w29L jeans . My daughter suggested Amazon . I found them and ordered 4 pairs . My husband has never worn Wrangler , but now he loves them , they are a perfect fit and comfortable also . I will be shopping at amazon first from now on .
 Title says it all Best jeans I 've ever owned . Even accidently washed them in hotter water then recommend with no adverse affects . rpm
 I can never find the right size of jeans for me in the store . So I decided to try buying jeans online . Got a great price and exactly the size and style I wanted . Not what some buyer decided to put on the rack at the local store . I like the classic look of this pair of jeans . They look just like the pictures . I 've owned previous Wrangler jeans before and have had good luck with their durability .
 Not as sturdy as I 'd hoped , but they do the job . The pocket that my husband keeps his wallet in has started to deform and get thinner where his wallet presses against it , but other than that they are fine . Very sturdy construction and reinforced seams are a plus .
 But after wearing them twice , they loosened up . So , I think I will but them again in the future . ok
 Hubs wanted some more of these jeans for Christmas . Since he has retired they have become his everyday pants . The fabric is soft enough to be comfortable and they fit him just right . We will be getting more of these in the future .
 Properly sized for a change . A lot of jeans these days are not properly -LRB- consistently -RRB- sized . Wrangler seems to be the exception .
 For value , IMHO this is a worth the price . I 'd read the earlier review and ordered a slightly larger fit . The pockets are quite deep and overall if it does n't shrink too much , I 'll will order more .
 I bought him these after Casual Male black Jeans fell apart at the seams . like a month later . He works he theatre doing sound . so he carries things in his pockets & it rugged . but they are comfortable they move with him if he has to bend . I would recommend this product .
 I find it strange to have Rugged Wear jeans have washing directions to use cold water and low heat in the dryer .
 These jeans a a big fitting and comfortable at the same time . I hate skinny jeans and always go for relaxed fit . These jeans are comfortable and sturdy unlike some other brand jeans . If you need a pair of jeans then look no further as Wrangler have done it again .
 Am very happy with this purchase of Wrangler Relax Fit Jeans . Very hard to find plus sizes here in Honduras , and so pleased that they are as advertised . Perfect , Thank-you .
 These are my second pair of these Wranglers . I wear these daily to work and they are very comfortable . I like the loose fitting feel to keep me comfortable during the long work day .
 I NEED A PAIR OF GOOD JEANS ANYWAY i COULD NOT FIND JEANS MY SIZE SO I TOOK A CHANCE AND WAS GLAD I DID THEY FIT GREAT
 These jeans are the best ! They fit really well , they feel very comfortable , and they are very durable . I recently bought these jeans because the Wrangler Rugged Wear jeans I had finally wore out ... After 4 years of working in the desert ! The front pockets are very roomy and the rear pockets can accommodate larger sized men 's wallets . The change pocket is much larger than I 've seen in other brands of jeans and these Wrangler 's fit `` true to size '' . There is no need to worry about getting one size larger or smaller to ensure a proper , comfortable fit . My 36x34 's fit perfectly and they have a great break in the cuff . Additionally , there is plenty of room in the seat , crotch , and the thigh areas . These jeans are a great option for those who like a looser fitting jean . They also look great and are appropriate for anything from rugged outdoor activities to casual days at the office . And compared to other `` designer '' jeans out there , you simply ca n't beat the price . I highly recommend these jeans and I 'm sure you will like them as much as I do !
 Various brands and styles of jeans fits people differently , and that 's just the plain truth about the matter . For me , I 've found that these jeans , in relaxed fit , are just what I like to wear . Matter of fact , I wo n't even look at other jeans anymore or anywhere else . I do n't know what I 'd do if Amazon quit carrying this product ... go naked I guess .
 Wranglers have always been my favourite jeans . The price here at Amazon is the best . Took a while to arrive , but the fit is perfect , they last , and are always my most comfortable pants . I 'm sometimes tempted to be trendy and try a pair of `` designer '' jeans , but then I get into my old faithful wranglers , and that thought passes ! I 'm also a 38 '' inseam , and these jeans are a TRUE 38 '' It 's great to have pants that fit correctly in the length !
 Most comfortable Jeans I 've had in a very long time . Will continue to buy wrangler items based on this experience .
 Just saw a news report about Wrangler rebuilding their Alabama manufacturing plant after it was destroyed by a tornado . Their commitment to US jobs and their employees makes me proud to buy Wrangler jeans -- way to go Wrangler !!!!
 I was looking for something to wear on my off days as All the other clothes I have are t-shirts and work-related . These fit great , look great and seems as if they will last a long time . I ca n't really complain too much as the price makes it work .
 Good fit for the extremely lean and tall guy . What 's frustrating is that I used to get the 30x34 size at WalMart for $ 15 and now have to pay double since they do n't carry them in their stores anymore !
 these are a good deal and saved me going to a store to buy them ca n't wait for summer so that I can fit into them
 These are the most comfortable longest lasting jeans I 've ever owned . I bought three pair about 4 years ago and I am still wearing them . Great Jean !
 Value and well fitting jeans . Have owned this style before wear and wash well without shrinking . I give them five stars .
 I am gaining weight . But this pair does n't make me look as though I have . Its roomy and comfortable , even if I bend over it does n't ride up my back side . Going to get other dungarees like this . Just hope it hold it size when washed .
 My husband 's job in distribution entails a lot of movement , pushing , pulling , squatting , loading , and constant walking throughout the days . He says these are the most comfortable jeans he owns . The relaxed fit makes movement easy but the jeans are n't baggy . They are true to size and extremely durable .
 best fitting pants i 've had in years - durable and comfortable - ordered multiple pairs and still waiting for last pair , but worth the wait for the price - pricing seems to vary according to order history and stock - got mine for around 23 - 24.00 per pair - on my computer they are now about 39 per pair while a pair 2 in bigger is 24 per pair -- interesting , no ?
 These are great basic jeans in hard to find sizes . My long and lanky teen is hard to fit , so we are glad these are available . They have been washed and dried repeatedly and have held up well .
 I think I might have stumbled upon a new supplier of clothes . I am BIG and TALL and have problems finding clothes at reasonable prices . Well here it is and they fit .
 I have worn Wranglers and these are no different , thank goodness . They give me plenty of room and are very durable.They feel good right out of the box , good heavyweight material .
 Love the fit and feel , very comfortable for a fat man ; pass the gravy . It 's hard to find 44 x 29 pants ; thank you wrangler .
 They fit the way a pair of jeans should . They look and feel like Levi 's -LRB- 501 & 505 -RRB- used to and wished they would again . But since Levi 's do n't I tried these . Happy . Except the rear pockets end a little too high up on the ass .
 BIG AND TALL MEN ... . I ordered these for my husband in 46x36 Black Denim ... very hard to find bigger sizes especially length , Price was excellant , jeans were excellant . Would recomend highly . Fast shipping .
 I used to wear Levi Jeans , but then decided to try a pair Wranglers since they were on sale at a very good price . They are much more comfortable than the Levi Jeans by the way they are designed to fit . Wranglers for me from now on !
 When your pants measurements are 48 '' waist with a 28 '' inseam , it gets a little hard to find cloths that fit . A whole lot of specialty `` Big & Tall '' pants for us big guys are `` custom fit '' for 48 X 28 start life with a 38 '' inseam and are then chopped by ten inches so that you feel like you 're back in the 70 's wearing some bell bottom pants again . Wrangler Jeans does not use this method with their product . They fit well both in the waist and are not too long or big in the legs . This is a great pair of Jeans and I 'll be wearing them for a long time to come . I highly recommend this product .
 HI , ALL THE BIG GUYS LOOKING FOR A PAIR OF JEANS , YOUR SEARCH ENDS HERE.I BOUGHT A PAIR OF WRANGLER MEN 'S RUGGED WEAR RELAXED FIT JEANS , ANTIQUE INDIGO BLUE.WHAT CAN I SAY JUST THAT I HAD A TERRIFIC EXPERIENCE SHOPPING FROM AMAZON.COM , THE PRODUCT WAS AS DESCRIBED AND SHIPPING WAS FAST.ALL I CAN SAY IS , SHOP WITH CONFIDENSE AT AMAZON , YOU WONT REGRET IT .
 Premium quality , great fit and look . American made . Word-up dog , diddy diddy bump bump bump meet me in the coral .
 I bought my husband one pair as a ` trial ' based on the commercials showing more `` U Fit Room '' . It is a good plus according to my husband . He has worn them so much I bought a few more and we are cycling out his old tight jeans . They seem to wash well and feel very comfy for him . He likes that he can bend , stretch , get on his motorcycle , etc without any pinching or discomfort . Price is decent too compared to alot of other brands like the Duluth Company -LRB- $ 54 ! -RRB- and Levis -LRB- 35-40 ! -RRB- .
 These jeans are all he will wear . Plus it is hard to find 29 length in some styles . Very soft material is also a plus .
 Got these for my grandson . The size is pretty hard to find ... glad I found them here on Amazon !! Good product . He 's a happy camper with my buy . Hurray for Amazon , Wrangler and Grandma !! Good buy .
 Best pair of jeans he has had so far and they were the perfect size . Can not find these many places .
 I just needed a pair of pants to do everything in and these are just the ticket . Not too tight and not too baggy .
 Love these jeans and always will . Been wearing these for over thirty years . I still wear a pair that I have had for over ten years . I highly recommend the Wrangler brand .
 Jeans fit really good , especially as hard to fit as I usually am due to being tall . Appreciate the quality and appearance .
 I 've wore wrangler for a long time and it is a quality made product . I love them . Tough and rugged
 They arrived very quickly ! And they fit perfectly ! It 's nice to be able to buy pants in the correct length ! For some reason no stores carry shorter lengths -LRB- 28 '' -RRB- . . I 'm very happy with my purchase !
 Jeans arrived in about 2 weeks to Australia . Regular postage . Good quality denim and stiching . Fit perfect for me . Solid man with large thighs . Jeans have long zip . Plenty of belt eyes . Very happy with jeans , better than levis and in my size and correct length . Never going to pay $ 100 retail australia for jeans ever again .
 Was very pleased with these Wrangler jeans . They are well made , and a perfect fit.The design is very good , and they did not shrink with washing . Thank you , Amazon !
 Rugged enough to do lawn care , but dressy enough in black to wear to a casual party . Love wearing my jeans !
 these things look very good , they feel good and they last . not to mention that the price is far lower than it is in the store . i highly recomend them .
 My son is over 6 feet tall and 300 + pounds and it is very hard to get a pair of jeans that fit him properly . Although this is a bit expensive for me as I have to get them shipped to South America , it 's worth it ! Will definitely buy more .
 I bought Levi 's for years because `` thats what I was supposed to do '' ... now that I have grown up I have realized that price does not make a good pair of jeans.I am now and exclusive Wrangler jeans person.The fit is spot on , and the price is very reasonable.The cost is below what the jeans are worth.I have bought from Amazon and from Wrangler direct.ALWAYS is the fit the same ... perfect ... and I do not feel like I paid for some execs summer island home in order to wear them.I buy Wrangler as long as they stick to their current way of thinking ... good products at a fair price .
 Great fit and comfort . My only complaint is the change pockets . I use a small cell phone that easily fits in the change pockets . The attachments no longer have rivets , and the change pockets have easily torn on all 3 pairs of these I have . Otherwise the quality is fine .
 Soy de Caracas-Venezuela y Recomiendo ampliamente a esta vendedor , Muy Buena Calidad , Putualidad en la entrega , Recomendable 100 % , Felicitaciones
 While the brick and mortar do n't typically stock 29 inch inseams I can always seem to find them on line and they fit !
 Its been a while since I purchased these jeans and they are holding up quite fine ; great fade , lots of wear left 2 yrs plus and going strong
 The jeans came in a very short time and were brand new in the package . I am very happy with this purchase !
 After going to all the stores around town I gave up and finally found what I needed , a nice pair of jeans . The right sizes , colors and reasonably priced . I bought three ! Received them faster than I thought I would .
 I bought 2 pairs of the Wrangler Rugged Wear Relaxed Fit jeans -LRB- a lighter and a darker pair -RRB- for my husband and they look fabulous on him . He usually does n't look good in relaxed fit jeans as the seat part sags and the thigh areas are too puffy . And it 's hard finding his size in stores -LRB- 40X34 -RRB- . So I was very hopeful when I saw these jeans on Amazon . I liked the cut and they looked great on the models , so I took my chances . I was not disappointed . They fit my husband beautifully and they 're well-made and durable . I 'll be buying these from now on !
 These jeans fit and are perfect for big guys . They wear like iron and last under daily use . The sizing is dead on accurate . The cut is perfect for the older ` wide body ' wearers . This is my retirement ` uniform ' and will be until I am no more . Thanks Wrangler , keep this one coming . Do n't change a thing .
 The reason I shopped for Wrangler jeans on Amazon is that it is really hard for me to find my size where I live . -LRB- Which is completely stupid because I live in a suburb of Los Angeles ! -RRB- Perhaps I am not looking hard enough but with Amazon I do n't need to spend a bunch of time looking for jeans.Knowing your size is really important if you do n't want to end up getting very familair with your post office sending something back . However as a jeans shopper you should know that already.I love Wrangler quality and consistency . I hope they continue to keep up both ! The jeans come exactly as I expect them to be and the best part is they get here super fast ! I do n't pay for expedited shipping but they still get to me in 3 days which is great!Thank you Wrangler and Amazon!Kris Orange
 I hate shopping for clothes . Finding my size even in well stocked clothing stores like Target or the Gap really frustrates me . Using Amazon 's sizing table , these Wrangler Jeans fit just fine . I also purchased a pair of nominally the same size jeans from L.L. Bean online . Overall quality of L.L. Bean exceeds that of Wrangler , but sizing -- my main complaint -- did not match Wrangler 's spot-on fit . Both pair will likely give years of service .
 I purchased several pair of these jeans for my husband for Christmas . He loves them . I received them in a timely manner too .
 I have worn these jeans forever there the only brand i buy very durable comfortable . shipped right on time .
 Well-constructed jeans of heavy , high-quality denim for less ... how can you go wrong ? Levi 's lost their cachet years ago , never mind the loss in quality . Wrangler , Carhartt and a few small companies have been making the best jeans by far for the last couple of decades . In my opinion , Wrangler is the best of them , and for those to whom it makes a difference , continues to be a strong supporter of traditional cowboy culture and values .
 Having reached an age when my middle is expanding -LRB- slightly -RRB- despite all of the exercise and dieting I can do , it was great to be able to find jeans that fit on-line . The relaxed fit is just my style.For 40 years , I 've been wearing a 34x34 ; lately , they 're just a bit tight . Very few -LRB- if any -RRB- stores carry 35 '' waist , and the 36 '' are just too big.So I was pleased to find comfortable jeans in my size . They look great , feel great , and were delivered as promised . -LRB- Extra bonus
 The fabric is nice and substantial and promises long wear . Very comfortable and great fit . I 've always loved Wrangler jeans and from now on I will look specifically for the Rugged Wear Wranglers .
 product was delivered in excellent time , jeans would sell for much more than I paid for them in a store . they are an excellent purchase and I am very satisfied with them .
 ... jean for $ 14.99 ! What 's wrong ? One leg longer?NO . They are top quality jeans at rock-bottom pricing . Man !!!! They fit perfectly and look good.I 'll buy six pairs at these prices , instead of one or two pair , every month or two when I need to replace my jeans . Amazon ... do n't stop selling these as I will keep you in business . Plus , I am getting the word out there for you !!!
 The size was perfect and the jeans was very comfortable and good looking but the two parts -LRB- the things that you put the belt in , i dont know what it is called -RRB- are two close to the bottom and they are really annoying when you put the belt on them .
 I 've worn Levi 's for 30 + years , they have always been my jean of choice , part of the reason was their fit + finish , and the other part was cultural - they are simply the brand you wear . I 'm not sure what prompted me to try these Wranglers , but I am glad I did . The denim seems heavier , the fit is comfortable and the price is right . Great jeans .
 Good quality product . The inseam is often longer than labeled and I had to return the first two pair before getting ones that were correctly marked . This same thing happened on a previous order . The legs , waist and crotch are well tailored . However , the back is cut lower and the seat is tighter than any other relaxed fit jeans I 've worn . This is probably not a very good choice if you are a candidate for the old butt-crack sight gags .
 Bought this as a gift for my husband . He loves them ; wears them all the time . I would recommend them .
 The jeans were a little more expensive than the walmart price , but Iwas able to get the size I wanted . That is important to me .
 Love the jeans and could n't be happier that I have found a source of the sizes and styles I want .
 I wear jeans almost every day to work , so I need jeans that will stand up to regular wear . These jeans definitely fit that bill . I recently noticed a hole in a pair that I had bought previously and tried to find them in my Amazon order history to order more ... it had been two years ! Jeans that last two years are always bargain.The ` antique indigo ' color is my personal favorite ; it has a look of slightly worn denim . Comparing the color of the new jeans to the old , the color stands up to wear and washing quite well.Overall , I would highly recommend the Wrangler jeans to anyone .
 Right size ; very pleased with selection and fit of jeans . Could not easily find the right size in regular stores .
 Arrived as promised . Highly recommend for anyone who is looking for Wranglers in hard to find sizes . Given as a gift .
 Wrangler jeans are the best qualityfor the price . Good , sturdy jeans .
 These jeans are truly amazing ! Both legs were almost the same length , and they have a zipper in the front which is very convenient . I read the instructions and can now put them on even in the dark . Just fantastic .
 These jeans arrived within the 8 days allotted . They are in great shape and fit perfectly . I highly recommend this site for other users .
 Well made Jeans . I own three pair of Wrangler Rugged Wear angler pants size 32 x 32 that fit me perfectly . All my other dress and casual pants are the same size . When I tried on these jeans I was unable to button them . I would recomend purchasing one size larger waist size . The length was correct .
 ME PARECE UN PRODUCTO MUY BUENO , LO RECOMIENDO . GRACIAS . ENVIO RELATIVAMENTE NORMAL . SIN PROBLEMAS . .
 These pants are great . Good price as well . I have stonewashed and black ant they fit well . Do n't have to go looking for my size .
 Product quality is good . . is according to the price paid . . recommend this product is just what I needed
 delivered fast no issues . Not a bad deal for the price ! I just needed something to wear to work on Friday dress down . I did n't want to buy designer denim untill I loose 10 more inches . LOL
 I went with 5 stars I bought them for my son because his size is difficult to find locally . I got them in a timely fashion
 I bought these jeans for my husband . They look nice and the quality is good . He says they are a little tighter in the waist than the jeans he 's been wearing . Overall , though , they are good jeans for the price paid .
 I am not a Jeans person . This is the first pair I have had since I was a kid and they fit great and they are going to be a great knock around the house , yard etc pair of slacks . Wish they came in other colors like brown .
 Good pair of jeans but stitching not upto the mark as expected from one of the world leaders in jeans mfg.
 These jeans fit extremely well . They wear well , feel good and look good ! For the price you ca n't go wrong .
 These pants are extremely comfortable and the sizing is true . I am a relatively tall person and have a tough time finding jeans in the length I need . These were perfect and arrived on time .
 The length options for these jeans goes above and beyond any store . You 're lucky to find 32 length in stores , let alone 34 's . My husband is quite tall & really likes the way these jeans fit and the length is perfect .
 My dear Husband is a little on the Big side & also tall . these jeans are available in his size - are comfortable for him - but not sloppy . The material is a substantial weight - so they are good for working in the shop or garage . The only down side is the colors - we 'd like a darker indigo - pre-washed . that 's a very small - . this is the pair of jeans we can count on to fit , and last a long time .
 Wrangler jeans are the best for me . Great fit , price and they arrived as scheduled . I would recomend to everyone .
 I like the belt rings , a lot of jeans have rings so far out the belt slides all over the place . These are nice . I 'd buy them again . They fit great and stretch in the right places to keep the boys happy : o -RRB-
 These jeans were just as advertised . They arrived earlier than forecast . Cheaper than buying the same product from the store . I am a big guy , and getting my size can be hard - big waist , short legs - and I always have to get them shortened . These were perfect out of the box , no tailoring required .
 Found these to be a great fit , they are very nicely styled , and are comfortable to wear . Love the jeans and the color .
 I have not had a pair of Wranglers for many years . Wore them when I was a kid , but somewhere along the line , switched to Levis . I have not been very satisfied with the Levis in recent years , as the material seems ` thinner ' than it once was.So , I decided to try Wranglers again and the generally lower price was an additional attraction . I have been very pleased with the Wranglers I purchased recently . The material feels like it has some substance , but not excessively heavy , the fit is good and I expect to buy Wranglers again when the need arises .
 I have worn Wranglers on and off my entire life . And retirement is no exception.They are rugged , comfortable and easily maintained .
 I am required to wear black jeans for work . My search has ended with the Wrangler Rugged Wear relaxed fit jean . The front pockets are very deep , the zipper is longer than on regular jeans and the fit is roomy . Due to the fact that I wear my jeans once then have to wash them , I ordered a 36x36 instead of my normal 35x34 because they shrink rather quickly at first . The length was long at first but after 2 washes it shrunk down to a nice length . These jeans have 7 belt loops vs the 5 on other jeans , which makes it easier for me since I have alot of stuff attached to my belt for work . I am very please with these jeans .
 Good product . It is an original product of good quality and in perfect condition , I recommend it to all users of amazon.com . thanks
 These are the jeans I wear , I usally buy them at Academy , the size I wear they only stock a few , so I bought them from Amazon , had to pay $ 6.00 more per pair , So price is the only thing bad about this Item .
 Nice jeans for a tall person . Very difficult to locate a a reasonable cost in a store jeans for tall men . Fast delivery and a nice product . We now have ordered two pair of these jeans and will order more in the future . Thank you .
 I am delighted with the purchase -- I teach at a small college and usually depend upon such black jeans to go along with dress shirts . The price , size , quality , and speed of delivery were all excellent . In short , I 'm very pleased .
 I chose a five star because Wrangler jeans are the best fitting ones . My husband likes them better than Levis . They fit better all around . The price is great , ca n't beat it . I would recommend these to anyone who likes a comfortable jean and good looking on top of that .
 I 've been wearing these jeans for the past 30 years , one pair after another . They outlast any jeans i ever wore before that and are comfortable.I do n't wear any other pants , none ... . I even got married in Wranglers , Ha !
 I am 5 7 so when I saw these jeans come in a 29 length i ordered them . They were as advertised . I really like the jeans
 I wear blue jeans every day , 365 days a year . So , I obviously wear through jeans at a pretty good pace . A few years ago , I happened across these Wrangler jeans on Amazon , and decided to give them a shot . I have not been disappointed , and they 've been by go-to jeans ever since . These jeans look like good old fashioned jeans . Nothing fancy , and certainly not like a pair of $ 400 `` designer '' jeans . They 're well made , and seem to outlast any similarly priced jeans I 've tried . The `` relaxed fit '' is exactly that - a little extra room , without being baggy or `` gangster '' looking . For a bigger guy like me , who 's carrying a few extra pounds , the relaxed fit much appreciated . Very comfortable . Given the relatively cheap price of these , I 've not found a better deal for jeans that are of this quality , or last this long . Great product for a good price .
 I love these jeans . They are simple and traditional jeans without stretchy material , weird embellishments , funky designs , or strange pockets . Just a simple pair of jeans that fit well , are comfortable , wash easily , and are durable .
 I am very surprised that Wrangler 's made this kind of jean . It look great . The price is awesome compared to others top brands . Wrangler 's is the best in my book . The measure is exactly as expected . It fit very nicely around the waist and not below the waist . The rear pockets sit high , not low that make your pants look too bagging . I have bought two already and waiting for my third set to come in . Again , it is the pants to get .
 My husband does a lot of construction work around the house and is very hard on his jeans . I purchased these pants about 6 months ago and he has been wearing them since . He is very happy with them . They have a nice fit , they are very sturdy and the color if modern . I am pleased with this product and the service . I would purchase from this seller again .
 First off , I can not see how anyone can really fault the solid quality of these jeans , nice thick material with pretty serious looking stitching.The problem I have is in the labelling of the sizes for the jeans I received . I ordered size 38x32 , and the outer paper tag on the delivered jeans did show that size . However , the stitched material label inside the jeans shows 40x30 , as did the peel-off label on the jeans.The jeans are loose on me , so I think the outer tag is wrong -LRB- and therefore I have been shipped jeans a size bigger and a little shorter than I ordered -RRB- . Luckily they kind of fit me , a bit loose really , but quite comfy . I 'm in Australia so I ca n't be bothered with the hassle of returning them anyway.UPDATE . . -------- Well , took a chance and re-ordered some more . This time they arrived labelled as expected , and fit exactly as expected . These are the most comfortable jeans I have ever worn . Guess I was unlucky and got a duff labelled pair first time , always a risk with internet shopping I guess.Anyways , ca n't see myself buying any other jeans than these . BTW , the black looks cool , almost semi-formal . I 'd agree with what someone else said about how you could just about wear them as office gear , if you 're not talking a place where you 're needing to wear a suite .
 What can I say . These are my favorite brand of jeans and these were at a good price and delivered quickly .
 I had been to all the western store trying to find jeans in 40x38 and all I could find was 40x36 . The Big & Tall shops could order 40x38 Wrangler but wanted $ 50.00 a pair . I ride a Royal Star Venture touring motorcycle and these relax jeans are perfect for long rides .
 I love these jeans , only complaint that i have is with the pockets , the jean material doesnt go deep enough down the entrance of the pocket , and the white material of the pocket is visiable . kind of gives it that `` bunny ears look '' but they are a good quality made jean !
 As a rather big guy I have problems to buy suitable clothing . But I found the WRANGLER jeans on this website and I 'm happy with it . Will buy again !
 I bought these jeans for my husband . They were a great price . The fit is wonderful and he loves them .
 I felt I received very good notification of the shipping and the jeans I order , I was very pleased with .
 We had no problems with the order , and husband does n't want to wear any of his other jeans . They 've held up nicely for a couple of years .
 I bought more than one of these items because as soon as I got the first one I saw the good quality/price ratio , which I guess is the strong aspect of these jeans . I have not found anything bad in them !
 I have been wearing Wrangler jeans my entire life . I like the relaxed fit becuase it gives your legs some breathing room without being `` baggy . '' I can always trust Wrangler Jeans to fit me the same every time and do n't need to `` try them on '' first . A top quality product that I will continue to buy the rest of my life .
 I 've been unable to get jeans locally that fit correctly for the past 2-3 years , so ordering these Wranglers directly from Amazon.com was a last resort . They fit perfectly -- at 2/3 the cost of jeans I could find in stores , and of superb quality -LRB- like the Levis from the '70s -RRB- . Excellent .
 Quite nice jeans and the perfect Size that was ordered . No alterations needed ... Very Dark Rich Black Soft 100 % Cotton Jeans . Fit well and pleasant to wear . Not scratchy or stiff as Levis . Also very good price . Close to $ 18 BELOW Big And Tall Levis Pricing . Buy em again ... why You betcha ... Wrangler from now on ... Oh by the way ... Levis Poly/Cotton Blend and Imported also ... What would John Wayne say ... Cheers -LCB- : o -RRB-
 My hubby is plus size and found the jeans to be comfortable ... after several washes the color is still true black :--RRB- highly recommended
 This is a great product and the service was excellent . From now on I know where to get my Wrangler jeans at a great price and always a great fit .
 These are truly great jeans . They fit very nice and they are really tough . I own 3 pairs .
 The jeans are fine , the packaging for shipment was fine . Amazon did publish the retail price in this instance so that I knew what sort of discount I was getting . I have seen a trend with Amazon though where the item , even new , has the retail price deleted so that if their partner vendors are charging a premium , one does n't immediately know it . I 've curtailed buying from Amazon until I 'm convinced they wo n't be doing this any more . They 're only response to the issue was to tell me to return the item to the vendor which is a cost to me-time and money-might as well go to a brick and mortar store if I 'm going to go through that inconvenience .
 This item wrangler jeans it 's really nice and very comfy for my husband he likes it and I think it 's great jeans for casual wear or even for work ! Not very expensive for a pair of jeans why pay so much for brand if we are comfy with what we think nice and looks good . Wrangler is a brand name that never disappear in this business .
 These jeans are great ! They look nice and they work well for my husband 's tall frame .
 Amazon provides the 29 inch length jeans I wears . The delivery is quick and the packaging is great . Great quality products .
 with typical wrangler durability . I would have like them to be a little bit looser than what I got .
 I live in these jeans . The deep pockets are a detail that make a quality difference in my life.Regarding sizes , jeans are cut by hand , so some slight variation in size can happen .
 Levi 's tend to dominate the jean market for no apparent reason other than hype over the name . Fortunately , there is Wrangler that provides a less expensive , quality product -LRB- no I do n't have any affiliation with Wrangler -RRB- . These jeans are comfortable and sized perfectly . My only complaint is the denim of the front pocket inserts seem a little undersized . This sometime causes the white lining to show a little when you are sitting down.And , of course , they fit properly over your boots . -LRB- Only select Levi 's fit right over boots -RRB- .
 I ordered here because they offered odd waist size -LRB- 35 -RRB- and other places did n't . Perfect fit !
 Excellent pair of jeans , bought from amazon because I am a hard to find size . Jeans are comfy , do n't shrink in the wash , and hold up well over time .
 I have worn these pants exclusively since receipt . They have been comfortable where regular fit were n't . The workmanship and materials are great .
 Bought these for my husband . He needs a 29 &#34; inseam , which is too hard to find in stores . So easy to buy online . He loves the fabric , the fit . Would definitely recommend .
 These are my fisrt pair of Wrangler 's . For 20 years I 've been wearing nothing but Levi 's Silver Tab Baggy 's but when some genious @Levi 's decided to discontinue that line , I had to look for something else . Levi 's brand is getting very poor reviews these days so I decided to check out some other brands . Wrangler 's brand has good reviews so I wanted to give it a try.Very nice quality and look . However , the jeans are tighter than the other brands , so keep that in mind when choosing size . For that reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 .
 After reading the reviews of the various jean brands I decided on the Wrangler Relaxed Fits . As usual , Amazon delivery was super - received on time and properly packaged . There had been some comments from other reviewers about size being a little small . I did not find that at all . I ordered my regular size and the fit was excellent . The jeans are comfortable in all areas and the quality seems to be good . The jeans have not been through the wash cycle yet , so I can not comment on how they 'll stand up to washing . Overall , I would rate them a very good value for the price and a very comfortable fit .
 I 've worn a number of brands over the years -- Lee , Levi 's , HOB/Harbor Bay , and Wrangler . Lee no longer makes relaxed , boot-cut jeans in 38x38 , so I went back to Wrangler . These are terrific jeans -- a little heavier denim , so they last long , and the fit is perfect . They 're just a tad snugger , but not too tight . They fit right over my harness boots ; you definitely want to order your jeans longer if you 're wearing boots and do n't want half the boot to stick out of your pants . I order jeans to wear with boots about 2 inches longer and that seems to work just right .
 The size was correct . There were no defects . Much easier than going to the store for my size . Very pleased .
 I have a number of pairs of Wrangler Jeans . They fit well wear well and Amazon has great prices and selection .
 Success with Wrangler Rugged Wear Jeans ! I have finally found jeans that fit someone my size -- 6 ' -2 '' , 275lbs . Fit even better after after a hot water wash and normal dry . Usually finding pants can be impossible with other brands in the 44W 34L size . Either the crotch measurement is too long or short or they seem oddly built . If you are my size you know exactly what I mean . I will be back when these wear out .
 THese jeans I bought for my husband and he just loves them . I get about four pairs every 6-8 months for him to wear to work for his mechanic job and they are rugged , sturdy and last a good long time when you consider all the wear and tear he puts them through . I think the average man just buying these to wear as jeans and not work pants would not only be satisfied with the quality but also what a value they are in that they last so long . Cowboys have always worn Wranglers and for a good reason-they can take anything you dish out!THe relaxed fit is good for men who have muscular legs since they are a bit more generous in the thigh area but not so much that they make the guys bottom look baggy .
 These are great jeans . 5 pocket , very comfortable , 9 belt loops keeps belt on jeans not on your tummy , wears well and holds up well .
 These jeans are so durable , heavyweight yet very comfortable . I know they will last a long time . My husband wants another pair !
 I bought these jeans as a X'mas gift for a relative , and it was exactly what he expected . Nice fit and durability were the main factors in our brand choice . Seller and process was swift . Will buy again .
 I caught these on sale and it was a great deal , Wrangler is about the only jean I will wear now . Every pair I have ever owned have held up well and lasted quite awhile . Recommended .
 These were a Christmas gift for our son . He really liked them a lot . They fit very well . Will buy again .
 The length and waste is perfect , it is just a little wide but it was my choice the relaxed fit , the cloth is very good and also finishing .
 Placing the order was easy , the price was convenient , the delivery was exactly inside the delay mentionned when I placed the order . Who could ask for more .
 Jeans are as described , fit is good , color is good . All around a good experience . Amazon provided quality service on this order
 Excellent , durable and very comfortable jeans and reasonably priced . I shall use this brand exclusively from now on.Nothing more needs to be said
 I 've been wearing Wrangler since I was a teenager . Their comfort , style and durability are just as good as those `` fancy '' jeans I see people going into big name store 's and paying $ 100 or more for ... jeans . What ???? Come on people ... it 's blue jeans ! Blue jeans never go out of style , but the price of blue jeans costing $ 100 or more should go out of style .
 These are my favorite work jeans . They are the most comfortable jeans during a long work day . I have trouble finding these particular style in stores , so I will order them on here from now on . They last quite a while , and do n't develop wear spots in the typical areas . Great jeans at a great price .
 They fit well . The quality of the material is superb . I like them so much that I purchased a second pair .
 These pants look good on my husband . He prefers boot cut , he says , but he did n't notice they were just a relaxed fit and likes them as well .
 Black Wrangler men 's jeans just look good , feel good , and last for a very very long time . I 'm a pretty large `` fatty '' from WAY BACK !!! My waste is 54 '' . I weigh over 300 lbs . I have a very active hard on clothing job with UPS . These jeans are the ONLY long pants I wear at work . They are comfortable and have proven themselves durable for a VERY LONG time . I really love them .
 What else would you expect from Wrangler ? Jeans are of a high quality and a perfect fit .
 Nice color , nice feel . Size and length accurate . They are very generous as regards relaxed fit ... almost wish they were a little tighter but no big deal . Very comfortable , plenty of belt loops , deep pockets . Excellent jeans.Seller was quick to ship . Will get more ... although a smaller size .
 I bought these for my husband . He asked specifically for them and is very happy with them . They fit perfectly and are a good price .
 Awesome fit ! They 've very durable ! I have already put them to good use and they 're holding up great . A little bit heavy to wear for casual use , but if you work or plan on getting dirty , these Jeans can stand up to the job !
 These jeans are a very good fit . As all of Wrangler jeans , they look good and wear very well . The only thing to be aware of is the depth of the pockets makes it a little difficult to find and remove an object , especially if you are sitting down .
 Love these jeans . They are cheap , yet durable and very comfortable . Would recommend to anyone : -RRB-
 I purchased therse jeans primarily for work . But these jeans are fine for casual wear . Wrangler Rugged Wear is no joke ... They really are .
 Wrangler makes a great pair of somewhat loose fitting rugged , durable jeans for any guy who wants a slightly more relaxed look to their work -LRB- or play -RRB- jeans . Moreover , these jeans are a good choice for people like me who are slightly overweight . They really do give you extra room in the thigh and the seat ; and that 's great!The denim is nice and thick ; and these jeans are extremely durable . The excellent stitching helps make this possible . In fact , these jeans can last for years at a time without any fraying -- even at the bottoms of the legs . They are made from cotton and they are permanent press . However , I would wash these jeans with similar colors to avoid any color dye bleeding onto white garments in the wash or dryer cycle . They say that you should tumble dry these on low ; but I use the permanent press settings on my dryer and that seems to work fine without any problems . They come in five colors , too . Black jeans are even possible in an office where you do n't have to dress too fancy but yet blue jeans just wo n't be allowed , either.Overall , these fine jeans by Wrangler easily rival any jeans made by other manufacturers . Make sure you choose the right size and color for you if you 're using the pricing and availability chart above on this webpage . If you want a pair of loose fitting yet rugged , durable jeans , this may be just what you 're looking for . I doubt that you 'll be disappointed .
 I used to buy Levi 's 550 relaxed fit jeans because they were an American company , but now they are no longer made in America . These Wrangler Rugged Wear jeans are similar fitting and looking as the Levi 's 550 jeans and about half the price , and seem to be a better fabric than Levi 's .
 One reviewer is doing a VERY GREAT disservice to purchasers of this brand of Jeans . I followed his claim that the waist size is 2 inches off and his recommendation that everyone select a size 2 inches larger . I followed his advice , and I now have a pair of jeans that not only do not fit properally , but are in fact 2 1/2 to 3 inches too big !!! Ignore the `` buy oversize '' claim and buy what your tape measure suggests . Just think , if I loose 10 pounds , my pants will then be 2 entire sizes TOO BIG !
 If you 're like me , a bit on the tall side -LRB- 6 ' 9 '' -RRB- and not skinny -LRB- 320 pounds -RRB- , a 44x38 straight is wearable , but not comfortable . Now , for the first time in years , I can be comfortable while standing , sitting , stooping , squatting , walking , etc. . I wish I had discovered Wrangler Relaxed Fit jeans years ago!Buy a pair or six . They 're not expensive .
 I purchased 3 of these jeans , that were sent to someone . They had the free shipping over $ 25 but he would n't of been living where he was so I had to take the overnight ship which worked out great . He said they fit him perfectly and were extremely comfortable and wash well . Wrangler is a company that has been around forever and I can remember as a child going to the Army and Navy store to buy these jeans . I had originally purchased Lee 's for him because that is what he has always bought but Amazon had problems with the vendor and the stock they had depleted so I went with what I knew and great for the price . He was also very happy they went over his work boots with no problem .
 The wrangler jeans I purchased fit well and was just what I hoped they would be.I take a large size so I was very happy with the selection I made .
 I bought two pair of these jeans for my husband , two different shades and wish they had other shades in his size , particularly his length . Was thrilled to find what I did and with Prime shipping to boot.One pair has been worn , washed , worn again . Second pair is in hamper to be washed for first time . Having been scared off by some reviews here , I did n't dare to put the first pair in the dryer , so they were cold water washed and rinsed and then hung up on bathroom shower rod to dry . Furthermore I used one of those straight plastic hangers -LRB- from something or other we bought -RRB- with the clampy deals on either end , hooked the back waist band to that and hung the jeans from that , which I think helped create a bit more air flow , at least in the waist/seat area . In fact my husband wore them the next day and said they were very very slightly damp some in the legs but not enough to matter . He also said they still felt fine as far as the fit . To play it safe I guess I 'll continue to cold wash and air dry.Rivets , belt loops , all appear intact and well sewn , etc , no problems there . I looked all over them , tugged on the loops , do n't think they are going to pull off anytime soon if ever.Checked the pair in the hamper , and the tag inside says they were sewn in Mexico from US fabric .
 Good quality product , but as more than three times the price . These jeans in a 42x32 can be bought at target for $ 16 , but are only available in sizes up to 44 &#34; waist . I required a 46x32 . The shipping was a bit slow but the product was as advertised . The 4 stars is because the wrangler jeans are well made .
 Quite helpful for my dear husband 's field work . He did n't plow or harvest , but his inspection job did require him to go to some unusual places . He needed this rugged garment .
 It is always a chore to order pants as most companies do n't have a standard size and one maker you 'll need a larger size or longer length . These fix perfectly and are very comfortable .
 Heavy weight material like jeans used to be . Love them !! perfect fit . This is my third time buying them and I usuallybuy three pairs at a time . I live in these pants .
 Nothing wrong with the jeans . I do not think they would do any good to stop an uncomfortable alien probing , but they will work for my terrestrial needs .
 These jeans fit great and they 're very comfortable . Loose fit so you 're not squeezed into them and they do n't ride down your waist .
 I bought these for my son for Christmas -LRB- at his . request -RRB- . He says they are the most comfortable jean he has ever worn . Thanks !
 Great fit and wear so far on these jeans ! Coud n't beat the discount price ! Wrangler still makes a decent jean !
 Very stylish and warm . A great buy . It was bought for a gift , and was very well received . A great buy !
 Bought this as a gift to replace the one I hmm -LRB- took over -RRB- . Seems warn and confy like the one I took over .
 Understand that these Katahdin fleece products are unisex in size . The original order was too large as I was using a women 's sizing chart so I exchanged for a size smaller . If you have long arms , this is the jacket for you ! I love that they did n't scrimp on the length of the sleeves . I bought this product as well as the Katahdin half zip fleece and it fits the same.I have it on now and am toasty .
 But I am now ! its great , great fabric , great light weight-ness , those who suggested sizing down , kudos , arrived in good time and is incredibly warm -LRB- wisconsin -RRB-
 The fleece jacket was as describe and is very warm . Reasonably priced with quick shipping . I would buy here again .
 I 've enjoyed owning the fleece so far . I took it on a week-long trip overseas , and it held up very well . I think it performs well at a much wider range of temperatures than other fleeces I have owned . Even when the temperature started to climb , I did n't feel uncomfortable as long as I rolled the sleeves up . The only negative things so far are that , as others have noted , it would be best to wash the item before your first wearing . Otherwise , it will thoroughly coat your shirt in fuzzy lint . Also , the zipper can be a bit rough at times . I 've been careful with it , but it feels like it might break or come off track if I were less careful . All things considered , though , I 'm very pleased with this item .
 This beautiful jacket was good quality , soft fleece , washes and drys well , good price , shipped in a timely manner and in excellent condition . This is not to heavy but will keep you warm and draft free indoors .
 I have n't had a new coat in 15 years -LRB- live in the desert -RRB- and this is just perfect ! It 's so soft , fits great ... great price -LRB- got it on sale -RRB- . Picked up two - one for me and one for my husband . Hope it gets cold enough to wear !
 I bought this as a present for my brother . I had been looking all over for this exact product in all the stores I went to . This was the only place I could find it in the right color and size . I was also extremely pleased with the service and the fast delivery time .
 Nice jacket but a little smaller than I thought it would be . . But should be nice to wear when it gets really COLD in S.Calif . maybe in the 50 's . . lol
 I had some compression shirts from about 5 years ago . These new ones are not the same fabric quality as they used to be , fabric is lighter and less stretchy . Despite they fit perfectly and work fine , I 'm worried about the durabilty of the shirt .
 I have taken several rain . And I have not even a little wet . Others vehicles can see me clearly day or night . You have him a little care . I am very happy with it .
 This is a very good rain suit . It is so bright , you need sunglasses . I ca n't wait to it rains and I put on the suit and I start to glow . The kids at the school loves it .
 The overalls broke , they had no give in the crotch , so getting on to my motorcycle was a challenge , and is what tore the inseam.The jacket is great though !! It totally cuts out the wind and rain , and the visibility is optimal . The quality of the jacket is a little better then I anticipated . It wont stand up to abuse , but if you get the right size , where its a little baggy on you , it should hold up fine . Just dont try to test it 's limits in that way .
 This raing suit not only keeps you working dry but it also allows you to be safely seen while working in and around unsafe conditions .
 I bought these for my job and short term wonderful , they do their job and lightweight which is what I wanted -LRB- 1st mistake -RRB- , they keep me dry and are n't uncomfortable ... . now if you do any real work in them that 's where there are issues . If you barely snag them on anything they rip . . but still I wanted lightweight so I got exactly what I asked for . . use these if you are just walking around in the rain , not working in the rain ...
 I used this for Project Safe Way team that stand on corners monitoring kids as they walk to and from school . This suit aloud them to be very visible in rainy conditions . A must have for safety .
 Very stylish and warm . A great buy . It was bought for a gift , and was very well received . A great buy !
 Bought this as a gift to replace the one I hmm -LRB- took over -RRB- . Seems warn and confy like the one I took over .
 Understand that these Katahdin fleece products are unisex in size . The original order was too large as I was using a women 's sizing chart so I exchanged for a size smaller . If you have long arms , this is the jacket for you ! I love that they did n't scrimp on the length of the sleeves . I bought this product as well as the Katahdin half zip fleece and it fits the same.I have it on now and am toasty .
 But I am now ! its great , great fabric , great light weight-ness , those who suggested sizing down , kudos , arrived in good time and is incredibly warm -LRB- wisconsin -RRB-
 The fleece jacket was as describe and is very warm . Reasonably priced with quick shipping . I would buy here again .
 I 've enjoyed owning the fleece so far . I took it on a week-long trip overseas , and it held up very well . I think it performs well at a much wider range of temperatures than other fleeces I have owned . Even when the temperature started to climb , I did n't feel uncomfortable as long as I rolled the sleeves up . The only negative things so far are that , as others have noted , it would be best to wash the item before your first wearing . Otherwise , it will thoroughly coat your shirt in fuzzy lint . Also , the zipper can be a bit rough at times . I 've been careful with it , but it feels like it might break or come off track if I were less careful . All things considered , though , I 'm very pleased with this item .
 This beautiful jacket was good quality , soft fleece , washes and drys well , good price , shipped in a timely manner and in excellent condition . This is not to heavy but will keep you warm and draft free indoors .
 I have n't had a new coat in 15 years -LRB- live in the desert -RRB- and this is just perfect ! It 's so soft , fits great ... great price -LRB- got it on sale -RRB- . Picked up two - one for me and one for my husband . Hope it gets cold enough to wear !
 I bought this as a present for my brother . I had been looking all over for this exact product in all the stores I went to . This was the only place I could find it in the right color and size . I was also extremely pleased with the service and the fast delivery time .
 Nice jacket but a little smaller than I thought it would be . . But should be nice to wear when it gets really COLD in S.Calif . maybe in the 50 's . . lol

 you must get this looks amazing on you can wear any color cami under it.great dress up or dress with jeans
 This top is cute , and a reasonable price . I thought it was very true to size -LRB- it says in the listing juniors ! -RRB- I am usually a M-L in women 's and a 1X fit me perfectly . I did not have any issues with the quality and for a lace top I think it 's pretty durable !
 It fits very well . The buttons on it are all still intact and the overall feel and look is absolutely stunning . I love it !
 The product was exactly as advertised and it looks great . And for this price , it ca n't be beat . I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to look sexy , and sophosticated for a without hurting your pockets .
 I 'm so glad I got this blouse , based on other reviews . I wear a flesh-colored undershirt , and wear with a belt and skirt . It is very dressy , and the adorable rhinestone buttons look glam .
 this is a beautiful shirt . I love the lace and the cut of the shirt . and it was a great price .
 So sexy ! It really shows off curves well . It is almost to loose in the boob area for me -LRB- I 'm a 32 B and ordered a size small -RRB- . If your smaller then a 32B I would not recommend this top because it probably would n't fit right ... Another thing to be aware of is that it says to hand wash it but I just put it on the delicate cycle and it was fine . I love it and I highly recommend getting it !
 I paired this top with a bright colored cami underneath for a very flattering look ! I received compliments all day long !
 Luv it , Luv it , LUVVV it !!! Sooooooooo SEXYYY ;--RRB- True to size although I am a 4x but I myself prefer a somewhat looser fit.The length is Perfect & the rhinestone buttons are Lovely !!! I am very very HAPPY with this BEAUTIFUL Blouse !!! I have n't sported it yet but anxious to wear it when the weather gets a lil warmer ; - -RRB- Muy Muy Sexxxy !!! Ay Ay Ay Mama Mia ...

 I received this black , lacy top as a gift from a Live and Grind fan who selected it for me as a present from my wishlist . I love it , it feels VERY good to wear as the inside of the top does n't have a scratchy feeling as some lace shirts I 've owned in years past sometimes did . Even the outside feels relatively soft and smooth . The material is of a very good quality and does not appear that it will snag easily or cling to surfaces or unravel or anything . I would highly recommend this to people who love lace but do n't want the discomfort of low quality lace against their skin . Highly recommended !
 Ver pretty ! Be careful when washing as it is delicate . Worth every penny though . I am 5ft tall . 110 lbs and a triple D . So I ordered a large to accomodate bust size . I like the fit , not to baggy and not to tight . If you want a snug fit order a medium . You will look smoking hot in this blouse and feel beautiful !
 Totally LOVE this top - obviously you wear a tank underneath but , it is unbelieveably cute - everyone comments on it . You 'll be thrilled to have this in your wardrobe .
 I wore this top over a jersey knit black dress for an informal night out on the town , and it looked very flattering . I thought the quality of the lace was very good for the price , as it was soft , not scratchy . It also had just a little give , so it fit very nicely over my dress without bunching . It it a snug but not tight fit , which is what I expected . If you want a semi-fitted or loose fit , consider ordering one size up . First purchase from this brand and will consider buying other pieces .
 When I ordered the top It was a perfect fit . I love it just put a low cut tank top underneath and it 's perfect , goes great with a high wasted pencil skirt !
 One of my all time favorite tops . Goes with anything ! I would definately recommend this shirt for most any occasion !
 This blousse makes me feel sexy . I wore it with jeans and thought it was perfect . I felt very comfortable wearing it . I personaly wore a tan/skin color tank under so it may look like Im wearing `` nothing '' under -LRB- lol -RRB- . The price was great too .
 When I saw it on Amazon I fell in love with it ... When it came in the mail , I hated it ... When I tried it on , I fell in love all over again ... I too thought that there was a satin lining to this shirt and was part of the reason I fell in love with it so I was very quick to add it to my cart . The item arrived quickly and when I pulled it out of the package I was so greatly disapointed that there was no lining and I was positive that I would never wear it and thought about returning it . Finally , I just tried it on and I happen to have a little white/lace trim cami to go with it and I love it ! Its very flattering and would look amazing with a skirt , slacks or even just a pair of jeans . Great addition to a wardrobe .
 Love the blouse , it is very feminine ! Great fit and comfortable . Took me a little creative thinking on how to wear it since it is lace ! But I found the perfect under-shirt and I 'm going to be wearing it out for my Birthday Night !
 I found this top to be very nice and a good fit . . very versatile ! It is lace so it needs to be treated with care for sure ... I had no issues with buttons at all ... I wear a large and the large was true to size !
 I love the versatility of this top . It is great for going out -LRB- the buttons add a fabulous detail -RRB- but can also be dressed up and made work-appropriate . Great price too !
 I really love it . When I first bought this lace top I did n't have an idea how to use it , because it is transparent , but I tried a white , green and red tang tops under , and it is so great , it makes you look fancy and makes your body shape look better . I am so glad I bought this item .
 This top is sexy , you will need a tank top underneath to wear it out in public .

 Very stylish and warm . A great buy . It was bought for a gift , and was very well received . A great buy !
 Bought this as a gift to replace the one I hmm -LRB- took over -RRB- . Seems warn and confy like the one I took over .
 It 's underwear . For the price , its a value and the fit is fine . Do n't see a need to spend big dollars on a pair that gets stained .
 I purchased about 20 pair and have used them for over a year . They are comfortable , medium thickness , and wear out normally .
 While it 's unfortunate the only color available for these was white , because frankly , it 's not a charming look . However , somethings do require function over fashion . These being such the case.Buy your normal size in these . Do n't go by the indications they give . Many of the reviewers commented that the sizing was off . Part of that problem is since these are 100 % cotton , they look positively ginormous when you take them out of the package . After washing a medium is a normal medium.The two benefits that make it worth the ` little boy whities ' look are the longer than normal leg which is great for tall guys like my man . And the extra support which is great for those with juevos grandes , like my man .
 Have worn this item for years and have n't been able to find them in local stores . Great quality and price .
 I always like this product , but for me it has one problem with the sizing , in other products large size it between 36-38 , I thought is the right one . also I recommended . the Price is Good .
 Fruit of The Loom always have great products . These boxer briefs are no exception . They fit perfect and feel great . Price from Amazon was also great .
 They fit , they 're simple , they 're comfortable , and they 're not unreasonably priced for the size.I 've worn Fruit of the Loom since I came out of diapers . I 'll never wear anything else .
 The briefs was received as I expected and were in outstanding condition.the price was very reasonable and was received on time .
 Bought these for my husband to try out . He loves them . I know , not much help review wise , sorry . Just know , they are soft and supportive .
 I got exactly what I was waiting for . Excelent quality and the price is a half 's same product sold in my country 's stores.I think I discovered my underwear store .
 My husband loves these and has worn them for a long time . However , they are hard to find locally so we were happy to find them through Amazon . The elastic waist band is comfortable which is important to one who has had several back surgeries and they do not &#34; ride up &#34; .
 Husband is a nurse cant find white briefs in the stores not if i want other colors . I didnt have to buy 4 packs to get 4 pairs !!
 I bought these as a gift for my son and he really likes the longer length of them on his leg .
 For best fit and comfort you ca n't beat this brand , I 've had other brands and none of them even comes close . These are the only ones that holds the elasticity at the thighs , I wo n't buy anything else .
 very comfortable . soft and plenty of &#34; room &#34; will most likely buy more in the future . I would recomment them to anyone .
 Likes this type of underwear and he especially likes these because they have a slightly longer leg than his old ones .
 I have no idea why white underwear has become so difficult to find ? This is the only game in town . I am loyal to boxer-briefs , so in I went . Great quality .
 I am so glad I could fine white i have been looking in all the stores around me and they dont sell white . I have been buying this type of underwear since they strated putting them out . Keep white in stock .
 Great material , soft , comfortable . Briefs that at last are large enough , For those who do n't like the new body-thight fashion .
 I 've been wanting to purchase these for years and I finally saw them available on Amazon . I live in Singapore and I was glad to see they shipped here as I really wanted theseThese boxers are just what I needed . I 'm 24 years old and I ordered the 34 inch size . These are perfect for me . I like to long legs and feel really comfortable under my Levi baggy jeans . I like to sag a little to show the waist band in jeans and these are cool for show . They also attracted attention from my friends that I sag out with . They also do n't go up my butt and the fabric is great . I order three packs of these and I 'm now converted to these from my CK boxers I was wearing before . They also hold my jewels and package well and are really comfortable . Some say the fabric is a little thin - I really like the fabric actually - nice.My girlfriend also likes them , so , I guess they are okay and sexy . These FTL boxers are well worth the money . Buy these - you wo n't be dissapointed . They hold your jewels and package well , are really sexy , attract attention and are cool to wear . You just need to watch the sizing as you may wish to order a size smaller than you usually wear . Great product and well done FTL .
 My husband reports that they are comfortable and long wearing . Longer leg than most others on the market which is more comfortable and looks better .
 My husband just loves these briefs . He switched over from jockeys and just loves the comfort !!
 The person I purchased this item for is extremely happy with my purchase and loves the fit . This product is very comfortable also.Sally Molock
 This boxers are very good , my husband always wear them and they look good and are easy to wash . They last a long time also .
 These are not the most fashionable boxer briefs I own ; they are more like average in terms of fit and quality . But considering the price , they are a great buy . However , I usually look for briefs that do not get a lot bigger as I wear them -LRB- I like them to stay tight around my legs throughout the day , for instance -RRB- and these fail in this respect . They do not get all soft and double-sized , as some briefs tend to do , but they also do not stay the way they are when I put them on . So in this sense , they are a bit of a disappointment . And they tend to get a little `` harder '' in the fabric over time as they are washed repeatedly . But again , for this price -LRB- basically a 4-pack for the price of a normal 1-pack of a higher-quality brand -RRB- I certainly can not complain . These are great spare underwear .
 I had been looking for affordable men 's briefs for my husband for months . These are good quality and a great price . My husband is happy with them . He loves the longer legs .
 Great Quality and great price product . These last forever , or until you have enough holes in them you really have to throw them away ...
 They fit my husband well . You cant wear them out ! They are comfortable soft and durable . He strongly recommends these
 Does what underwaer is supposed to do . It covers your junk and keeps your naughty bits from flying around in your pants .
 I 've been wearing these non-elastic-top socks for decades , and they are the only really comfortable socks I 've found , and I 've tried many . Somehow they stay in place without making groves on your leg . My only minor complaint is that they do n't come in many colors , but I 'm still totally sold on them for a dress sock .
 Gold Toe is probably my favourite brand of sock . They 're comfortabcotton , with no elastic , and they last . I highly recommend them .
 It is very hard to find nice white socks , they are all the workout short type . They fit him great and he said they were very soft - I probably should have ordered more .

 I bought this , but because I was unsure of whether or not it would be good , I also took along my iron . I must say that I did n't use the iron once . It actually worked . Of course , when I say `` worked '' I mean it was very good for being on vacation . I would n't consider it working if I were at home . -LRB- my standards would be higher -RRB- But then again , that 's not what it 's for
 This stuff is so cool , it actually works ! I received it as a gift from a friend ... I 'm going to Europe where I was n't sure there would be an iron in the hotel room . I tried it on a pair of 100 % linen capris , and it works like a charm . You just smooth the wrinkles with your hands . Smells nice , too , and with the 3 oz size , it should not be a problem -LRB- I hope -RRB- to take the aerosol on the plane .
 We just returned from a 23 day trip around the world , focusing on China and Korea . I bought this at a luggage store and was n't sure if it would work well or not . I loved it ! I ironed maybe one or two times just because there was an iron set up already , but other than that , we would pull clothes out , spray it on and follow the directions . I am searching it now to buy more since we travel quite a bit . Definitely a great product !
 This is the best quick wrinkle remover I 've found . I found it years ago , then it `` disappeared '' from the stores . It dries quick and it really works ! I 'm so glad I found it again !
 Wrinkle Free is great for travel , and I always keep some on hand when I 'm at home for those times when I do n't want to pull out the iron . It 's quick and has n't ever spotted any fabric . A truly useful and wonderful product .
 I was a little skeptical purchasing this , but it truly is the best spray for relaxing wrinkles . I always take when I travel . And I sometimes use at home ! You will not be disappointed . It smooths out some of the toughest wrinkles .
 This is a great fanny pack - I like being able to put it around the waist so you do n't have it hanging off your back , and if you slide it around the front , everything you need is hanging right in front of you . There is enough space to hold the basic for quick access , and good pockets/zippers to divide supplies .
 Prompt service to ship it out and looks great on the person I got it for . Absoletly stunning .
 I like this tie , goes well with my tuxedo which I have as yet to wear , but it seems to be well made . Now I have both a red and black tie ...

 I had some compression shirts from about 5 years ago . These new ones are not the same fabric quality as they used to be , fabric is lighter and less stretchy . Despite they fit perfectly and work fine , I 'm worried about the durabilty of the shirt .
 They run true to size , so I went with the large . They 're a little small , but I still can hardly tell I am wearing them . Very soft , very comfy .
 Very stylish and warm . A great buy . It was bought for a gift , and was very well received . A great buy !
 Bought this as a gift to replace the one I hmm -LRB- took over -RRB- . Seems warn and confy like the one I took over .
 Understand that these Katahdin fleece products are unisex in size . The original order was too large as I was using a women 's sizing chart so I exchanged for a size smaller . If you have long arms , this is the jacket for you ! I love that they did n't scrimp on the length of the sleeves . I bought this product as well as the Katahdin half zip fleece and it fits the same.I have it on now and am toasty .
 But I am now ! its great , great fabric , great light weight-ness , those who suggested sizing down , kudos , arrived in good time and is incredibly warm -LRB- wisconsin -RRB-
 The fleece jacket was as describe and is very warm . Reasonably priced with quick shipping . I would buy here again .
 I 've enjoyed owning the fleece so far . I took it on a week-long trip overseas , and it held up very well . I think it performs well at a much wider range of temperatures than other fleeces I have owned . Even when the temperature started to climb , I did n't feel uncomfortable as long as I rolled the sleeves up . The only negative things so far are that , as others have noted , it would be best to wash the item before your first wearing . Otherwise , it will thoroughly coat your shirt in fuzzy lint . Also , the zipper can be a bit rough at times . I 've been careful with it , but it feels like it might break or come off track if I were less careful . All things considered , though , I 'm very pleased with this item .
 This beautiful jacket was good quality , soft fleece , washes and drys well , good price , shipped in a timely manner and in excellent condition . This is not to heavy but will keep you warm and draft free indoors .
 I have n't had a new coat in 15 years -LRB- live in the desert -RRB- and this is just perfect ! It 's so soft , fits great ... great price -LRB- got it on sale -RRB- . Picked up two - one for me and one for my husband . Hope it gets cold enough to wear !
 I bought this as a present for my brother . I had been looking all over for this exact product in all the stores I went to . This was the only place I could find it in the right color and size . I was also extremely pleased with the service and the fast delivery time .
 Nice jacket but a little smaller than I thought it would be . . But should be nice to wear when it gets really COLD in S.Calif . maybe in the 50 's . . lol

 I ordered the Marmot guide jacket to take the place of my old faithful down vest that was missing half it 's feathers . Yeah , I know it 's summer , but having a warm layer in the Northern Rockies ' cold summer nights is a necessary thing , besides you can always use it as a pillow when you 're backpacking.I was thrilled when I got this jacket . I had also ordered the Marmot Ama Dablam down coat , and another Mountain Hardware coat at the same time so I 'd have a choice , but I 'll be returning the other two . All were on sale , but the Guide jacket was the least expensive . Right away , I noticed how much thicker it seemed than the other two , and the green color was even prettier than in the web photo.It fits very well for being quite thick , and I can still get a rain layer on over it if the weather turns really bad . It seems to run true to size without being too bulky . I 'm 5 ' 8 , 135 pounds . The length was about right , and the sleeves fit , which is often a problem for me as my arms are on the long side . I do wish it had a hood , but that would add extra weight and bulk . It also has an inside pocket which the jacket is supposed to tuck into , but the jacket is a little large for it , and I felt I was on the verge of damaging the pocket by cramming the coat in it.I really felt I scored . I would expect to pay twice the price in the fall for such a warm , functional and attractive jacket .
 pull the adjuster tight and you 've got some serious cleavage . leave it loose and you 've still got great support and shape . The padding is a little thick but that 's not all bad . The fabric does n't breathe very well so I 'd just use this for going out and not all day wear .
 This is a high quality t-shirt , great fit , and nice graphics . The sleeve has a Glock logo on it as well , a nice touch . The seller shipped this item right away , and I received it two days later . I would recommend purchasing to anyone looking for a Glock t-shirt .
 Being a collector of Glock firearms , I was looking for a casual tee shirt to wear around my shop or the range . The quality of the material , printing and comfort is more than anyone can expect for the money . I have tried to find other items better than this and have been unable to do so . Enjoy , I do !
 This is a nice thick cotton fabric , not thin by any means . The writing on the t-shirt was a silvery gray , not white like I thought . I think it makes the shirt look much nicer . Also , there was the word Glock printed simply down the left sleeve , which the picture either did n't show , or I did n't notice , but there again , it makes the shirt look much nicer . My fiance ' was very happy with it .
 I do like the shirt . However , be aware that the Glock graphic is only on the left front chest and sleeve . There is nothing on the back of the shirt .
 Purchase this shirt for my nephew has a Christmas present . He indicated he liked the smaller logo Glock Logo versus the whole body logo .
 Great fit , good quality 100 % cotton and has held up well for at least 10 washing so far . I recommend purchase .
 this feels like a well made shirt and it fits comfortable . usually shirts run short on me since i have a longer torso . this is plenty long , so when the shirt arrived and i tried it on , i bought another .
 Shirt is very heavy and durable . Will have to wait to see how quickly it fades from washings ? I will purchase more .
 I bought this shirt for my husband and he loves it cause it is just so manly and it is very simple .
 the one review on this wallet made before mine said that they had this wallet for 4 years and bought a new one just like it to replace their old one . i just got mine delivered today through fedex , and i have to say that i agree with his statement . in other words , i would LOVE the chance to buy another wallet just like this one next time i need one . it is beautiful and well made . bosca makes VERY nice wallets . tumi is another great company . also , i paid $ 62.00 which is great because the list price is $ 95.00 !!! wallets are one of those items that is hard to shop for online , but i am very pleased with my purchase ...
 very thin for the amount of cards it holds and stands up very well to the test of time . my last one lasted about 4 years and I bought the exact same one to replace it .
 pull the adjuster tight and you 've got some serious cleavage . leave it loose and you 've still got great support and shape . The padding is a little thick but that 's not all bad . The fabric does n't breathe very well so I 'd just use this for going out and not all day wear .
 I love these ! They cover so well and you ca n't see them when your clothes are on - even in tight t-shirts ! They stick to you and stay in place after your body heat has warmed them up a bit . But you really will forget they 're on . I 'm usually surprised at night when I take my bra off because I forget they 're there . I 'm buying a second pair to wear while I 'm washing the other ones -LRB- they are reusable -RRB- . These are great !
 These are real embarrassment savers when wanting to wear skin tight clothing . An absolute must have that is worth every penny and then some .
 These are wonderful ! They really work , under all kinds of fabrics . Without bra discs , when I wore any of those moisture-wicking athletic shirts -- even with an industrial-strength sports bra underneath -- my chest always looked like I was outside an Antarctic research station , without a coat , if you know what I mean . I tried other nipple-hiding solutions before , but these are the best . I love that I can wear them with my regular bra -LRB- being a 32 DDD , I hate wearing padded `` T-shirt '' bras -- the last thing I need is more padding -RRB- . Adhesive breast petals are OK , but not enough under some fabrics , and most of them are n't reusable . Adhesive silicone covers have all been too thick at the edges and just made it look like I had huge , puffy areolae ; the bra discs taper at the edges so that they 're invisible . They 're also comfortable
 With the new fabrics and tight clothing on the market , the bra diskstake away the tell-tale embarrassment of show-through problems . YOu know what I mean . This product is easy to apply under the bra , it absolutely does not show through , even with a white tee shirt , and it does not have to be peeled off ! Clean with simple soap and water , use over and over . Highly recommended for a `` smooth look '' .
 Stays in place and is comfortable while wearing . Now I do n't have to worry about my nipples protruding when wearing certain tops . It may not bother some people to have nipples that protrude , but I use to shy away from certain cute tops just because of it . Now I do n't have to any more . With Nipple Covers I can wear the cute tops with being self conscious . I would recommend it to my friends .
 These discs are great . Good coverage , stay in place well , ca n't see discs through shirt , and very comfortable . This was my fourth order . They hold up well . Gently wash with mild soap and warm water , then air dry . Love'em .
 I am a large breasted woman and after nursing my son it left me with large nipple protrusion . A lot of the bras I wear do n't have a lot of padding -LRB- who needs more boobage at my size 40F -RRB- and boy do you show through when the headlights are on , actually it is very embarrassing for me when that happens , my line of work which is hairdressing . I guess men do n't mind but I do ! I just bought a second pair to have in case something happens to one of these covers I wo n't be without them EVER !!! I am glad I do n't have a reaction to the nipple covers which I think are made from latex , so if you have allergic reaction to latex I would n't buy these nipple covers .
 THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for such a wonderful product . It is hard to believe that something so small could change how one feels about themselves but this product did that for me . Since I had breast surgery almost 20 yrs ago , my nipples stay in the pointed position all the time . I am almost 60 yrs old and would rather they did n't show when wearing a bra . Until recently , I had no idea there was a product like this out there . After reading the reviews , I knew I had to take a chance and try them and I am so HAPPY I did . I have tried bandaids but they hurt too much when taking off . I 've worn my bra discs all day for three days without any problems . They stayed in place til I took them off when I got home . I do believe this is one of my best buys ever . Thanks again for such a good product .
 I 've tried a few different products . This is the best by far . Now I can wear light , skimpy bras without attracting attention to protruding nips . They work fine with a tank top if it has a `` shelf '' bra built in . These do n't always stick to your skin , so I would n't try wearing them without something to help keep them in place . They look like they will last a long time & withstand many washings . One time I had a problem with itching , but just once . I 've worn them many , many times with no itching . They arrived with a nice , hand written note of thanks for buying them . Really appreciate this product that solves a problem for me !!!
 Like the other reviewers said , these are wonderful . I had no idea how good they would be . I 've worn them almost daily for 2 weeks -- I ca n't feel them on and you ca n't see them on . If you 're not quite sure , like I was , buy them -- it 's a great seller ! -- and find out for yourself !
 Finally , I found my HG ! Those covers are absolutely invisible , reusable and cover everything that needs to be covered . No more hiding under the jacket because my nipples are saying their hello to the world . I do n't like heavy-duty molded bras , and those discs are being great help .
 I bought these in the summer of 2011 and have used them virtually every day since receiving them . I have tried many different products and bras to conceal my `` high beams '' and these are the BEST ! If you are thinking of purchasing this product I highly recommend you do . They are comfortable , durable , easy to use , work like a charm and best of all you wash them and reuse them !! They have changed the way I dress , purchase clothes , bra 's and carry myself . I feel so much more confident with these and can buy any type of bra that I want . They are invisible under the bra and clothing . A + product !!
 These are excellent . I will be wearing these for the rest of my life or until they come out with something better ! I tried Bristol nippies but those did absolutely nothing .
 I 've had these discs for several months now and they are the best ! They cover those embarrassing headlights and you ca n't see them at all . They do have to be worn with a bra to hold them on , so do n't plan on buying these if you go bra-less . Although wearing them with a tank that has a shelf bra works fine . They do sort of `` stick '' to you once you 've had them on a while , but they are not self adhesive . You can easily wash them off with soap and water and they 're ready to go again . I will always have a pair of these . At $ 18 , much cheaper than the throw away adhesive petals and much less painful to take off . : -RRB-
 I really was skeptical about this item because of few negative comments . However , I 'm glad I listened to my instincts . This is a great item . I used it to go to the gym the day after I received it . Feeling a little scared that my chest would attract attention , and to my surprised I looked down and no headlights . I was so happy that I longer had to wrap the towel around neck to cover my chest . I felt confident to walk around and not worry that my chest would bring attention . Good product .
 This product has changed my life ! I am much more confident when I walk anywhere in public . It has improved my posture because I do not have to slump over to try to conceal `` the problem '' . I have been wearing these covers every day for over a year -LRB- same ones -RRB- . I simply slip them inside my bra after I put it on . I can not feel them or see them at all . They are very durable and washable . After a year of use , one of them is finally beginning to tear so I am ordering another pair ! I am so thankful I found this product !
 These nipple covers are just what I needed when I wear sports bras or other lighter bras . They stay in place , and I hardly know they are there . They do the trick ! I never tried anything like this , so I thought I 'd take a chance . I was not disappointed . The service was excellent , and shipping was fast . They even came with a personal note from the company , which I thought was sweet . It 's nice to know that people care about the products they sell and the customers they work with .
 These work great under my sports bra ! The sports bra is just one thin layer , and everything is invisible even through those very thin , moisture wicking workout shirts . I was a little nervous about wearing it when I work out in the heat , but it was no problem and I completely forgot I was wearing them . I wore them all day today -LRB- not to work out -RRB- , about 14 hours , and they did not irritate my skin .
 already a lot of great reviews for this product . Just want to add that I have worn these for working out many times , both with sports bras and with tops that have built-in bras . Either way they stay in place , do not move , and are not visible . Even during intense workouts including a lot of jumping i have not had an issue . Also they are perfectly comfortable and you just forget they are there .
 I never really give reviews but I had to give a review this time . This product really and truly works ! I know the price may be steep for some but its so worth it . My nipples have shown through my shirts since puberty in every season weather it 's been hot or cold lol . Ir 's worse now that I 'm 5 months pregnant . I decided to do some research when I came across these bra discs . I just received them yesterday and I love them ! They are so thin and comfortable that you ca n't even tell that you are wearing them and yet they are so effective . You can also clean them with soap and water so you get your money 's worth out of them because they last for a while . I would recommend these to anyone who suffers from the embarrassment of having their nipples show through their cloths , trust me you will not be disappointed .
 Finally , I am no longer self-concious at work!Just landed a new job where I can/want to wear nice new clothes , rather than the t-shirts and sweats that were the standard uniform of my last two ... But I was very self-concious in meetings and walking down the street because my nipples can become prominent with a simple lite breeze ... Read a lot of reviews on amazon and decided on these . They are fabulous ! Cheap , simple to use , and work great . Yes -- with sheer white -LRB- or thin white -RRB- t-shirts and camisoles , they show a little -- but they certainly take care of my problem under any other kind of shirt/thin sweater/blouse etc. . . And they are so lite and comfortable that I 've actually forgotten to take them off when changing for the gym or getting undressed to take a shower ... If you are reading this review , then you are going through the same research I was ... . Stop right now and buy these things !
 For all my life I have been buying padded bras to prevent show-through ; however with most sweaters and shirts and in air conditioned rooms , it still has been a problem . I have even resorted to making a pad out of paper towels or tissues and wearing them under my already padded bra . At work , some of our conference rooms are cold . These bra disks do work and provide a nice , smooth front , even in cold room . At my last meeting , I felt much more confident and able to talk without having to be worried about showing through and having to keep my arms in front of my chest.I do like the fabric insert in the Fashion Forms Breast Petals better than these discs which are all soft rubber . With normal body heat , the rubber causes the disc to stick to your skin so they stay in place . Even after an hour and a half of vigorous , sweaty exercise , they still stayed in place!I wear them all day . At the end , it is a little uncomfortable peeling off and unsticking the rubber from your skin but less so than a band-aid . With the cut petals , I worried about ripping them as I pull them off but going around and unsticking them has worked fine . I do enjoy taking the discs off at the end of a 12-hour day and letting everything breathe . I have n't had a problem with a rash or anything . I have worn them five to six days a week for a month now , and I am grateful for them when I put them on before I go to work or wear a more form fitting top . They are also very easy to wash with a little warm water and soap.I bought two pairs of these , and I appreciate the freedom and increased confidence the discs bring . I look forward to being able to buy a thin , lacy bra -LRB- not padded -RRB- and to be able to wear it with these discs.I appreciate everyone 's reviews for these which helped me decide to purchase these . These discs are GREAT and I am so glad I found them after all these years .
 These solved my problem.I am nursing a two year old . He is allergic to regular milk , so I am not planning on weaning yet . The problem , all this nursing has made my nipples really stand out . I found these and I am so happy . I now have a whole new wardrobe . I am a teacher , and walking around with my nipples showing is not an option . I am going back through my closet can wear only one layer again .
 I 've been using these shields for months now and they are great . Like the other reviewers have stated , I can now wear all of my tops without being embarassed and/or self-conscious . They are generally so comfortable that it is easy to forget that you are wearing them -LRB- though sometimes they cause some discomfort if I forget to remove them when I 'm at home after wearing them all day -RRB- .
 I had a pair of DIMRS for almost exactly 3 years , worn daily , that just started falling apart . They always did okay , but obviously they were n't perfect because rather than replace them with an identical pair , I switched to these.The short version of the story is that these conceal better , and is n't that the whole point ? At least on a D-cup . I 'm more confident that I 'm not pointy in these . There 's an extra curvature to the DIMRS silicone that does n't fit just perfectly and if you were really , um , cold , it just looked wrong , maybe even lumpy . These are flat circles and do n't have any additional shaping to them . I suppose if you were much smaller chested and the DIMRS happened to be just the right curve they 'd work better . I like the case these come with.DIMRS claim to adhere with body heat , while these state you MUST wear a bra . Oddly enough , these , once warmed up and stuck , stick MUCH better than the DIMRS . I think you could actually wear this without a bra -LRB- not my thing -RRB- . I KNOW you could wear it under a tank with a shelf bra without a problem.It 's hard to see exactly what these are like in the picture . It 's basically a round disc , hence the name , of silicone and those lines are actually slits in the silicone that make it conform to the shape of your chest.Now , on to my complaints for these.-They can itch a bit at times , not too bad though.-These stick REALLY well . In fact , if you 're sensitive it can be a little uncomfortable to remove them , though not painful . However , if you were a new to breastfeeding , it might kill you to remove these . I have found though that you can lessen discomfort if you remove them in the shower , which is also handy because you can wash them up with a little gentle soap while you 're in there.-Since they are so stuck on there , you kind of have to go around the circle and pull each of the little sections off before removing the center . I 'm concerned that if I 'm not careful , someday I might rip right through the middle with one of the outside parts.-While I 'll pay it for what it does , why are these so freakin ' expensive ?! BOTTOM LINE
 I tried these out of desperation -- the company I work at has problems with the air conditioning and it is always freezing . No matter what I wear -LRB- unless it 's a jacket -RRB- I have show-through problems with it always being so cold . I tired of the tape products , because they hurt when pulling them off . On the first day I tried the bra discs , I was amazed . I have been wearing them frequently and have had zero problems . They work 100 % and you can not tell in the least , even under a white shirt -- such a simple design , yet so effective and so easy to wear and remove . I am going to buy one for my sister and my mom ... I wish I had known about this product years ago -LRB- if they existed back then . -RRB-
 The one person who gave this a negative review must own a competing company because this product is brilliant . I have suffered with embarrasing `` high beams '' for 25 years and finally , I can shop in the freezer section with confidence . Seriously girls , this simple product is amazing - they 're comfortable , easy to use , and very sanitary . I went food shopping today to try them out and as soon as I walked in the airconditioned store I could feel the high beams coming on . Much to my shock , I looked down and my form fitting tshirt showed no evidence of `` perkiness . '' I am thrilled beyond belief and want to kiss the inventor right on the mouth . Do n't waste your money on anything else if you have this issue .
 This Discs have saved me ! Really , I first bought them in 2007 so I would n't be self conscious about my nips when swimming laps . I dived in a few times , they stayed right where they belonged ... plus , when I got out of the water , I looked down and saw nothing =-RRB- Since high school , I was extremely embarrassed of my nips , and started hunching my back , crossing my arms ... these things just had a mind of their own ?! I stayed away from so many adorable shirts , dresses , light feminine clothing because it was awful - eyes would go immediately to my chest.I purchase a second pair because the first ones started tearing ... they lasted almost 2 years ! I was wearing them daily . The only difference -LRB- and I 'm not sure why -RRB- is with the 2nd pair , they seem to make my boobs itch . I never had that problem with the 1st pair ? It is a little annoying . When that happens , I just remove them for the rest of the day , give my boobs some freedom . That seems to work , and now the itching is occuring less frequently.I use the nipple discs mainly with sports bras , workout tops , strapless dresses/tops and swimsuits - the best product ever =-RRB- Highly recommend !! Just FYI - Hanes has come out with a bra with concealing petals in the bra ... this bra kicks booty ! I wear it with thin shirts , it covers up the nips ! I used to wear the discs every day ... until I found this bra at target . So if the itchiness bothers you , this is a nice change = -RRB-
 They fit great under the bra and do not budge . I think your own body heat makes them stick to your boobs . These definitely got rid of the high beams . The only drawback is they make my boobs itch like crazy . I wash them regularly so it is n't like I 'm wearing dirty discs . If anyone has the same problem and has a solution , please let me know . Other than the itching , these are good products.UPDATE 11/25/11
 These are great . I was afraid they might hurt when they are taken off , but I have not had any sensitivity . Now I can wear some clothes , bras , exercise tops that I could not wear before . Beautiful lace bras sitting in my drawer are now put to use . They stay put and are perfect for working out . Thank you for this excellent and useful product .
 This is truly and excellent product . It does everything it says it will . I have another brand which do not come close to the hide given by these discs ; you will love them . Even with a sheer top , there is no nipple visible through the fabric .
 But what is holding them ON ??? There 's no sticky , nothing . Just my body heat I guess but the bra ca n't be loose at all ... no show though and no these do not show either ... was n't `` life changing '' for me , but I can now wear bras I could n't before with white t-shirts ... so that 's something.You only get one `` leftie '' and one `` rightie '' ... I thought this was a package of many of them for some reason . I opened it up and thought - I paid $ 10 for each one of THESE?Okay . Someone is really getting rich off this product / they probably cost pennies to produce , but they do work ... I do wish they had some sticky on the back or option to have to hold them on ... in case I bend over and my bra shifts alot ... . hmmmm . I may find some body glue of some sort and use that ... I 'm not RAVING about this like everyone else is here ... I only got two of them , if I lose 1 I have to buy two more ... okay .
 These are great . They never show through anything . They are easy to wash , too , which makes them perfect . I highly recommend them .
 I had no idea there was a product like this out there - and thanks to Amazon and the awesome reviews , I 'm finally able to cover my nipples and satisfy my boyfriend on his fixation with the `` potential '' of my nipples showing with my clothing . I have had to resort to throw away nursing pads -LRB- that can become expensive -RRB- to wear with my sports bra and I was told with some of my shirts , you could still see my nipples at times . I checked , and this was the case . I bought two different -LRB- well , my boyfriend did :--RRB- -RRB- products on line for nipple coverage and these are the best . I can now wear other bras without so much padding , if I choose . These are awesome . They clean easily and are mostly comfortable . At times I feel a little sting on my skin but it 's so minor and infrequent I probably should n't even mention it . These are so awesome , I will always have these available ... as long as they keep making them . They do the trick better than anything I 've tried and finally my boyfriend can quit fixating on my nipples and find something else to obsess over - ha ha
 I really like this product and am glad I bought it . They have n't shown through any of my shirts and they do exactly what they are supposed to do . I always forget I 'm wearing the discs after a few minutes and I have n't had many problems with them slipping . I have found that they stick better when they are freshly washed , and it is easy to wash them with soap and water . The only issue I have is that my breasts are on the smaller side , so the discs sometimes lift off in certain spots -LRB- I 've never had one come totally off , though -RRB- . Overall this is a good buy !
 I wish I had found these years ago . I 've been dealing with thick padded bras in an effort to prevent the embarrassing ` cold ' look . Now I can finally wear a thin comfortable bra and have no worries while at work or in the freezer section at the grocery store ! I just received these 2 days ago and have used them both days . I did n't have any problems with a skin reaction . You ca n't see the outline of them at all , even with a fairly snug top on . The material seems to be durable so they should last for a long time . I 'm very pleased with this product .
 I have tried everything from adhesives to silicone gel covers and these work the best so far . Not only do they prevent the high-beam look , but the discs do not show through , even with white t-shirts . While some of the silicone covers are thick enough to distort the shape of your breast , these are thin and look natural . They are meant to be placed inside a bra and take longer to position than adhesives , but are MUCH easier to take off . The only drawback is the material , which is rubbery , but the effectiveness of these discs is outstanding .
 If you 're reading this I know exactly what you came here for and I 'll tell you that it absolutely works . You wanted something to cover those high-beams for
 These are perfect.As stated in the description , they must be worn with a bra.They are comfortable , light weight , you do not know you are wearing them and even with a very thin bra you can not see the disc.I am very happy with this purchase.Highly recommend !
 The Bezi bra discs are the best . I have been using them for several years . They are long wearing even with many washings and are transparent through the lightest tee shirt . Ann B. Ottawa , Canada
 This is exactly what I have been looking for !!! The answer for an embarrassing problem that I have had for years . Thank you so much . They never slip or slide even during exercise . Also invisible to the eye and can now wear super light weight shirts with out worries .
 I LOVE them ! I did not experience any skin reaction to it . They are so comfortable that I forget that I actually am wearing them . Even though one already slightly ripped just after a month of use I still give it 5 stars since I think it is a great product !
 I highly recommend these , even if they make me a little itchy . You really ca n't see them , even through a white blouse .
 I thought these were a bit pricey but now that I have tried them , they are well worth the price . Nice to be able to reuse them and to wash them . I like that no adhesive is needed .
 These work beautifully ! Wish I had known about them years ago . I can now wear fitted tops and not worry ! They stay in place , and I do n't feel a thing . They are also easy to remove . They are worth every cent I paid for them !
 this disc for my daughter.she is 18 year old and just start the collage . she need some thing to give her full confident to live dorm life . thank god she is happy now . when my daughter is happy that mean this Bra discs is relay work.thank you so much .
 This is simply an amazing product . They do n't show through my bra and they perfectly conform to my breasts . The discs are not sticky or tacky in any way . After sticking them in your bra for a little , they warm with your body heat and perfectly suction to your breasts which keeps them in place . I was amazed the first few times I wore them and they stayed on my breasts after taking my bra off . They really hit it out of the park on this one !!
 I have tried several products of this nature , and these are BY FAR the best . I even tried the &#34; hippies skin &#34; , and you could still slightly see them underneath . These Bezi discs are completely seamless , AND there was no &#34; show through &#34; even in the frozen food section . Ha . Stop your search and purchase these !
 These work as described , small , simple , and great for my workouts . Keeps everything hidden while thin enough to not show an outline . Exactly what I needed for those thin bras that easily show through .
 The daisies help with the problems we ladies face when we are chilly . I gave them to my two daughters also !
 These are perfect !!! Stay in place great & cover exactly like I wanted . Highly recommended for those who get sick of wearing padded bras just for cover .
 If you have a problem , this is the product for you - have had a problem since menopause - these work so well - you can not tell you have them on -- they tend to stick to you so they do n't move - am now able to wear tight fitting shirts with no problem - they come in a nice case to keep them in
 I have to say , I 'm very happy with this product . I barely know that I have them on and they work just as advertised . I 'd recommend these to any woman who wants to be discrete under any shirt .
 I am not kidding-this really is a life-changing product ! I had a problem for years with nipple protrusion through sports bras , as well as regular bras ! I wanted to wear sports bras under t-shirts for comfort , but could n't because of the problem . I decided to try these and let me tell you , they work ! You slip them in under your sports bra or even your regular bra and they somehow adhere to your body and stay there until you take them off ! I wear them for 15 hours at a time and they never budge . They are wonderful and I would recommend them highly . A + + + + + + +
 The handy reusable case comes with two discs that are inserted in your bra . Unlike other silicone nipple covers these are non-adhesive so they must be used with a bra . Not a problem for me since I always wear a bra - well almost always . You know what I mean . They are comfortable enough so that you forget you have them on . I like these better than the silicone nipple covers -LRB- having used numerous brands over the past few years -RRB- because they are thinner and give you a smoother look . They do n't create that areola mound that the silicone covers sort of do . The thickness is somewhere between the disposable bandaid-like nipple covers and the silicone nipple covers . I was skeptical when I saw how thin these were but they provide great coverage even when used with unlined bras and under a thin t-shirt . I have medium brown skin and considered buying the darker discs but am glad that I chose the blush . The blush color does n't show through a white or beige bra as the darker discs might have . Darker pigmentation and nursing three children have caused nipple issues that do n't allow me to wear even expensive nipple covering bras without some show-through . These solve the problem for me .
 These bra discs are the best product I have found yet for preventing show through when wearing thin or tight fitting tops . I play a lot of tennis and the tops that are made now are snug fitting and do n't leave much to the imagination so for that reason these discs are the best solution I have found . I have tried several of the silicone products but they are bulky and still show through my tops . You ca n't wear these without a bra but I would n't play tennis without a bra anyway ! If you want to go braless then the silicone discs are the way to go . These discs are thin but somehow manage to keep me looking smooth in tight fitting tee shirts and thin clingy tops . I did not experience any irritation from them as mentioned in other reviews and I will be buying more of these in the future .
 Worked like a charm ! They magically adhere to skin and stay in place , even after 12 + hours . I have avoided clingy tops for years because of prominant nipples and now I can wear anything with confidence . No more trying to find a bra that hides me ! Made of quality material that should last a long , long time .
 I absolutely love this product . For years , I have felt a sense of discomfort when wearing shear tops . Now I feel at ease when I am out in public . I especially love the fact that these particular Bra Discs that I purchased blend very well on women of color . I almost forget that I even have them . It 's only when I take off my bra that they fall out that I remember ! Thanks for selling a great product ! I will purchase another set in the near future .
 I 've tried several different types of nipple covers , including the silicone `` stick ems '' , but this is by far the best . They are lightweight , provide complete coverage and are easy to keep clean .
 Love this product ! Had been using tape version which was expensive and good for only one use . This product is foolproof and can be used over and over . It is well worth the price . I have absolute confidence when I wear the discs . They are comfortable , and you forget you even have them on ! I will be back for another set when these -LRB- if ever -RRB- wear out !
 These things are awesome . I bought them because I am `` small '' enough to wear tops with built-in shelf bras -LRB- at least the more supportive ones -RRB- but I always had serious `` headlight '' problems and thus ended up wearing a bra anyhow . Problem solved with bra discs - now there are a lot more things I can wear for summer ! : -RRB-
 easy to use , easy to clean and great coverage . i 've tried other items of this nature in the past and none of them worked as well as these !
 I had been looking for something like this for a while . I am not comfortable with the ones that use adhesives to stick to your body . This does n't , is easy to use , very convenient to maintain and does its job really well . Although it is significantly more expensive than other such products , it pays for itself in the long run . Can you really put a price on confidence esp . in the workplace ? Hope this helps !
 I wish I 'd bought these years ago . Have had to buy decorated tops lately to help limit the `` view '' . I got tired of not being able to wear solid color tops so decided to try these . They are amazing ! They are easy to wear -LRB- yes you MUST wear them with a bra -RRB- . They are so comfortable I do n't even know I 'm wearing them . They are so easy to wash - by hand with a bit of soap - and can be dried instantly . I have had no trouble with any irritation or them not staying put . They also appear to be very durable . Now I can wear whatever style and color tops I want . I 'm going to order another pair just as a back up .
 These work , and work very well ! I can now wear T-shirts with confidence . But take them off slowly -- they do stick to your skin , as they should .
 These are great as there is no `` see-thru '' when using them . They make my breast area a little itchy but that is because I am allergic to sticky-tacky items such as band aids & surgical tape . I still use this product daily as it works great !
 Can not believe I went my whole professional life wearing jackets because I was embarrassed that my nipples always showed under tees and tops . I am very pleased with this product , would buy more and would recommend to others . I do see where it pays to treat them like one would soft contact lenses as they adhere so well , they must be peeled off gently , petal by petal .
 These nipple covers are fabulous ! They apply easily , stay in place all day long and they 're so comfortable I forget I have them on ! And most important , they do the job !! Nothing is showing under these covers ! Love , love , love .
 I 'm a 32D and , despite my teenage daughters ' best efforts , I refuse to wear padded bras . There are n't many bras in my size anyway , and the few that I like are comfy , thin and stretchy . Well , you know what happens . This product really does the trick - and I love that it 's completely washable and reusable , since I hate the waste involved in disposable items . I also love that although the covers stay on absolutely firmly , there is no adhesive.At first I did have an issue with the covers slightly changing the shape of my breasts - they left a slightly flattened patch - but I experimented a bit and learned to position them in such a way that this is no longer a problem . They even seem to cling slightly to my bra , which means that they help keep me evenly shaped throughout the day - a very nice plus .
 I ca n't believe I had never known about this kind of product before ! At work and other places , I would feel very embarrassed about show-through . Now I do n't have to worry about it at all . These covers do n't show , and I do n't feel them , when wearing them - which is exactly what I want .
 This is a wonderful product that makes me feel more confident in every day life . No itching ... hardly know they are there ! Thanks !
 I have tried many types of nipple covers -LRB- Nippits , silicone adhesives , etc. , -RRB- and Bra Discs are by far the best . They give the best coverage , show the least -LRB- some adhesive-style covers are smaller and do n't give a smooth line under tight tops -RRB- , and can be washed and reused indefinitely . I have been using mine for over two years , almost daily in the summer months and they are as good as new . Bra discs gave me a whole new set of options for summer clothing -- suddenly I did n't need to feel self-conscious about wearing a shelf-bra top without a regular bra underneath -LRB- what 's the point of that anyway ? -RRB- . I highly recommend Bra Discs , they are the perfect solution to a common problem .
 I never thought I 'd write a review for nipple covers , but this product is so wonderful I had to let others know . They do exactly what they 're supposed to do , and do it well . I like that the product is reusable , and with a little TLC I expect to get a long product life . These disappear magically under clothing and are easy to take off . They are a bit more expensive than other brands , but very worth the money .
 This product changed my life ! Seriously ! I had no idea such things even existed , I wish I had known about them years ago . If you are as self-conscious as I am the last thing you need is your body embarrassing you yet more . These covers work . They do n't show -LRB- I do n't wear really sheer clothes so that might be an issue but they really do n't show under thin T-shirts -RRB- . Also they have no adhesive , which I suspect my skin would react to . They do n't slip or move around , and you really do forget you are wearing them . Also awesome is that you can wash them with soap and water and pat them dry with a towel and they are ready for another day , absolutely no hassle at all!As another reviewer said , if you are reading up on this then this is the product you need . I highly recommend them .
 I bought this after many years struggling with bra . I hate bra with wire , after washed them a few time the wire started to come out and poke your skin . I removed the wire and my boobs look like going everywhere without support.I change my bra with sport bra ... good support and comfortable , the problem was my nipple.People could see my nipple when I wore t-shirt . So , I used tissue to cover.Tired of this , I searched in Amazon `` nipple cover '' . I found this and I love them !!
 These work great ! You ca n't feel them and they lay flat on your skin . The gel/silicone cup things did not work so well for me . By bra is 40-42 D , the cup things just looked weird.The only problem I found was that when I first starting wearing them they itched ! But you can wash them with mild soap and water , and I think that helped . I only itched for about the first two hours I wore them . After washing , they did n't itch so bad.They gave the coverage I needed and did n't hurt when I took them off . Excellent product !
 Seriously , I dreamed about covers like this . I am a small busted 36A , and have little boobage to fill up bras . I dislike wearing bras immensely but have to because of my giant nipples . They show thru padded bras under layers of shirts . I live in a warm climate so tank tops and/or thin tees are often a part of my wardrobe . The only bras that fully conceal the nips are super super thick and crazy overkill for a small busted girl . But let me tell you , these Bezi Discs are EXACTLY what I 've been dreaming about . I wanted 100 % concealment with zero adhesive and that 's what these are . They actually somehow adhere to your skin as it warms up and they do NOT move until you peel them off . I 've never seen anything like it . I ca n't feel them at all , another HUGE plus . The only drawback -LRB- which I do n't care about -RRB- is that you have to put them on with a fitted top or a bra since they do n't stick to your cold skin right off the bat . I was so tired of looking in the mirror during my barre class and noticing giant headlights . Way to make everyone uncomfortable . My mom told me I 've ruined family photos because they were n't properly concealed . Those days are over . These are the absolutely greatest thing I have in my wardrobe . I 've tried the adhesive petals from Victoria 's Secret before which kinda worked but any kind of adhesive cover is impractical , gross and expensive . I knew that was n't going to be an option . I rinse these off at night , let them air dry on the sink and bam , they 're ready for me in the morning . I 've worn these from 6am-1am with a workout in between and I do n't remember they 're there until I get undressed to take a shower . I wear them every day all day and for every workout . I thought they were a little overpriced before I bought them and hemmed and hawed for a week before I finally ordered them . I can easily justify the price of these Discs by the fact that I am now able to wear a ton of things in my wardrobe that I was previously shy or insecure about . Buy them if you 're on the fence . You 'll be sold , day one . I promise .
 I just have to say that if you 're looking for nipple covers that DO N'T show through your clothes , you can stop searching now and buy these!In the past , I had purchased the silicone type nipple covers , and sure , they covered what I wanted them to , but then the outline of it -LRB- which sort of resembled a flower -RRB- was completely visible , which was just as embarrassing ! And is n't the whole point of a nipple cover to NOT bring attention to that area?So needless to say , I was a bit skeptical about these but I read some of the other reviewers saying you could n't see these through clothes , so I gave them a try . I was so glad to find out they were right!I 'm so thrilled to be able to go to work and wear whatever I want and not have anything show through ! And my boss keeps the office as cold as a meat locker , so this was a must have ! I wear these things almost everyday ! And they 're easy to clean ... just a little bit of soap and warm water , then towel dry and you 're good to go ... Also , I wear very thin bras . I 'm an A cup and bras with extra padding just look ridiculous on me . Even when I wear bras made of thin material , they still do not show through , and more importantly , nothing else does either !
 I 've been using this product for many years . I 'm a breast cancer survivor and surgery has made me not so symmetrical on both sides . This product conceals so that it 's not so obvious . The discs are easy to use and stay in place all day without a problem . I highly recommmend this product .
 Since puberty , I have been terribly self conscious about my nipples showing through my shirts . No matter what kind of bra I would wear or what the temperature was , it was inevitable that they would show through . After one too many `` high beam '' comments , I decided to find a solution . I shied away from buying covers previously because I did not want to glue anything on my breasts day in and day out . I also was not interested in paying $ 50 for covers that only lasted a few wears and would be bulky -LRB- which seems rather counterproductive ! -RRB- . After reading the rave reviews on Amazon , I bit the bullet and ordered a pair of Bezi Bra Discs . As another reviewer stated , this product is life changing ! As silly as it sounds , these discs really have given me my confidence back . Now I can stroll through the grocery store freezer section and not worry about getting disgusting leers from guys . I no longer have to lug my jacket to cover up if I decide to wear a somewhat thin t-shirt . They stay completely in place , are not at all noticeable under clothes , and are totally comfortable . I never go out without them on anymore!The only downside to these discs is they can sometimes be painful to remove . They have a tendency to really stick to the skin -LRB- especially if you have been in a warm environment -RRB- and may pull a bit when removed . I find this a small price to pay and would recommend these to anyone who is tired of being self conscious .
 I get so tired of wearing the lightly padded bras to cover myself up under tee shirts -- especially in the summer when they end up making me sweat more . I was so grateful to find the bra discs , as they cover me up well without being noticeable themselves . I can now wear almost any of my bras , even those with thin cloth , with my tee shirts . The bra discs meld to my skin after a short time wearing them , so they do n't move around . The only drawback is that they , too , can make me a little sweaty where they are on my skin , and so they need substantial washing to keep them from smelling bad on warm days . They seem more than durable enough to deal with all the soap and water , though , so that 's fine . I highly recommend these .
 What a great little item ! No more embarrassing pointiness . Very comfortable and invisible .
 This is my second purchase of these and they provide great coverage . Just be careful taking them off because you could tear them which is what I did to my first set but that was over like a year or 2 and me not being careful . But , I highly recommend this product and will keep buying it when my others wear out .
 These nipple covers are spectacular!They give me such peace of mind -- something I never had wearing only a bra ! I even used to at times use Scotch tape to cover my nipples and that did more skin damage than anything.I no longer have to worry about showing when I am wearing any shirt ! I even used to wear two shirts
 I just want to echo all the positive reviews here - bra discs are great!Like one other reviewer , I have occasionally gotten some itching , but only when I have used them over a very long day -LRB- > 12 or 14 hours -RRB- . I can generally avoid this by remembering to take them out when I get home -- though sometimes I forget , cuz they 're so comfortable .
 I needed this post-surgery because I was n't able to wear conventional bras . These provided great coverage & modesty ; I could tuck them in the shelf bras of camisoles and wear the camisoles under any other shirt . Even though they do n't have any adhesive , I have noticed that after wearing them for a while , your body heat & what I guess is the natural oil of your skin help keep them on ; I can change clothes and they stay stuck on ! However , they do tend to smell a little funky after a day 's wear -LRB- like rubber -RRB- even though I wash mine daily . I also saw some sort of residue buildup -LRB- dead skin cells & natural oils again ? -RRB- on the skin-touching side of mine , which I also washed off daily . You 'll need to be a little careful with each individual petal , but I loved the coverage I got and the fact that these were n't adhesive . -LRB- But like I said , they do n't really need to be -RRB- I 'd definitely recommend these for anyone who has issues with nipple perk .
 I had spent years trying to find a product that provided great nipple coverage without adding bulk and that would stay in place without having to be pinned to the bra . The Bra Disc is the greatest invention since sliced bread . It provides complete coverage with no added bulk , and it stays in place completely . I would recommend it for everyone .
 These are great . They leave no sign that you are wearing them -LRB- other than the obvious -RRB- , peel off easily , are washable , and are incredibly comfortable !
 This product stays in place and provides full coverage . Shipping was quick . The product comes in a case , which is nice for storage .
 I had settled for years for only using &#34; battleship &#34; bras . They were the only things I could use that I was n't embarrassed working as a substitute teacher in the local high school . I had several very expensive and lovely bras that had been relegated to the bottom dresser drawer , but now with these covers I can use them again . So much more comfortable and more natural looking . The covers use no adhesive , so nothing sticking on body . Very easy to use . I bought two pair , so that I could rotate them . Very happy with purchase .
 Finally ! I can wear my thinner shirts at work without worrying about what effects the cool AC -LRB- or the hot FedEx guy -RRB- will have on the nipples . I definitely feel more confident with these inserts , and less self conscious about the breast area.I 'm loving this product and I also love the little case it comes in , makes it easy to bring everywhere . The pads stay in place all day , no need to keep reaching in to readjust.Definitely will recommend this too family and friends , no doubt !!
 I 'm on my second pair , one petal off of the first pair eventually cracked and tore off . I now place a bit of vaseline on them before application.I have saved money on these rather than order one time use petals . I like both , but I prefer the Bra Discs hands down . Ive used other reusable ones , and the manufactures must be men who do not have breast or wear sheet tops . The other reusable petals look HORRIBLE and are obvious through the most thickest of shirts.If you are hesitant in buying this product , for its price . . does it work , does it cover . . etc BUY IT!GREAT PURCHASE !
 I have been searching for something like this almost my entire adult life . I have the same issues as most of the other posters here , and have tried everything else out there . Nothing works , or it shows through . THESE DO NOT SHOW THROUGH YOUR CLOTHES !!! I just wore a light pink cotton shirt to work today-nothing showed !!! I can FINALLY wear shirts that do not have a pattern , or the darkest colors , or I can even wear a plain T-shirt . I want to thank everyone here for leaving your remarks . I would never have tried these without all of these many , many reviews . There is not much out there on the internet about this `` issue '' , and boy do you get some interesting results when you do a search ! Anyway , if you are still not convinced that this is the best solution for an embarrassing problem , after all of the 50 + reviews , just try them anyway . You will NOT be disappointed !!
 I wish I had known about these years ago . I almost always wear padded bras even though I really do n't want the extra padding or `` push up . '' I have searched for a lightly lined bra that will do the job but I have yet to find one that actually conceals my nipples , especially under thin tops . These do the job perfectly . They are thin enough that you ca n't see them under a shirt and they do n't create an odd shape . I love that they stay in place without any adhesive -LRB- although you do kind of have to peel them off at the end of the day -RRB- . When I saw the rubbery material I thought they might be uncomfortable but I never notice that I 'm wearing them.I honestly do n't need very much support in a bra , and it 's always been frustrating to not be able to wear tops with shelf bras . No longer an issue ! I am looking forward to being able to purchase shirts/dresses this summer without worrying how I 'm going to deal with my completely unnecessary over-padded bras.I ca n't think of the last time I purchased a product that has made such an improvement in my life . Some would see that as an exaggeration , but if you are looking at products like this one I think you 'll understand what I mean . I ca n't recommend them enough .
 These things are great - no adhesive to worry about - 5 minutes under anything relatively tight fitting and they are `` stuck '' to you - all the ones with adhesive bothered me . I have worn these for over 16 hours several times - it does feel good to take them off by the end of those days , but still , not bad at all.I have probably already worn these 20 + times , washed them -LRB- very easy -RRB- and left to dry - no wear shown at all yet.Also , worn these under lots of tight fitting + thin shirts - really , they do n't show any lines around the outside of the outer ring . You ca n't tell they are there -LRB- unlike so many others -RRB- . Will buy another pair when these finally give out . I know they are more expensive , but trust me , they are well worth the extra $ above the others !
 I know it sounds a little dramatic to say this little product is life changing but I have been wearing these discs daily for about 3 years now and can truly say
 I was afraid that I was wasting my money when I purchased the nipple covers . I read the reviews and I was not to sure on the item . I really needed something to cover my nipples and where I work with the public I was paranoid that people where staring at my chest all the time . As my husband say 's `` standing at attention '' ! Was I ever surprised that they worked !!!! The nipple covers covered me up and I could n't tell that they were there . Also they are very easy to use . I followed some recommendations in other reviews about washing them before they are used so you would n't itch . When I get home at the end of a work day I take them off so my ladies have a chance to relax . I have recommend the nipple covers to friends and people that I work with . I am planning on getting a second pair . I 'm glad that I took the time to read the reviews and check out other items similar to this product . Others were not happy with the different products and had many complaints . This works and covers very well .
 I am 40yrs old and until only recently had thought I was destined to cross my arms or wear layers !! Then I spent way too much money for little stick on petals ... Until I found these !!! They are great ! I can wear so many of my shirts now that were just hanging in my closet or covered up by a sweater !! These discs are so smooth , you can wear them even under tighter shirts !! Yippee !! If you are shopping around . . You can stop now and Buy These !! The price is so good too !!
 For YEARS I have stuffed cotton balls or anything I could find , in my bra to hide my nipples . I 'd try to buy molded cup bras to hide them but even that did n't always work . I am so happy to have found this product . I no longer have to cross my arms to hide anything and can wear form-fitting tops whenever I choose . I was hesitant to purchase and almost went with a less expensive product but I have no regrets . They do have to be removed carefully so as not to damage as they are thin but they really do the trick . You 'll be surprised how free you feel . I 'd like to tell all the gals with `` headlights '' about this product - what a difference !!!
 BRAVO ! What an awesome product ! I am big busted -LRB- 42-D -RRB- and have avoided padded bras since they add more inches . I have always struggled with `` show through '' when I wear my favorite T-Shirts . This product works wonders and does not show through my bra , let alone my T-Shirts -LRB- even white -RRB- ! The discs stay in place and do not irritate my sensitive skin . Thanks for bringing us such an awesome product - I highly recommend it !
 Very stylish and warm . A great buy . It was bought for a gift , and was very well received . A great buy !
 Bought this as a gift to replace the one I hmm -LRB- took over -RRB- . Seems warn and confy like the one I took over .
 Understand that these Katahdin fleece products are unisex in size . The original order was too large as I was using a women 's sizing chart so I exchanged for a size smaller . If you have long arms , this is the jacket for you ! I love that they did n't scrimp on the length of the sleeves . I bought this product as well as the Katahdin half zip fleece and it fits the same.I have it on now and am toasty .
 But I am now ! its great , great fabric , great light weight-ness , those who suggested sizing down , kudos , arrived in good time and is incredibly warm -LRB- wisconsin -RRB-
 The fleece jacket was as describe and is very warm . Reasonably priced with quick shipping . I would buy here again .
 I 've enjoyed owning the fleece so far . I took it on a week-long trip overseas , and it held up very well . I think it performs well at a much wider range of temperatures than other fleeces I have owned . Even when the temperature started to climb , I did n't feel uncomfortable as long as I rolled the sleeves up . The only negative things so far are that , as others have noted , it would be best to wash the item before your first wearing . Otherwise , it will thoroughly coat your shirt in fuzzy lint . Also , the zipper can be a bit rough at times . I 've been careful with it , but it feels like it might break or come off track if I were less careful . All things considered , though , I 'm very pleased with this item .
 This beautiful jacket was good quality , soft fleece , washes and drys well , good price , shipped in a timely manner and in excellent condition . This is not to heavy but will keep you warm and draft free indoors .
 I have n't had a new coat in 15 years -LRB- live in the desert -RRB- and this is just perfect ! It 's so soft , fits great ... great price -LRB- got it on sale -RRB- . Picked up two - one for me and one for my husband . Hope it gets cold enough to wear !
 I bought this as a present for my brother . I had been looking all over for this exact product in all the stores I went to . This was the only place I could find it in the right color and size . I was also extremely pleased with the service and the fast delivery time .
 Nice jacket but a little smaller than I thought it would be . . But should be nice to wear when it gets really COLD in S.Calif . maybe in the 50 's . . lol
 CK really shines with this item . The fabric is 93 % polyester and 7 % lycra . For me , the medium is not skin tight and that was fine -LRB- 38 inch chest , 32 inch waist -RRB- . I bought this item for outdoor running on cool -LRB- 40-60 F -RRB- but not cold days . For very cold days I still fall back on my UnderArmour version of this shirt that is much thicker , tighter and less comfortable . This one is made in Israel and the stitching is top notch .
 My grown son loves everything Motley Crue and was pleasantly surprised at this gift that he did not know was available . Two points for me !
 Unlike some , my bandanas were printed on both sides . I had actually lost one just days after purchasing , but I liked it so much I ordered another.The colors are beautiful and after a few days of use , the fabric softens up and it is comfortable to wear . Would definitely buy a third if I lost it again : -RRB-
 This has become a signature look for the person I bought it for . The product washes well , dries quickly and is a good thread count . Colorful and fun , highly recommend this bandana .
 As you 've probably read , the print is only on one side . But , the side that 's printed on is really pretty and stylish . I bought this for my dog as a bandana around her neck and I get a lot of compliments on it when we go out . It 's not super soft , but not completely rough either . I would recommend it .
 Good quality has held up so far . I use them on my dog to help spot him and he wears each different bananas i have for him for a week or untill real dirty , wash with towels or whatever it has survived for two weeks on him -LRB- 2 yr old lab . -RRB- no tears or fading yet !
 This item is fantastic and so is the Seller ! I was worried about the sizing , but took a chance . Wow , did it pay off ! I am an XL and this item really is an XL without looking like draperies . It is fitted in all the right areas and is beautiful . It is one of the most versatile blouses in my wardrobe . I live in Arizona and this item could even be worn in the hottest of days here -LRB- 120 -RRB- ! The fabric is versatile and cools you when you need cooling and heats when it is cold . I have the item in Black and Teal . I will soon be getting it in Tan and Rose as well . Then , in another few weeks , will be finishing the collection with the purple and burgundy ! I wear it with broom skirts , the black tiered skirt in this shop , and with different batik scarves and sarongs.Absolutely fantastic addition to ANY wardrobe !
 These are rich deep jewel tones , I bought two of them ! They look great with a lacy cami underneath , just the right weight for cool Florida evenings . Great with jeans!They run slightly large , I wear a ten and bought the small , it 's perfect !
 First of all the service was excellent . I ordered on a Friday evening , they shipped on Saturday , and I had the tunic tops on Monday -LRB- and I did n't even ask for Express Shipping -RRB- . When I saw the rich , beautiful colors -LRB- I ordered the tan , black and teal - but I will be ordering more colors -RRB- I was delighted . When I took them out and touched the light , quality fabric -LRB- perfect for summer but great for spring and fall too -RRB- I was pleased , and best of all the fit -LRB- I ordered a large -RRB- was perfect . They drape beautifully and can go with jeans or be dressed up with jewellery and a skirt .
 I 'm older than the woman pictured in the purple tunic . I wear a size twelve . I needed a summer weight comfortable top that was n't too see-through , did n't need a cami underneath , was sized to drape nicely and fit comfortably without pulling at my shoulders or bust , and was long enough to fall at my lower hip . If that sounds like what you want , this is your top . If you want to look feminine , need something dressier than a tee shirt , and still want to be comfortable in the summer heat , you could n't find anything better than this . I ordered one last summer -LRB- size large -RRB- , and the day it arrived I ordered another , and here I am the next spring , ordering two more . I wash mine in the washing machine on cold water , gentle cycle and hang to dry . They have not shrunk at all . They have not faded . I have never ironed mine . I do n't know how I survived summer before I had them .
 I have one in every color , love them all and they fit perfectly , are comfortable and great style , especially in hot sunny Florida weather ! LOVE THEM !
 I could n't wait to get my tunics , I ordered 5 of them , purple , tan , teal and the amber and gold patterned ones by the same company . They are so pretty and I normally wear an xl in tops so that 's what I bought . They fit great but I 'm only 5 ' so they came below my hips which I was hoping they would hit at my hips or just above so I was kinda disapointed they were a little too long . I think I will just throw on a belt over my tunic and pull it up to make it slightly shorter . I 'm going to wear mine with jeggings and boots this fall . Love the rich colors and thinness of the material .
 Understand that these Katahdin fleece products are unisex in size . The original order was too large as I was using a women 's sizing chart so I exchanged for a size smaller . If you have long arms , this is the jacket for you ! I love that they did n't scrimp on the length of the sleeves . I bought this product as well as the Katahdin half zip fleece and it fits the same.I have it on now and am toasty .
 But I am now ! its great , great fabric , great light weight-ness , those who suggested sizing down , kudos , arrived in good time and is incredibly warm -LRB- wisconsin -RRB-
 The fleece jacket was as describe and is very warm . Reasonably priced with quick shipping . I would buy here again .
 I 've enjoyed owning the fleece so far . I took it on a week-long trip overseas , and it held up very well . I think it performs well at a much wider range of temperatures than other fleeces I have owned . Even when the temperature started to climb , I did n't feel uncomfortable as long as I rolled the sleeves up . The only negative things so far are that , as others have noted , it would be best to wash the item before your first wearing . Otherwise , it will thoroughly coat your shirt in fuzzy lint . Also , the zipper can be a bit rough at times . I 've been careful with it , but it feels like it might break or come off track if I were less careful . All things considered , though , I 'm very pleased with this item .
 This beautiful jacket was good quality , soft fleece , washes and drys well , good price , shipped in a timely manner and in excellent condition . This is not to heavy but will keep you warm and draft free indoors .
 I have n't had a new coat in 15 years -LRB- live in the desert -RRB- and this is just perfect ! It 's so soft , fits great ... great price -LRB- got it on sale -RRB- . Picked up two - one for me and one for my husband . Hope it gets cold enough to wear !
 I bought this as a present for my brother . I had been looking all over for this exact product in all the stores I went to . This was the only place I could find it in the right color and size . I was also extremely pleased with the service and the fast delivery time .
 Nice jacket but a little smaller than I thought it would be . . But should be nice to wear when it gets really COLD in S.Calif . maybe in the 50 's . . lol
 Very stylish and warm . A great buy . It was bought for a gift , and was very well received . A great buy !
 Bought this as a gift to replace the one I hmm -LRB- took over -RRB- . Seems warn and confy like the one I took over .

 I had some compression shirts from about 5 years ago . These new ones are not the same fabric quality as they used to be , fabric is lighter and less stretchy . Despite they fit perfectly and work fine , I 'm worried about the durabilty of the shirt .
 This product is very , very comfortable . I wear it under a regular shirt during cold weather or in extremely cold air conditioning .
 i have used this shoes for a couple of weeks . Really a masterpiece . It worth every penny you spent on it . That is what I said , ADIDAS is the wonderful friend of soccer professionals . The shoes rocks your game .
 The shoes I bought didnt fit on me , so i returned it . But it seems to be a great shoes !!
 Excellent seller , everything developed with normality and the product is the original one and very but very well
 First and foremost , the dimensions of the bag are completely inaccurate.The product description states that it 's 20.5 '' x 15 '' x 7.75-12 .75 '' . The bag comes with a product tag attached to it that reflects closer to what it really is
 I just bought one of these for my Brother in Law after carrying one around Iraq and Afghanistan these last 3 years . The bag is solidly built and still shows no signs of wear and tear .
 This bag is everything I had hoped it would be
 I found this laptop bag to be everything the discription said , and then some ! There are a lot of complaints about the buckles on the strap . Frankly , I do n't see what people had problems with the buckles . They seem pretty heavy duty to me . Another plus for this bag is that , it came with an identification tag -LRB- dog tag ! -RRB- with USMC embossed on the back ! Very cool . The only problem I had was with the colors . Make sure you look up the color name on Google before you order the laptop case . Luckily , I did , and I love the color . If your thinking of getting a heavy duty laptop bag , look no further !
 I was a little worried to order this because I thought it would n't fit . It 's adjustable and not as flimsy as I imagined from reading the other reviews . I thought the bra was a nude bra though , but it 's just a cut out . Which is even sexier ! It comes with two extra hooks for the cuffs in case they break I guess ? Or if you want to change the length yourself . I am on the thinner side but I tried it on and looked just like the woman in the picture . It 's great for the price ! Buy it !
 LOVED this outfit , both of us did . I know not to spend aton of money on sexy little pieces because they are on for about 3 minutes so this was a great price !! The bra is adjustable to fit a lot of different sizes and shapes . The panties are super cute !!
 This little number is HOT !!! Not much else has to be said about it . I was really happy with my purchase especially with the reaction that came from me wearing it .
 loved it fit well my boyfriend loves it too . Finally a one size that actually fits all the way around
 I AM OK WITH THIS ITEM I THOUGHT THE BRA HAD SOME SUPPORT ON IT , BUT I LOVE THE UNDERWARE ANDTHE LACE WRIST LIKE HAND CUFFS . THATS WHAT MAKES IT EXCITEING TO WARE AND IT FITS GOOD AND , THE SHIPPINGWAS FAST AND PRICEING WAS THE BEST I HAVE TO SAY . I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ORDER FROM THE WEBSITE .
 My boyfriend absolutely loved this but the bra is really meant for people with at least C cup . It 's comfortable and super sexy
 True to size-bottoms fit size 12 bottoms , would not advise for anyone largerlace is actually stretchy . .
 This outfit is great as long as you treat it gently . It will rip fairly easy if you are playing hard . But it does look stunning .
 Loved this item . The fabric/lace was nice and soft . It fit nicely and made my husband happy too ! Would recommend this for any couple .
 I really like this outfit . I have n't been able to try it out in action , so I do n't know how it would hold up , but I took some pictures for my man and I think they look pretty hot . It 's a one size fits all and I had no problems with fit . I ca n't wait to put it to use when my man comes home .
 Product is hot like the picture , but a little overpriced considering the quality of the material . The chain connecting the neck piece to the hands is a cool idea , but it acts more like a decoration . You actually need to be careful about snapping the fabric where the chain connects.A good buy if you 're worried about getting something that wo n't fit - my girlfriend has a large bust so it 's hard to find stuff that fits . This did the trick !
 This is what you ca n't find at Victoria 's that really spice up an evening , both product and service are superb !!!
 No , this is not going to be a daily wear piece . That 's the point ! It 's sexy , exactly as advertised and a great deal for under $ 20 ! The lace a satin bow are super pretty , and the collar is stretchy , so no marks or pulling!It arrived in just a few days after purchasing -LRB- 3 , I think -RRB- and the product was in perfect condition and looked just like the picture with the model . It 's one size fits most and that worked for me -LRB- I 'm size M in panties and a large 34 B cup -RRB- . The bra has a cut out section , so I imagine it would fit most bust sizes from A cup through D . The thong is very stretchy , and so very forgiving .
 Very sexy lingerie for various sizes . Wonderful for a romantic evening with your lover . The shipping was fast and the condition great . I look forward to buy from this seller again in the future .
 Great outfit i loved the look of it on my girl.Stretch Lace Trim Sleepwear Open Cup Bra Top and Matching Thong 4253
 i got exactly what i payed for ... it fit well and me and my boyfriend have really enjoyed it . haha thank you !
 I love this piece , it fits as shown , though it is a little delicate so be gentle if you intend to reuse ... the cuffs have been snapped off the chain more than once , but they are reattached easily enough so no complaints really ... i fully endorse ! : -RRB-
 Very stylish and warm . A great buy . It was bought for a gift , and was very well received . A great buy !

 CK really shines with this item . The fabric is 93 % polyester and 7 % lycra . For me , the medium is not skin tight and that was fine -LRB- 38 inch chest , 32 inch waist -RRB- . I bought this item for outdoor running on cool -LRB- 40-60 F -RRB- but not cold days . For very cold days I still fall back on my UnderArmour version of this shirt that is much thicker , tighter and less comfortable . This one is made in Israel and the stitching is top notch .
 I just bought this hat today and all I can say that it is the best hat I 've ever bought ! It fits perfectly on your head and it looks great !

 Love the fact that it does n't squish your boobs while holding the rest of you in . I wish it was a little bit longer , and it can ride up a bit during the day , but nothing serious . For a body shaper , it is definitely one of the more comfortable ones I 've used .

 I have purchased cheaper shirts from Croft and Borrow and they do n't stand up close to these shirts . If you are buying to wear as a white t-shirt , and that 's all ... you probably should n't buy this product . I have only used these shirts as under shirts or wearing for mowing the lawn or just around the house . As silly as it sounds during the Michael Jordon commercial , it 's true . These shirts do n't get the `` bacon '' collar like other brands . If you want the undershirt to last a long time , buy these .
 They are great quality shirts.Pros
 These Hanes crew neck T shirts are very comfortable ; the smooth , super soft and preshrunk 100 % cotton will be comfortable the very first time you wear them . Moreover , the back inside of the shirt has no tag that could feel scratchy on the lower part of your neck . The information that used to be on the tag is now imprinted onto the rear inside of the shirt.In addition , the double ply neckband makes the garment stronger than ever so it lasts longer then ever ! The shirt stays tucked into your pants , pajamas or underwear shorts very well since its length comes slightly longer than the typical length . The shirts even come three to a pack for added value -- great!Just a few extra words of advice based on my experience
 I have never been a t-shirt person , but found my dress shirts were not lasting as long as I wanted . Heard wearing a t-shirt would help and started using them six months ago.Now I wear these t-shirts all the time and really like them . They are great for workouts in that they pull the sweat off my body . They 're like a second skin and very comfortable.This is a great price . I have not been able to find them cheaper . Plan to stock up , since I wear these almost daily .
 I LOVE Hanes T-shirts , my husband wears them as undershirts and I often steal them for nighttime . They were the only thing that fit me when I was nine months pregnant , and now my son and daughter wear the toddler/infant Hanes shirts.The price is unbeatable on Amazon , and the quality has been consistently good throughout the years.I do n't know what is going on with the negative reviewers , I have n't experienced shrinkage , perhaps the reviewer was getting larger ... : -RRB-
 Unlike some of their socks these T-shirts have not shrunk and fit very well.Great product !
 True to size and excelent fit . Thank you Hanes and Amazon for facilitating the transaction .
 I 've been wearing these shirts for a few months now and the neck elastic on all of them are still in great shape . Ca n't complain about the price either - much cheaper on Amazon than in stores .
 The &#34; slight imperfection &#34; detail could have been a little clearer on the description , but the shifts seem to fit and look fine .
 Some reviewers said that the quality just is n't the same it used to be and so on but I found this Hanes to be just right . I use them under my dress shirts and they are really comfy . I have already washed them a few times and they still feel like the first day . Ver happy with the price too !
 Perfect . I did n't have to go out to buy them during the busy shopping season & they were the same price as in stores .
 Our order came so fast that my husband was shocked and surprised . the order was just as stated . it was fast it was quick product was of the best quality we were surprise .
 estas camisetas son muy comodas y frescas , las puedes usar como ropa interior o hasta como para hacer deporte . buenas
 These were used for costuming purposes for our lead actor , who , despite claiming to be a medium , had plenty of room left in these shirts . Not that that 's a bad thing .
 My husband requires white teeshirts for work , and these work perfectly.They are priced nicely too , so if he gets them stained , we can replace them easily enough.Good bargain , nice fit , and they are soft too .
 I have always worn Hanes T-Shirts , These are UNDERSHIRTS and they fit and feel GREAT!Nice and Soft and they do not shrink ilke cheeper shirts would .
 Good price for Hanes tees . Not much else to say . say . say . say . say . say . say . say . say . say . say . say . say . say . say . say . say . say .
 Bought these for my husband . The size is accurate . He is normally an extra large , and these fit the shoulders well . They are a little longer than some of his other tees , which he likes for tucking in . The only reason I gave them a 4 is that-in my opinion - they are a little thin , even for an undershirt .
 I bought these shirts for my dad - he loves them and wears them under everything . The cotton is soft , and the neck is a really great size -LRB- does n't fit too snuggle , and is n't too weirdly big -RRB- . The cotton is n't too thick , either , which is great foe big guys who are always hot . These are much better than the logo tees that can sometimes show through !!
 Great fit even after washing and long enough to tuck in , no bulging at the sides which I 've experienced with more expensive T-shirts . Four stars instead of five because the collar 's a little heavier than I like .
 Other reviewers have stated their too thin , that 's the idea people , if you did n't know you were buying ` undershirts ' then you need to do more shopping in physical retail stores . my only reason for 4 stars is the mediums i ordered were a little on the big side after 1 wash , maybe they 'll shrink down later and be a little more snug or else I 'll grow a beer belly to make these shirts worthy of five stars , do not worry , I 'll make this purchase work .
 Nice fit white tee-shirt , I bought these for my son he stated their so soft and good to sleep in
 CK really shines with this item . The fabric is 93 % polyester and 7 % lycra . For me , the medium is not skin tight and that was fine -LRB- 38 inch chest , 32 inch waist -RRB- . I bought this item for outdoor running on cool -LRB- 40-60 F -RRB- but not cold days . For very cold days I still fall back on my UnderArmour version of this shirt that is much thicker , tighter and less comfortable . This one is made in Israel and the stitching is top notch .
 This is a sturdy backpack for sure . For $ 56 , I think this is going to last me quite some time and will be an investment . Great storage space inside .
 As of September 29th , it has been a year since I have had this bag . It is still holding strong and that is no easy task considering I do n't have a car and use this bag EVERY DAY on my bicycle commute . I hold a lot of gear on a regular basis , sometimes too much , and through all kinds of weather . I have noticed some of the inside liner is starting to peel away from the seams , but is no big deal . This is the second OGIO I have owned and when this finally wears out , I WILL get another . As far as this model in particular , all the specialized pockets are awesome ! It frees up the main pocket for all the large bulky items i end up hauling around . Try out an OGIO ! You will not be disappointed .
 I thought it was just going to be an over priced piece of junk , but it was totally worth it . It can carry all of my college books which weighs about 50 pounds and my computer perfectly fine .
 The back pack is great . I literally put it through hell and back as a cyclist and it still looks like new . No tears , no defects , sustainable and very spacious . It rocks !
 I took my new Ogio Metro on its first business trip . It was a complete success , and a vast improvement over carrying a traditional computer case.It fits everywhere on the plane . Having both hands , without a strap slipping off one shoulder made this business trip X10 better.I had my laptop , iPad , headphones , notebook , several magazines , chargers/cords ... basically my entire office with me , comfortably.Ogio makes a great product . -LRB- A little smaller , the Ogio Fugitive is an excellent choice in backpacks also . -RRB-
 Pretty much everything about this backpack is great . It lacks a little bit of space but its not enough to make this backpack unbuyable . It has a lot of compartments labeled and such all around it . The only problem I had was Amazon sent me brown and I paid for black , but I could n't return it because my old backpack could n't handle it anymore .
 I just replaced an OGIO Metro with an OGIO Mastermind backpack . Both look great , are well made , and comfortable and the side-entry zipper for a laptop is convenient . The Metro is fairly compact and can hold up to a 14 '' laptop . The external pockets seemed small but I found they held everything -LRB- computer power supply , Blackberry , cables , GPS -RRB- perfectly and were designed to prevent things from falling out if a zipper is not closed . Several interior pockets allow you to store/organize small items and protect them from damage . Unless you need to carry a lot of stuff or have a larger computer , the Metro is a really good choice .
 Love This backpack ! Ilove all of Ogio 's products ! Light weight ... nice padded straps . . tons of pockets/space . Perfect for just about any type of travel ! Im in the MX photography business and this is my go-to choice backpack . I also have two more Ogio bags , Terminal Rolling , and 9900 Rolling Duffel Bag Great for travel ! Highly recommend Ogio.So if your looking for a great durable backpack ... this is one is great !! OGIO Metro Backpack
 I researched bags for a bit , and decided to go with Ogio Metro . I think this bag has a lot of strong points , but a also a couple of fatal flaws . It has a nice padded side/rear pocket for your laptop which only fits 15 '' and under laptops.If you want to play it safe on what bags your laptop will fit into check out ebags . It also has a pocket inside the main compartment , that you are supposed to be able to fit a laptop in , but I have a hard enough time squeezing a magazine in it , and couldnt see much more than maybe a 12 '' laptop fitting that designated area -LRB- if that -RRB- . I love all of the random pockets great for small digital cameras , portable hard drives , cables , power supplies , randomness , & I also use the long compartment on the left side for my Umbrella -LRB- nice fit -RRB- . I do n't like how the main compartment does n't open as wide as I 'm used to.I thought it would at least hold a 12 '' vinyl record , but because of the design its impossible to fit in even with force . I have n't had any problem with lack of padding or the bag being uncomfortable while using , which I have seen other complain of ? The build of this bag is great and the warranty is even better . The extra strong handle is a nice touch . It also looks great ! I picked up the red -LRB- Burgundy -RRB- one to hopefully increase visiblity while using this while commuting on my bike .
 I 'm a frequent road warrior with `` unique '' needs in stuff transportation - my friends refer to my car as `` the place things go to die '' because I pretty much trash anything I come in contact with . I have worn out more bags in my day than I ever thought possible , and if anything lasts me more than a week I 'm fairly pleased with it.I got an Ogio Metro backpack from my workplace as part of an attendance incentive , and did n't think too much of it . Its not a bag I would have bought myself -LRB- I usually buy snowboarder backpacks due to the more rugged construction -RRB- but I 'd just worn out my messenger bag so I started using this one . I have never been more pleased with a laptop bag in my entire life.The main laptop pocket works perfect for my dell inspiron , and the inside pocket -LRB- the file pouch or whatever -RRB- fits my macbook pro like a snug glove -LRB- yes , both at once -RRB- while leaving the majority of the open section empty and ready for my stuff . A few water bottles , couple of notebooks -LRB- I use the thin 1 '' ones for most things , athough it 'd probably hold 2-3 of the `` normal '' sized ones -RRB- , some other gear , a couple paperbacks and some peripherals fit easily , there 's a couple waterproof pockets with headphone holes for my iPod and would fit a small CD-walkman if I had one , and with my blood sugar issues I LOVE the smaller side pouches because they 're perfect for a couple candy bars in case I have a sugar attack . Digital camera goes in another pocket for quick access , with its usb cable and some spare batteries in another.Padded ribbing and neopropene -LRB- sp ? -RRB- helps the comfort , along with some webbed padding in the shoulder straps . Weight distribution is good , and it survives getting thrown around in and out of my car and never has a problem . The hand grip on the top -LRB- by which I frequently drag the bag -RRB- is both comfortable and integrated into the design rather than being sewn on as an afterthought so is much more durable than most grips.Although I 'd never have bought this bag to begin with -LRB- I 'd never even HEARD of Ogio -RRB- I would buy another without hesitation and suggest it to anyone who needs a new bag even if they do n't need it for an actual laptop .
 I LOVE this bookbag . I got the Ron Burgundy Color not only because it was an absolute STEAL at $ 28.00 plus free 2 day shipping , but the color is really rich and vibrant too . I 've never owned any Ogio products so of course I read all the reviews before I bought it . And they are SPOT on.The main storage area for your books and such are pretty spacious , although my only complaint is that it 's not roomy enough ? But I guess its hard to fit 2 huge science texts , two 1.5 inch binders and another textbook -LRB- its a tight fit -RRB- The problem with this tight fit is that the books absolutely will put pressure on your laptop -LRB- pining it against ur back -RRB- , risking damage . I think if u have only a book and binder or two , then this bookbag would hold an additional laptop PERFECTLY.On the left side there two pockets . I use the bottom one to hold my contacts , solution , hand sanitizer , anti diarrhea med -LRB- for exam days , do n't ask lol -RRB- , miscellaneous stuff . The top one I stuff with about 6 granola bars and a pack of gum . On the right side , there is a tall pocket that fits a bottle of water PERFECTLY -LRB- I use a 28oz blender bottle -RRB- Or you can put a ti-83 and such there.At the top there are 2 weatherproof pockets . I have yet to test their weatherproofness though . The smaller one is the audio pocket with headphones port . If ur thinking , wont the water enter through the port ... It wont because the port doesnt open directly into the pocket . Simple and ingenious . The bigger pocket can hold cd size things . In fact I usually put my G1 phone and canon 790 IS camera in there . Fits great.Right below the main compartment where the books go is another pretty large compartment for additional storage . It 's divided into at least 6-8 additional areas of various sizes for really practical and useful storage
 I can not recommend this backpack highly enough . I got mine junior year of high school - a full seven years ago - and it 's still going strong . The only damage in all those years of lugging heavy books around , checking it a few times on airplanes , and who knows what else , is as follows
 I have had this bag for a week now and I love it . It has many compartments for pens/pencils , glasses , mp3 player , water bottle , and stuff so everything is easy to find . I also like the fact that it has a large undivided main compartment . That makes it possible to carry an assortment of different sized books and binders . My laptop travels in a different bag so I use the laptop sleeve for notepads and folders . I have found this to be much more comfortable than the single strap messenger bag I usually carry to school . I like that there are a couple of water proof pockets and that one is easily big enough for a TI calculator . I have recommended this bag to friends and would certainly buy this bag again myself .
 i am happy to have gotten such a great backpack i can tell it will last a good while . i am taking it to Africa so it better last .
 This is my 3rd time buying this backpack ! I have had this same style for about 8 years and I ca n't find any better setup . These are very durable backpacks that I use every single day of the year on many different journey 's .
 As I 've gotten older it has been harder to find soccer shorts that are made of material that is this thin . They are comfortable and breathable , and they -LRB- so far -RRB- have held up well in the wash . And you definitely ca n't beat the price . I 've actually ordered several pairs in different colors to have around for practice . I 'd recommend them to anyone .
 In looking through the internet for a pair of Umbro style soccer shorts like I had back in the late 80 's or early 90 's I found these . Very happy thus far . They are more satin sheen vs. the checker board Umbro but appear to be built about the same . Not too long , not too short and no inner liner . Very comfortable , and thus far very happy with the purchase . I would recommend them if you are searching for what I was initially .
 Certainly the price was right ! So I ordered two pairs -LRB- navy with gold stripes and white with black stripes -RRB- . Good decision ! I was a little surprised about the nylon material
 the whole line that I bought were of good quality . I could not find these in athletic stores . I like the material and I bought several colors
 They are super cheap , when you open it they look cloth and material looks very shiny but they awersome for when you play soccer or run ! love them ! specially the price !
 I bought a pair on a whim , due to the price , but have since bought several more pairs ... they are comfortable , lightweight , loose fitting with a forgiving waistband , yet not `` balloonish '' I was a little skeptical because of the nylon material , but it definitely works ... they are now my favorite gym shorts
 complete freedom of movement , can do high kicks , knees , etc , no binding of fabric . really comfortable .
 I have ordered these soccer shorts from this company before . The shorts are very good for the money that they are being sold for . They are very comfortable and perfect for doing any kind of excercise . You have plenty of mobility and comfort in order for you to play or excercise to your best capabilities . I highly recomend these .
 Comfortable , well made , nice colors . I bought a couple of different pairs . True to size as well . My husband would wear this daily if he could . Good quality product at a reasonable price . Thanks !
 I bought these shorts because I had some exactly like them made by the big `` U - '' manufacturer , which were starting to show their age . Well-made shorts , I am able to move well in them . The only thing lacking -LRB- which my other shorts have -RRB- is a back pocket to put my keys/phone/wallet / etc. . If I had that , I could give 5 stars .
 Just purchased these for my husband and he loves them . Great nylon material keeps him cool while he 's working around the house or running in them . I purchased 5 pairs in assorted colors . They also wash up great . Definitely recommend !
 Terrific product . Shipped very quickly . Was exactly as described . While not really expensive , the price was definitely worth the quality !
 I live in the deep South and I wear these mainly to work in the yard . They are light weight and fit well .
 These are excellent athletic shorts . Many shorts of this variety are cotton blends with exposed fibers . This makes them collect and display sweat trails very evidently . The Vashon are comfortable and fit extremely well . Most importantly , they move with the athlete . You can wear boxers or briefs with them without any tug or pull when running .
 I received my shorts super fast . They fit perfect and the colors are so vibrant . They are just like umbros but a fraction of the price . Could n't be happier with my purchase . I will be buying more !!
 The noly tinny coment , this is a little bit largest than I prefered this kind of shorts , but in general those are a wonderful option to play and to run , and even only to use at home
 My daughter likes to wear these around the house and for sleeping . They are soft and wash great . She likes them long and loose to so even though she 's a thin size 3 ususally , we bought the Adult-M . Perfect ! Should have bought more !
 I am pleased with the fit and feel of these shorts . Allows for range of motion while preforming physical training exercises .
 Great product . Thinner than I expected , but still good quality . They come in colors that can be hard to find locally .
 I SENT THE SHORTS BACK FOR A BIGGER SIZE , AND I NEVER HEARD BACK FROM THEM ... . WILL I GET A REFUND ...
 These are quality shirts that will help relive your golden years when going to Polk High meant something .
 Good replica of Al Bundy 's Polk High gearSize a little bigger than expected
 I am always amazed at how many Married with Children fans are out there . I have owned this for a few years and has held up very well , and one of my favorite shirts along with the NO'MAAM shirt.Buy this shirt if you are a Married with Children fan .
 I just bought this hat today and all I can say that it is the best hat I 've ever bought ! It fits perfectly on your head and it looks great !
 I have been wearing the Goddess Longline since I was 15 . The longline eliminates back fat and lifts and separates your breasts very nicely while promoting great posture . I look about 20 pounds thinner ! Though I wear a DD , I have never had back problems because I get the support I need .

 I 've looked a round for the perfect gym bag and decided on this one . I love it as it 's the perfect size , and the color 's not bad either ! The shoe pocket is big enough for a pair of ladies ' sneakers , plus a pair of sandals/slippers - perfect for the gym or as a weekender . The bag 's well-made and it looks like it 'll last me a long time . A big plus - the price is right !
 Very stylish and warm . A great buy . It was bought for a gift , and was very well received . A great buy !
 Bought this as a gift to replace the one I hmm -LRB- took over -RRB- . Seems warn and confy like the one I took over .
 Understand that these Katahdin fleece products are unisex in size . The original order was too large as I was using a women 's sizing chart so I exchanged for a size smaller . If you have long arms , this is the jacket for you ! I love that they did n't scrimp on the length of the sleeves . I bought this product as well as the Katahdin half zip fleece and it fits the same.I have it on now and am toasty .
 But I am now ! its great , great fabric , great light weight-ness , those who suggested sizing down , kudos , arrived in good time and is incredibly warm -LRB- wisconsin -RRB-
 The fleece jacket was as describe and is very warm . Reasonably priced with quick shipping . I would buy here again .
 I 've enjoyed owning the fleece so far . I took it on a week-long trip overseas , and it held up very well . I think it performs well at a much wider range of temperatures than other fleeces I have owned . Even when the temperature started to climb , I did n't feel uncomfortable as long as I rolled the sleeves up . The only negative things so far are that , as others have noted , it would be best to wash the item before your first wearing . Otherwise , it will thoroughly coat your shirt in fuzzy lint . Also , the zipper can be a bit rough at times . I 've been careful with it , but it feels like it might break or come off track if I were less careful . All things considered , though , I 'm very pleased with this item .
 This beautiful jacket was good quality , soft fleece , washes and drys well , good price , shipped in a timely manner and in excellent condition . This is not to heavy but will keep you warm and draft free indoors .
 I have n't had a new coat in 15 years -LRB- live in the desert -RRB- and this is just perfect ! It 's so soft , fits great ... great price -LRB- got it on sale -RRB- . Picked up two - one for me and one for my husband . Hope it gets cold enough to wear !
 I bought this as a present for my brother . I had been looking all over for this exact product in all the stores I went to . This was the only place I could find it in the right color and size . I was also extremely pleased with the service and the fast delivery time .
 Nice jacket but a little smaller than I thought it would be . . But should be nice to wear when it gets really COLD in S.Calif . maybe in the 50 's . . lol

 CK really shines with this item . The fabric is 93 % polyester and 7 % lycra . For me , the medium is not skin tight and that was fine -LRB- 38 inch chest , 32 inch waist -RRB- . I bought this item for outdoor running on cool -LRB- 40-60 F -RRB- but not cold days . For very cold days I still fall back on my UnderArmour version of this shirt that is much thicker , tighter and less comfortable . This one is made in Israel and the stitching is top notch .

 Beautiful sweater ; exceeded expectation in quality for the price . Only negative note , I was not informed there would be duty charges COD from US to Canada . An additional $ 21.00 on top of an already high $ 40 shipping charge .

 I recieved the product much quicker than expected , and it was in as good a conditon as anything I could have bought in the store , for about ten dollars less . I 'm not sure how Amazon can do it for less than the manufactures web site , but I 'm not looking that particular `` gift horse in the mouth '' . I 've been wearing this bra for years and love it . It gives the support I need and looks good and is super comfortable . Ordering it from Amazon makes it a heck of a lot more affordable too .
 After years of using wired bras , I found these and have used nothing else for at least 15 years . What more can I say ? They fit perfectly , and I have them in all colors .
 I have been wearing this model bra for years and am so greatful that I can still get it . So many things that we use we take for granted and then , when we ca n't get them any longer , we actually go into a small type of depression . No kidding ... . we do ! Back to the point ... . which is the quality of this bra is far superior to so many others . Bali really gets it when it comes to the way this bra is made . In short ... this bra is the most comfortable uplifting experience of my adult life .
 This is a great bra . It supports me and it is very comfortable . There is no annoying wire . I even wear it to work out .
 I love this bra because it 's comfortable , has great support , & lasts . The adjustable shoulder straps stay where you put them rather than self-adjusting like so many other styles . With proper fitting , the back strap also stays put providing great support . I do n't care for the little bow in the front b/c with some tops , it 's too bulky , so I cut them off .
 This bra is a perfect fit for me . It is so comfortable and I love the support . I kept the information so I can order the same one next time . Ordering from Amazon was an added convenience . I could read reviews before purchasing and get free shipping .
 I needed a supporting , lifting , shaping , and comfortable bra . This was the best bra for me till now . There are so many bras looks similar to this . So , I checked the product code and ordered one more .
 This bra does n't cut in your sides has plenty of support and it has four hooks in the back for added protection .
 The order came on time and the product was what I wanted . The bra is comfortable and holds up to many washings .
 Received my package from Amazon very quickly and I tried this bra on and was really impressed with how comfortable it is . It fits nice . I have trouble finding bras that fit me comfortably . I also want to thank those who wrote a review . I bought this one based on what you said about it and I am glad I did .
 I love this bra . It stretches inall the right places and supports where you need it . It is soft and comfortable . The only thing I would recommend for improvement is a slightly wider band at the bottom . Otherwise , great .
 I 'm throwing all my other bras away . This bra is the best I 've found for my size , 38DD . I love that it does n't have underwires gives great support and best of all pushes you together rather than out , creating a lovely silhouette .
 Do n't be fooled by the thin straps - this is a great soft-cup bra for large-busted women . Most of the support comes from the band , as it should , so the straps do n't dig . It gives good support and definition without uncomfortable wires . I wear a 36DD and this bra is great for workouts and everyday wear . Like all bras , it does need a little breaking-in so do n't judge it by how it feels for the first few times you wear it . It 's also quite durable , I have four of them , and two are a few years old but still give great support and have n't worn out . My only quibble is that I wish it was seamless , as I have sensitive skin . But I tried on dozens of bras at Macy 's , both wire and underwire , and this one was not only the most comfortable , it also looks the best . A great all-purpose bra and highly recommended for large-busted women . It runs true to my measured size - always a plus .
 It has been a challenge finding bras without bones , smaller cups and comfortable . Had one of these , finally stopped looking and bought 3 more on line . Am a 42c and most of it in my back . These are so comfortable that I have fallen asleep in them and not compelled to tear them off as soon as I get home !
 I wear a 44D and felt I was always sagging by the end of the day . The stretch straps , which I thought I needed for comfort , were actually not giving me the lift I needed . This bra has great support and is very comfortable . I put my Playtex bras away and wear only this brand and style .
 This is a good bra , for the price . It 's comfortable , well-made , and provides good support .
 I just received my Bali Women 's Double Support Wire-Free Bra # 3820 , tried it on and I love it!Hey , I really needed the support -LRB- 40 D -RRB- , its wire free and the makes me look 25 again !! A great look and feels great ! I am pleased ! I will buy more of the Bali Women 's Double Support Wire-Free Bra # 3820 only . Thanks
 I have probably owned 6 or 8 of this particular bra style -LRB- # 3820 -RRB- in the past 10 years or so . I try on other brands and other styles when I shop , but I always come back to this one . I wear a 34D . They are very comfortable to me and in my opinion they give a very natural appearance .
 It 's hard to find bras that do n't have underwires but still provide support . This bra has no underwires , is comfortable and is very supportive . It 's also nice that the strap adjustments are in front so you do n't have to take the bra off to adjust them . I 've worn this Bali Double Support for years and love it .
 I love this bra ! It is so comfortable and provides wonderful support!Hint
 This is without a doubt the most comfortable and long-lasting bra on the market . I 've worn this style for years and years .
 This is the second time I have bought this bra because it is one of my favorites . It fits great and the material feels nice . I read in another review that it was not liked because it made the reviewer look pointy . It does not make me look pointy .
 I have been wearing this bra for years . I find it comfortable . It support well , not as good as a wireless but easier to wear all day .
 This is a good no-wire support bra . The manufacturer needs to use better elastic - the elastic used is too narrow for this type of bra and it gets lots of fuzzies on it eventhough I wash it by hand and line dry . It 's a mfg. mistake to continue to use this inferior material in s uch a well made other wise great bra .
 This is a neat bra . Fits great through the back and looks good under t-shirts . The best thing is the STRAPS DO N'T SLIP !
 I purchased this bra because being top heavy underwire bras are sometimes uncomfortable . This bra is very comfortable and very supportive of the girls.i wish this bra came in other colores for dd girls . I will purchase this bra again and would recommend to friends .
 I love this bra . it is comfortable and fits very well for the mature figure .
 I love these bras and I live an hour and a half from any JC Penny , so it is just as easy for me to go on Amazon and order them from there . they get here quickly , in one piece and I love them AND Amazon .
 That 's all I really need to say to women , is n't it ? Otherwise , it 's your basic great support , well-fitting bra . Come to think of it , I have n't had one of these in , well , forever . It does give a little Madonna on tour/cone effect but it 's pretty slight . Would I buy it again ? Oh yeah ... good straps and comfort are hard to find !
 This is a very comfortible bra , that offers great support and is a joy to wear all day long . I intend to buy more of the same bra , in the other colors offered . Dealing with Amazon was wonderful , the shipping was fast and the product was delivered as stated in the ad .
 This is a wonderful bra for women with full breasts that do n't like underwire bras . It is very well made .
 The bra is very supportive and comfortable , but the cup is a little bit on the big side and is n't smooth .
 I really like this bra , being a c-d I bought the c and it fits perfect
 Fits well and does what it is supposed to do . I love the comfort and the color .
 This is the most comfortable bra I have ever owned and I 'm 62 . Usually I have to take my bra off first thing when I get home . This gives good support for the larger breasted woman , is well constructed and a good value , plus it came in my hard to find size .
 This is a great product always makes me happy . Just one thing I ordered white and received pink but will live with it .
 Have been looking for a bra to replace my older ones , it has taken over 2 years but this one does it and they are great ... ordered 2 more . and plan to order more .
 After looking for many years for an unpadded bra , I found this Bali support , wire-free bra that is perfect for me.Comfort is the key to a good fit at any age , but when you are in your 70s , it is a must.Thank you Amazon for getting this package to me so quickly .
 This bra was a perfect fit . I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could order a bra without trying it on an get it to fit perfectly . I will use this service again .
 Great bra ! Fast delivery on product ! Will place more orders soon ! The support of this Balli bra is substantial . It washes/drys very well . Thank you !
 This is the most supportive wire-free bra I 've ever worn ! I do feel ` lifted ' and and it is so comfortable ! This is a great bra ! It is made of a silky material which gives a smooth appearance , with no seams running across the middle of the cup.I like this bra so much I have ordered three more in different colors .
 I love these bali bras . No under wires but sufficient support-a favorite of mine for years and the price was great .
 It is the only bra that fits me and I have difficulty getting it in stores . I 'm glad I can purchase it online .
 This is a wonder product and I think it is the best fitting bra that I have . It is very comfortable and offers a lot of support . I would highly recommend this bra to anyone looking for those qualities in a bra .
 Very comfortable , supportive & wire-free . Dried overnight in hotel rooms in Europe , very pleased with product .
 I have worn this style bra for years . I like that it dose n't have wires and the double support is great
 This bra gives the support I 've been searching for without skipping comfort , at an extremely reasonable price . Highly recommended !!!!
 I have been wearing the same style bra for years and have purchased from others online and have had a problem with the fit ... this is by far the best fit and most comfortable bra I have gotten ... vendor will definately be book marked for future purchases.I did have a problem with shipping BUT when I called customer service they were most cooperative in tracking the shipment and keeping me informed ... it was well worth the extra few days wait !!!!
 Despite the fact that I have large breasts , I still avoid underwire as I find it way too uncomfortable . This bra fit nicely , and offered support , but was a bit too tight girth-wise . Still a very good bra !
 I hate shopping for bras . I can spend hours trying to find my size at 3 or 4 stores . When I find one , I take it home to try and wear it for a few days . Then if I like it , I can never find more like it . I was so excited to be able to put in the brand and model number on Amazon and find it . I 'm not sure that the price was so great , but just to be able to get what I want without spending so much time and gas to find it is wonderful . The bra is comfortable , has just enough support and is light weight .
 I bought these several years ago and they are durable and comfortable.They are good value for the money , best deal on shipping .
 This is a great bra with great support . I usually purchased underwire bras but this one is excellent , I purchased another , that 's how great this bra is !
 -LSB- ... -RSB- it 's difficult to find a bra that fits . I finally found a bra that fits with this one . I like it so much . I feel confident and supported , and it does not show . I can finally enjoy a comfortable bra and be proud of it . I do n't know how to express my feelings of wearing this bra at home , school , or wherever . Confidence can do anything to -LSB- ... -RSB- , and this elegant brassiere has gone a long way .
 I wore them for years and could not find them in the stores . Also , the price was much better than in the stores .
 This bra is the most comfortable bra I have ever worn . . It gives good support and it does n't pinch or bind like some do . . This is the one bra I buy the most . . I have tried others but they just were n't as nice as this one .
 I WILL ORDER MORE MORE MORE I LOVE THIS BALI BAR 100 % A MUST HAVE NO UNDERWIRE AND IT FEELS GREAT ON
 I 've worn this style for years - it comes in several useful shades and fits comfortably . It is especially good for those of us that find underwires uncomfortable and are simply looking for a proper lift and easy movement . It is seamless and double layered so maintains modesty for us shy women .
 I worked in the lingerie department at a major store when I was a teenager . We were given samples of the products and I got to try all the brands . The Bali 3820 is the only one that was consistently comfortable . So , for 30 years now it has been the only bra I will buy . I can buy them on-line and be sure they will fit .
 I 've been wearing Bali bras for years and I think they are great . I 've tried other over the years but these bras have the best fit and support .
 Very happy that I found this bra . I 've been searching the stores and was unable to find it.No problem getting my size and had it in a few days .
 Bought this because I was undergoing radiation treatments for breast cancer and they said not to use a bra with an underwire . It is very comfortable and fits great even without the underwire . Still had good support but it did take a little while to get used to such thick straps . At least I did n't have to worry about straps falling down . I liked it better than the sport 's bras they recommended that I use since it has hooks for easy on and off instead of having to pull it over my head . The pretty silky fabric was a plus and I can see me using this even after treatments are over .
 Best bra . Super comfortable . No irritation ! Been wearing forever , will not go with any other brand of bra ! Definitely worth buying !
 Great fit ! Need to order more . There 's nothing more to say about this . I think I have 3 more words here : -RRB-
 This is a very comfortable bra and very durable , I have been wearing this bra for many years and it holds up very well .
 I am skeptic about buying cloths online but I thout I will give a try . And I am not disappointed . I just got my bra today . The bra made really nicely , fits perfectly and gives a really good support . I got this bra for sleep in and I ca n't wait to use it for this purpose . It is a great bra for a great price.Update
 I have been wearing Bali bras for years now and I love the way they fit and feel . Great quality and great comfort ! Got a spectacular price here on Amazon with free shipping , too !
 I wear a girdle every day - it holds in my tummy but gives me man boobs . I wear a bra forsupport and to shape my breasts . The Bali 3820 double support is wonderful . I wear a 40 Bcup and fill the cups fully - no padding , no pushup and no falsies . My bra makes me standtaller and I am not at all self consciou . With gridle and bra on I look and feel greatin my clothes - women 's underwear does just provide the support I need and the shaping Iwant . Would not leave home without my foundations - also - do wear stockings to hold myOBG down -LRB- black -RRB- and panties -LRB- pink -RRB- to make it easy to pull on .
 `` ex '' has been looking for and needing new bra 's for some time . had bali before and really liked them . wanted wire-free . only problem was could n't find them or her size at most stores -LRB- she is kinda small , 34b i think , though i never minded :--RRB- . anyways , finally found what she was looking for but they wanted over $ 30 each . told her to wait and i would check online . found them on amazon for half the price !!!! bought two of them for the price of what it would have cost in the store for one . plus buying two i was eligible for free shipping . `` ex '' really likes them , soft and wireless , perfect fit . as for me personally ... do n't know . she would n't model them for me :--LRB- part of our problem . would definitely order again , or should i say make her order her own !
 This bra is the most comfortable bra and best fitting one you will ever wear . I highly recommend it to anyone .
 I 've purchased Bali attire for many years . I 'm always happy with it.This product came quickly , as advertised - I 'm pleased with the product and with the vendor .
 I am used to wearing an underwire bra but decided to try this out . It 's comfortable for me -LRB- a 34DD -RRB- without digging into my ribcage for traction . It does have a bit of `` tube '' concerns . If you are not wearing it with a t-shirt or close fitting sweater , it is terrific . Comfortable , lightweight and easy to hook makes a great choice for the full chested woman .
 I was amazed when my daughter taught me that I could buy the bras I 'd worn for years at Amazon ! I thought Amazon was just for books and records . I ordered them and they came exactly as I wanted . Wow!Now I see on the Product Search list how versatile Amazon truly is . Thanks .
 I am full figured and a D cup and this is the only bra I will buy . I totally disagree with the person who said it gave no support . It supports very well . And it 's comfortable . The last thing I want is underwires sticking me all day . This bra is excellent .
 This bra is very comfortable to wear and it fits well . It is also very durable .
 I knew this was a good bra and the price was less than I had paid before .
 Best bra I 've ever bought . Been wearing this brand at least 9 yrs . Also have the spa closure but still like this one best . Bra brands can talk about how they lift & separate but they have nothing on Bali 's Double Support . These are wirefree , but they do have a small stay on each side under the arm . Might try other bras but will wear these as long as they make them .
 I was sorta skeptical when I got this bra . But it proved to be the best bra I ever wore ! Love the light blue color that I got and its really smooth to the touch on the cups . Liked that the adjustable straps were in front . Also love the little bow in the middle . Will definitely buy the pink and white ones . Thank goodness I do n't have to wear under wire to get the support I need . I did n't even notice I had it on ! And thankfully no red marks on my shoulders or itchiness anywhere.Hope they never discontinue this bra !!!!
 I 'm a lady that truly hates to shop ... and go only when is absolutely necessary . Like to buy good when I go though so I can delay going again as long as possible . Belk 's or Penney 's is where I have always bought my lingerie and once I find a brand/style I like ... keep buying the same over and over . This time when I bought my style of bra I thought it was a good buy ... thought the sign said buy one get one free ... however , when got to register was buy one and get one half off . That meant I paid over $ 50 for two bras . This is when I decided I needed to get over my fears of shopping on line and see what I could find . So I typed in my bra style # and the rest is history ... saved $ 20 on the two bras and took the ones I bought at Penney 's back . Also , discovered while rambling through your Amazon store that Shadowline lingerie is selling on line now . I have to say I was more happy than a person should be over finding her favorite brand of bloomers ... but I was ... simply because I just could n't find anything as comfortable as the ones I had been wearing for years . I had gone to the close out plant sale here in our town and bought up all I could a few years back and knew the time was coming I would have to settle for something of less quality . My experience with Amazon was for sure 5 stars ... and for someone that hates to shop as much as me ... I could give more stars because it was just that easy . Now can buy the quality of products and brands I trust without leaving my chair . The bali bra I bought is a very good quality bra ... have worn this style for years ... great no seam silky smooth material and as comfortable as can be . Shipping was fast and free and they kept me posted by email all through the process . I want to thank folks that take the time to write reviews ... nothing like real experiences to help readers/shoppers make purchasing decisions .
 I have been buying this brand and style bra for years because of the comfort and support I get from them . When I found out that they were available at Amazon.com and for an better price than I had been paying I was very pleasantly surprized . One of the many things that I really like about this style bra is that it does n't have any seams that run across the nipple area of the inside of the bra . Bras with those seams are very uncomfortable to me and I end up getting sore . I highly recommend these Bali Women 's Double Support Wire-free bra . If you want comfort and support these are the bra for you .
 I thought the Bail Women 's Double Support Wire-Free Bra was comfortable and supportive . I liked how it did not squeeze or pinch me . It looked great under my clothing with a smooth look . After washing it still looked good . I am very satisfied with my purchase and would buy more .
 I have always liked Bali bras and this bra has the same comfort and support as previous Bali bras . The straps do n't slip , which is very important to me . This is a very good bra for the price and I would recommend highly .
 I have been wearing this bra for many years , in many different sizes over the years , love this bra , great fit , NO WIRES , yeah ... , very comfortable bra ...
 Have been wearing these Bali Bras for several years and love the way they fit & their style . Just hope they do n't discontinue them as often happens when you find something you like .
 Highly recommend Bali . These are the most comfortable bra 's I have found . They last through many washing without losing there shape and support . I will be a Bali fan for life !
 Very comfortable!I 've worn this stye for several years . Thankfully , they have , so far , not changed the pattern and/or sizing .
 I have been wearing this model bra for years . I love this bra . In the stores it is twice as much but on amazon it 's like getting buy one get one free . Truly this is the most comfortable flattering bra I 've ever worn and best thing support with no under wires . Ta da .
 I just got my bra today . I love the fact there is 4 hooks on the back . The bra it self is made very nicely . I did put the bra on and it didnt fit perfect but it was a close fit . It shipped fast . The price is good . I would recomend the bra .
 good support , comfortable fit , like the colors , good for full figure women or smaller cup size figures . i like it
 This bra is true to its sizing by the manufacturer . The only drawback I have is that the shoulder straps once extended fully have no &#34; give &#34; in them .
 This fits great and feels great , has a wide band to hold the back down even if you have a heavy load . The cups are not that ` formed ' so I wo n't wear this under clingy sweaters . So it is perfect for what I wanted , but maybe not for work or clingy tops !
 Very happy with the bra I received . It was just what I expected . I hope to order more at another time .
 Pretty ; shapes well ; comfortable . Wish there were fewer back snaps , but fits well and does n't pull on my shoulders . Washed well - held its shape . Could even be called sexy !
 I am very happy with the t-shirt which is a very good quality with a great message .
 I am very happy with the t-shirt which is a very good quality with a great message .
 Very stylish and warm . A great buy . It was bought for a gift , and was very well received . A great buy !
 Bought this as a gift to replace the one I hmm -LRB- took over -RRB- . Seems warn and confy like the one I took over .
 Understand that these Katahdin fleece products are unisex in size . The original order was too large as I was using a women 's sizing chart so I exchanged for a size smaller . If you have long arms , this is the jacket for you ! I love that they did n't scrimp on the length of the sleeves . I bought this product as well as the Katahdin half zip fleece and it fits the same.I have it on now and am toasty .
 But I am now ! its great , great fabric , great light weight-ness , those who suggested sizing down , kudos , arrived in good time and is incredibly warm -LRB- wisconsin -RRB-
 The fleece jacket was as describe and is very warm . Reasonably priced with quick shipping . I would buy here again .
 I 've enjoyed owning the fleece so far . I took it on a week-long trip overseas , and it held up very well . I think it performs well at a much wider range of temperatures than other fleeces I have owned . Even when the temperature started to climb , I did n't feel uncomfortable as long as I rolled the sleeves up . The only negative things so far are that , as others have noted , it would be best to wash the item before your first wearing . Otherwise , it will thoroughly coat your shirt in fuzzy lint . Also , the zipper can be a bit rough at times . I 've been careful with it , but it feels like it might break or come off track if I were less careful . All things considered , though , I 'm very pleased with this item .
 This beautiful jacket was good quality , soft fleece , washes and drys well , good price , shipped in a timely manner and in excellent condition . This is not to heavy but will keep you warm and draft free indoors .
 I have n't had a new coat in 15 years -LRB- live in the desert -RRB- and this is just perfect ! It 's so soft , fits great ... great price -LRB- got it on sale -RRB- . Picked up two - one for me and one for my husband . Hope it gets cold enough to wear !
 I bought this as a present for my brother . I had been looking all over for this exact product in all the stores I went to . This was the only place I could find it in the right color and size . I was also extremely pleased with the service and the fast delivery time .
 Nice jacket but a little smaller than I thought it would be . . But should be nice to wear when it gets really COLD in S.Calif . maybe in the 50 's . . lol

 Got so many compliments on the wings all night for Halloween ! It made my devil costume perfectly wicked !
 Beautiful sweater ; exceeded expectation in quality for the price . Only negative note , I was not informed there would be duty charges COD from US to Canada . An additional $ 21.00 on top of an already high $ 40 shipping charge .
 I bought this as a Halloween costume for my 4year old son . -LRB- He was a knight and his little brother was a dragon . -RRB- It 's so cute ! What a great find ! I looked at tons of toddler knight costumes , finally decided on this one and was very happy with that decision because it fit my son well and -LRB- with a few small adjustments -RRB- was just what we wanted . I simply velcro * one of my sons hats into the helmet -LRB- facing backwards/bill in back so it fit the helmet nice and discreetly -RRB- , so that the helmet would stay on his head . I also velcroed the face-mask part so that it was up -LRB- it would not stay up on its own -RRB- , my son did n't want it over his face all of the time -LRB- quite understandable -RRB- . Also my son was a little bothered by the shoulder things and took them off for part of the time while he was at school , and it still looked good without them anyway . * Velcro can be bought for a few bucks at any craft store , I had a long strip of Velcro with self-adhesive -LRB- sticker-like -RRB- backing you just cut to size .
 My son loves this costume . It fit him perfectly -LRB- at 2 1/2 -RRB- . The only drawback is it is a one piece , and is very fitting , so not easy for little ones using the potty.The helmet is really too large for him to wear , plus he hates it being over his face , and the shoulder pieces do n't stay on that long . But that can be expected with 2-3 yr olds .
 Costume feels cheap but I was impressed with how great it looked once on . The helmut that came with it was really flimsy and big so we used one we had from the dollar store which was much sturdier . I think this costume looks better than the ones I 've seen at places like Target but it also costs more .
 Lots of compliments at Halloween this year ! It LOOKS heavy and expensive , however its very lightweight . My little boy did n't like wearing the helmet . Also , Id recommend buying 1 size bigger .
 This was the most adorable costume I have EVER seen on a toddler boy . Very well made , cute as a button , and very masculine looking . I would rate this costume a 10 on the amazon star scale if I could . Definitely recommend .
 Small sizing . Also , it was weird that the outfit was so small but the helmet was huge . It was a cute costume , but there is nothing inside the helmet to keep it on so my son did n't even wear it .
 I got this costume for my two year old son . My son normally wears 2t clothes , so I ordered the 2t size and it fit great . Since it was pretty cold this Halloween we even had room to layer some fleece pajamas under the costume . Like one of the other reviewers suggested I bought some velcro -LRB- got mine at Walmart -RRB- to reinforce the not quite up to par velcro the suit came with . Great value for the price and my son loved it . Also the extra velcro made it harder -LRB- not impossible -RRB- for my son to pull the pieces off
 As many pointed out , the costume is good but not exceptional.The material is fine , it fits well , but the shoulder pads fall easily since they went for velcro instead of a more simple solution -LRB- like a couple of straps with pressure/stud buttons -RRB- ; the helmet was flimsy but nice ; no problems with the chest piece -LRB- also attached with velcro but seems to hold better , due the limited mobility -RRB- . The sword in the picture is not included.Overall a good costume , considering the cheaper alternatives .
 When I took this costume out of the bag I was dissapointed with the quality . However once I put this on my son I was thrilled . It looks really cute and much more quality on . I guess if they used a more sturdy contruction for the &#34; metal &#34; pieces it would be too heavy for the child . My only complaint is that the chest and shoulder plates are attached by velcro and my son liked to pull them off . I wish they were attached in such a way that he could n't do that . However even with the pieces off the costume was still cute and we managed to keep them on and get him to wear the hat long enough for a couple of cute pictures . Note-I ordered a size 2T for my 18 month old and it fit perfectly . He 's in the 97th percentile for height and 80th for weight .
 When I first got it out of the box it looked a little cheaper than the online picture , but it was so cute on . We got a lot of compliments and it was the only one like that I saw .
 My four-year-old loved this costume -- especially the dragon on the chest , the helmet , and the sword -LRB- bought separately -RRB- . And I got to have my knight in shining armor ! The costume seemed to run a little small . The helmet was too big and did n't stay on well , I ended up carrying it most of the time while trick-or-treating . But overall , it was a success and got some great pictures !
 HIGH QUALITY , TRUE TO SIZE , WOULD MAKE ANOTHER PURCHASE , DID NOT LIKE TO PAY FOR SHIPPING

 This beautiful jacket was good quality , soft fleece , washes and drys well , good price , shipped in a timely manner and in excellent condition . This is not to heavy but will keep you warm and draft free indoors .
 I have n't had a new coat in 15 years -LRB- live in the desert -RRB- and this is just perfect ! It 's so soft , fits great ... great price -LRB- got it on sale -RRB- . Picked up two - one for me and one for my husband . Hope it gets cold enough to wear !
 I bought this as a present for my brother . I had been looking all over for this exact product in all the stores I went to . This was the only place I could find it in the right color and size . I was also extremely pleased with the service and the fast delivery time .
 Nice jacket but a little smaller than I thought it would be . . But should be nice to wear when it gets really COLD in S.Calif . maybe in the 50 's . . lol
 Very stylish and warm . A great buy . It was bought for a gift , and was very well received . A great buy !
 Bought this as a gift to replace the one I hmm -LRB- took over -RRB- . Seems warn and confy like the one I took over .
 I am very happy with the t-shirt which is a very good quality with a great message .
 Understand that these Katahdin fleece products are unisex in size . The original order was too large as I was using a women 's sizing chart so I exchanged for a size smaller . If you have long arms , this is the jacket for you ! I love that they did n't scrimp on the length of the sleeves . I bought this product as well as the Katahdin half zip fleece and it fits the same.I have it on now and am toasty .
 But I am now ! its great , great fabric , great light weight-ness , those who suggested sizing down , kudos , arrived in good time and is incredibly warm -LRB- wisconsin -RRB-
 The fleece jacket was as describe and is very warm . Reasonably priced with quick shipping . I would buy here again .
 I 've enjoyed owning the fleece so far . I took it on a week-long trip overseas , and it held up very well . I think it performs well at a much wider range of temperatures than other fleeces I have owned . Even when the temperature started to climb , I did n't feel uncomfortable as long as I rolled the sleeves up . The only negative things so far are that , as others have noted , it would be best to wash the item before your first wearing . Otherwise , it will thoroughly coat your shirt in fuzzy lint . Also , the zipper can be a bit rough at times . I 've been careful with it , but it feels like it might break or come off track if I were less careful .

 pull the adjuster tight and you 've got some serious cleavage . leave it loose and you 've still got great support and shape . The padding is a little thick but that 's not all bad . The fabric does n't breathe very well so I 'd just use this for going out and not all day wear .
 Great socks so far !!! My daughter loves them . Very warm and the color has n't faded on them after several washes . Very cute too !!! Worth the money
 I am very happy with the t-shirt which is a very good quality with a great message .
 I really like the shirts but the sizes are way off everyone I have ordered has beena size and some two sizes smaller.Everything I have gotten has run on the small sideI wear a XL in most every shirt I own I like really baggy shirts for congealed carry purposeI ordered 2XL and they were more like a 1XL or in some cases a large all were on the smaller side but the shirts them selfs are great great looking and kool pictures and graphics and nice just the sizing problem .
 i purchase this same shirt in Key West , FL . and i love it . the detail of this shirt is on the front and the back . . the fabric is smooth like a silk . its right now one of my favorite shirts
 The Ogio Flux is a great backpack . I got the burgandy one and it is an attractive bag . I am endlessly in love with all the little pockets . The little audio pocket at the top might be the best idea ever . I also love that the front pocket is big enough to hold my bike lock . I have seen reviews where people complain about the handle strap on the top rubs thier necks , but it does not rub mine . It 's actually kind of cool . I 'm not sure why that is a problem for some people ? Maybe they have fat necks or they just need to loosen the straps . Anyway , I heart my new backpack !

 the jacket is nice for the price ; very fluffy , verry verry light -LRB- which i like -RRB- ; you feel like you do n't even have it on you ; the only drawback is it is a little bit small for its stated size ; you might want to order one size up your normal size ... overall , it is a good buy .
 This was a great buy for me . It 's thin , but quite warm . Great for packing as well if you 're on the go . The only downside was it 's a bit small for the size -- if you plan to wear fleece or sweatshirt for layering you might want to get a bigger size . Otherwise , this is a great bargain !!
 Los compre para la novia de un amigo , les parecieron excelentes ning&uacute;n problema , recomendables para la compra .
 This is my absolute favorite bra . It fits perfectly , and eliminates back fat with way the back is designed . I hope that they do not discontinue ! It 's been very hard to find lately .
 I now own two of these bras and would buy them again . The cups are soft cups but have three seems to provide support . These seems do show through a t-shirt , so this is not a good t-shirt bra . I bought this bra for basic comfortable every day wear and it has been perfect . It is in UK sizing so be careful when you order to make sure you are getting the correct size . The sizing on this bra is pretty accurate and it provides a good supportive fit . If you like this bra you should also try the Panache Inferno . It is not quite as good but still a great bra . Panache Inferno underwire plunge multiway bra
 Really . It 's my favorite piece of clothing . I own 4 of these , one of which is 7 years old . Hand washed and worn all the time , it has stayed in near perfect condition and is very flattering on a large bust .
 I ordered these wings for a costume I use frequently . They totally look realistic and are very durable , surviving many nights of extensive use . I would most certainly by product from this prop maker again . It is more than worth the price !
 This shirt is awesome we live in Florida . My daughter is in the pool or at the beach alot . It is holding up just fine , it has faded a little and will snag -LRB- as to be expected -RRB- . I am going to buy another one when she grows out of it.I love it .
 I am very happy with the t-shirt which is a very good quality with a great message .
 These are sturdy , quality socks . The fit was just right . Ca n't go wrong with them . The colors up on top make them cute too .
 Girls ankle socks are hard to come by . Do n't know why but was very happy to locate some right here on Amazon ! Daughter is thrilled with them and after washing and getting them to shrink down a bit they fit much better . She wears a size 5-1/2 narrow shoe so keep that in mind when purchasing . The heel does go up her foot a bit so the size large would probably fit size 6 or 7 better . All-in-all really nice socks .
 I bought these for my grand daughters for Christmas . they liked them and they came right on time as advertised

 I love these pajamas . The color , the softness -LRB- get softer the more you wash -RRB- , and the fit . I had purchased these for an older friend and found I was n't able to part with them so I made it up to her in other ways . Never done that before ... shows how much I like 'em .
 Arrived fast and in time for V-day ! Thanks for your high quality product and its fast arrival !

 the duaghter loves the costume to wear , especially for halloween . She got a lot of treats for wearing it . it was good .
 There are better messenger-style bags , but the Prada is pretty good . Mine came with a few loose threads , but otherwise was finely made . I wo n't buy another one , but I 'm not disappointed with it .
 pull the adjuster tight and you 've got some serious cleavage . leave it loose and you 've still got great support and shape . The padding is a little thick but that 's not all bad . The fabric does n't breathe very well so I 'd just use this for going out and not all day wear .
 I have a large collection of The Mountain shirts so I can tell you that this is a serious and valid review of this product . The pro 's and con 's of the shirt are : Pros :1 . Dark or white you have to love all races of kittens . Even if you hate white kittens you ca n't deny the love or affection you feel for the other and vice versa . They two of them are bonded by sprits and on this 100 % cotton shirt .2 . OMG they are so cute just looking at us like that . `` excuse me kind sir , do you see me ? '' `` I 'm here in your moon cut window wanting you to love me . '' AWESOME !!!! 3 . The stars . Just look how many of them there are . Did the kittens bring out the stars or did the stars come out because of the beautiful kittens that arrived here ? This is one of the most important questions asked about this shirt I get when wearing this outside in large crowds .4 . Petting factor . People want to touch me and bet the kittens . The black and white on has it 's nose just above my navel and when people pet him it makes me growl . . Simply amazing product placement The Mountain ! 5 . It 's my size ! Finally an XXL shirt with kittens to fit real men . Sometimes when walking through isles upon isles of kitten and puppy shirts you never run across the adult section XXL sizing . Finally The Mountain sees you as important and privelaged enough to wear you true heart on your chest.Cons :1 . While the touch factor is good sometimes too much touching makes me want to scream outlound and run through the gamestop store wishing I was never born . Most of the time I like it when they pet the black kitten .2 . Why stop at just two kittens . Where is the curious orange kitten that should n't be left out ? 3 . More color choices . Cooling water blue , saffron green , and bodacious black should be included as choices for the base color.Other than that the fit and sleeve depth are wonderful . The neck is thick and covers most of the moles . I wish that the girth size was a bit bigger . I am able to tuck the shirt into pants with both kittens still showing !! Well done !
 Great gift set ... you ca n't go wrong with these little life savers . Baby Legs make diaper changing a breeze . Finally all the little babyonesies can be worn year round!No more dirty , cold baby legs . Also , can be worn as sleeves ... neat concept ... lovem !
 Baby Legs are great ! They can be pants , tights or even leg warmers . My seven month old daughter looks so cute in them and will have for years to come .
 The Ogio Godfather backpack is very nice and holds all of my college books . It easily holds 3 good sized text books plus other olds and ends . The laptop sleeve will fit a 14 inch screen , but if you have a laptop with a larger extended battery -LRB- like me -RRB- it probably wo n't fit unless you remove the battery . But overall a good backpack , looks cool , comfortable and I would recommend it .
 I love this item . I wore it as lingerie for my boyfriend and then it got put on over a bellydancing tie top for a renaissance faire . It 's absolutely beautiful . Heavy duty . A little heavy and cold to the skin for a few minutes after putting it on , but I love it so much .
 My Hubby got these gloves for me , because we keep our home cool and I have something called Raynaud 's Disease -LRB- basically , my fingers and hands get cold very easily , and they have a hard time warming up . -RRB- These gloves are warm , comfortable , and allow me to sit at my computer in much more comfort and still be able to use my fingertips to type , write , or manipulate things which I simply can not do with full gloves.My only disappointment is that these gloves only come in the Large size ! I did n't pay attention to that when I got them , so my hubby is getting these and I am ordering a smaller size from another company.While large , they still work great - but I find I 'm tugging them up my wrists a bit , and they are just a little loose.These were a trifle itchy at first -LRB- wool , duh ! -RRB- but I found that either I acclimated well , or that they loosened/softened up after wearing them for about 2 weeks.Great buy for those of you who fit a large size glove -LRB- or slightly big mediums ! -RRB-
 These were the second pair I bought for my son only this time they were very reasonable . First pair was triple this price.They were very well made and I 'd buy more if the needed . Pure wool just as claimed .
 I bought two pair of these gloves for a friend , as a Christmas present . She loves the fingerless gloves , but has a hard time finding a pair to match the ones she bought years ago . She has tried many brands , but none seemed to compare to the old ones that were softer , a better fit , and more flexible . I found these online and thought I 'd give them a try . She was very happy to finally have what she called `` The Real Thing ! '' . She uses them all the time ! I would highly recommend them .
 My mom has some fingerless gloves nearly identical to these that she purchased from a specialty shop for around $ 25 that I 've always wanted . I 'm a little cheap -LRB- okay I 'm reallllllyyyyyy cheap -RRB- so I just could n't stomach paying that price even though I wanted quality fingerless wool gloves . These fit the bill perfectly.I 'm tall so my hands are on the large side for a woman . These gloves are a good length for me , but they are still loose around the actual hand area . Because they are loose on me and I do not have a small hand , I believe these are a men 's large although I do n't believe the description gives a gender . It 's not enough for me to dock any stars because I still love them , but they will likely be a bit loose for even larger-handed women .
 great gloves ! It does affect your writing if you were thinking of using these to do work on cold days . . but that 's probably the nature of the material .
 These gloves really do the job for me
 My finger mittens keep my hands protected and warm when I am going out in the cold for a short time . When I walk to the car from the house , or from store to store these mittens allow great dexterity with keys or packages without sacrificing lots of warmth .
 Gloves fit well -LRB- better than other fingerless gloves I have used in the past -RRB- , are warm , and look good ... except FYI they are a salmon-pinkish/tan color , not the typical grey wool color shown in the photo . I knocked off one star on the review just because pink-toned gloves were a bit of an unwanted surprise ...
 I received a beige color rather than the gray in the picture , but that does n't bother me . I work in a small office that is filled with really expensive electronics and it is kept around 60 degrees . These help . One of my coworkers insinuated I was gay because of the coloring , so if you are self conscious you might want to take a pass .
 These gloves are perfect for my husband especially when he took down the Christmas lights and when he uses his telescope . Provides warmth but use of the fingers when it is most needed .
 They are exactly as they say , LARGE FINGERLESS WOOL GLOVES ! They 're quite comfy and warm , although the fuzzies from the wool get all over my jackets which is what I would expect . All-in-all , though , great for the price !
 I am very happy with the t-shirt which is a very good quality with a great message .
 Beautiful sweater ; exceeded expectation in quality for the price . Only negative note , I was not informed there would be duty charges COD from US to Canada . An additional $ 21.00 on top of an already high $ 40 shipping charge .

 CK really shines with this item . The fabric is 93 % polyester and 7 % lycra . For me , the medium is not skin tight and that was fine -LRB- 38 inch chest , 32 inch waist -RRB- . I bought this item for outdoor running on cool -LRB- 40-60 F -RRB- but not cold days . For very cold days I still fall back on my UnderArmour version of this shirt that is much thicker , tighter and less comfortable . This one is made in Israel and the stitching is top notch .

 Pros : I usually detest Halloween costumes for their cheap fabric and accessories but this one is an exception . I wanted to get a handmade costume but ran out of time . I feel like this one is just as wonderful . It has so many little details even within the print of the fabric that make it look realistic.Cons : It 's pretty long so you may need to situate it a little bit for shorter children .
 This was a great costume for my son 's 5th birthday party . I would definitely buy the robe to go with it though . It is the typical costume quality but my son loved it .
 A little too expensive for the quality , but overall it is good because my son loved it . Has n't stopped wearing for a month , so the smiles and fun are worth it .
 The costume looked great . The only problem was that one of the velcro straps to kerp the boot covers on was ripped off .
 I had to make minor adjustments but the fabric was one that did n't fray , so no sewing involved , just some cutting . my son is thrilled with it and will probably wear it until Christmas time
 My son loves his . Wears it all the time . I do n't like the Velcro for the back on the neck , it bunches up a bit but still looks good on him
 The costume overall is great , I guess I was just a little disappointed in the feet portion of the pants . I bought a bigger size for my 6 year old and the shoe covers attatched to the pants do n't fully cover his feet . He 's only going to get bigger . Fits great otherwise .
 For the Price we Loved it !! It did run a little large though . just had to use safety pins . Great costume , my son loved itFor the Price we Loved it !! It did run a little large though . just had to use safety pins . Great costume , my son loved it
 My grandson loved his costume !! He put it on & paraded his neighborhood . Your product surpassed an 8 year olds expectations !!
 It fill well on my four year old . He had a ball being a Jedi Knight for Halloween . It has room for him to grow into it as well so I 'm sure he 'll get lots of good playtime use from it ! Quality acceptable for the price .
 The costume is exactly what my son wanted - it looked like a jedi knight . It 's not super high quality , it 's not going to last forever , but it 's fun for dress-up . Shoe covers do n't actually cover the shoes very well , but it did n't worry him .
 I got this for my 9 year old son for Halloween . He is average build and height and a medium worked well for him . We did not find the sizes to be off like other reviewers . The costume was of decent quality . There are a lot of cheap ones out there and this was not one of those . My only complaint was that the belt was a little hard to get on since it 's kind of tight and you have to pull it over their head or up from their feet . All and all though I thought it was a good value for the price and he was definitely happy . His 6 year old brother was Anakin and they thought they were pretty awesome together .
 I ordered this costume to my son who loves Star Wars . The pants were long to him but I could fold it a bit on the waist line and fitted ok . I guess it is good so he can enjoy his cotume longer as he grows up . The quality is very good for the price . Loved it .
 We have a big star wars fan and he just loves this costume ! now he can be a jedi any time he wants . they seem to be true to size .
 This costume was great for my son ! He is on the taller / husky side so the 10/12 fit great !
 He wore this with the Star Wars Jedi Robe . It was good quality , but thin enough for our warm climate . I did not like that the boot covers were attached to the pants . Other than that , he looked awesome and was comfortable .
 Best price and best looking anikin costume we could find . It was too large for our son but with some snipping it fit great .
 If your little Jedi will be wearing this on a daily basis , I would look elsewhere . For a $ 16 Halloween costume , this is perfectly adequate . Size medium fit my 52-53 &#34; child well with growing room . I would say size is generous EXCEPT for the boot covers . They are ridiculously small ! The foot flap only came about halfway over his foot .
 The coloring on the costume varies slightly from what is pictured , but not in anyway that makes the costume unlikeable . My daughter was thrilled when it arrived , and is so excited to be a jedi knight for Halloween . The price was significantly lower at amazon than any of the other online costume retailers , and we are very happy with the quality , the fit , and the value . -LRB- My daughter is 4 , almost 5 , and the costume fits very nicely . -RRB-
 We received this costume for our six year old son and its wonderful . Its the same quality you will get at a Halloween store in town . Overpriced and not amazing quality . But our son loves it . He is thrilled to be Luke this year and it will probably last him a year of role playing as all his costumes in his closet ... Costume seems true to size also . My son wears a 5-6T and the small fit perfectly . if my son was any bigger than a 6T i would probably have needed a Medium
 I loved this costume . My 3 year old loves it and it was so much better quality then the dark brown Anakin costume I bought .
 great costume ! good quality ! I just wish the belt would unhook , that was the only downfall.My son loved it , was great for halloween .
 Stays looking nice even after poor treatment on the Halloween circuit and other events . Stains even come out easily . Your child will look great in it too . One of the best made , most accurate , and nice looking Halloween costumes I have even bought .
 Got this for my son with the matching cloak , he LOVES it ! It looks super cute my only problem with it is that it is n't very durable . One time through the washing machine and it looks as though it 'd fall apart . My son is old enough to take care of it but for anyone younger than 4 it might not last long .
 This costume was perfect for our 5 year old . He loved it and felt like a real Jedi ! I did end up buying a Jedi Robe as an add on to complete the costume . We already had a few lightsabers at home !! Would reccomend this costume highly !
 I bought this for my child for halloween and it is a very good costume . a bit complicated so do not buy it for a child that you do not plan to HELP them get dressed in it . but it looks real good with the hooded cape and lightsaber .
 My son had lots of fun wearing this costume . He 's been wanting for quite a while ...
 My kid is very happy with this costume , does n't take it off not even to go to bed . The material looks good .
 My son asked for this for Christmas and has gotten himself dressed up many times to pretend he is a Jedi . Clothes are durable and easy to put on and take off .
 This is an excellent costume , but the sizes are misleading . I would strongly recommend that you buy it one size smaller than you think you need . My nephew was very happy with it , but I was disappointed that it was entirely too big for him .
 The costume is nice , not superb material and craftsmanship , the belt is very simply put together -LRB- looks nicer in the picture than in real life -RRB- . supplier was prompt and accurate
 I ordered this product for my kids to use for talent show . It was visually pleasing and satisfied the purpoe . The belt was made from flimsy material and the shirt a little thin on quality . But for the price I thought it a fair value and my kids do n't notice the litle things that I do . As far as they 're concerned when they wear it they are a Jedi and that 's what it 's all about.I would buy this again . The price was fair against the quality .
 Super cute ! Our son loved wearing it for halloween . He was 5 years old and we bought the small size , it fits perfect . We also ordered the cape to go with it .
 I bought a bunch of different Bberry covers/cases to try . This is the best one on to buy . Looks nice , feels nice , priced nice , and it keeps your butt from using your phone .
 There are better messenger-style bags , but the Prada is pretty good . Mine came with a few loose threads , but otherwise was finely made . I wo n't buy another one , but I 'm not disappointed with it .
 They look good on my girlfriend and she like them , she 's happy , I 'm happy , happiness is a happy girlfriend who likes her underwear !
 CK really shines with this item . The fabric is 93 % polyester and 7 % lycra . For me , the medium is not skin tight and that was fine -LRB- 38 inch chest , 32 inch waist -RRB- . I bought this item for outdoor running on cool -LRB- 40-60 F -RRB- but not cold days . For very cold days I still fall back on my UnderArmour version of this shirt that is much thicker , tighter and less comfortable . This one is made in Israel and the stitching is top notch .
 My houseband is a fan . So he was very pleased with the quality and all the `` authentic stuff '' on it
 I 've searched forever on the internet and this is the only place that sells killer whale lunch totes . My child loves Shamu and really enjoys her lunch bag . There 's a nice compartment to the front of the bag that can hold change or snacks . The vinyl padding on the inside of the tote can be easily cleaned . And the strap is easily adjustable . I am very pleased with this purchase and transaction . The company shipped it quickly to my home .
 This cloak is satisfactory on quality . I would buy it again . one of the things I found with it is it is virtually identicale to the harry Potter robes , So it has a double purpose . The length on it makes it useful for many sizes of kids . I would guess 7-12 years old can wear it comfortably.I believe this is a good buy .
 My 7 year old asked for it for his birthday and he loves it . Nice fabric , light but with some texture . Great for those young jedis out there !
 It arrived in a timely manor and my son absolutely loves it . It 's exactly what he wanted.Thank you . Thank you .
 My litle grandson was so happy with this Jedi Robe . He called me long distance to thank me .
 Our kids are into Star Wars Clone Wars on cartoon network , so we got them Jedi robes and light sabers for Christmas . It was a big winner . These robes are not too flimsy , they have n't broken yet -LRB- and it 's been a whole month ! -RRB- and they were affordable . I recommend them highly .
 My son wanted to be a Jedi for trick-or-treating , but was also invited to a `` Haunted Mansion '' party where he needed to be something scary . We bought the Jedi robe to compliment his Jedi costume ... then he went as a phantom in it for the party . Win-win ! The robe is actually thinner than I expected , and I did end up adding a hook/eye closure because it kept slipping off his shoulders , but it is lined and he LOVED it .
 We have already used this costume for three Halloweens . What really makes the costume though is the deluxe Jedi Robe we purchased with it . It is durable and my oldest son has now outgrown it . The real reason I 'm writing is that I was in the market for another DULUXE star wars outfit this year and noticed all the bad reviews on the other DELUXE versions of the star wars costume . If you get the robe you wo n't regret it . Hopefully they have n't downgraded the product since we bought ours like three years ago . We have also been very happy with the infant yoda baby fleece costume . I have three boys . The third will be wearing it this year . Firt each boy uses it as yoda . The next year they are a padawon -LRB- yoda without the ears -RRB- . And then they move up to jedi knight -LRB- The obiwon deluxe outfit with his jedi robe -RRB- .
 I bought this robe for my 5 year old son . He loves it and seriously wears it every day ! He is heavily into all things Star Wars , it was a perfect birthday present for him . I did have to reinforce the seams -LRB- there were 2 small holes along the seam when it arrived -RRB- But given that he wears it all day , inside and outside the house , it has held up just fine . The fabric is thick and durable and it washes nicely . If your kid loves Star Wars , I 'd advise spending the money for this robe .
 It 's a cute costume all around . It was a little big on him though . He is 5 1/2 and could have done the small .
 The Jedi robe has provided hours of fun for my grandson ! Lots of imaginative play , especially with other `` Jedis '' ! Worth the purchase for many hours of role playing and interaction !
 This is a great little cape . My son did n't take it off for days . He even slept in it ! It is very lightweight and not very durable so be aware that the description is not acurate . Still , it was a good purhcase for those who want to be a furture Jedi .
 Love this !! We bought this to go with a Halloween costume and my boys loved it !! We 've since used it many times for `` dress up '' play !! : -RRB-
 Overall the Royce Toiletry Bag w/zippered Bottom Compartment is a first class piece of luggagebut the bottom compartment does take space away from the main top compartmemt . Materials and workmanship are 2nd to none . If the top compartment were a little larger I 'd give 5 stars easy . As it is , it is a strong 4 . ****
 I travel quite a bit and the trips are never usually short . I needed something to carry at least two weeks worth of toiletries for use on business trips.This is just what the Doctor ordered . The size is large enough to accommodate full sized bottles , but not too big to pack in a carry on.In this I am able to fit everything in the main compartment -LRB- 1 full size shampoo bottle , 1 full size body soap bottle , razor , regular size shaving cream can , tooth brush , tooth paste , comb -RRB- . The second compartment holds my travel medicines and has loops to help organize.The leather is good quality and has shown no sign of wear in almost two months of constant use.I would recommend this to any frequent travelers .
 Bag arrived promptly and in was packaged very well . Leather appears to be great quality , zippers seem durable , and product looks like it will last a while . Came with three plastic travel size bottles and a mesh bag that Velcro 's in the the bottom compartment . Product is exactly what i was looking for . The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because of the price . Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend so it has n't been used yet , but I think he is really going enjoy having it as he is a frequent traveler .
 arrived fast , very nice looking ! I bought this as a gift , it was a home run !! The leather was very nice and the extras in the bottom zipper was an added plus .
 Sometimes ytou cant describe you really feel about something you love , and the best way that I can describe how happy I am with this toiletry bag is , WOOOOW !!! I love it .
 Got this for my brother for his birthday . The men at the reunion were raving about it . The quality of the leather is incredible . You can tell its a well made product and will be lasting for a quite few years . Would definitley recommend
 Excellent condition . Fast delivery . A + +
 Quick delivery - exactly what i was looking for .

 I bought this hat for a present for my boyfriend because he is all about Cadillac . He greatly enjoyed it .
 Going by looks , I think he 'll love it ! It 's celebratory and it 's part of his up-coming Christmas gift ! I think it will look great on him !
 I 'm really not a `` pink '' person , so I was a little worried about that , but the picture was so cute that I got them . I 'm a size 12 and the large fit me perfectly . They are made of a very durable fabric and having all the pockets is great - especially for going on walks . I wore these to work -LRB- on a casual Friday in the Legal department of a pharmaceuticals company -RRB- and I must have gotten a dozen or more compliments on them from both men and women . My big joke was to say thank you , but they really should n't be able to see me . ;-RRB- A great buy for the price and made very well .
 Let me just say Ladies , be careful when choosing a size . The first pair I bought were a size Small and they were huge . I normally ware a size 5 jeans , and thought a small would fit . I returned them and bought an XXS and they fit perfect . They are low cut and sit just under the belly button -LRB- about an inch below the belly button -RRB- . I measure 36 inches in the hip area and 27 in the waist -LRB- True waist old school style above the belly button -RRB- . Rothco states in their sizing chart XXS = 31 waist and 41 hips . The point at which these sit on my hips is 33 inches , and they are loose fitting in the crotch and legs . They also run a little long . The Small size was about 4 inches wider at the point where they sit on my hips , they go up 2 inches per size.Other than the sizing they are very comfortable and I will be buying more of these .
 Love these pants ! I wear a 10/12 in a jean . Ordered a large and they a slightly baggy , just the way I like it . I am only 5 ' 1 '' and the adjustable drawstring ankle works great for me ! Subdued colors , lots of pockets and sits below the waist . Nothing negative to say !
 I do a lot of hiking in all sorts of weather . These pants have pockets galore - enough for bandanas , knife , map , MoJo bars , hard candy , and flashlight . The drawstring cuffs keep them secure around the tops of my boots . The blend of cotton and ramie washes like a dream and is soft on the skin . The rear and legs are deep enough to accommodate long johns .
 They arrived yesterday and I 'm very happy with them . I 've been looking all over for pants like these . I 'm curvy and I wear anything between a 12 or a 14 and the large fits perfect . I would suggest maybe a size down if you want them more form fitted . I really like the `` great outdoors '' aesthetic they have and I personally think they look really cute with spaghetti string tops or babydoll t-shirts .
 These fatigues are just what I wanted , they run a little big but they have an adjustable waste . Very comfortable . Perfect for the urban jungle ! TY
 These are great , especially if you need something durable . The material is thick , so they 're a bit warmer than I expected but I know they will last . Also , they have a very short waist and long legs , but you can cinch the drawstrings and tuck the laces under . I cut my laces shorter once i figuredout how to best tie them ... I am a 34-35 '' waist and a large fits snugly but not too tight .
 Very comfortable pants for lounging around . Love all the pockets and the drawstring waist .
 OMG !!! I love all the pockets and do order a size smaller then what you would normally wear , that is a very good tip that I got from the other comments and they are so right ... . I will so order these pants again I love them ...
 I initially bought the extra small vintage paratrooper fatigues , but today where enormous ! I am 4 ' 10 &#34; and have a curvy figure at 115 pounds . If you have a Waist line that is less than 36 inches , these are the right size for you .
 fast service , great product , as shown , would do business with these folks anytime ... fair pricing ... good quality item ... also great gift ... great gift ... love them
 These pants are so comfortable and cute ! I normally wear a small but ordered one size smaller based on the other reviews and they fit great !
 I have gotten MORE compliments on these pants . I wear them on day 2 of our Breast Cancer walk and so many people asked where I got them . Look out Amazon , I 'm sure you 'll get a lot of orders
 There is nothing sexy about these camo cargo pants , but I do like them . Have n't worn them yet because they are too long , like for a six foot woman . The pants re sturdy and well made . I would reccomend them to anyone who likes pink camo .
 These are practical yet sized for a lady . Not a tall lady as the rise is shorter ... which is why conventional ladies pants fall short . So I only gave them a 4 as the description did n't state that but the tags on the pants did . Super soft , nice long legs , the finish make them look gentally loved and I will be loving these for a long time .
 Love these fatigues . I like the way I can ajust the length to wear various shoes or boots . Great Item thanks
 Excellent product ; well constructed pants . Run small so would suggest ordering one size up . Used the pants as part of wedding outfit -LRB- husband is a soldier -RRB- .
 These pants arrived exactly as described . The sizes do run large . Just to give u an idea of the sizes incase u are going to order a pair . I am a size 38/18 , I ordered an XL because they did n't have the XXL in stock and they did n't fit . They were too small . I kinda expected that but i took a chance . So I think I 'm going to keep them and try to loose a few pounds.Anyways , the pants are of great quality and everything i expected and more .
 First let me say the shipping was incredibly fast -LRB- like 2 days from ordering to my house fast -RRB- . I love , love these pants . They are very comfy and the pink camo is an excellent color . I have these in regular camo as well and those have lasted for years through hunting in the great Northern Woods of Maine to just bumming around on the weekends . As for sizing I hope this helps . I 'm 5 ' 6-1/2 '' and weigh appr 150lbs . My normal jean size ranges from between 7-10 depending on brand and cut . I ordered these in a size small and they fit great . They are baggy -LRB- which is how there suppose to fit -RRB- but not ridiculously . These pretty much sit at the hip and was slightly big in the waist -LRB- good in case I grow -RRB- however there are ties to sinch the waist as well . The length is great for me I like to wear heals but even with flats you can sinch the ankle opening to accomodate . Ca n't wait till summer , these will be perfect with sandals and tank .
 I love love love these pants !!!! I 'm only 5 ' tall so I had to have then altered by 4 &#34; . Very comfy and very worth it . I ordered xsmall . I usually wear size 3-5 normally .
 I love these Jeans I own them in five colors and in three different size ... I an 5 ' 3 , 26inch waist , 39 hips and a very defined ass and arch back so hard to find Jeans , , , I have the size M I wear as scrub pants at work , S run about size , and XS is when I want to stand out fits close under stated sexy , sits low on the waist but no crack showing and you can bend an move in them . . The draw string is what make it work in several size ... If you are pear shape its best to use the hip measure ment as your guide for how close you want them to fit on you .
 These are very nice pants , these fit me fine even though I am a tiny person ! At first when i looked at them i thought maybe they would n't fit me because they looked so big , but they have stings to tie at the bottom and top . I love the pockets too ! They are pretty deep and there is lots of them
 I 've been wanting pants like his for a long time and these are absolutely perfect ! I 'm 5ft tall and a size 5 in pants and these were absolutely perfect . The material and length are perfect , its faded to look vintage and washed out and the draw strings at the bottom are just right to get the exact fit . On top of all that I got the pants way before the estimated delivery date ! I 'm very happy !
 Who would have thought these pants would be so comfortable . My only grips were that the strings on the ankles were way to long and the string on the waist band dug into my hips . I ended up taking out the string in the waistband and inserted a thin belt instead . I love these pants now and were them all the time .
 Quite a while ago I had a pair of these in large but they became very baggy on me when I lost some weight . I got some smalls and they were still too big . I just ordered the XXS and they fit quite well with the exception of the length . I 'm 5 ' 3 '' , 120lbs , size 3/4 with 33 '' inseam . The pants get shorter as the size goes down , about 1/2 -1 '' per size . The XXS are over an inch shorter than the smalls , short enough to hike up way above my ankles when sitting . I cut the strings in the legs off and can roll them up for a summer look . I think the sizing of these is inconsistent , because when I bought 2 different colors in XXS one pair is a little bigger than the other . It might just be bad luck I got ones that were too short . It also might explain all the reviews of `` they run big '' and `` they run small '' with no consistency . Other than the length , these are great pants which is why I bought 2 more pairs . Super comfy and cute !
 I bought this for my Mom and she loved it . The reviews I read were right - it runs a little big . I ordered a size smaller and it fit perfectly . The seller was great . The item shipped quickly and arrived right on time .
 Item was quickly sent , is a BEAUTIFUL color , nicely sewn decent weight material that will work wonderful as `` guest of the wedding '' outfit besides being WASHABLE and A GREAT BUY ! What more do you want ? A + + +
 My niece was getting married and her Granny was n't coming . So we bought her this outfit and she delighted everyone . A woman can always use a new pretty outfit .
 My mom loved her sage green suit especially elastic waist band . Washable , fit well . Reccomend this for great priceAnd style
 This italian made Leather Wallet cost me more than i would really pay . But since it was a christmas gift ... . i could n't care about the price . I got it with a 60 % off though ;--RRB- ... nice !! It 's Christmas , price is not an issue here . The person who go it was thrilled , she totally fliped out ! and that my dear readers , deserves a 5 stars .
 Excellent condition . Fast delivery . A + +
 pull the adjuster tight and you 've got some serious cleavage . leave it loose and you 've still got great support and shape . The padding is a little thick but that 's not all bad . The fabric does n't breathe very well so I 'd just use this for going out and not all day wear .
 I bought this in red to wear over a black camisole . It does n't have dedicated thumb holes , but you can make your own . I am a size 0-2 and this fit me fine . Was comfortable to wear , although it did leave some fishnet marks on my arms after I took it off . The bottom does tend to roll up but I 'm not sure there 's any way to get around that . Very sturdy netting , BRIGHT red color . Will be getting another one in black soon .
 Great quality , Amazing color and best of all -- One size fits ALL : -RRB- Could n't be HAPPIER with this product . * Remember to only wash by hand .
 When I purchased this shirt I thought it would have thumb holes as was mentioned in the description . It does not . There are holes throughout the entire shirt , which is to be expected , so I 've just been using a random hole to put my thumbs into to keep the sleeves down . Without my thumbs keeping the sleeves down , the sleeves sit at about elbows length . Overall it was a good shirt for the buy , however I would n't have bought it if I 'd known it was n't coming with thumb holes .
 I ordered three of these shirts , in red , lime , and neon purple . I received my red one today and I love it.It arrived 3 days after I ordered it , and the shipping was free . I plan on ordering the rest of the colors the next time I place an order from Amazon.I own a black fishnet shirt from Hot Topic , and paid $ 20 for it 3 years ago . These are a much better price , and the quality and flexibility of the shirt is also much better than the one I have from HT . I will probably end up ordering a black one of these.The shirts can also be worn off the shoulders , which I like a lot . It does n't have any seams along the arms or sides preventing it from being worn different styles.These are a great price , amazing product , ships fast , and comes in lots of cool colors . I ca n't wait for my other 2 to arrive . : - -RRB-
 I owe 5 of these in different colors ... all of which I love . One of these I 've had for years . . they hold up great , even for me , and I 'm hard on fishnet . Ca n't beat Lycra Fishnet products!I do however , hate that they now put tags in the shoulder . lame .
 As a petite person I always avoid one size items . I picked up this shirt at a local store and was excited to find this shirt fit so well . Would recommend wearing the shirt as shown , over rather than under other clothes . While the shirt is comfortable it rubs sweaty areas uncomfortably .
 These shirts are great . They are very soft and stretchable , fitting even a size 14/16 . They always arrived quickly and the colors are beautiful too .
 I use mine for goth appearance and I could n't be happier . Everyone buys that Hot Topic junk and get jealous when they see mine . I love these so much that this is my second one .
 Bought this product -LRB- two colors -RRB- two days prior and I got it MUCH faster than expected . They are amazing ! Best buy I ever bought online . The fabric is tough -LRB- unlike others that are sold at metal stores and the like -RRB- and it stretches out nicely . It may look small but it fit just nicely and I 'm a bit bigger than the average sized woman.I 'm gon na buy some more of different colors ! I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT INDEED!Also , I was worries that the shirts were open at the shoulders as the picture shows but it 's not . It 's just like any other fishnet shirt out there with sleeves and all .
 This product is comfortable , but the bottom of it rolls up a bit . I personally do n't mind because I wear it under clothes instead of over them . It looks very small when you take it out of the package , but I promise you that it stretches big enough for an actual person to fit into it . = D
 The seller sent it promptly and arrived perfectly . It looks just like in the picture , even for me that I 'm size XS and all the time everything is too big for me :-RRB- The only comment I want to leave for you all , not to be mislead by the picture is that there is no `` special hook '' or hole for the thumbs , you just have to use one of the net 's to look like the picture .
 came as described before expected delivery date . I 'm a size 14 and it fits , can stretch a little bit more in the waist but I 'm not quite sure how the arms would look .
 Just as they are in the photo , except for oooooone thing . It seems like there is a hole for her thumb , but on the actual product , there is not . I had to cut a couple lines to make a thumb hole for myself . In any case , they are very stretchy and tight at the same time , able to fit a thin girl , or a male ! Not recommended for larger males , of course , but for everyone else , these are perfect !
 This product has lasted me over a year . It does fit well , though the day I got it , it snagged and now has a hole . The neck was not as pictured , but it still works great !
 This product is amazing ! i weigh like 190 and when I got it I did n't think it was going to fit ! It fit perfectly ! great product ! and the fabric is durable too ! : -RRB-
 I 'm a mixed-fit gal for tops - my waist is a medium , while my chest is extra large or sometimes even 1X -LRB- plus size -RRB- . The DDD 's just mess it all up , LOL . I have a long torso - regular shirts tend to sit at my belly button , or just barely meeting my hips where the curve begins . I 'm roughly a size 12 in women 's . I was n't scared taking it out of the package - fishnet always looks tiny until you put it on . It feels sturdy and like it will hold up over time , with nice thick stitching and weave . What concerns me a bit is that it fits snug ... I mean SNUG . The netting gets turns into bigger diamonds around my chest , while the neck/arms/waist remain small as-per-norm . It 's tight enough that I 'm not sure that I can wear it over camisoles or a tank top as I normally do . The shirt does n't feel like it 's biting into my arms or chest , so that 's good , but it 's clinging to my hips - not a good sign , as tight-at-the-hips tends to lead to rolling up as I move about.Hopefully it will stretch out with some wearing . I 'll post an update after a night out , let you all know how it goes .
 Got here within 3 days and the outfit is totally awesome . I got the blue one and the color is so bright and beautiful . It was one of my best purchases here so far .
 I knew I wanted a new replacement , larger sized , fleece jacket , and couldnt find many available online , but was hesitant to order this one due to what I considered a poor description that I couldnt understand , but I took a chance and ordered it anyway . As usual , the photo example of the jacket uses a dark colored one , which makes it virtually impossible to discern much of anything about the product . I had no idea what `` no-pill fleece '' meant , I thought it perhaps meant that the fleece was ` smooth ' on the outside like a sweat shirt , but this isnt the case , it is wooly on the outside , like I wanted . I also didnt understand what the description meant by `` three piece collar '' , I thought maybe they meant several layered flaps of some sort , however it is just a typical collar that can be raised -LRB- and zipped -RRB- during cold winds , or laid down at other times ; the collar is Black on the inside for fashionable contrast . I didnt really want ` elastic cuffs and waist ' , but it was the only style I could find available on the web ; but it turns out that the elastic is not real taught , so I can live with it . The zippered pockets are very spacious on the inside . The label on the jacket says ` Colorado , Authentic Outerwear , Timberline ' . I hope this helps clarifies the description . My wife says it `` looks real good '' on me , so I guess I will keep it , I like it pretty much , especially the Burgundy color I chose . This type of coat is really great , similar previous coats like this . . Ive worn pretty much all winter , if you leave them unzipped they are tolerable in cool weather , or in quite cold weather they are very warm if you zip them up all the way .
 The jacket is excellent . It is warm and extremely comfortable . It is informal enough to wear to any event , yet nice enough to wear to church . I love it .
 The fleece jacket is great . Warm and it zips to the outer jacket I got from Sierra Trading Post ! Perfect ! : - -RRB-
 For over a year I shopped for a similar jacket for my man . With no success I went on line to find exact match . Yay ! Ordered it straight up and got it quick . Now that 's my kind of shopping .
 Going by looks , I think he 'll love it ! It 's celebratory and it 's part of his up-coming Christmas gift ! I think it will look great on him !

 pull the adjuster tight and you 've got some serious cleavage . leave it loose and you 've still got great support and shape . The padding is a little thick but that 's not all bad . The fabric does n't breathe very well so I 'd just use this for going out and not all day wear .
 I bought this cincher to flatten and smooth my waistline beneath a bridesmaids dress . I have had two children and I have a permanent pooch in the front , I am also carrying extra weight from my last pregnancy still . While I did n't expect this to take away any inches , it does what I hoped for ! My tummy is flat and my waist is nipped in the right spots . It is a comfortable garment , I expected the worst , scratchy , binding , bulging , but it is none of those things ! When I pulled it around my waist , I thought it was going to be too small , it was difficult to pull the sides of it together over my baby belly , but I had ordered according to the size chart on Rago 's website , so I persevered . Once it was all hooked , I could see it was the perfect size , any larger and it would n't have been as effective , any tighter and I would have that bulging thing going on . I recommend this for anyone looking to smooth and add shape to their waistline , for that special event or just for an everyday confidence boost !
 I purchased a size M/28 in white . I 'm in my mid-30s and had a child around 9 years ago , I have the mama-pouch in the front that I ca n't seem to get rid of no matter what I do . This is very well made . I sew as a profession as well as a hobby . The fabric used -LRB- not the lace part , however -RRB- is exactly the same we use at work for medical compression garments . I think this is partly the reason why this garment works so well . I was primarily looking to flatten my stomach , but this product also cinches in your waist a bit that gives you a very flattering silhouette . I have several corsets and girdles -LRB- yes , there is a difference -RRB- and I have to say , this is one of the best girdles I have ever used . I 'm most likely going to get rid of my old girdles because that is how pleased I am with this product . Of course , when I am looking for a more severe waistline , my corsets are still the way to go . This garment also works well under moderately tight garments . Nothing skin tight , but I have some relatively tight shirts that you can not tell I am wearing this underneath . With the light boning , this provides some gentle support that helps you keep your posture , which is always good . I have not had any problems breathing in this garment and the bones do not stick in anywhere . I love that it also includes detachable garters ; a bonus in my book . As mentioned before , the quality of the materials used are great -LRB- except maybe the lace topping , but it 's there less for function and more for the pretties ! -RRB- . I 'm used to most of these types of garments flatting you down a bit , but making you more of a tube figure , but this one gives you a nice waist . I highly recommend this product .
 I got a bit chunky this last year in my tummy/hip area . I 'm otherwise proportionate , so wearing anything form fitting would make my midsection look ... weird.So , I looked around to see what I could do about it . After reading some reviews , I thought I 'd try out this rago waist cincher . A couple people mentioned that the sizes run small , so I heeded their advice and ordered an XL . -LSB- In other products , I wear a L. -RSB- It was a noticeably snug fit at first -LRB- even though I ordered an XL -RRB- , but I did not have a problem fastening it together , so I knew it was the right size.It has plastic boning between the elastic-band-reinforced , stretch mesh panels . It fastens with about twenty or so hook and eye closures that go between the front two panels of the cincher . The front panels have more reinforcement and the side panels are more elastic ; my tummy gets flatter and my waist and hips get curvier -LSB- in a good way . -RSB- It took a couple days to get used to , but after wearing this after a week or so , I now feel strange going out without it!This thing rocks ! So , it flattens my tummy and redefines my waist/hip ratio . Yet , there are n't any mutant bulges going on above or below the cincher ! This item holds its shape , too , so do n't worry about it buckling or bending back on itself . Well , perhaps if this is happening , you may need to order another size . But in my situation , it definitely felt secure . I trust this item and I dont worry that `` one wrong move '' will cause this thing to fall apart . And that 's awesome . Because falling out of your clothes is not awesome.Anyway , the cincher does start to ride up when i 'm sitting down for a long time -LRB- e.g. while watching a movie at a theater or something -RRB- . It does n't bother me too much , but I would be lying if I said that it never became a nuisance . This could also be due to my crummy posture , but I 'm not sure.The only other drawback -LSB- I could think of -RSB- happens while wearing the cincher under a t shirt and jeans
 I have never worn a girdle or control underwear before , so I expected discomfort . This cincher was soooo much better than I expected ! It pulled everything in and gave me a nice , smooth shape under my dress without any pain or pinching . There did n't seem to be any visible lines under my cotton dress - I do n't know if it will show under something like silk or satin , though . Anyway , I could n't give this 5 stars because it has a very noticeable crease across the lower back part above the bum .
 I got this after I gave birth to my daughter and used it when I wear something that clings to my body . It works wonders at making my belly look flatter . It is hard to put on at first but after a while I got a hang of it . I am a size 0 from Gap and got a XS from here and it fit and works for me . It is hard to move and sit when you wear this but do make you look much much better .
 I think I got it a size too big . Im a size 22 in dresses and and 43 in waist , I got a size 6x . I think next time I 'll get a 5x . Great craftmanship and very comfortable to wear and very easy to put on !
 Rago # 821 which is smooth and has no garters , and # 21 which is lacy and has removable garters.I 've ordered twice from this product page , and got a different type each time -LRB- checked links from my order history -RRB- . Worked out fine for me , but since I do n't know which one I 'd get this time , I ordered -LRB- # 21 -RRB- from another site -LRB- 3 different sizes , going down , quite possibly related to the use of this product -RRB- .
 I recently gave birth and like many new moms I have the infamous muffin top . I ordered the XS cincher and my ordered came well before the estimated delivery date , however when it arrived I noticed that the cincher was lace instead of satin as the photo shown in the advertisement . Despite this one problem the cincher did fit really well . And it did hold in my mini pouch . Which is the only reason I did not return it . That and because I did not want to go through the hassle of mailing items back and forth with the companyIn the future I plan on ordering the satin cincher if I can find one , but will order it from somewhere other than HerRoom
 I ordered this to wear with a clingy dress for Valentine 's Day . Ordered the 3X/36 and the 4X/38 , and I 'll definitely be going with the 36 . According to their size chart I should be 4X/38 , and it definitely flattens my tummy , but the 3X/36 does the same and nips me in a bit more without creating any bulges at the top or bottom.If you 're going for that super curvy hourglass figure , this is probably not going to be quite enough for you . But if you 're just looking to slim down a bit and get rid of that food baby , it 's excellent . It 's very comfortable and of high quality - the stays are very sturdy , as is the fabric . The back and sides are sheer , so it does n't have that horrible medical-garment look to it , either .
 I really like this item especially for its price . It visibly makes a difference on instantly . Seems comfortable but have n't worn it for a long period if time . If the outline shoes through your shirt , you can wear a tank top to hide the outline . Just make sure you get your correct size so it works .
 I am sort of a plus person and i put this on and immediately i could see a difference . i have it on now and i feel like `` showing myself off '' . I ca n't wait . it does take some weight off and i feel more desirable already . i ca n't wait . i ordered an extra large and it fit is tight , which is what i wanted . thank you when i loose a little weight i will be ordering another one in a smaller size . thanks again very happy with my purchase !
 I bought this product to wear under some of my dresses . In the past couple of years I gained my freshmen 15 and then some . I got this in hopes that it would tame the pooch and it did . It makes my new dresses look great . I think the one I got was just a tad too small but I ordered a medium too so I 'll have to see how that works out . Overall though it did meet my expectations .
 This costume got ALL the looks and pics at The Texas Renaissance Festival this year !! I was just wearing it till I got my other outfit , but after the reviews as well as the looks , I think I 'll stick with this one . Just as an FYI ... The bottoms included is a thong -LRB- not what I wore though -RRB- .
 I looked good ! I wore this as a butterfly Halloween costume . I covered everything though . And the suit was comfortable and I could have worn it all day ! It had good stretch and the color was very pretty . Very , very good price !
 What can I say ? I am a dancer and have danced in this outfit.It is always WELL RECEIVED !!
 Excellent condition . Fast delivery . A + +
 I sweat a lot ... since the hood was lightweight that wasnt a problem for me ... I always lay hats and gloves down and cant find them when needed with this hood I didnt have to remove it from my body until I was going to be in for awhile which was good also ... I just wish they had more colors

 I knew I wanted a new replacement , larger sized , fleece jacket , and couldnt find many available online , but was hesitant to order this one due to what I considered a poor description that I couldnt understand , but I took a chance and ordered it anyway . As usual , the photo example of the jacket uses a dark colored one , which makes it virtually impossible to discern much of anything about the product . I had no idea what `` no-pill fleece '' meant , I thought it perhaps meant that the fleece was ` smooth ' on the outside like a sweat shirt , but this isnt the case , it is wooly on the outside , like I wanted . I also didnt understand what the description meant by `` three piece collar '' , I thought maybe they meant several layered flaps of some sort , however it is just a typical collar that can be raised -LRB- and zipped -RRB- during cold winds , or laid down at other times ; the collar is Black on the inside for fashionable contrast . I didnt really want ` elastic cuffs and waist ' , but it was the only style I could find available on the web ; but it turns out that the elastic is not real taught , so I can live with it . The zippered pockets are very spacious on the inside . The label on the jacket says ` Colorado , Authentic Outerwear , Timberline ' . I hope this helps clarifies the description . My wife says it `` looks real good '' on me , so I guess I will keep it , I like it pretty much , especially the Burgundy color I chose . This type of coat is really great , similar previous coats like this . . Ive worn pretty much all winter , if you leave them unzipped they are tolerable in cool weather , or in quite cold weather they are very warm if you zip them up all the way .
 The jacket is excellent . It is warm and extremely comfortable . It is informal enough to wear to any event , yet nice enough to wear to church . I love it .
 The fleece jacket is great . Warm and it zips to the outer jacket I got from Sierra Trading Post ! Perfect ! : - -RRB-
 For over a year I shopped for a similar jacket for my man . With no success I went on line to find exact match . Yay ! Ordered it straight up and got it quick . Now that 's my kind of shopping .
 I love my Timberline Fleece it was just what I was looking for . I was looking for a very bright yellow fleece and I could n't find one in Chalotte N.C. , so someone told me to look on amazon.com . Now I have a new bright yellow fleece that is very warm . I must also tell you that the item arrived really timely.Thanks for everythingC.A . Vision Consulting
 I use this wallet as a holder for my college ID and metrocard . It 's very cute , and besides , it 's Prada !
 Just large enough to carry a couple credit cards and ID . Love the colour .

 I use this on my 22 month old when he swims & when he 's playing outside in the garden with the hose . It fits very well - obviously a little big but will last him all thru the summer & beyond . I highly recommend it - it 's much easier than trying to slather a wet , wiggly toddler with sunscreen all the time !
 Fits her good and protects her from the sun . I like the neck sun guard especially . One thing ... , on breezy days the suit can make her quite chilly if it is wet so make sure you dry the little ones off good .
 This SPF rashguard has been a great item for sun and swim time . My son is very fair and I 'm conscious of avoiding excess sun . Since sunscreen is not advised for babies under 6 months and is very slippery and difficult to apply , this is the perfect solution . With this rashie , one only need apply suncreen to lower legs and feet , pop a wide brimmed hat on their little head , and you 're good to go . -LRB- I do n't put sunscreen on hands since my boy jams them in his mouth so much -RRB- . It has snaps along the bottom for quick diaper changes and a front zipper for easy-on/off . I plan on buying another one when he outgrows this one .
 I bought this for my 5 month old son to go swimming in to protect him from the Arizona sun . It 's very comfortable , easy to put on . I like the leg snaps for easy diaper area access . With this on and his hat he 's totally protected from the sun . I 'm very happy with the design and quality .
 My son outgrew his old one , so this is a repeat purchase in a larger size & diff colour . We love the cut , material , bbright colour and durability of this suit . LOVE IT !

 I really only needed this vest for my NY Comic Con outfit , and it did the trick perfectly . I was a little worried about the length when I looked at other vests on here that did n't come all the way down the torso , but this one does . It 's also very warm and does n't breathe , which was OK with an undershirt , but it 's something you should know if you plan to take it along in warmer climes . The material is great , it has plenty of pockets for all your stuff , and it shipped on time . Really just what I needed and I highly recommend it .
 I just purchased this vest for my boyfriend who 's a nature freak and he absolutely loved it ! I must admit , I didnt think it would be of good quality but it actually turned out to be very sturdy , great material , and had lots of pockets ! Perfect for a hiking or camping trip , or any other outdoor activity . I was n't sure whether or not to buy him the L or XL because he 's a pretty big and tall guy but the Large worked out perfect ! A + product ! And fast shipping !!!!
 fits well for this heavier female , just the right length at mid-hip so that pockets are still accessible when traveling and pockets big enough for paperback books and I.D. guides , not sure what I 'll use all the smaller pockets for , but I 'm sure they will get filled .
 This Vest was purchased for my husband for a very long overseas trip from the U.S. to Brazil . We purchased a 2XL to be sure it would fit him comfortably cause he 's a big & tall guy ; he 's 6 ' 4 '' tall and weighs 260lbs . He said the vest had plenty pockets and that it worked great . He wanted it for convenient access to his IPOD , snacks , meds , passport , etc. .
 stitch is good.fastening is slowed due to the small zipper.Anyway I like it .
 This vest is sturdy and great for carrying all your supplies into the bush . Load the stuff you have to reach in a hurry in the front and carry the rest in a backpack .
 I wear a size 12 -LRB- woman -RRB- . I wanted this to be fairly big for comfort when on the plane and the Large size worked great for that . Loved all the pockets , felt comfortable and secure zipping my passport and wallet into an inside pocket . Carried my medication , mints , granola bars , lip gloss , ear pods , tissue , book . And even a kid-size blanket in the big back pocket . Easy to forget which thing was in which pocket ... so i finally did ` edibles ' on the right and ` other ' on the left :-RRB- You need a system :-RRB- The fabric is lightweight , but strong . My only problem was that i felt the back neckline of the vest was high ... . with stuff in the pockets weighing the vest down , the back neckline pulled uncomfortably on my neck , so i did trim and re-sew that back neckline to be lower . It was easy going through the security check , just took off the vest and put the whole thing in the bin .
 This vest is soooo awesome !!! I ordered it to use it at the lake and for a Worlds of Fun trip i was going on so i would n't have to worry about things falling out of my pockets hanging upside down . I tested it out the first few days i had it around the house and out in the garage and running some errands around town and now i ca n't take the damn thing off ! Some stare and some compliment but IDK because it is so handy and comfortable . I ordered this coming into fall and it is perfect for these cool fall days with a long sleeve underneath . I must stress how comfortable and lightweight this is ! Like other reviews you may read order a size smaller , I am a large usually but i went ahead and ordered a medium because of other reviews and i 'm very happy i did . This vest is like a backpack but with easier accessible pockets and so much lighter . If this is what you get for $ 30ish bucks i ca n't imagine how nice those $ 75.00 vest would be .
 This vest is not just good for fishing but also good for traveling to carry travel documents like passport and visa . You can store stuffs for your camera like battery , memory card and other attachments . Overall , great product !
 This vest is comfortable to wear . I 've spent the last two months wearing only this vest -LRB- and pants -RRB- and I do n't have a single complaint about it . I carry a ton of stuff with me at any particular time and I really like throwing on the vest and getting out of Adventure HQ without having to put pens in my pockets and grab my keys and watch -LRB- yeah , I still wear a watch . It 's got a compass on it ! -RRB- At the end of the day , I drop all my accouterments in the big pockets and I do n't have to look for them in the morning -LRB- or afternoon , as the case often is -RRB- . I do a fair amount of hiking and kayaking around Los Angeles and this vest has served me well . I even wear it to work . I 'm buying a second -LRB- black , so I can be more like Han Solo -RRB- and taking them on two six-month expeditions through the Caribbean and then Antarctica . I 'll update my review upon my return and report how well they hold up through the tropics and the Antarctic -LRB- I might swing by Machu Pichu , while I 'm at it -RRB- . Now that I think of it , I bet I could fit my thongs in the back pocket ... My only complaint so far is that it gets pretty soaked with sweat when I 'm adventuring . So , some sort of sweat-wicking material might be better , if not as sturdy .
 I ended up returning mine and buying a vest locally because this one was way to large . I ordered a medium in the khaki color . Medium usually fits me . I was swimming in it . It was much too large . I 'm not sure if a small would have fit me either . I am 5 ' 6 '' and 135 pounds.The construction and pocket layout of the vest was great . I would have liked more large pockets , but it did have quite a few.It is a great vest , just order a size smaller then you normally would .
 This product was available at lots of various vendors online for prices up to $ 150 + . This seems to be just a well made as the more expensive ones but with a great price .
 Bought it as a gift and they loved it , has lots of pockets grewat for hiding different stuff !
 I have used this for almost six months now . It has been money well spent . I am an amature nature photographer and this vest hold almost all of my equipment . I would strongly recommend it . The only con , on occasion I have had a little trouble with the zipper opening as I zip it up . Though this problem it fixed by taking a moment and paying attention as you zip it up .
 This is a great vest . It has lots of pockets for carrying stuff . The price was the best I could find compared to other vests .
 Its made wll enough and has more than enough pockets . It was a little loose around the middle but nothing that got in the way .
 It was a gift for husband , and it had all the pockets he wanted , plus size is perfect . He loves it .
 I do residential energy efficiency inspections -LRB- aka home energy audits -RRB- and use this vest for holding my tools for a variety of inspection locations . The elastic gathers keep things like my laser tape meature and inspection camera in the pockets while I climb up into attics and down into crawlspaces . The inside pockets hold my regular tape measure and gloves . I have n't lost a single item yet and I get into some crazy spaces sometimes.After 18 months of continuous use , the pockets are starting to wear through in some places so I wish the material was thicker/more abrasion resistant - but I like the layout of this vest so much I am buying a replacement.My only other complaint is the weight of the garment , loaded with about 4-5 lbs of my tools , tends to settle on the back of my neck .
 Matter of fact , I used for work in a daily bases and my only problem with it is hard to keep it on the shoulders without been shifted to the front
 The vest came very quickly . It is large so it fits well . It appears well made and has many pockets . It will be perfect for my photo shoots and when I travel . I would recommend it for photographers but does not have a place for a long lens but will hold most of the things you need when your trave . I would give it 5 stars .
 I was looking for a vest that did not ride below my waist and this is the one ! Pockets could be a little more sturdy but for what it is intended for this is a great vest !
 Bought this vest as a gift for my daughter for our geocaching expeditions . She 's worn it for those and for hiking and just loves it . It was such a great buy that I bought another for a nephew .
 I am very happy with this vest . I have seen many in stores since I bought this and it 's far better than most I 've seen , and far better for the money . I bought it for horse back riding . I can put all my emergency things -LRB- cell phone , whistle , knife , hoof pick , leg wrap , compass , etc. -RRB- and treats for me and for my horse :--RRB- . It has pockets galore and all are very nice and deep with great closures , yet easy to get at . Very comfortable too .
 I bought this vest for my fiance . She is a photo guru and has been in desperate need for a photographer 's vest . She loved it . It provides room for everything she needs and then some . Comfortable , great color , and perfect storage . I would highly recommend this product .
 I 'm very satisfied with the vest . It 's light , have more pockets than I need , and secure . The price is reasonable . I did ` nt experience any rain where I went , so I do n't know how the vest performs in the rain .
 The vest fits fine and I like it . I had a 2X large , then I lost weight , so I bought a large .
 I ordered two in Khaki so my wife and I could use them on our upcoming trip to Alaska . The estimated delivery was June 1st , but they came on May 23rd which was great ! Although we have not used them yet , they appear to be everything we hoped for . A few days ago I found the vests -LRB- just slightly differnt -RRB- at WalMart for $ 24.95 . That was a disappointment .
 This vest allows the traveler many areas for organization and prevention of pick pockets . While traveling , accessibility to needed personal items are essential to the successful traveler/tourist .
 Seller was prompt on delivery , for the price it 's a great value . I do lot of driving and I can keep everything within reach
 item came in good condition , and , on time.fits well and price was good . would recommendto others .
 This is terrific ! Just what I was looking for . I had to look up why there 's a cotton patch on the pocket -LRB- it 's for holding fishing lures -RRB- . The vest fits perfectly and is just what I needed . It will hold everything . I do n't need my backpack anymore .
 Delivered very promptly . Workmanship seems very good . I use it to walk our dogs -LRB- 4 of 'em -RRB- and keep spare leashes , poop bags , etc. , all together so I can grab and go .
 I purchased this vest for my paranormal research team . I bought the vest in black which is the required ghost hunter color of course . It arrived promptly and in good condition . I really like the variety of the sizes of pockets . As I began loading ALL my various gear into different pockets , the vest began to get sort of heavy . Also if you load up the front pockets and do n't put anything in the rear pocket the vest will want to pull forward and can cut into the back your neck after wearing for long periods . I then moved some notepads to the rear , took out the extras and the vest worked excellently . It took me about 3 investigations to get the gear distributed to where I found it the most effective . I 've only had the vest for a little over a month so I ca n't rate the dependability.The only thing that kept the vest from getting 5 stars was the fact that the rear pocket is very large and things tend to bunch in the center of it which interferes with sitting .
 The medium is perfect for a 5 ' 4 '' 126 pound female . It allows room to really stuff the pockets . I used it as my carry on for a 15 hour flight and it held everything I needed ; snacks , books , tissues , hand wipes etc.It does get warm as the fabric does n't breathe so consider this if going to hot climate.The vest is great to use instead of carrying a day bag while on tour , too.I recommend it as a useful addition for travel .
 This vest was perfect ! Bought for my plane flight that lasted 10 hours.More pockets than I could use . Many were roomy enough to hold my baggies of pretzel snacks , half dozen little mini bottles of booze , camera , sunglasses , phone , pens , passport , wallet , and there was even a large magazine sized pocket in the center of the back of the jacket that allowed me to carry 4 or 5 magazines without having to fold them!Vest is light , comfortable , and the pockets are high enough so when you sit down , you are not sitting on any of your stuff . You probably could put a full change of clothes in here without much trouble.And the price is less than half of the other vest I was looking at from Scottivest !!
 After looking at a multitude of vests from different suppliers , comparing prices and quality , this vest blows away the competition in price and quality . This is not some cheaply made , weekend warrior vest , but rather a vest that is built to take years of use , and will stand the test of time .
 I got two vests , one in khaki and one in black . I am using them mostly for dog sports -- specifically Rally obedience , where I needed to have something with an easily accessible pocket , since you can not use a treat pouch in trials and I did n't want to be trying to dig treats out of my pants pockets . So , these vests are perfect for this use . They are also perfect for travel because you can put all of your important stuff in the pockets , along with things like lip balm , tissues , pens , a tablet , a small camera , whatever you need , without having to use a fanny pack , purse or wallet . The vest can easily be removed at airline security checks and easily put back on . There 's a reason all the seasoned travelers use a travel vest!About the sizing
 This is exactly what I was looking for . I do paranormal research and I need a vest with a lot of pockets to carry all of my equipment , and this is perfect ! This is a vest that has 17 pockets ! 17 ! Not only does his have 17 pockets in it , it 's a comfortable fit and is n't bulky . The material is fantastic . It does n't make a `` swishing '' noise when you move around like some of the vests do . I ca n't say enough good things about the vest . It 's a fantastic quality for a fantastic value . If you need a vest with a lot of pockets in it and is comfortable , then this is a must have for you . If you purchase this , you wo n't be sorry , I know I was n't .
 The pockets sag a bit when full , but it is incredibly useful for travel . I was able to fill it up and use is as `` wearable carryon luggage '' on a recent trip . It 's a way to keep all your personal items on your person without using up your airline carryon allowance . Of course , once I arrived it was also a useful photography gear caddy .
 I hate purses and this vest has so many pockets I can cram in everything I need including my ipod and flip video camera ... a sandwich ... my cell phone ... and on and on . I had purchased 2 similar vests years ago and used them , and used them and kept repairing them ... these vests are more sturdy than those that I originally had .
 I originally ordered the wrong size -LRB- apparently these run a little large -RRB- and this company was very responsive in getting me the correct size . I had to pay to ship the old one back to them , but that 's pretty standard . I am very happy with the quality of the vest . Nice and light weight .
 Awesome shirt and fits perfect ! If you like the Jerry Garcia this is a must buy , and its a really cool tiedie also !
 I got this for my son for a 6-week camping trip to the Canadian Rockies and rainy Alaska and believe me this little jacket got a workout ! Never a leak , never a split seam . These are fantastic ! The only nit I would pick is that they are not at all warm . If you will be in a place that is cool -LRB- or cold -RRB- , get a size larger so you can wear layers underneath . As a straight rain jacket in warm weather , it 's perfect !
 I love this jacket . I 'm looking forward to using it in the rain.I 'm a woman 's XS and found the boys jackets significantly cheaper priced . It makes a great replacement to a woman 's XS , well-fitted except it is a little baggy around the chest -LRB- length of jacket and sleeps are great -RRB- but nothing significant . If you 're a woman 's XS looking to save some money - definitely recommend it !
 We bought 3 - one for each kid . They 're lightweight , easily compress for stuffing into a book bag , and keep the rain off . They also have held up to the general rough-and-tumble exposure that any child puts clothing through .
 This coat is great ! My son is a large nine-year-old -LRB- about the size of a typical 10 year old -RRB- , and the size Large fit him perfectly , with a little room to grow . It is warm and waterproof . Very sharp looking , too .
 El material esta perfecto , transpirable y completamente impermeable . Excelente producto . solo le falta que le coloquen un bolsillo tipo Napole&oacute;n .
 Great coat ! Well made , light weight , awesome colors . My son is green obsessed and he loves it . Marmot is awesome .
 Love these Jackets . VERY good quality . I bought 2 . Kids stayed warm and DRY . Rolling and going crazy in the snow . Major snowball fights . Jacket worked perfect ! Also thin so we can use during warmer weather too . Packed in the suitcase easy .
 I love my Timberline Fleece it was just what I was looking for . I was looking for a very bright yellow fleece and I could n't find one in Chalotte N.C. , so someone told me to look on amazon.com . Now I have a new bright yellow fleece that is very warm . I must also tell you that the item arrived really timely.Thanks for everythingC.A . Vision Consulting

 Love it . For some reason I was n't expecting it to be so `` cold weather appropriate , '' but it 's lined on the inside and is SUPER WARM !! Also , because the lining is fleece you do n't get that itchy feeling you get with other beanies . I could wear this all day hehe .
 I was looking for a french bulldog tie for my fiance to wear at our wedding . We have a fawn french bulldog and this tie is perfect ! I looked at other sites and did n't find one as nice as this . The quality is very good and the price is extremely reasonable.The shipping was very fast too . Very satisfied .

 pull the adjuster tight and you 've got some serious cleavage . leave it loose and you 've still got great support and shape . The padding is a little thick but that 's not all bad . The fabric does n't breathe very well so I 'd just use this for going out and not all day wear .

 The first one I owned was from a local costume shop . I paid $ 5 for it . Went crazy for it , I even wore it out to lunch once with my husband . After 40 years he is used to my being comical . I ended up giving it to my sister for a party and I never saw it again . I felt like I had lost my alter ego!You ca n't imagine how I cheered when I saw it on Amazon this past Halloween season . Imdont remember how much I recently paid for it -LRB- maybe $ 20 or $ 30 ???? -RRB- -- it was worth it . Just give it a slight spritz of water and it is easier to style and move the bangs the way you want them . You may have to use a little scissors on a fewerrant hairs , but it really is easy to play with . The wig has more hair than in this photo where it looks wispy . Wear it in town sometime with a tight white tee shirt , jeans and huge sunglasses so you can watch people 's faces when you walk by . It 's an amazing cultural education on image , stereotypes and how we react to someone who is &#34; different &#34; . I 'm going to Ikea shortly and I will wear it with a conservative business suit . Everyone there smiles and says &#34; Hi &#34; , I 'm happy some people have a sense of humor ! I 'm thinking of wearing it with a mask and going to an &#34; open mike &#34; nite at a comedy club .
 It fits nicely & looks like the picture after some fixing . It 's a great addition to my roleplaying outfits !

 OK guys , you need this as a second wallet for ID , ATM card , and some cash . It will be flat with folded over bills and the clasp is a dual action -LRB- pulls bills under clip -RRB- Sure , you 'll need your regular wallet of choice , but grab a couple of things above and go to the beach or a quick fill-up with this on shorts without pockets and you 'll be okay
 I bought it for my husband as a gift coz his part-of-a-wallet wallet was getting old . He does n't carry a lot of cash , you can fold a few bills inside it , but do n't expect to carry cash in it . It 's got enough pockets for 8 cards , plus a see through pocket for ID . He was looking for a slim one that would n't bother him in the back or front pocket . This one would 've been perfect if it had n't had the clip at the back of it coz if he puts it in the back pocket it 's hard to sit on . He 's had it for over a year now and he 's still using it .
 Great value for money . Inexpensive , in fact a bargain at this price . Good soft quality leather . Enough space for my card . Slim pocket size . Will be sure to order a few more as Christmas gifts . Just wish they would ship to South Africa , would make purchases so much easier .

 I would recommend to anyone trying to get a toilet bag that is tough and durable . Love it and would buy for gifts for family and friends .
 i had my girlfriend buy me this on amazon because we were going on a trip . I needed my essentials . toothbrush , toothpaste , hair gel , cologne , moisturizer , sunblock , etc. . The price ca n't be beat and with amazon prime shipping , this was a no brainer . The material is good heavy stuff and wo n't tear on your . the handle is great for tossing it around or hanging up to us your stuff . It does n't have any pockets , just put your things in and go . I picked the olive drab because it seemed more military-esque . I did n't want black to get toothpaste and other stuff that might stain it . The green has been doing well for months now . I 'd definitely recommend this if you just need something to carry your toiletries with .
 Large enough for everything it needs to hold , small enough to carry and travel with . Great buy . Definitely a good investment , perfect for holding toilettries when travelling or at college or wherever .
 Short and sweet
 I bought this to replace my old travel case that was wearing out and had broken zippers . The old one was a vinyl material . This item is made of a nice , strong cloth and is very sturdy . I was surprised at the quality for the price . A good value .
 nicer than the ones @ Marshalls for the same price . Fine zipper and large enough for shaving cream after shave etc. .
 This is a basic travel bag for toiletries . Not fancy , but looks well made and durable with the thick canvas material . It 's a pretty good size so I can fit everything I need in one case - all my toiletries , shaver , hair brush , and some medical stuff without any problems.For the price , it 's pretty good when I compared it to other bags of the same size at my local department stores .
 For anyone looking to purchase a travel kit that is very functional and is not made out of leather which costs more than a reasonable amount , this purchase is excellent . The material is heavy . The zipper works fine -LRB- I have not owned it for a long time -RRB- . The styling is nice . It travels well . It has a handle . It has soft sides so it can be compressed to pack well . I have not dropped it , however I feel the heavy cloth would definately protect items . It holds a decent amount of items . I pack a hair brush , toothpaste , electric and regular toothbrush , aspirin , cologne , razor , and other small items . There is still about three inches of height left to pack . I recommend this item and I would purchase it again .
 My husband needed a new toiletries bag , but did n't want anything very fancy or expensive . This one is very basic but he said it was a good size and seems like it will be durable . It was just bigger enough than his old one without being too big .
 For the price you can not go wrong w / this shaving kit . It says `` Mini , '' but it 's actually not that small . It fits all of my things with plenty of room to spare . Material is solid . Only thing it 's lacking is a side pocket or two , but for the price it does n't matter .5 / 5
 Nice heavy material , feels very sturdy . Only one main compartment . Fits my needs perfectly , has held up on repeated on cross country airplane and road trips .
 Great bag for carrying your bathroom essentials when traveling . I like the quality of the product and would recommend it to anyone .
 It was just what i need it i had one before and this one is exactly the same one I am pleased .
 Basic product , heavy canvas , overall it get 's the job done . This is much like what I used to see in the Army PX .
 My shaving kit was trashed and I needed a new one , this fit the bill nicely . Like the OD color . Thanks
 It 's a durable canvas bag that can fit all of my toiletries . What more could you want ? It 's not stylish and there are no hidden compartments , but neither of those things mattered to me .
 The The lab coats were delivered as promised . They arrived quick , packagedproperly and in good condition . I got what I expected .
 I got this for my son for a 6-week camping trip to the Canadian Rockies and rainy Alaska and believe me this little jacket got a workout ! Never a leak , never a split seam . These are fantastic ! The only nit I would pick is that they are not at all warm . If you will be in a place that is cool -LRB- or cold -RRB- , get a size larger so you can wear layers underneath . As a straight rain jacket in warm weather , it 's perfect !
 I love this jacket . I 'm looking forward to using it in the rain.I 'm a woman 's XS and found the boys jackets significantly cheaper priced . It makes a great replacement to a woman 's XS , well-fitted except it is a little baggy around the chest -LRB- length of jacket and sleeps are great -RRB- but nothing significant . If you 're a woman 's XS looking to save some money - definitely recommend it !
 We bought 3 - one for each kid . They 're lightweight , easily compress for stuffing into a book bag , and keep the rain off . They also have held up to the general rough-and-tumble exposure that any child puts clothing through .
 This coat is great ! My son is a large nine-year-old -LRB- about the size of a typical 10 year old -RRB- , and the size Large fit him perfectly , with a little room to grow . It is warm and waterproof . Very sharp looking , too .
 El material esta perfecto , transpirable y completamente impermeable . Excelente producto . solo le falta que le coloquen un bolsillo tipo Napole&oacute;n .
 Great coat ! Well made , light weight , awesome colors . My son is green obsessed and he loves it . Marmot is awesome .
 Love these Jackets . VERY good quality . I bought 2 . Kids stayed warm and DRY . Rolling and going crazy in the snow . Major snowball fights . Jacket worked perfect ! Also thin so we can use during warmer weather too . Packed in the suitcase easy .
 Excellent condition . Fast delivery . A + +
 pull the adjuster tight and you 've got some serious cleavage . leave it loose and you 've still got great support and shape . The padding is a little thick but that 's not all bad . The fabric does n't breathe very well so I 'd just use this for going out and not all day wear .
 I love my Timberline Fleece it was just what I was looking for . I was looking for a very bright yellow fleece and I could n't find one in Chalotte N.C. , so someone told me to look on amazon.com . Now I have a new bright yellow fleece that is very warm . I must also tell you that the item arrived really timely.Thanks for everythingC.A . Vision Consulting

 I loved this costume . It was free flowing and comfortable . the only bad thing was that the sleeves did not stay in place .
 The Kids just love them . Realistic looking , large kong arms are great for pretending .

 I bought this backpack about 2 years ago . It is still in excellent condition , and it use it ROUGH every day . It fits my body like a glove - I 'm 5 ' 6 and about 120 lbs . -LRB- I own the M/L size -RRB- I did a lot of research before purchasing it , but it was really the way it feels that sealed the deal . It can handle a lot of weight , and still be very comfortable . The shoulder straps are wider and more flat - like those of Arcteryx packs , but they feel incredibly comfortable and very supportive . There is also a waist belt to put more of the weight onto your hips - it is also wider and more flat , but does a great job of transferring the weight , and is super comfortable . I sound like I 'm the owner of this company with this review , but I just ca n't believe I 'm the first person to review this pack ! I 'm 26 and I 've gone through lots of backpacks - this one is just phenomenal . It also has a built-in laptop envelop , which doubles as a camelbak water bladder holder when hiking -LRB- it has a hydration port as well -RRB- . It has a large back section , and a mid-size front section . The front section has a great organizer zipper panel within it as well . It has one large water bottle pocket on one side , and a velcro soft-pocket on the other . It also has a kind of secret pocket on the back , above where the shoulder straps attach . The back of it is made of ridged firm foam - it keeps you cool and does n't create any pressure points on your back , even if you 're carrying around a bunch of oddly shaped pieces of pottery . This is the perfect backpack . And if anyone wants to know anything else about it - feel free to email me . The only bad thing about this bag is that it is n't made in the USA - I 'm big on labor standards , but ... if you use it for years , I think it 's worth it .

 I ordered the black gloves for a military ball that I was attending the day after Christmas , and I can honestly say that they were perfect . The material was incredibly soft , not too difficult to wash , and stretchy , which helped keep them in place through lots of movement . Also , shipping was very fast - I received them in a matter of a few short days . I plan on hopefully using them again for next year 's ball and more ! : -RRB-
 The item was picked after the usual time so arrived after the party . They are in a box in the attic . Shop locally .
 The gloves are very elegant and have high-quality construction . The fabric is not thin , just the right thickness to smooth out the satin finish . They fit most hands ; large or very large hands might find the gloves tighter and the fingers shorter than would be comfortable for wearing for an entire evening . In all , they are elegant and fun !
 These are great gloves . I bought them for a costume and they are much better quality than those available at the costume shops .
 The product came in really faster than expected . The quality is beautiful , they fit perfect , the describtion they gave was accurate . I ordered the red satin opra gloves and am very pleased . I would recommend them to anyone . I am sort of pickie about accessories and wanted these gloves to go with a red sequin Mardi Gras gown , I could n't have chosen a finer pair . It was a true red just like online . Thank you
 the gloves are great , the material is not cheap , it 's thick enough w/o being winter gloves , but not a cheap flimsy material . They stretch , so it helps with the perfect . I would highly recommend these gloves
 I ordered these gloves on Monday and received them in the mail on Thursday . They were shipped rapidly and went extremely well with my prom dress , a burgundy dress . The material is soft and they stretch if necessary , so one size fits most . I tried them on several times before my prom and was ecstatic to see that they did n't stretch out nor did they lose their shape . Wonderful product , makes you look elegant and refined .
 I wore these for my college senior voice recital . They fit nicely and looked elegant -LRB- not cheap looking at all . -RRB- I would recommend to anyone !
 I needed these gloves to complete a costume , they were exactly as posted and arrived very timely . I would order from these folks again no problem .
 Received my merchandise on time and in excellent condition ... I highly recommend this product and the seller is very reliable .
 The black satin gloves compliment many ways of dressing ... from a long , sleeveless evening gown to a little naughty seductive play . They were a good purchase and would recommend .
 I work in a desert location in the Middle East . I walk on concrete surfaces daily launching , recovering aircraft . When I first got here I started getting blisters on my feet , seemingly regardless of what I wore . I started rotating my shoes and then I found these socks on Amazon.com . My wardrobe has nearly 200 pairs of socks of all kinds that I tried but these ClimaCool 's from Adidas are the best yet . They let my feet breathe and they 're cushioned in all the right places . Better than anything I 've used to date . Git 'em !!!
 These socks I bought for cycling and they are fantastic . They breathe very well , keep my feet cool , and dry off very quickly . I would definitely buy these again .
 I do not usually write reviews but found the previous reviews to be sooooooo very helpful that I decided to contribute my two cents.I bought these socks for Christmas gifts . My son , who is a mailman , said these are by far the best socks he has ever owned . They keep his feet cool and dry in our Florida weather . Thanks for all your great reviews ! We love them .
 I was a little hesitant spending so much on socks , however I am very satisfied with this product . These socks in particular are a great length -LRB- not to high or low on the ankles -RRB- and breath very well . In fact , I occasionally had issues with my feet not breathing properly through normal socks . These climacool socks remedied that issue and are quite light and comfy . I would recommend them to anyone looking for a lighter more comfortable sock .
 I live in Vegas and during summer it gets hot . I was finding that my shoes would smell after walking the dogs and my wife recommended these socks . Bought a pair and they are great at airing out my foot and allowing the sock to breath . Even on long walks my socks dont get nearly as sweaty as they used to and the great thing is my shoes are smelling better . They wear better than anticpated -LRB- the sock is thinner than my typical sport socks -RRB- and dont shrink in the wash.All in all a great product .
 I use this on my 22 month old when he swims & when he 's playing outside in the garden with the hose . It fits very well - obviously a little big but will last him all thru the summer & beyond . I highly recommend it - it 's much easier than trying to slather a wet , wiggly toddler with sunscreen all the time !
 Fits her good and protects her from the sun . I like the neck sun guard especially . One thing ... , on breezy days the suit can make her quite chilly if it is wet so make sure you dry the little ones off good .
 This SPF rashguard has been a great item for sun and swim time . My son is very fair and I 'm conscious of avoiding excess sun . Since sunscreen is not advised for babies under 6 months and is very slippery and difficult to apply , this is the perfect solution . With this rashie , one only need apply suncreen to lower legs and feet , pop a wide brimmed hat on their little head , and you 're good to go . -LRB- I do n't put sunscreen on hands since my boy jams them in his mouth so much -RRB- . It has snaps along the bottom for quick diaper changes and a front zipper for easy-on/off . I plan on buying another one when he outgrows this one .
 I bought this for my 5 month old son to go swimming in to protect him from the Arizona sun . It 's very comfortable , easy to put on . I like the leg snaps for easy diaper area access . With this on and his hat he 's totally protected from the sun . I 'm very happy with the design and quality .
 My son outgrew his old one , so this is a repeat purchase in a larger size & diff colour . We love the cut , material , bbright colour and durability of this suit . LOVE IT !

 This is so soft and what a color ! Cashmere and silk ... for a tango instructor . This was a birthday gift fora friend from Venezuela who dances tango with me . He deserves the best ! Beyondancing !
 Goes so well with my husband 's new leather bomber jacket . Now he looks like an authentic navigator ! Great quality scarf1
 silk on one side patterned cashmere on the other , off white pure style . I shall wear it as an ascot tucked in a shirt , sweater , vest . Chicks dig it or not It 's still style .
 I had a white silk scarf many years ago , but lost it somewhere along the road of life . My wife decided it was time for a new one , and so surprised me at Christmas a few years back . I wear this with a long woolen overcoat during those -LRB- relatively -RRB- cold months of January and February here in North Carolina , and it is not only decorative but functional when the cold wind blows and I ca n't afford to have `` hat hair . `` For the guy who likes to dress well and who thinks he has everything -- he does n't until he gets one of these scarves !

 This is an awsome work out tank top . I purchased them about a month ago and I am returning to buy more.The tanks shrink a little in the wash so wash them in cold water other than that perfect price and quality for your average gym rat .
 My husband is a gym fanatic , he loves these tank tops . They are perfect . The customer service was awesome . We had a small issue , but it was taken care of immediately and no questions asked !! Thank you!Lisa
 These are great shirts , very thick and durable . I would recommend buying at least one size smaller though , maybe two .
 I do n't have muscles like the guy in the photo , but I like freedom on my gym wear ; this one delivers on that front . nothing binding or restrictive , but enough to keep me covered for my workouts . . I 'll definitely be stocking up to round out my collection

 It was raining for days on end here in Florida and I needed a new rain jacket . I am a short woman and know I can fit into a boy 's x-large jacket . I was a little worried ordering this on line as sometimes , sizes can differ . And it fits me like a glove . It repelled the water great and it is comfy . I am very satisfied with this purchase and being a boys , it saved me some money too !

 This umbrella is particularly useful when it rains heavily which is quite common in the New England area .
 This was purchased as a gift for one of our grandson 's - he was very happy with it . Priced right .
 I purchased this for my older son who is a die hard Yankee fan !! Not only was I happy with delivery time and super great deal , but he also loves it so much that he too sleeps with it on !!! GREAT !!!!!

 I 've been wearing these forever . I like the low rise fit for me . I 'm a 34 size and I buy size 36 , fit great !
 I 've been using the same briefs for years . Every time I switch , I 'm disappointed , so even if I ca n't find them in a store , I can get them online .
 I 've been a long-time Jockey user . I 've tried other brands but I always end up going back to Jockey . Reading the reviews , most of the complaints were about the sizing . This is the &#34; Low Rise &#34; model which sits just over the hips . As this area is normally larger than the waist , it will require a larger size . I normally wear a 32 and ordered the 34 which fit me perfectly . For those wanting more coverage and a waistband closer to the waist , order the regular Classic Brief , not the Low Rise .
 So tired of going to stores and finding what I want , but not in my size . Problem solved !
 These are good briefs . They are , like another reviewer said , tight , but some of us like it that way . I 'm in no way small , but these really make you feel sexy . Personally , if I 'm going to wear briefs , they should be tight . But , when I 'm not wearing briefs , I 'm wearing boxers . So , there 's the loose and tight of it .
 There are times when you need to keep `` the boys '' close ... and these briefs do the job ! Best for those who like low rise jeans ... very comfortable .

 The colors i got were not bad at all . I got a blue print that is n't too ostentatious . The top is a little too big for me and the bottoms are a little too high cut for my taste , but I just fold them over . For sizing , I am about a size 3/4 in womens and the small fits pretty decently .

 These Brushed Booties are a dream to wear year-round when you do n't want socks with cuffs . Wear them with sneakers , or just to lounge around the house . They 're great to sleep in.If you have any problems with socks bunching up and giving you blisters , you will adore having these Brushed Booties . Once you try them , you will order them again and again . -LRB- You ca n't always find them in the stores . -RRB- I was thrilled to see them on Amazon.com.Recommended !
 Fast service and so soft and nice . It is so hard to find these in the stores today .

 I did not receive the products by the time I was advised I would . I then contacted the company and asked if there was anything I could do in this as there was no tracking information available . Within a day of sending the email , I was very courteously advised that as there was nothing that could be done , and since I did not receive the product , I would receive a full refund immediately . So while I can not write a review about the product , I would like to say the company seems honest and reliable , and very friendly .

 I have worn many different sets of rain gear since I lived in Alaska . Of course there are very high quality sets , However for the price and the quality of this set , you absolutely can not go wrong . I recently used my set on the ocean during heavy rain and wind and could not have been happier and drier ... thank you JM

 I love this bag ... I actually own it in the Bleu color . I am a bit confused on how they are calculating the original price though as the tag attached states that the original price was 805,00 Euro -LRB- about $ 1066.00 -RRB- and then sold at an outlet -LRB- Prezzo Outlet -RRB- for 350,00 Euro -LRB- $ 464.00 -RRB- . mentioning the outlet tag for those buying these as gifts.Also , mine has somewhat of a design flaw on the back side ... one of the darker ` squares ' has a partial ` white outline ' like the others , hard to explain , not very noticeable , but obviously I noticed it . Since it came from some sort of an outlet it could be just mine or it could be the whole batch , not sure , just mentioning it.It is also more along the lines of being 11 '' long , 6 '' high and 6 '' deep . The amazing real leather smell when you open the box is GREAT , authentication cards and dust bag were included .
 This shirt is of good quality and logo of the team is large and striking .
 I 've been wearing these forever . I like the low rise fit for me . I 'm a 34 size and I buy size 36 , fit great !
 I 've been a long-time Jockey user . I 've tried other brands but I always end up going back to Jockey . Reading the reviews , most of the complaints were about the sizing . This is the &#34; Low Rise &#34; model which sits just over the hips . As this area is normally larger than the waist , it will require a larger size . I normally wear a 32 and ordered the 34 which fit me perfectly . For those wanting more coverage and a waistband closer to the waist , order the regular Classic Brief , not the Low Rise .
 So tired of going to stores and finding what I want , but not in my size . Problem solved !
 These are good briefs . They are , like another reviewer said , tight , but some of us like it that way . I 'm in no way small , but these really make you feel sexy . Personally , if I 'm going to wear briefs , they should be tight . But , when I 'm not wearing briefs , I 'm wearing boxers . So , there 's the loose and tight of it .
 There are times when you need to keep `` the boys '' close ... and these briefs do the job ! Best for those who like low rise jeans ... very comfortable .
 Needed to update my uniform set and found ordering this easier than getting to AAFES . The quality is OK , and the delivery and cost was reasonable . Nothing extra special , but not a bad value .
 I am very happy with the product that I ordered . The quality was just what I expected , and it was delivered on time . Elton K Bass
 I love my Timberline Fleece it was just what I was looking for . I was looking for a very bright yellow fleece and I could n't find one in Chalotte N.C. , so someone told me to look on amazon.com . Now I have a new bright yellow fleece that is very warm . I must also tell you that the item arrived really timely.Thanks for everythingC.A . Vision Consulting

 I was very pleased with the pirate costume . It is very cute . I bought it for my daughters 9th birthday , a Pirate Party .
 Bought this for daughter for pirate night on Disney Cruise . It held up without issue and fit well . It 's a halloween costume , so it 's not made to last , and the price was in range for what I was willing to spend for her to wear it a couple of times . Happy overall .
 These suits are great ! I purchased one 2 summers ago a 12-18mo . from another company and my son wore it for 2 summers . 2 summers of chlorine pools and Arizona sun ! It held up great ! The other name for it is `` Sunbusters '' I was excited to find this vendor for my sons suit for this summer . They were very reasonable on the price and shipped very fast !! I will be looking them again next year for sure !! Thanks !!
 I was extremely pleased when this product arrived super quick , just in time for my daughter 's weekly swim class . She 's been wearing the suit for nearly two months and it is holding up nicely - the material still looks new even after many dips in the pool . One of the snaps along the leg seam no longer snaps securely but the others hold well . That is my only complaint . Otherwise , a great toddler swim suit , and the price was definitely right .
 This is an adorable outfit . My son wore it at 8 months and it fit him fine -LRB- there was def . some room for him to grow but I would think if he was closer to 18 months it would n't fit as well -RRB- . I like how he was safer out in the sun with this on and the snaps on the bottom were a breeze -LRB- and smart design choice ! -RRB-
 I love this suit ! I was looking for a suit for my 4 month old . He was taking swimming classes and I was worry about the Florida sun . It is well made and it is easy to put it on . It is really easier to handle the baby with the suit compared to having two pieces .
 I bought two for my twin boys and this is a great swimsuit - they were not even wet under the suit . I would recommend this product strongly .
 Love this suit , it saves me from having to lather my daughter in suncream and I do n't worry about her skin being damaged by the sun . -LRB- She 's much more content only having to wait for cream to be put on the bits that show ! -RRB- She seems very happy in it . Size-wise I think it 's true to size . It seems very well made and I will probably be getting another when she outgrows this one . I have seen the exact suit elsewhere being sold for a lot more money !

 my nephew loved this costume . he kept trying to sneak it out under his normal clothes to wear to school . Arrived within decent time and good quality .
 My son like it too much . The materials of all the accesories are fine , not to use it every day but for ocassional it 's fine .

 I bought this bag 4 years ago after my old back-pack ripped . I used this bag to lug heavy heavy books and a heavy laptop to school . Four years later , the bag is still in great condition . It holds a ton of stuff and is impossible to break .

 The proud members of the international community of Gas Mask collectors -LRB- or Gassies , as we call ourselves -RRB- are pleased to see that Amazon is now selling the Belgian gas mask.Quite simply , this is the best gas mask in the world , easily outstripping both the military and civilian Israeli versions in terms of quality and design - although , to be fair , their children 's mask remains the best option for young people and dwarves.Despite the funky colour scheme , the East German gas mask ca n't filter a gnat 's fart and the pathetic , eco-friendly British version - made from Welsh string-vests and previously-owned toilet paper - pales by comparison.Sadly , Belgium is too often dismissed as the world 's worst colonial power and an unlovely home to an obscene number of serial killers . Now it is time to celebrate her achievements - the vierendeel truss , nauseating fruit-flavoured beers , an imaginary , moustachioed amateur detective with an eating disorder and the finest gas mask known to man.If you still believe Belgium to be an irrelevant , non-country peopled by bickering dullards , please keep you ill-informed opinions to yourself - otherwise Jean-Claude Van Damme might come round and kick your head off .
 Run/chase ppl in this thing , and you 're gon na start breathing heavy , and when you breathe heavily , and the intake vents , which are situated under the lenses ... SHOOTS jets of air into your eyes , blinding you and give them a window of opportunity for retribution saoifdhodshfiahoshfo xDSeriously though other than that , this thing is great , do n't expect it to protect against anything though
 looks fun and humiliating on boy slaves ! easy to manage and it looks strange and appealing to me somehow .
 This Item I bought for halloween and it was cool looking and OK comfortable it was a very entertain ing buy .

 This was my first purchase of a thong and I 'm so impressed with how comfortable it is to wear . The fit is great too .
 This thong is perfect !! I was a little skeptical about thongs because it seems like they would be uncomfortable . But its exactly the opposite . They provide lots of support where needed and you do n't have to worry about having lots of extra material . You feel like ur not even wearing anything underneath at all . Plus these underwear are super sexy and u wont stop looking @ how huge ur cock looks in the mirror . Dont worry about the string in the back its very comfortable and u dont get the feeling like u have a wedgy . The package is plenty big and it stretches well . Even for us guys who have cocks like stallions , it perfectly fit my 10 + inch erect dick in the pouch . So i would def suggest this to men who have a monster cock and huge balls . Im not sure why men wearing thongs in our society is so weird because they def feel better than briefs and boxer briefs . Wearing a thong makes u feel horny all the time , it brightens ur day !! This thong if def for those who are in shape . This is the most comfortable thong ever . Plus Im not gay , i just like the feeling of having nothing on under my clothes .
 Great feel and support . Fantastic on the tennis court or ocean swimming . They are so comfortable , I often forget I have them on .
 I buoght this thong out just to try it ... I am a big fan of underwear and want to try on every style . I was vey skeptical of this at first , I mean it is a thong . I got it , in a nice little package too . Tried it on . WOW ! I didnt know thongs were this comfortable , much better than jockstraps . I might even by more . The only thing I dont like is that the pouch is a little small , but this is a problem with alot of underwear . Especially if you happen to get a little too excited , your member seems to peek outside the top , and theats when it becomes unfortable . It is a must try for ALL guys ... yes , us straight ones too .
 These are my single favorite pair of underwear . Not your typical jock but much more comfortable and stylish . I 'm in the military so at first I thought `` thongs are not for `` real men '' but after wearing these I found they are , and a lot more guys wear thongs and jocks than you realize . I wear these for every day activivties , sports , work , and leisure . There is n't much fabric so they 're great under jeans and my girlfriend thinks there sooo sexy . After wearing them for a while it 's like nothing is there because they support you only where you need it . If you 've never owned a thong , I think you should give these a shot.I definately recomend the - IN2 Y-back thong .
 This belt is wonderful , minus the fact it 's 2 1/4 '' wide . I guess you 're not supposed to wear it as a regular belt ...

 This shirt is cute , protects from the sun and is light weight . I had concerns that in the 96 degree heat/humidity that my 1-year-old would get overheated by wearing a shirt . However , this shirt was perfect . When it is wet it helps keep him cool .
 Great Product!Protects wet or dry , what a great price . Others I looked at were 3 + xmore expensive.The boys did not even mind the shirt . Works great ! I bought 3 of them and matching bottoms.They look so cute on too.I highly recommend.Mommo of 2 ages 1 and 3
 Late review but it 's ok.Pros
 Title says it all . I always loved Rothco hats . Word of advice though , DO NOT WASH ! -LRB- it will fall apart and fade considerabe after like 2 washes -RRB- .
 Nice fit , true to size , beautiful color and it goes with several other outfits I own . I would recommend this one .
 Just a note on size - I usually order a 30 waist ; some companies size their products smaller than one might expect from sizing guidance -LRB- probably due to the trend toward tighter fitting clothing -RRB- . I ordered size small hoping they were n't too small - even after a wash they fit just fine . The cut of these shorts is almost perfect - roomy enough but not so much fabric that they bunch.The construction and material are both pretty good in quality . Decent value . I 'll likely order more .
 My husband has worn the tapered briefs for years , however , they are hard to find . Of all the stores in this area that carry Jockey , only Macy 's carries the tapered briefs . The problem is , they always seem to be out of stock . I finally gave up and turned to Amazon.com and viola ! , there they are , and a little cheaper , too . I should have done this a long time ago . They arrived in just a few days . Thanks for being there !
 Fit is great . Not long . Great leg room . I will be back for more . The one thing is that the fly opens freely ! So be careful if you are wearing them around the house that you dont know !
 shopping within Amazon will get you these for 16 bux and free shipping ... also Jockey . The tapered boxers have always been my husband 's preference because he says when he does physical work , the regular boxers ride up the butt crack . The tapered fit nicely , and they 're true to size . Tapered are difficult to find . These were 14.99 w/free shipping -LRB- nov. 12 -RRB- . I guess the xmas spirit jacked them up.Our local Bealls , which is only store we 've found them in this area , they 're 22 $ + tax .
 These boxers do not add a lot of bulk under the pants like traditional boxers do . Their fitting is nice and slim . They are not too long and not too wide . The opening at the side is nice , although it looks a little girlish to me . The fabric is thin and comfortable . I wish these were 100 % cotton though as I am a little wary of having non-natural materials in my underwear .
 The best boxer shorts on the market . They are tapered so they are not so baggy but loose enough to feel like boxers . Look great too . They come in several colors too ,
 I bought these for my husband for Christmas and he loves them . They are verybsoft as well . The true test is that he has requested more of the same ones .
 I bought 3 pairs of this and it was all good . My husband like wearing it and best of all the price is affordable .
 I 've been wearing these forever . I like the low rise fit for me . I 'm a 34 size and I buy size 36 , fit great !
 I 've been using the same briefs for years . Every time I switch , I 'm disappointed , so even if I ca n't find them in a store , I can get them online .

 comfy bra and ca n't beat the price ! pads are part of the cup though so are not removable .
 Both my girls loved this toy . I needed something to keep them busy when I went out of town and I bought this toy and they spent hours playing together with this set . What I like most about it is all the stuff that comes with it fits inside of it and it is easy for them to clean up on their own .
 This toy was given to my daughter for Christmas 2 years ago . Since then I 've bought the additional sets and this past Christmas , the whole Aladdin set . My daughter just loves this toy so much . I love that all the pieces fit in and can be neatly stored in its own cute case that she can take with her anywhere she goes . Definitely recommend !
 My daughter received this as a Christmas gift in 2005 when she was 4 . A year later she still loves to play with it and even her 2 yr-old brother plays with us too . We act out the Cinderella story as well as make up our own . I love it because I get to close it up after we play with it with all the pieces inside -LRB- except the pumpkin carriage which we bought separately . -RRB- It 's easy to take with us when we visit friends and family . We 're hoping for the other accessory set so she has the stepsisters to play with -LRB- they do n't come with the main box set . -RRB-

 My husband likes to buy nothing but Carhartt clothing . They last long and wear well as work clothing . His problem comes where waist size is concerned though . Carhartt , and all the other manufacturers need to consider that not everyone wears 30x30 , and above . He needs a 28x34 , and those are difficult to come by.After looking online , I see the difficulty is still there .
 My husband and sons have purchased many brands of work clothes . These by far last the longest and hold up to rough daily wear . Quality items.They wash great !

 i love these ! i wear them just as shorts in the summer and always get compliments
 These pants feel very comfortable and fit well . I have a bit of a spare tire so the larger waist is perfect . However , I am 5 ' 2 '' so they are very long and will have to be shortened a lot . I like the flared bottom but imagine that will be gone by the time so much is taken off . Wish them came in a petite size . Also , it would be helpful to know the inseam measurement is . No mention on the website .
 I had some Danskin yoga pants for many years & they finally wore out . Of course I never thought I could get the exact same ones after so many years . Much to my delight I received these new ones & they were the exact same pant . Way to go Danskin -- sticking with a good product .
 I do not think I have ever owned a pair of yoga pants that were this comfortable . They have a nice wide waistband that does not roll . The material is not too light , not too heavy . They wash and dry easily . Hope Amazon gets them back - I want more more - more ! : -RRB-
 Love these pants to work out in or lounge around the house ! They are really soft and really comfortable !
 Cool , dressy , slimming , these pants are a must have as they will make WHAT EVER you wear look fabulous.Black will go with everything . As a school teacher , work out fan and pot luck church goer , my Danskins look great with everything from tennis shoes to spike heels . Fabric is quality , and the fabric looks smooth and sleek . The Price at Amazon is even cheaper then at the Danskin site . Enjoy .
 I ordered these online to replace my favorite pair of Danskin yoga pants that were wearing out . These new pants are lighter in weight than my old pair and contain more synthetics , but they are comfortable and sturdy . I had to shorten them quite a bit . I would recommend them for their value - the price is good and they should hold up fine .
 Delivered on time . Pants fit great , look great , and stretch better than I do in yoga positions . Very comfortable .
 Exactly what my wife was looking for and not available in Canada as she was told that Danskin Canada has undergone bankruptcy .
 These pants are awesome ! Very comfy and soft . I wear them for working out or even for around the house/for bed . Danskin makes the best yoga pants in my opinion !
 Recently ordered these pants . They are incredibly comfortable and the fit is wonderful . I like the firmness of the waistband and it is also very comfortable . Wish they came in more colors though .

 It is really hard to find a sports bra in the size I needed . I reccomend this bra for those of you who are big chested , but still want to exercise without having your chest flop around .
 This is the most comfortable bra I have ever owned . I am a 34 G in the brand name Goddess but I am able to wear a 38 DDD in this bra . In my experience all my bras have had a painful `` break in '' period but this bra comes `` broke in '' right of the hangar . Ordinarily the underwire hurts my ribs for a while but the underwire in this bra does n't really rest hard against your body . It 's very unusual however very comfortable and provides nice support at the same time . Normally a sports bra gives a `` unaboob '' appearance but this sports bra gives nice seperation.When ordering keep in mind that the cup size runs large and the numbers run small . I highly recommend this bra .
 This is an excellent sports bra especially for large breasted women . I am large-breasted but thin/small ribcage . I recommend this bra to anyone . It is so much better than a one size fits some , cupless bandage bra .
 This bra is comfortable , and supports me appropriately . I bought it based on the previous reviews of other women with larger breast . Great value also .
 This bra is SO comfortable . I have never had a supportive sports bra that was comfortable before . I picked it up at a local store , and the ladies there were very helpful helping me find the right size . I wear these every day when working out , and they are absolutely wonderful .
 Best sport bra I had for my size , fantastic if you are a bustier woman .
 I love this bra . I have it in both black and white . I wear the 36G and I use the black for outdoorsy stuff like backpacking and canoe tripping and I wear the white for medium to low intensity workouts like strength training and zumba . I 've tried jogging in it -LRB- like across the backyard -RRB- and it does n't support me as well as my Enell which I use for running and soccer . My only complaint is that the underwire started poking me in the side on the 4th day of my 7 day canoe trip this summer . I think it stretches a little with continuous wearing and swimming in it . This did n't happen when I wore it for a few days straight backpacking . I do n't sleep in it , but I will probably take a 2nd bra to rotate daily on my next canoe trip . The best thing though is that even though I wore it for a few days straight -LRB- which could be kinda gross -RRB- , it did n't smell and it seemed as good as new after I washed it at home .
 i thought the bra was true to size , fits well and above all is COMFORTABLE . it has n't been hot enough yet here for me to tell how well the bra wicks moisture away ... we 'll see this weekend . but it fits well , supports well , and is comfy . i just bought a 2nd one .
 LOVE this bra ! Its my absolute favorite sports bra . I never have any bounce even when doing the hardest workouts . Will buy again and again !
 These are a great bra for sports , work or anytime . They are extremely durable .
 Bouncing breasts are unattractive and painful . If you know exactly what I 'm talking about , then this bra is a bra you should try . It offers the same no-bounce strength of traditional sports bras without the unflattering uniboob feature . I 've worn this bra for high-impact activities and am very happy with it . It does sit higher -LRB- look at picture -RRB- , so if you normally wear low-cut tops when you 're working out , look at other options . I have n't experienced the issues that other reviewers have ... in fact , I 'm not even aware of this bra when I 'm working out ... a testament to product fit and performance .
 love ! love ! love ! just been wearing it a couple of days ! but it is so great ! I have never had a sports bra that has supported me that well and this does !! I am a 34DDD/34E and have always had difficulty finding bras that support myself and now I have ! No bouncing ! no squishy ! and no one boob ! i actually look like I have two large breasts ! I look like a woman ! yay !! : -RRB-
 I love these bras . I wear a 32C . Do n't let the underwires scare you off . These bras are built for medium to large breasted women.Most sports bras do n't have underwires and tend to operate under the theory that if they can squash your tatas back into your chest cavity , then they are offering adequate support . In actuality , one gets all the pain of crush damage , and for the medium to large busted woman , those inferior models feel like trying to contain 3 lbs of jello with a rubber band while jogging.The Lunaire has underwire support , but they 've comfort-wrapped the underwires so that they do n't poke at odd angles . I wear mine several times a week and they 've lasted for several years . -LRB- Mind you , I air dry them rather than putting them in the dryer . -RRB- The shoulder straps are wide and stay up , despite the fact that I play ice hockey with boys about 1/2 my age who shove and push . In fact , my Lunaires are so comfortable , I even wear them to work sometimes . They look like a regular bra , but they are n't . The only downside I can see is that the cups are full and prohibit wearing lowcut shirts , however , I wear these to do sports , not impress the boys . I would recommend this bra to anyone .
 This is more like a bra than a sports bra , but it 'll do for low impact exercising . It gives you a nice shape .
 I am large - 36DD . This bra is very comfortable and definitely holds one up and the sides in . The only problem with the bra is that it is high up in front - so if you plan to wear a low fronted top , this is not the bra for you . All other regular type tops look great with this bra .
 The main reason that I bought this bra was for it 's CoolMax fabric ... it really wicks away the moisture . However , please be aware that the bottom band is not made of coolmax ... and that 's one area that does collect some moisture ! I like the support that it offers - enough to keep me from bouncing uncomfortable , but not enough to make me feel imprisoned . Some reviewers complained about the pointed cups ... . that is n't a problem with me as I 'm from the generation that bought bras to `` LIFT & SEPARATE '' : - -RRB- I also really like the adjustable straps , as I 'm extra tall , and most sports bras have too short of straps for me . If the bra survives several washings , I plan on buying more of these nice bras .
 This sports bra is good for moderate exercise or activity but I do n't think it would offer enough support for some very active sports . I am glad I have a gaited horse and not a rough riding one ! That said , it is a good value , well made and very comfortable .
 I recently started a running program and had to find a really effective sports bra for the first time in quite a few years . I am really impressed with this sports bra . The underwire offers great support and the bra is so well constructed you have no idea it is in there when you are running . The bra keeps me from bouncing and its so comfortable , I do n't even think about the fact that I am wearing it . Great product for the well-endowed active woman ! I found the bra to run very true to size .
 This bra is really great . I feel comfy and confident when I 'm at the gym . It 's very true to size and wicks away the sweat like no other ! If you 're tired of the saggy uni-boob formed by those other sports bras , order this one !
 This Sports Bra was exactly what I needed for our Fitness Center and it does well in all the activities I participate in . Thanks .
 I like the coverage of this bra plus the support . I like to wear it for everyday activities . The price was good .
 I love this bra . It is extremely comfortable and very reasonably priced . I am glad I can still find it here . Dillard 's stopped carrying it and I think that was big mistake . It ca n't be beat for fit , comfort and price .
 Ordered for its Coolmax and fit features , it seemed to expand some after laundering so perhaps ordering a size smaller might have been better . Also there was not a lot of strap adjustment but with these summer temps still a good item .
 This bra is EXACTLY what I have been searching for . It 's wicking properties are great . No more uncomfortable wetness against my chest . I love the support it gives . I started out with two and got four more . It has made this hot , sweaty summer much more bearable for me . I even sleep in this bra . Recommended .

 SOMETHING DIFFERENT is an album answering the question `` what if Lost And Found recorded with other instruments ? `` So , Lost And Found offers their orignal sound -LRB- which I prefer -RRB- on the first nine tracks . Then , on the next nine , they have other instruments added . I like this , too , but I prefer traditional speedwood.After the eighteenth song , wait and there will be a Bluegrass version of `` Multiply '' and if you wait after that , there will be a song called `` 1980 '' that Lost And Found did not write - but was written by a guy who was writing down thoughts as he reads the newspaper . It sounds like a sarcastic in-your-face , `` we 're America , and we can do what we want '' piece of music . I think Lost And Found sang it just because it is sarcastic and they enjoyed playing it.I love the fact that Saskatchewan is included . The one song I sometimes do not listen to is `` Your Memory . '' I really like the song , but it can make me sad and it really makes my sister sad . It is about remembering loved ones who have passed on . It is extremely important to my life because I was just getting over the death of a good friend when I actually got to sit and listen to the song -LRB- I did n't own the CD yet and was listening to a friend 's copy -RRB- . If you like Lost And Found 's traditional style , but want these songs , just stop the CD after the first nine tracks . If you 'd like to hear what Lost And Found would sound like with a full band , get this CD and listen to the last nine tracks.Then you can decide if you prefer listening to the first half or second half or like both equally well .
 But it still gets 4 stars . Honestly , I think the plain old speedwood versions of the songs are way better , with the sole exception of Ca n't Take Away . The rest of the songs just seem weird played with electric instuments , and the drums just make it seem like it is n't Lost and Found.I would still definitely reccomend this album , but only after getting the Speedwood albuls , Something , etc , all of which were 5 stars in my book . Then again , I do n't like most music with drums and electic instruments , so if you do , maybe you will like them on this cd . Either way , just the speedwood versions are well worth getting the cd for , and I also love the last hidden track -LRB- 1980 -RRB- .
 Lost and Found sounds like nothing else I have ever heard . In the midst of the endless sea of over-produced , hyper-commercialized `` popular '' Christian music and the recent trend of artists jumping on the praise and worship bandwagon with its `` 7/11 '' songs , L&F ; is a refreshing change . I love the depth and poetic nature of many of their lyrics ; songs that speak not only of our passion for God but also embrace and proclaim timeless truths and doctrines ... often pulled directly from the Word ... not that every L&F ; song is serious ... many of them are just fun ! Their music has a raw , unrefined edge to it ... and it is so original in style
 You know , when I first heard of this album , I could n't wait to hear the added-to versions with other instruments and artists . I was incredibly surprised to hear that they were still better raw and un-touched . That said , the new versions are still incredible , but nothing to the `` Lost and Found '' versions . This is an excellent album by and excellent group , see a concert if you ever get the chance ! They are as good as on the cd and hilarious in-between songs ! Stein Auf
 Lost and Found has done it again . This album is great for all the right reasons . If you have never heard them perform , then you do n't know what to expect . Purchase this album anyway ! There is a reason that this song writing/playing duo consistently receives 5 star ratings on Amazon , they maintain artistic and theological integrity by not bowing to corporate producers . This is playful music with an intense message , but this particular album is even more intriguing than their previous releases because it offers us an insight into their other sound.Michael Bridges and George Baum 's previous recordings have always centered on their message , leaving their music well played , but still raw from a production format . Some listeners have viewed this a s a plus , others a minus . This time they have given us both , there are 9 songs on this CD , each offered twice . The first time through , it 's the same Lost and Found that we have come to know and love . they play just like they 're in concert , straight through with no studio reworking . The second time through , they offer the same songs reworked with more musicians , different instrumentation ... the works . This is their `` what if ... '' album , but like their previous recordings , it is also `` Something Different . ''
 My husband likes to buy nothing but Carhartt clothing . They last long and wear well as work clothing . His problem comes where waist size is concerned though . Carhartt , and all the other manufacturers need to consider that not everyone wears 30x30 , and above . He needs a 28x34 , and those are difficult to come by.After looking online , I see the difficulty is still there .
 My husband and sons have purchased many brands of work clothes . These by far last the longest and hold up to rough daily wear . Quality items.They wash great !
 My son 's birthday is on Halloween , and he 's been an avid fan of the band since he was in college in the mid-90s , so what better present could I give him than a Phish Halloween t-shirt ! It was shipped quickly , in excellent condition .

 I love my Timberline Fleece it was just what I was looking for . I was looking for a very bright yellow fleece and I could n't find one in Chalotte N.C. , so someone told me to look on amazon.com . Now I have a new bright yellow fleece that is very warm . I must also tell you that the item arrived really timely.Thanks for everythingC.A . Vision Consulting
 Talla completa el mejor pantal&oacute;n para el trabajo diario , a la vez viste de forma casual . tela excelente , buen dise & ntilde ; o , y calidad .
 This was the easiest way to buy jeans ! Perfect fit and fast service . Did n't have to waste gas shopping the stores .
 According to my wife , who I bought these jeans for , She says , `` These jeans are rugged and roomy . The front pockets are deep . As far as I can tell the design has not changed since I started buying these several years ago . ''
 CUMPLIO CON LAS ESPECTATIVAS PARA LA COMPRA DE ROPA POR INTERNET , LA FACILIDAD PARA LA ESCOGENCIA DELAS TALLAS Y EL MODELO .
 este producto es muy bueno diria q excelente asi que muchas gracias por todo es una buena mercancia y medida esperada
 these things look very good , they feel good and they last . not to mention that the price is far lower than it is in the store . i highly recomend them .
 I used to wear Levi Jeans , but then decided to try a pair Wranglers since they were on sale at a very good price . They are much more comfortable than the Levi Jeans by the way they are designed to fit . Wranglers for me from now on !
 When your pants measurements are 48 '' waist with a 28 '' inseam , it gets a little hard to find cloths that fit . A whole lot of specialty `` Big & Tall '' pants for us big guys are `` custom fit '' for 48 X 28 start life with a 38 '' inseam and are then chopped by ten inches so that you feel like you 're back in the 70 's wearing some bell bottom pants again . Wrangler Jeans does not use this method with their product . They fit well both in the waist and are not too long or big in the legs . This is a great pair of Jeans and I 'll be wearing them for a long time to come . I highly recommend this product .
 HI , ALL THE BIG GUYS LOOKING FOR A PAIR OF JEANS , YOUR SEARCH ENDS HERE.I BOUGHT A PAIR OF WRANGLER MEN 'S RUGGED WEAR RELAXED FIT JEANS , ANTIQUE INDIGO BLUE.WHAT CAN I SAY JUST THAT I HAD A TERRIFIC EXPERIENCE SHOPPING FROM AMAZON.COM , THE PRODUCT WAS AS DESCRIBED AND SHIPPING WAS FAST.ALL I CAN SAY IS , SHOP WITH CONFIDENSE AT AMAZON , YOU WONT REGRET IT .
 I am 5 7 so when I saw these jeans come in a 29 length i ordered them . They were as advertised . I really like the jeans
 I wear blue jeans every day , 365 days a year . So , I obviously wear through jeans at a pretty good pace . A few years ago , I happened across these Wrangler jeans on Amazon , and decided to give them a shot . I have not been disappointed , and they 've been by go-to jeans ever since . These jeans look like good old fashioned jeans . Nothing fancy , and certainly not like a pair of $ 400 `` designer '' jeans . They 're well made , and seem to outlast any similarly priced jeans I 've tried . The `` relaxed fit '' is exactly that - a little extra room , without being baggy or `` gangster '' looking . For a bigger guy like me , who 's carrying a few extra pounds , the relaxed fit much appreciated . Very comfortable . Given the relatively cheap price of these , I 've not found a better deal for jeans that are of this quality , or last this long . Great product for a good price .
 I love these jeans . They are simple and traditional jeans without stretchy material , weird embellishments , funky designs , or strange pockets . Just a simple pair of jeans that fit well , are comfortable , wash easily , and are durable .
 I am very surprised that Wrangler 's made this kind of jean . It look great . The price is awesome compared to others top brands . Wrangler 's is the best in my book . The measure is exactly as expected . It fit very nicely around the waist and not below the waist . The rear pockets sit high , not low that make your pants look too bagging . I have bought two already and waiting for my third set to come in . Again , it is the pants to get .
 My husband does a lot of construction work around the house and is very hard on his jeans . I purchased these pants about 6 months ago and he has been wearing them since . He is very happy with them . They have a nice fit , they are very sturdy and the color if modern . I am pleased with this product and the service . I would purchase from this seller again .
 First off , I can not see how anyone can really fault the solid quality of these jeans , nice thick material with pretty serious looking stitching.The problem I have is in the labelling of the sizes for the jeans I received . I ordered size 38x32 , and the outer paper tag on the delivered jeans did show that size . However , the stitched material label inside the jeans shows 40x30 , as did the peel-off label on the jeans.The jeans are loose on me , so I think the outer tag is wrong -LRB- and therefore I have been shipped jeans a size bigger and a little shorter than I ordered -RRB- . Luckily they kind of fit me , a bit loose really , but quite comfy . I 'm in Australia so I ca n't be bothered with the hassle of returning them anyway.UPDATE . . -------- Well , took a chance and re-ordered some more . This time they arrived labelled as expected , and fit exactly as expected . These are the most comfortable jeans I have ever worn . Guess I was unlucky and got a duff labelled pair first time , always a risk with internet shopping I guess.Anyways , ca n't see myself buying any other jeans than these . BTW , the black looks cool , almost semi-formal . I 'd agree with what someone else said about how you could just about wear them as office gear , if you 're not talking a place where you 're needing to wear a suite.UPDATE 2 -LRB- feb 2013 -RRB- ------------------- Well a bit of weight loss over the last year or so , so I 've ordered pairs of these jeans in 36 and 34 . Each time they 've been perfect . They are really great wearing jeans . I will continue to buy these jeans on Amazon . . unless I take a holiday to the US one day ... then I 'll just buy a whole ship load !
 I am gaining weight . But this pair does n't make me look as though I have . Its roomy and comfortable , even if I bend over it does n't ride up my back side . Going to get other dungarees like this . Just hope it hold it size when washed .
 My husband 's job in distribution entails a lot of movement , pushing , pulling , squatting , loading , and constant walking throughout the days . He says these are the most comfortable jeans he owns . The relaxed fit makes movement easy but the jeans are n't baggy . They are true to size and extremely durable .
 best fitting pants i 've had in years - durable and comfortable - ordered multiple pairs and still waiting for last pair , but worth the wait for the price - pricing seems to vary according to order history and stock - got mine for around 23 - 24.00 per pair - on my computer they are now about 39 per pair while a pair 2 in bigger is 24 per pair -- interesting , no ?
 I have not had a pair of Wranglers for many years . Wore them when I was a kid , but somewhere along the line , switched to Levis . I have not been very satisfied with the Levis in recent years , as the material seems ` thinner ' than it once was.So , I decided to try Wranglers again and the generally lower price was an additional attraction . I have been very pleased with the Wranglers I purchased recently . The material feels like it has some substance , but not excessively heavy , the fit is good and I expect to buy Wranglers again when the need arises .
 I have worn Wranglers on and off my entire life . And retirement is no exception.They are rugged , comfortable and easily maintained .
 I am required to wear black jeans for work . My search has ended with the Wrangler Rugged Wear relaxed fit jean . The front pockets are very deep , the zipper is longer than on regular jeans and the fit is roomy . Due to the fact that I wear my jeans once then have to wash them , I ordered a 36x36 instead of my normal 35x34 because they shrink rather quickly at first . The length was long at first but after 2 washes it shrunk down to a nice length . These jeans have 7 belt loops vs the 5 on other jeans , which makes it easier for me since I have alot of stuff attached to my belt for work . I am very please with these jeans .
 Good product . It is an original product of good quality and in perfect condition , I recommend it to all users of amazon.com . thanks
 These are the jeans I wear , I usally buy them at Academy , the size I wear they only stock a few , so I bought them from Amazon , had to pay $ 6.00 more per pair , So price is the only thing bad about this Item .
 The reason I shopped for Wrangler jeans on Amazon is that it is really hard for me to find my size where I live . -LRB- Which is completely stupid because I live in a suburb of Los Angeles ! -RRB- Perhaps I am not looking hard enough but with Amazon I do n't need to spend a bunch of time looking for jeans.Knowing your size is really important if you do n't want to end up getting very familair with your post office sending something back . However as a jeans shopper you should know that already.I love Wrangler quality and consistency . I hope they continue to keep up both ! The jeans come exactly as I expect them to be and the best part is they get here super fast ! I do n't pay for expedited shipping but they still get to me in 3 days which is great!Thank you Wrangler and Amazon!Kris Orange
 I hate shopping for clothes . Finding my size even in well stocked clothing stores like Target or the Gap really frustrates me . Using Amazon 's sizing table , these Wrangler Jeans fit just fine . I also purchased a pair of nominally the same size jeans from L.L. Bean online . Overall quality of L.L. Bean exceeds that of Wrangler , but sizing -- my main complaint -- did not match Wrangler 's spot-on fit . Both pair will likely give years of service .
 I purchased several pair of these jeans for my husband for Christmas . He loves them . I received them in a timely manner too .
 The fit of these is so good . The waist is a true size and the seat has just enough room .
 These jeans are just as described ; a little heavier than normal but very comfortable . Delivered on time and without a problem .
 Jeans fit great . They are exactlly as advertised . ON line purchase is great for the longer lengths I need .
 I was afraid to buy the pants on-line . But I got it in my house , it fits perfectly , better than at the store . My size is very uncommon in the stores , and I often have to buy it in small sizes because they do n't usually have it in stock.Right now I will be more at Amazon.com.Recommended.You can buy with no worries .
 It is nice to get exactly what you expect . I use to purchase this product from a local retailer who no longer carries this size . Happy to find that it is still available .
 Service from Amazon was , as usual , exemplary . These are really comfortable , well-fitting , and correctly sized , which can be a problem in today 's market . Great price , also . Definitely recommend .
 the are the 4th pair of jeans I have purchased the the value is outstanding . If I ever need another pair I will be back .
 My son is over 6 feet tall and 300 + pounds and it is very hard to get a pair of jeans that fit him properly . Although this is a bit expensive for me as I have to get them shipped to South America , it 's worth it ! Will definitely buy more .
 I bought Levi 's for years because `` thats what I was supposed to do '' ... now that I have grown up I have realized that price does not make a good pair of jeans.I am now and exclusive Wrangler jeans person.The fit is spot on , and the price is very reasonable.The cost is below what the jeans are worth.I have bought from Amazon and from Wrangler direct.ALWAYS is the fit the same ... perfect ... and I do not feel like I paid for some execs summer island home in order to wear them.I buy Wrangler as long as they stick to their current way of thinking ... good products at a fair price .
 Great fit and comfort . My only complaint is the change pockets . I use a small cell phone that easily fits in the change pockets . The attachments no longer have rivets , and the change pockets have easily torn on all 3 pairs of these I have . Otherwise the quality is fine .
 These jeans a a big fitting and comfortable at the same time . I hate skinny jeans and always go for relaxed fit . These jeans are comfortable and sturdy unlike some other brand jeans . If you need a pair of jeans then look no further as Wrangler have done it again .
 Am very happy with this purchase of Wrangler Relax Fit Jeans . Very hard to find plus sizes here in Honduras , and so pleased that they are as advertised . Perfect , Thank-you .
 These are my second pair of these Wranglers . I wear these daily to work and they are very comfortable . I like the loose fitting feel to keep me comfortable during the long work day .
 I NEED A PAIR OF GOOD JEANS ANYWAY i COULD NOT FIND JEANS MY SIZE SO I TOOK A CHANCE AND WAS GLAD I DID THEY FIT GREAT
 These jeans are the best ! They fit really well , they feel very comfortable , and they are very durable . I recently bought these jeans because the Wrangler Rugged Wear jeans I had finally wore out ... After 4 years of working in the desert ! The front pockets are very roomy and the rear pockets can accommodate larger sized men 's wallets . The change pocket is much larger than I 've seen in other brands of jeans and these Wrangler 's fit `` true to size '' . There is no need to worry about getting one size larger or smaller to ensure a proper , comfortable fit . My 36x34 's fit perfectly and they have a great break in the cuff . Additionally , there is plenty of room in the seat , crotch , and the thigh areas . These jeans are a great option for those who like a looser fitting jean . They also look great and are appropriate for anything from rugged outdoor activities to casual days at the office . And compared to other `` designer '' jeans out there , you simply ca n't beat the price . I highly recommend these jeans and I 'm sure you will like them as much as I do !
 I just needed a pair of pants to do everything in and these are just the ticket . Not too tight and not too baggy .
 Love these jeans and always will . Been wearing these for over thirty years . I still wear a pair that I have had for over ten years . I highly recommend the Wrangler brand .
 Jeans fit really good , especially as hard to fit as I usually am due to being tall . Appreciate the quality and appearance .
 I 've wore wrangler for a long time and it is a quality made product . I love them . Tough and rugged
 Not as sturdy as I 'd hoped , but they do the job . The pocket that my husband keeps his wallet in has started to deform and get thinner where his wallet presses against it , but other than that they are fine . Very sturdy construction and reinforced seams are a plus .
 But after wearing them twice , they loosened up . So , I think I will but them again in the future . ok
 Hubs wanted some more of these jeans for Christmas . Since he has retired they have become his everyday pants . The fabric is soft enough to be comfortable and they fit him just right . We will be getting more of these in the future .
 Properly sized for a change . A lot of jeans these days are not properly -LRB- consistently -RRB- sized . Wrangler seems to be the exception .
 Success with Wrangler Rugged Wear Jeans ! I have finally found jeans that fit someone my size -- 6 ' -2 '' , 275lbs . Fit even better after after a hot water wash and normal dry . Usually finding pants can be impossible with other brands in the 44W 34L size . Either the crotch measurement is too long or short or they seem oddly built . If you are my size you know exactly what I mean . I will be back when these wear out .
 THese jeans I bought for my husband and he just loves them . I get about four pairs every 6-8 months for him to wear to work for his mechanic job and they are rugged , sturdy and last a good long time when you consider all the wear and tear he puts them through . I think the average man just buying these to wear as jeans and not work pants would not only be satisfied with the quality but also what a value they are in that they last so long . Cowboys have always worn Wranglers and for a good reason-they can take anything you dish out!THe relaxed fit is good for men who have muscular legs since they are a bit more generous in the thigh area but not so much that they make the guys bottom look baggy .
 These are great jeans . 5 pocket , very comfortable , 9 belt loops keeps belt on jeans not on your tummy , wears well and holds up well .
 These jeans are so durable , heavyweight yet very comfortable . I know they will last a long time . My husband wants another pair !
 They arrived very quickly ! And they fit perfectly ! It 's nice to be able to buy pants in the correct length ! For some reason no stores carry shorter lengths -LRB- 28 '' -RRB- . . I 'm very happy with my purchase !
 Jeans arrived in about 2 weeks to Australia . Regular postage . Good quality denim and stiching . Fit perfect for me . Solid man with large thighs . Jeans have long zip . Plenty of belt eyes . Very happy with jeans , better than levis and in my size and correct length . Never going to pay $ 100 retail australia for jeans ever again .
 Was very pleased with these Wrangler jeans . They are well made , and a perfect fit.The design is very good , and they did not shrink with washing . Thank you , Amazon !
 Rugged enough to do lawn care , but dressy enough in black to wear to a casual party . Love wearing my jeans !
 These jeans fit great and they 're very comfortable . Loose fit so you 're not squeezed into them and they do n't ride down your waist .
 I bought these for my son for Christmas -LRB- at his . request -RRB- . He says they are the most comfortable jean he has ever worn . Thanks !
 Great fit and wear so far on these jeans ! Coud n't beat the discount price ! Wrangler still makes a decent jean !
 Premium quality , great fit and look . American made . Word-up dog , diddy diddy bump bump bump meet me in the coral .
 I bought my husband one pair as a ` trial ' based on the commercials showing more `` U Fit Room '' . It is a good plus according to my husband . He has worn them so much I bought a few more and we are cycling out his old tight jeans . They seem to wash well and feel very comfy for him . He likes that he can bend , stretch , get on his motorcycle , etc without any pinching or discomfort . Price is decent too compared to alot of other brands like the Duluth Company -LRB- $ 54 ! -RRB- and Levis -LRB- 35-40 ! -RRB- .
 These jeans are all he will wear . Plus it is hard to find 29 length in some styles . Very soft material is also a plus .
 Got these for my grandson . The size is pretty hard to find ... glad I found them here on Amazon !! Good product . He 's a happy camper with my buy . Hurray for Amazon , Wrangler and Grandma !! Good buy .
 Best pair of jeans he has had so far and they were the perfect size . Can not find these many places .
 Excellent , durable and very comfortable jeans and reasonably priced . I shall use this brand exclusively from now on.Nothing more needs to be said
 I 've been wearing Wrangler since I was a teenager . Their comfort , style and durability are just as good as those `` fancy '' jeans I see people going into big name store 's and paying $ 100 or more for ... jeans . What ???? Come on people ... it 's blue jeans ! Blue jeans never go out of style , but the price of blue jeans costing $ 100 or more should go out of style .
 These are my favorite work jeans . They are the most comfortable jeans during a long work day . I have trouble finding these particular style in stores , so I will order them on here from now on . They last quite a while , and do n't develop wear spots in the typical areas . Great jeans at a great price .
 Soy de Caracas-Venezuela y Recomiendo ampliamente a esta vendedor , Muy Buena Calidad , Putualidad en la entrega , Recomendable 100 % , Felicitaciones
 While the brick and mortar do n't typically stock 29 inch inseams I can always seem to find them on line and they fit !
 Its been a while since I purchased these jeans and they are holding up quite fine ; great fade , lots of wear left 2 yrs plus and going strong
 The jeans came in a very short time and were brand new in the package . I am very happy with this purchase !
 After going to all the stores around town I gave up and finally found what I needed , a nice pair of jeans . The right sizes , colors and reasonably priced . I bought three ! Received them faster than I thought I would .
 I bought 2 pairs of the Wrangler Rugged Wear Relaxed Fit jeans -LRB- a lighter and a darker pair -RRB- for my husband and they look fabulous on him . He usually does n't look good in relaxed fit jeans as the seat part sags and the thigh areas are too puffy . And it 's hard finding his size in stores -LRB- 40X34 -RRB- . So I was very hopeful when I saw these jeans on Amazon . I liked the cut and they looked great on the models , so I took my chances . I was not disappointed . They fit my husband beautifully and they 're well-made and durable . I 'll be buying these from now on !
 These jeans fit and are perfect for big guys . They wear like iron and last under daily use . The sizing is dead on accurate . The cut is perfect for the older ` wide body ' wearers . This is my retirement ` uniform ' and will be until I am no more . Thanks Wrangler , keep this one coming . Do n't change a thing .
 Excellent pair of jeans , bought from amazon because I am a hard to find size . Jeans are comfy , do n't shrink in the wash , and hold up well over time .
 I have worn these pants exclusively since receipt . They have been comfortable where regular fit were n't . The workmanship and materials are great .
 Wrangler jeans are the best qualityfor the price . Good , sturdy jeans .
 These jeans are truly amazing ! Both legs were almost the same length , and they have a zipper in the front which is very convenient . I read the instructions and can now put them on even in the dark . Just fantastic .
 These jeans arrived within the 8 days allotted . They are in great shape and fit perfectly . I highly recommend this site for other users .
 Well made Jeans . I own three pair of Wrangler Rugged Wear angler pants size 32 x 32 that fit me perfectly . All my other dress and casual pants are the same size . When I tried on these jeans I was unable to button them . I would recomend purchasing one size larger waist size . The length was correct .
 ME PARECE UN PRODUCTO MUY BUENO , LO RECOMIENDO . GRACIAS . ENVIO RELATIVAMENTE NORMAL . SIN PROBLEMAS . .
 Nice jeans for a tall person . Very difficult to locate a a reasonable cost in a store jeans for tall men . Fast delivery and a nice product . We now have ordered two pair of these jeans and will order more in the future . Thank you .
 I am delighted with the purchase -- I teach at a small college and usually depend upon such black jeans to go along with dress shirts . The price , size , quality , and speed of delivery were all excellent . In short , I 'm very pleased .
 I chose a five star because Wrangler jeans are the best fitting ones . My husband likes them better than Levis . They fit better all around . The price is great , ca n't beat it . I would recommend these to anyone who likes a comfortable jean and good looking on top of that .
 I 've been wearing these jeans for the past 30 years , one pair after another . They outlast any jeans i ever wore before that and are comfortable.I do n't wear any other pants , none ... . I even got married in Wranglers , Ha !
 I bought two pair of these jeans for my husband , two different shades and wish they had other shades in his size , particularly his length . Was thrilled to find what I did and with Prime shipping to boot.One pair has been worn , washed , worn again . Second pair is in hamper to be washed for first time . Having been scared off by some reviews here , I did n't dare to put the first pair in the dryer , so they were cold water washed and rinsed and then hung up on bathroom shower rod to dry . Furthermore I used one of those straight plastic hangers -LRB- from something or other we bought -RRB- with the clampy deals on either end , hooked the back waist band to that and hung the jeans from that , which I think helped create a bit more air flow , at least in the waist/seat area . In fact my husband wore them the next day and said they were very very slightly damp some in the legs but not enough to matter . He also said they still felt fine as far as the fit . To play it safe I guess I 'll continue to cold wash and air dry.Rivets , belt loops , all appear intact and well sewn , etc , no problems there . I looked all over them , tugged on the loops , do n't think they are going to pull off anytime soon if ever.Checked the pair in the hamper , and the tag inside says they were sewn in Mexico from US fabric .
 Good quality product , but as more than three times the price . These jeans in a 42x32 can be bought at target for $ 16 , but are only available in sizes up to 44 &#34; waist . I required a 46x32 . The shipping was a bit slow but the product was as advertised . The 4 stars is because the wrangler jeans are well made .
 Quite helpful for my dear husband 's field work . He did n't plow or harvest , but his inspection job did require him to go to some unusual places . He needed this rugged garment .
 It is always a chore to order pants as most companies do n't have a standard size and one maker you 'll need a larger size or longer length . These fix perfectly and are very comfortable .
 Heavy weight material like jeans used to be . Love them !! perfect fit . This is my third time buying them and I usuallybuy three pairs at a time . I live in these pants .
 Nothing wrong with the jeans . I do not think they would do any good to stop an uncomfortable alien probing , but they will work for my terrestrial needs .
 Wrangler makes a great pair of somewhat loose fitting rugged , durable jeans for any guy who wants a slightly more relaxed look to their work -LRB- or play -RRB- jeans . Moreover , these jeans are a good choice for people like me who are slightly overweight . They really do give you extra room in the thigh and the seat ; and that 's great!The denim is nice and thick ; and these jeans are extremely durable . The excellent stitching helps make this possible . In fact , these jeans can last for years at a time without any fraying -- even at the bottoms of the legs . They are made from cotton and they are permanent press . However , I would wash these jeans with similar colors to avoid any color dye bleeding onto white garments in the wash or dryer cycle . They say that you should tumble dry these on low ; but I use the permanent press settings on my dryer and that seems to work fine without any problems . They come in five colors , too . Black jeans are even possible in an office where you do n't have to dress too fancy but yet blue jeans just wo n't be allowed , either.Overall , these fine jeans by Wrangler easily rival any jeans made by other manufacturers . Make sure you choose the right size and color for you if you 're using the pricing and availability chart above on this webpage . If you want a pair of loose fitting yet rugged , durable jeans , this may be just what you 're looking for . I doubt that you 'll be disappointed .
 I used to buy Levi 's 550 relaxed fit jeans because they were an American company , but now they are no longer made in America . These Wrangler Rugged Wear jeans are similar fitting and looking as the Levi 's 550 jeans and about half the price , and seem to be a better fabric than Levi 's .
 One reviewer is doing a VERY GREAT disservice to purchasers of this brand of Jeans . I followed his claim that the waist size is 2 inches off and his recommendation that everyone select a size 2 inches larger . I followed his advice , and I now have a pair of jeans that not only do not fit properally , but are in fact 2 1/2 to 3 inches too big !!! Ignore the `` buy oversize '' claim and buy what your tape measure suggests . Just think , if I loose 10 pounds , my pants will then be 2 entire sizes TOO BIG !
 If you 're like me , a bit on the tall side -LRB- 6 ' 9 '' -RRB- and not skinny -LRB- 320 pounds -RRB- , a 44x38 straight is wearable , but not comfortable . Now , for the first time in years , I can be comfortable while standing , sitting , stooping , squatting , walking , etc. . I wish I had discovered Wrangler Relaxed Fit jeans years ago!Buy a pair or six . They 're not expensive .
 I purchased 3 of these jeans , that were sent to someone . They had the free shipping over $ 25 but he would n't of been living where he was so I had to take the overnight ship which worked out great . He said they fit him perfectly and were extremely comfortable and wash well . Wrangler is a company that has been around forever and I can remember as a child going to the Army and Navy store to buy these jeans . I had originally purchased Lee 's for him because that is what he has always bought but Amazon had problems with the vendor and the stock they had depleted so I went with what I knew and great for the price . He was also very happy they went over his work boots with no problem .
 The wrangler jeans I purchased fit well and was just what I hoped they would be.I take a large size so I was very happy with the selection I made .
 What can I say . These are my favorite brand of jeans and these were at a good price and delivered quickly .
 I had been to all the western store trying to find jeans in 40x38 and all I could find was 40x36 . The Big & Tall shops could order 40x38 Wrangler but wanted $ 50.00 a pair . I ride a Royal Star Venture touring motorcycle and these relax jeans are perfect for long rides .
 I love these jeans , only complaint that i have is with the pockets , the jean material doesnt go deep enough down the entrance of the pocket , and the white material of the pocket is visiable . kind of gives it that `` bunny ears look '' but they are a good quality made jean !
 As a rather big guy I have problems to buy suitable clothing . But I found the WRANGLER jeans on this website and I 'm happy with it . Will buy again !
 They fit well . The quality of the material is superb . I like them so much that I purchased a second pair .
 These pants look good on my husband . He prefers boot cut , he says , but he did n't notice they were just a relaxed fit and likes them as well .
 Black Wrangler men 's jeans just look good , feel good , and last for a very very long time . I 'm a pretty large `` fatty '' from WAY BACK !!! My waste is 54 '' . I weigh over 300 lbs . I have a very active hard on clothing job with UPS . These jeans are the ONLY long pants I wear at work . They are comfortable and have proven themselves durable for a VERY LONG time . I really love them .
 What else would you expect from Wrangler ? Jeans are of a high quality and a perfect fit .
 Nice color , nice feel . Size and length accurate . They are very generous as regards relaxed fit ... almost wish they were a little tighter but no big deal . Very comfortable , plenty of belt loops , deep pockets . Excellent jeans.Seller was quick to ship . Will get more ... although a smaller size .
 I bought these for my husband . He asked specifically for them and is very happy with them . They fit perfectly and are a good price .
 Various brands and styles of jeans fits people differently , and that 's just the plain truth about the matter . For me , I 've found that these jeans , in relaxed fit , are just what I like to wear . Matter of fact , I wo n't even look at other jeans anymore or anywhere else . I do n't know what I 'd do if Amazon quit carrying this product ... go naked I guess .
 Wranglers have always been my favourite jeans . The price here at Amazon is the best . Took a while to arrive , but the fit is perfect , they last , and are always my most comfortable pants . I 'm sometimes tempted to be trendy and try a pair of `` designer '' jeans , but then I get into my old faithful wranglers , and that thought passes ! I 'm also a 38 '' inseam , and these jeans are a TRUE 38 '' It 's great to have pants that fit correctly in the length !
 Most comfortable Jeans I 've had in a very long time . Will continue to buy wrangler items based on this experience .
 The length options for these jeans goes above and beyond any store . You 're lucky to find 32 length in stores , let alone 34 's . My husband is quite tall & really likes the way these jeans fit and the length is perfect .
 My dear Husband is a little on the Big side & also tall . these jeans are available in his size - are comfortable for him - but not sloppy . The material is a substantial weight - so they are good for working in the shop or garage . The only down side is the colors - we 'd like a darker indigo - pre-washed . that 's a very small - . this is the pair of jeans we can count on to fit , and last a long time .
 Wrangler jeans are the best for me . Great fit , price and they arrived as scheduled . I would recomend to everyone .
 I like the belt rings , a lot of jeans have rings so far out the belt slides all over the place . These are nice . I 'd buy them again . They fit great and stretch in the right places to keep the boys happy : o -RRB-
 These jeans were just as advertised . They arrived earlier than forecast . Cheaper than buying the same product from the store . I am a big guy , and getting my size can be hard - big waist , short legs - and I always have to get them shortened . These were perfect out of the box , no tailoring required .
 For value , IMHO this is a worth the price . I 'd read the earlier review and ordered a slightly larger fit . The pockets are quite deep and overall if it does n't shrink too much , I 'll will order more .
 I bought him these after Casual Male black Jeans fell apart at the seams . like a month later . He works he theatre doing sound . so he carries things in his pockets & it rugged . but they are comfortable they move with him if he has to bend . I would recommend this product .
 I find it strange to have Rugged Wear jeans have washing directions to use cold water and low heat in the dryer .
 These pants are great . Good price as well . I have stonewashed and black ant they fit well . Do n't have to go looking for my size .
 Product quality is good . . is according to the price paid . . recommend this product is just what I needed
 delivered fast no issues . Not a bad deal for the price ! I just needed something to wear to work on Friday dress down . I did n't want to buy designer denim untill I loose 10 more inches . LOL
 I went with 5 stars I bought them for my son because his size is difficult to find locally . I got them in a timely fashion
 I bought these jeans for my husband . They look nice and the quality is good . He says they are a little tighter in the waist than the jeans he 's been wearing . Overall , though , they are good jeans for the price paid .
 I am not a Jeans person . This is the first pair I have had since I was a kid and they fit great and they are going to be a great knock around the house , yard etc pair of slacks . Wish they came in other colors like brown .
 My husband has always had short legs . He wears a 29 in length . I drove all over to Walmart , Kmart , Pennys , Boscovs no one had 36w29L jeans . My daughter suggested Amazon . I found them and ordered 4 pairs . My husband has never worn Wrangler , but now he loves them , they are a perfect fit and comfortable also . I will be shopping at amazon first from now on .
 Title says it all Best jeans I 've ever owned . Even accidently washed them in hotter water then recommend with no adverse affects . rpm
 I can never find the right size of jeans for me in the store . So I decided to try buying jeans online . Got a great price and exactly the size and style I wanted . Not what some buyer decided to put on the rack at the local store . I like the classic look of this pair of jeans . They look just like the pictures . I 've owned previous Wrangler jeans before and have had good luck with their durability .
 I bought these jeans for my husband . They were a great price . The fit is wonderful and he loves them .
 I felt I received very good notification of the shipping and the jeans I order , I was very pleased with .
 I bought more than one of these items because as soon as I got the first one I saw the good quality/price ratio , which I guess is the strong aspect of these jeans . I have not found anything bad in them !
 I have been wearing Wrangler jeans my entire life . I like the relaxed fit becuase it gives your legs some breathing room without being `` baggy . '' I can always trust Wrangler Jeans to fit me the same every time and do n't need to `` try them on '' first . A top quality product that I will continue to buy the rest of my life .
 I 've been unable to get jeans locally that fit correctly for the past 2-3 years , so ordering these Wranglers directly from Amazon.com was a last resort . They fit perfectly -- at 2/3 the cost of jeans I could find in stores , and of superb quality -LRB- like the Levis from the '70s -RRB- . Excellent .
 Quite nice jeans and the perfect Size that was ordered . No alterations needed ... Very Dark Rich Black Soft 100 % Cotton Jeans . Fit well and pleasant to wear . Not scratchy or stiff as Levis . Also very good price . Close to $ 18 BELOW Big And Tall Levis Pricing . Buy em again ... why You betcha ... Wrangler from now on ... Oh by the way ... Levis Poly/Cotton Blend and Imported also ... What would John Wayne say ... Cheers -LCB- : o -RRB-
 My hubby is plus size and found the jeans to be comfortable ... after several washes the color is still true black :--RRB- highly recommended
 Right size ; very pleased with selection and fit of jeans . Could not easily find the right size in regular stores .
 Arrived as promised . Highly recommend for anyone who is looking for Wranglers in hard to find sizes . Given as a gift .
 These are great basic jeans in hard to find sizes . My long and lanky teen is hard to fit , so we are glad these are available . They have been washed and dried repeatedly and have held up well .
 I think I might have stumbled upon a new supplier of clothes . I am BIG and TALL and have problems finding clothes at reasonable prices . Well here it is and they fit .
 I have worn Wranglers and these are no different , thank goodness . They give me plenty of room and are very durable.They feel good right out of the box , good heavyweight material .
 Love the fit and feel , very comfortable for a fat man ; pass the gravy . It 's hard to find 44 x 29 pants ; thank you wrangler .
 They fit the way a pair of jeans should . They look and feel like Levi 's -LRB- 501 & 505 -RRB- used to and wished they would again . But since Levi 's do n't I tried these . Happy . Except the rear pockets end a little too high up on the ass .
 BIG AND TALL MEN ... . I ordered these for my husband in 46x36 Black Denim ... very hard to find bigger sizes especially length , Price was excellant , jeans were excellant . Would recomend highly . Fast shipping .
 The size was perfect and the jeans was very comfortable and good looking but the two parts -LRB- the things that you put the belt in , i dont know what it is called -RRB- are two close to the bottom and they are really annoying when you put the belt on them .
 Just saw a news report about Wrangler rebuilding their Alabama manufacturing plant after it was destroyed by a tornado . Their commitment to US jobs and their employees makes me proud to buy Wrangler jeans -- way to go Wrangler !!!!
 They are all around just a great pair of jeans . Comfortable , rugged and look just as good with a sweatshirt as they do with a sportscoat . And yes , as the commercial says , they do make my tired old butt look good .
 Convenient and comfortable jeans . Color corresponds to the specified . Material soft and dense , sit perfectly . The size corresponds to what you carry even if slightly hard as was at me , in 3-5 days slightly stretched and everything fell into place . Why 4 instead of 5 stars - an asymmetrical seam on one trouser-leg . For the price - excellent purchase , I recommend .
 Good fit for the extremely lean and tall guy . What 's frustrating is that I used to get the 30x34 size at WalMart for $ 15 and now have to pay double since they do n't carry them in their stores anymore !
 these are a good deal and saved me going to a store to buy them ca n't wait for summer so that I can fit into them
 Value and well fitting jeans . Have owned this style before wear and wash well without shrinking . I give them five stars .
 This is a great product and the service was excellent . From now on I know where to get my Wrangler jeans at a great price and always a great fit .
 These are truly great jeans . They fit very nice and they are really tough . I own 3 pairs .
 The jeans are fine , the packaging for shipment was fine . Amazon did publish the retail price in this instance so that I knew what sort of discount I was getting . I have seen a trend with Amazon though where the item , even new , has the retail price deleted so that if their partner vendors are charging a premium , one does n't immediately know it . I 've curtailed buying from Amazon until I 'm convinced they wo n't be doing this any more . They 're only response to the issue was to tell me to return the item to the vendor which is a cost to me-time and money-might as well go to a brick and mortar store if I 'm going to go through that inconvenience .
 This item wrangler jeans it 's really nice and very comfy for my husband he likes it and I think it 's great jeans for casual wear or even for work ! Not very expensive for a pair of jeans why pay so much for brand if we are comfy with what we think nice and looks good . Wrangler is a brand name that never disappear in this business .
 These jeans are great ! They look nice and they work well for my husband 's tall frame .
 Amazon provides the 29 inch length jeans I wears . The delivery is quick and the packaging is great . Great quality products .
 with typical wrangler durability . I would have like them to be a little bit looser than what I got .
 I live in these jeans . The deep pockets are a detail that make a quality difference in my life.Regarding sizes , jeans are cut by hand , so some slight variation in size can happen .
 Levi 's tend to dominate the jean market for no apparent reason other than hype over the name . Fortunately , there is Wrangler that provides a less expensive , quality product -LRB- no I do n't have any affiliation with Wrangler -RRB- . These jeans are comfortable and sized perfectly . My only complaint is the denim of the front pocket inserts seem a little undersized . This sometime causes the white lining to show a little when you are sitting down.And , of course , they fit properly over your boots . -LRB- Only select Levi 's fit right over boots -RRB- .
 I ordered here because they offered odd waist size -LRB- 35 -RRB- and other places did n't . Perfect fit !
 I 've worn Levi 's for 30 + years , they have always been my jean of choice , part of the reason was their fit + finish , and the other part was cultural - they are simply the brand you wear . I 'm not sure what prompted me to try these Wranglers , but I am glad I did . The denim seems heavier , the fit is comfortable and the price is right . Great jeans .
 Good quality product . The inseam is often longer than labeled and I had to return the first two pair before getting ones that were correctly marked . This same thing happened on a previous order . The legs , waist and crotch are well tailored . However , the back is cut lower and the seat is tighter than any other relaxed fit jeans I 've worn . This is probably not a very good choice if you are a candidate for the old butt-crack sight gags .
 Bought this as a gift for my husband . He loves them ; wears them all the time . I would recommend them .
 The jeans were a little more expensive than the walmart price , but Iwas able to get the size I wanted . That is important to me .
 Love the jeans and could n't be happier that I have found a source of the sizes and styles I want .
 I was looking for something to wear on my off days as All the other clothes I have are t-shirts and work-related . These fit great , look great and seems as if they will last a long time . I ca n't really complain too much as the price makes it work .
 These are the most comfortable longest lasting jeans I 've ever owned . I bought three pair about 4 years ago and I am still wearing them . Great Jean !
 I wear jeans almost every day to work , so I need jeans that will stand up to regular wear . These jeans definitely fit that bill . I recently noticed a hole in a pair that I had bought previously and tried to find them in my Amazon order history to order more ... it had been two years ! Jeans that last two years are always bargain.The ` antique indigo ' color is my personal favorite ; it has a look of slightly worn denim . Comparing the color of the new jeans to the old , the color stands up to wear and washing quite well.Overall , I would highly recommend the Wrangler jeans to anyone .
 Awesome fit ! They 've very durable ! I have already put them to good use and they 're holding up great . A little bit heavy to wear for casual use , but if you work or plan on getting dirty , these Jeans can stand up to the job !
 These jeans are a very good fit . As all of Wrangler jeans , they look good and wear very well . The only thing to be aware of is the depth of the pockets makes it a little difficult to find and remove an object , especially if you are sitting down .
 Love these jeans . They are cheap , yet durable and very comfortable . Would recommend to anyone : -RRB-
 I purchased therse jeans primarily for work . But these jeans are fine for casual wear . Wrangler Rugged Wear is no joke ... They really are .
 I have worn these jeans forever there the only brand i buy very durable comfortable . shipped right on time .
 Well-constructed jeans of heavy , high-quality denim for less ... how can you go wrong ? Levi 's lost their cachet years ago , never mind the loss in quality . Wrangler , Carhartt and a few small companies have been making the best jeans by far for the last couple of decades . In my opinion , Wrangler is the best of them , and for those to whom it makes a difference , continues to be a strong supporter of traditional cowboy culture and values .
 Having reached an age when my middle is expanding -LRB- slightly -RRB- despite all of the exercise and dieting I can do , it was great to be able to find jeans that fit on-line . The relaxed fit is just my style.For 40 years , I 've been wearing a 34x34 ; lately , they 're just a bit tight . Very few -LRB- if any -RRB- stores carry 35 '' waist , and the 36 '' are just too big.So I was pleased to find comfortable jeans in my size . They look great , feel great , and were delivered as promised . -LRB- Extra bonus
 The fabric is nice and substantial and promises long wear . Very comfortable and great fit . I 've always loved Wrangler jeans and from now on I will look specifically for the Rugged Wear Wranglers .
 product was delivered in excellent time , jeans would sell for much more than I paid for them in a store . they are an excellent purchase and I am very satisfied with them .
 ... jean for $ 14.99 ! What 's wrong ? One leg longer?NO . They are top quality jeans at rock-bottom pricing . Man !!!! They fit perfectly and look good.I 'll buy six pairs at these prices , instead of one or two pair , every month or two when I need to replace my jeans . Amazon ... do n't stop selling these as I will keep you in business . Plus , I am getting the word out there for you !!!
 Found these to be a great fit , they are very nicely styled , and are comfortable to wear . Love the jeans and the color .
 I bought these jeans as a X'mas gift for a relative , and it was exactly what he expected . Nice fit and durability were the main factors in our brand choice . Seller and process was swift . Will buy again .
 I caught these on sale and it was a great deal , Wrangler is about the only jean I will wear now . Every pair I have ever owned have held up well and lasted quite awhile . Recommended .
 These were a Christmas gift for our son . He really liked them a lot . They fit very well . Will buy again .
 The length and waste is perfect , it is just a little wide but it was my choice the relaxed fit , the cloth is very good and also finishing .
 Placing the order was easy , the price was convenient , the delivery was exactly inside the delay mentionned when I placed the order . Who could ask for more .
 Jeans are as described , fit is good , color is good . All around a good experience . Amazon provided quality service on this order
 Good pair of jeans but stitching not upto the mark as expected from one of the world leaders in jeans mfg.
 These jeans fit extremely well . They wear well , feel good and look good ! For the price you ca n't go wrong .
 These pants are extremely comfortable and the sizing is true . I am a relatively tall person and have a tough time finding jeans in the length I need . These were perfect and arrived on time .
 Bought these for my husband . He needs a 29 &#34; inseam , which is too hard to find in stores . So easy to buy online . He loves the fabric , the fit . Would definitely recommend .
 These are my fisrt pair of Wrangler 's . For 20 years I 've been wearing nothing but Levi 's Silver Tab Baggy 's but when some genious @Levi 's decided to discontinue that line , I had to look for something else . Levi 's brand is getting very poor reviews these days so I decided to check out some other brands . Wrangler 's brand has good reviews so I wanted to give it a try.Very nice quality and look . However , the jeans are tighter than the other brands , so keep that in mind when choosing size . For that reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 .
 After reading the reviews of the various jean brands I decided on the Wrangler Relaxed Fits . As usual , Amazon delivery was super - received on time and properly packaged . There had been some comments from other reviewers about size being a little small . I did not find that at all . I ordered my regular size and the fit was excellent . The jeans are comfortable in all areas and the quality seems to be good . The jeans have not been through the wash cycle yet , so I can not comment on how they 'll stand up to washing . Overall , I would rate them a very good value for the price and a very comfortable fit .
 I 've worn a number of brands over the years -- Lee , Levi 's , HOB/Harbor Bay , and Wrangler . Lee no longer makes relaxed , boot-cut jeans in 38x38 , so I went back to Wrangler . These are terrific jeans -- a little heavier denim , so they last long , and the fit is perfect . They 're just a tad snugger , but not too tight . They fit right over my harness boots ; you definitely want to order your jeans longer if you 're wearing boots and do n't want half the boot to stick out of your pants . I order jeans to wear with boots about 2 inches longer and that seems to work just right .
 The size was correct . There were no defects . Much easier than going to the store for my size . Very pleased .
 I have a number of pairs of Wrangler Jeans . They fit well wear well and Amazon has great prices and selection .
 My husband likes to buy nothing but Carhartt clothing . They last long and wear well as work clothing . His problem comes where waist size is concerned though . Carhartt , and all the other manufacturers need to consider that not everyone wears 30x30 , and above . He needs a 28x34 , and those are difficult to come by.After looking online , I see the difficulty is still there .
 My husband and sons have purchased many brands of work clothes . These by far last the longest and hold up to rough daily wear . Quality items.They wash great !
 I love my Timberline Fleece it was just what I was looking for . I was looking for a very bright yellow fleece and I could n't find one in Chalotte N.C. , so someone told me to look on amazon.com . Now I have a new bright yellow fleece that is very warm . I must also tell you that the item arrived really timely.Thanks for everythingC.A . Vision Consulting

 The material of the jacket is pretty good , not for a cold day , because the wind would go right through it . But in a casual general day , it feels fine . The front logo screen print is a bit faded , the yellow was n't as I expected . But overall , it 's not too bad of a jacket . and if you are a Flash fan , I 'd highly recommend it .

 Late review but it 's ok.Pros
 Title says it all . I always loved Rothco hats . Word of advice though , DO NOT WASH ! -LRB- it will fall apart and fade considerabe after like 2 washes -RRB- .
 Excellent condition . Fast delivery . A + +

 Excellent product , customer service , and arrived early . Given as a gift so , I do n't have product details but , she did love it . Thank you !

 These suits are great ! I purchased one 2 summers ago a 12-18mo . from another company and my son wore it for 2 summers . 2 summers of chlorine pools and Arizona sun ! It held up great ! The other name for it is `` Sunbusters '' I was excited to find this vendor for my sons suit for this summer . They were very reasonable on the price and shipped very fast !! I will be looking them again next year for sure !! Thanks !!
 I was extremely pleased when this product arrived super quick , just in time for my daughter 's weekly swim class . She 's been wearing the suit for nearly two months and it is holding up nicely - the material still looks new even after many dips in the pool . One of the snaps along the leg seam no longer snaps securely but the others hold well . That is my only complaint . Otherwise , a great toddler swim suit , and the price was definitely right .
 This is an adorable outfit . My son wore it at 8 months and it fit him fine -LRB- there was def . some room for him to grow but I would think if he was closer to 18 months it would n't fit as well -RRB- . I like how he was safer out in the sun with this on and the snaps on the bottom were a breeze -LRB- and smart design choice ! -RRB-
 I love this suit ! I was looking for a suit for my 4 month old . He was taking swimming classes and I was worry about the Florida sun . It is well made and it is easy to put it on . It is really easier to handle the baby with the suit compared to having two pieces .
 I bought two for my twin boys and this is a great swimsuit - they were not even wet under the suit . I would recommend this product strongly .
 Love this suit , it saves me from having to lather my daughter in suncream and I do n't worry about her skin being damaged by the sun . -LRB- She 's much more content only having to wait for cream to be put on the bits that show ! -RRB- She seems very happy in it . Size-wise I think it 's true to size . It seems very well made and I will probably be getting another when she outgrows this one . I have seen the exact suit elsewhere being sold for a lot more money !

 I had a blouse like this back in the 1960 's , that I foolishly gave away . I have been looking for a replacement for decades ! I was thrilled to find this blouse , and was very , very happy with it when it arrived . Thank you for making this blouse available . The level of craftsmanship is fabulous . I would highly recommend . I have washed it , and worn it , and love it .
 Overall good value for the price , but I wish the socks would have been longer and fully covered the calf .
 I got this for my son for a 6-week camping trip to the Canadian Rockies and rainy Alaska and believe me this little jacket got a workout ! Never a leak , never a split seam . These are fantastic ! The only nit I would pick is that they are not at all warm . If you will be in a place that is cool -LRB- or cold -RRB- , get a size larger so you can wear layers underneath . As a straight rain jacket in warm weather , it 's perfect !
 I love this jacket . I 'm looking forward to using it in the rain.I 'm a woman 's XS and found the boys jackets significantly cheaper priced . It makes a great replacement to a woman 's XS , well-fitted except it is a little baggy around the chest -LRB- length of jacket and sleeps are great -RRB- but nothing significant . If you 're a woman 's XS looking to save some money - definitely recommend it !
 We bought 3 - one for each kid . They 're lightweight , easily compress for stuffing into a book bag , and keep the rain off . They also have held up to the general rough-and-tumble exposure that any child puts clothing through .
 We spent 2 days of consistent rain during a recent cub scout event and thisjacket kept my son dry throughout the weekend . The rain was constant but notcrazy heavy , winds were moderate -LRB- 10mph -RRB- . I would buy this jacket again .
 It was raining for days on end here in Florida and I needed a new rain jacket . I am a short woman and know I can fit into a boy 's x-large jacket . I was a little worried ordering this on line as sometimes , sizes can differ . And it fits me like a glove . It repelled the water great and it is comfy . I am very satisfied with this purchase and being a boys , it saved me some money too !
 This coat is great ! My son is a large nine-year-old -LRB- about the size of a typical 10 year old -RRB- , and the size Large fit him perfectly , with a little room to grow . It is warm and waterproof . Very sharp looking , too .
 El material esta perfecto , transpirable y completamente impermeable . Excelente producto . solo le falta que le coloquen un bolsillo tipo Napole&oacute;n .
 Great coat ! Well made , light weight , awesome colors . My son is green obsessed and he loves it . Marmot is awesome .
 Love these Jackets . VERY good quality . I bought 2 . Kids stayed warm and DRY . Rolling and going crazy in the snow . Major snowball fights . Jacket worked perfect ! Also thin so we can use during warmer weather too . Packed in the suitcase easy .
 I use this on my 22 month old when he swims & when he 's playing outside in the garden with the hose . It fits very well - obviously a little big but will last him all thru the summer & beyond . I highly recommend it - it 's much easier than trying to slather a wet , wiggly toddler with sunscreen all the time !
 Fits her good and protects her from the sun . I like the neck sun guard especially . One thing ... , on breezy days the suit can make her quite chilly if it is wet so make sure you dry the little ones off good .
 This SPF rashguard has been a great item for sun and swim time . My son is very fair and I 'm conscious of avoiding excess sun . Since sunscreen is not advised for babies under 6 months and is very slippery and difficult to apply , this is the perfect solution . With this rashie , one only need apply suncreen to lower legs and feet , pop a wide brimmed hat on their little head , and you 're good to go . -LRB- I do n't put sunscreen on hands since my boy jams them in his mouth so much -RRB- . It has snaps along the bottom for quick diaper changes and a front zipper for easy-on/off . I plan on buying another one when he outgrows this one .
 I bought this for my 5 month old son to go swimming in to protect him from the Arizona sun . It 's very comfortable , easy to put on . I like the leg snaps for easy diaper area access . With this on and his hat he 's totally protected from the sun . I 'm very happy with the design and quality .
 My son outgrew his old one , so this is a repeat purchase in a larger size & diff colour . We love the cut , material , bbright colour and durability of this suit . LOVE IT !
 This Ferragamo keychain is not only stylish but also functional . I like the lean leather with a hook so you know where to find the keys in the purse . Good product .
 The Jansport backpack is a perfect size and weight for my son-in-law who just started grad school . It is sturdy without being heavy or bulky . The color choices for this product were very good . I would recommend this backpack to students who are looking for room without buying a huge bag .
 Well I loved the prize and it looks perfect on my daughter ... she ca n't wait for halloween and she says she wants to be starfire for the next halloween and the next as long as this costume fits her . I order it alittle bigger for her just for that reason ; so she can join wearing it again and agian . . thnx
 I love my Timberline Fleece it was just what I was looking for . I was looking for a very bright yellow fleece and I could n't find one in Chalotte N.C. , so someone told me to look on amazon.com . Now I have a new bright yellow fleece that is very warm . I must also tell you that the item arrived really timely.Thanks for everythingC.A . Vision Consulting
 I got this for my son for a 6-week camping trip to the Canadian Rockies and rainy Alaska and believe me this little jacket got a workout ! Never a leak , never a split seam . These are fantastic ! The only nit I would pick is that they are not at all warm . If you will be in a place that is cool -LRB- or cold -RRB- , get a size larger so you can wear layers underneath . As a straight rain jacket in warm weather , it 's perfect !
 I love this jacket . I 'm looking forward to using it in the rain.I 'm a woman 's XS and found the boys jackets significantly cheaper priced . It makes a great replacement to a woman 's XS , well-fitted except it is a little baggy around the chest -LRB- length of jacket and sleeps are great -RRB- but nothing significant . If you 're a woman 's XS looking to save some money - definitely recommend it !
 We bought 3 - one for each kid . They 're lightweight , easily compress for stuffing into a book bag , and keep the rain off . They also have held up to the general rough-and-tumble exposure that any child puts clothing through .
 We spent 2 days of consistent rain during a recent cub scout event and thisjacket kept my son dry throughout the weekend . The rain was constant but notcrazy heavy , winds were moderate -LRB- 10mph -RRB- . I would buy this jacket again .
 It was raining for days on end here in Florida and I needed a new rain jacket . I am a short woman and know I can fit into a boy 's x-large jacket . I was a little worried ordering this on line as sometimes , sizes can differ . And it fits me like a glove . It repelled the water great and it is comfy . I am very satisfied with this purchase and being a boys , it saved me some money too !
 This coat is great ! My son is a large nine-year-old -LRB- about the size of a typical 10 year old -RRB- , and the size Large fit him perfectly , with a little room to grow . It is warm and waterproof . Very sharp looking , too .
 El material esta perfecto , transpirable y completamente impermeable . Excelente producto . solo le falta que le coloquen un bolsillo tipo Napole&oacute;n .
 Great coat ! Well made , light weight , awesome colors . My son is green obsessed and he loves it . Marmot is awesome .
 Love these Jackets . VERY good quality . I bought 2 . Kids stayed warm and DRY . Rolling and going crazy in the snow . Major snowball fights . Jacket worked perfect ! Also thin so we can use during warmer weather too . Packed in the suitcase easy .

 These suits are great ! I purchased one 2 summers ago a 12-18mo . from another company and my son wore it for 2 summers . 2 summers of chlorine pools and Arizona sun ! It held up great ! The other name for it is `` Sunbusters '' I was excited to find this vendor for my sons suit for this summer . They were very reasonable on the price and shipped very fast !! I will be looking them again next year for sure !! Thanks !!
 I was extremely pleased when this product arrived super quick , just in time for my daughter 's weekly swim class . She 's been wearing the suit for nearly two months and it is holding up nicely - the material still looks new even after many dips in the pool . One of the snaps along the leg seam no longer snaps securely but the others hold well . That is my only complaint . Otherwise , a great toddler swim suit , and the price was definitely right .
 This is an adorable outfit . My son wore it at 8 months and it fit him fine -LRB- there was def . some room for him to grow but I would think if he was closer to 18 months it would n't fit as well -RRB- . I like how he was safer out in the sun with this on and the snaps on the bottom were a breeze -LRB- and smart design choice ! -RRB-
 I love this suit ! I was looking for a suit for my 4 month old . He was taking swimming classes and I was worry about the Florida sun . It is well made and it is easy to put it on . It is really easier to handle the baby with the suit compared to having two pieces .
 I bought two for my twin boys and this is a great swimsuit - they were not even wet under the suit . I would recommend this product strongly .
 Love this suit , it saves me from having to lather my daughter in suncream and I do n't worry about her skin being damaged by the sun . -LRB- She 's much more content only having to wait for cream to be put on the bits that show ! -RRB- She seems very happy in it . Size-wise I think it 's true to size . It seems very well made and I will probably be getting another when she outgrows this one . I have seen the exact suit elsewhere being sold for a lot more money !

 Bought it for my wifes Birthday and it arrived promptly . Exactly as described ... what do I know about purses ? I am a man .
 This bra is the best I have known for my horseback riding activities and jogging . I am 58 years old and for some years was becoming more and more sick because of an unknown gluten problem . It also caused weight gain and my boobs were bigger than ever . Fall of 2010 found I needed to get off gluten and began to lose the weight , gain the energy back as well as my health and strength . I feel like I am in my 30 's and again I am much more active . A freind who also rides , jogs , etc. told me about this bra and while I have never in my life even thought about spending this much money on a peice of underwear ... I just knew , after viewing the bounce test that this bra would , as my freind stated , `` Change your -LRB- my -RRB- life . '' The second time I wore it horseback riding I went with this freind and we did alot of trotting and cantering on our horses which , BEFORE , was too uncomfortable for me before purchasing the bra . What a wonderful difference this has made in my activities . My older boobs are nor as firm as they used to be also also are bigger ! so they are more of a problem ... but not with this sports bra ! Can not go wrong if you are active and need very good support of thos heavy , jarring boobs . I found it WELL worth the money .
 This is my second Enell bra . It is well worth the money . I purchased a size 2 in black about five years ago , and a size 3 in ecru this time . I needed a larger exercise bra because of lymphedema after breast cancer lumpectomy . My normal bra size is 34G . That is not a typo.The Enell bra is supportive and comfortable . It feels more like you are wearing a snug-fitting vest than a bra . The straps are wide , ideal for larger busted women . The bra stays in place during sprints on the track , walking fast on the treadmill , on the elliptical machine , and on the recumbent crosstraining machine.The bra wears like iron . I wash it using the delicate cycle setting , in cold water , then hang to air dry . It takes almost a day to dry . The fabric is heavy , and has a sheen . The bra is very toasty in summer weather , but is so supportive that I just deal with the heat.My only complaint is that the eleven hook and eyes are the same color as the bra fabric . This gives a nice finished look , but with my aging eyes , contrasting colors would make hooking the bra easier . I have to stand in front of a mirror to properly fit myself into the bra.If you have never worn this sort of bra before , you may find the way you put it on to be strange . Follow the manufacturer 's instructions , and you will get the hang of it quickly . The bra makes the wearer look almost flat . Your bust is pressed close to your chest to prevent damage during vigorous exercise . This does n't hurt , and it is fun to look smaller for a while .
 This bra has given me so much confidence to try different kinds of high cardio exercise . Having my ` girls ' firmly in place means I can go much harder at boxing , push ups and rowing . Recommend highly to any well endowed chicks feeling held back by their gifts .
 With a 32FF bust playing squash and doing karate can be trying . This bra is like an armour but it allows you to breath and move . NOTHING jiggles !!! You will never buy another sports bra .
 I saw this on Oprah and had to try it . It is absolutely amazing - nothing moves at all , not even a bounce ! This bra has allowed me to start running , something I have not been able to do in other sport bras.The only downside is that it is like putting on a jacket - once you 're in , you 're in . It works great for a workout , but is definitely not something you want to lounge around in at home or after the workout . But that 's fine with me.Highly recommend .
 I bought this for my sister and she loved it so much she asked for it in another color for Christmas !
 This definitely keeps the girls under control . This is my 2nd Enell . The problem with it is that it comes so high up the neck you can see about 1/2 inch on a tank top when you 're exercising . If that does n't bother you , then it will definitely keep a D cup move free ... making cardio work outs much more comfortable .
 Hi Received my sports bras promptly in the mail , the service was great , the price was great , and the items are fantastic
 Finally a sports bra that I can wear that holds me in and minimizes movement . I did order 1 size up from the sizing chart and it fits perfectly -LRB- size 2 for 34F -RRB- . I will definitely be ordering another one .
 Perfect !! I will never wear anything else to excercise in . A lot of the sports bras out there that claim `` supportive '' either are not supportive or so binding I cant breath . This is great ! Makes me want to run more often and longer . Order size 2 for 36DDD .
 This product is great for working out and keeps the girls in check ! There is some bounce with very strenuous exercise -LRB- but I did order a size larger than what I could have -RRB- , but I do n't have any of the pain I used to experience . I normally wear a 36DD and ordered a size 2 . Also , you should know the material is very shiny on the pink one , which is difficult to see in the picture .
 I was so thrilled when I got this bra and discovered that the other reviews were right ! I love/love it . I am currently nursing my 7 month old , but really wanted to get back into running . I did n't think it would be possible with my , shall we say , mega super enhanced breasts . This bra made it possible . It is a bit constricting in the ribcage as others indicated , and as the site indicated . But , it works and is easy to adjust to . I highly recommend it .
 If you are a D or DD and you want to run , you have to get this bra . Thanks to it , gone are the days of wearing a Champion jog bra over an underwire , or a Champion under a very supportive running tank . Unattractive ? Yes . Profound support ? Unbeatable . On first try on you 'll wonder how you 'll be able to breathe , but trust me , you 'll get over it .
 I bought my first Enell sports bra over 10 years ago based on a recommendation from a friend . I am just now having to replace it ! Finally after all of these years one of the eyehooks has come loose and it is starting to look a little ragged , but still functions ! I just bought a new one and am pleased to find that the quality appears to be the same as the first.I am a 42D and like to exercise - going to the gym , and doing CrossFit-style exercise . I have tried conventional sports bras , even doing the double-bra thing and nothing works like Enell . It takes a little getting used to at first and almost feels too tight , but it supports and holds like nothing else . I can do jumping jacks , jogging , running - and it is not uncomfortable at all ! I wo n't say there is zero movement or bounce , but it is so minimal it is almost unnoticable.I swear by Enell and it is money well spent !
 I 've had my Enell Sports bras for a little over a year and they are just as fantastic today as the day that I received them . I 've never worn a bra that was this comfortable or supportive and never moves , no matter how much I do , twist , turn , move , etc. , the bra stays in place and I do n't have to adjust it , now if I could just find a regular bra that could do the same thing .
 This is truly the Best Sports Bra EVER !!! I would give it more stars than five if I could . Will definitely be purchasing more .
 The best sports bra I have ever used . I 'm a 32DD -LRB- 00 size in this product -RRB- and this hold my boobs down when I 'm exercising . With other sports bras I use a regular cup bra and then a sports bra over it before my boobs feel secure . The clasps were a little hard to do at first , but I do a few top first and then a few on the bottom before doing the rest . The clasps are thankfully in front otherwise I would probably break my arms trying to put this thing on .
 Worth every penny , and more !!! Although if it were more expensive , I probably would n't have tried it . Now that I 've tried it , I would pay double without hesitation!All my other sports bras are ** completely useless ** compared to this dynamo ! No exaggeration!Comfortable in every way , holds firm the way you always hope and pray that the other sports bras would once you get moving.I 'm a jogger and endowed , and this product removes the pain and/or embarrassment out of such a bouncy activity!Love ! Love ! Love !
 Love this bra !! I am full busted and this bra makes exercising a lot easier ... thank goodness for this bra !! Highly recommend .
 I wear a 40DD , when I go to the gym I wear at least 2 sports bra sometimes 3 . Now I just wear the one bra . It holds wonderfully . I do wish it did n't have a seam as well but the support is worth it . In the past , I never did anything that required me to jump , now I can . I do not recommended wearing it more than 3 hours . However , I am so happy that I bought one .
 I have a large chest -LRB- DDD -RRB- and this is the best sports bra I have ever owned . I have a couple and will be buying more . I 've recommended this sports bra to family and friends .
 This really is a fantastic purchase for any lady who loves to exercise but needs the extra support . The sizing is true to your normal bra size -LRB- although I did go to my local running store to try one on first -RRB- . It really does do the job . I felt so comfortable the first time I wore it , I ran & ran & ran ... then regretted it the next day when my hip complained !! This bra was recommended on a triathlon website/forum I use and it got great reviews there too . Please take care to follow the washing instructions - it makes all the difference over time .
 I am a 36DDD and have a hard time finding a comfy workout bra . This bra definitely holds tight and helps reduce the bouncing that is inevitable when I run . My only complaint about it is that the straps are not adjustable . I would love to be able to tighten this straps but that 's not an options since it 's one big piece . It 's extremely comfortable to wear and does n't cut into you anywhere . I would definitely buy another one .
 I love this bra !! It is a total masher bra but for support you ca n't go wrong . The only problem is the straps do n't adjust but even with that I have owned nothing else for years .
 Fantastic bra for running , none better . The girls do n't move , not even a tiny bit .
 I have bought Enell bras before , they are great bras . Amazon had this bra with a great price and I received it in record time . I will order my next one from amazon as well . Money well spent .
 Great support for high impact activities , I absolutely can not run in a regular sports bra again !
 This is a seriously sturdy bra . I 'm a 40DDD and did n't think a sports bra existed that was capable of keeping my chest under control . Surprise - this one does ! I wear it jogging and biking and it 's awesome . No more painful and distracting bouncing ! As another reviewer mentioned , it 's not the sexiest underthing , but I like how it lifts and minimizes my bust - as long as I 'm wearing a thick shirt over it .
 I love this bra . For larger chested women like myself it 's really uncomfortable to run in a normal bra . And lots of bras are advertised as `` sports '' bras but so far none of them have ever really worked for me . This bra keeps everything still . And it 's actually not too uncomfortable . It 's a bit difficult to fasten all 11 hooks in the front but once it 's on it does n't need adjusted and it does n't slip move or creep . Perfect !
 not sure if I am a good one to rate it . the product did not fit my GF . she seems to be very tall and this did not have adjustable straps .
 This bra does exactly what it says . I am a 36 DD and a runner . This is the first bra that I have found that actually works for me and keeps things from being all over the place - ladies you know what I mean . The only thing that is a downside is that if you are larger breasted like me , you have to `` tuck '' your boobs in as you latch it up . But once I got used to it , that was n't as much of a problem .
 I just got my new Enell sports bra and have already worn it running a few times . I 'm very satisfied in that I experience absolutely no bounce . I love that aspect of the bra , and I really love that I only need to wear one bra versus the two I used to wear , which were n't nearly as effective . The fit is VERY tight -- so tight that it was difficult to put the bra on the first time , and , once it was on , it felt like I could n't take a deep breath . After I started exercising , I eventually forgot about the tightness and could breath comfortably . As others have noted , I expect the bra will stretch out a little in time.The only problem I 've had is with one of the eye hooks rubbing against my skin . I 've had to readjust while exercising , which has helped alleviate the discomfort . I just hope this problem will go away once I become more proficient at squeezing myself into the bra.All in all , this is a great bra and a godsend for big-busted women .
 This is my second Enell sports bra and I will never buy another sports bra . This bra has more support then any other sports bra or combination of sports bras . Once you try this sports bra you will never go back to a different one . Makes working out enjoyable .
 I bought 5 of these in the last 3 years . This is the perfect bra for me before , during and after pregnancy . Before pregnancy 36C and this bra was great for running , during pregnancy 38DD the bra worked great for running , after pregnancy 36D and the bra still works well for running . I of course had to order different sizes during this process , but no quality or bounce issues at any time . Taking measurements is the key to getting a good fit . I wo n't buy any other bra , unless they somehow make this bra better .
 Highly recommend for big busted ladies ! I went up a size bigger than what they recommended and I definitely did not need to do this . Go with the size they say and it will work perfect . No bounce !
 I recently took up running -LRB- after about 15 yrs without much exercise -RRB- but being a 34F complicated things a lot . I found this bra and was able to try it on before I bought it here . This bra seriously works miracles . Things stay in place like they never have and all I have to do is focus on my running . At first , I was looking at `` cuter '' bras ... but now I do n't care what this looks like , it does an amazing job and that is what matters !
 i loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee this sports brai can run and do hard core work outs and stay put its great , have never had one this good before
 as a big boobed gal , i researched quite a lot about different bras before shelling out big bucks . i will update this once i scrape enough dough to try some of the other bras i have seen.CONS : -- for my body type , i have very large boobs -- im a 38 G , BMI is 25 so this may not apply to all types . because of my size , i was recommended a size 3 . sadly , i can not see below my boobs to fasten the clasps at the bottom so i have to start at the top . but , once the bra is halfway fastened , your boobs are squished down below the bra -- i have to try and pull them back up and then start fastening the bottom clasps . it takes me about 5-6 minutes to put it on . -- there is NO stretch to this thing . it feels quite stiff and restricting -- i have less restriction on my breathing when i `` double bag '' the girls with 2 sports bras . eventually , you do get used to it -- ugly as sin . straps show with just about every workout top i wear and it looks like an old grandma bra . it does come up quite far so you can even see the clasps in the front on some of the lower cut work out shirts or tamk tops.PROS : -- boobs are pretty rock solid and dont move much . by far , the best single sports bra i have ever used . i play sports with running , jumping , and the girls stay quietly perched on my chest ! -- has held up well to washing -LRB- i dont dry it -RRB- without losing elasticity . its about 6 months old thus far -- my usual sports bras only make it 1-2 years max . looks like this one will have more longevity -- no chafing like some sports bras can do -- wide straps dont hurt your shoulder or dig in -- band around the chest doesnt dig in either like some elastic models -- no uniboob ! well , minimally uniboob i should say -- coverage up high for the more modest people . however , because of the design , there is still hella cleavage since it pushes the boobs upOVERALL : -- like it , if i dont find another one that is better , will buy more -- if you get a good sports bra and put it on top of one of the playtex 18 hour non underwire bras -LRB- see http://www.amazon.com/Playtex-Womens-Original-Comfort-Strap/dp/B0007YY8H0 for examples -RRB- , it is almost equivalent but looks better and is more comfortable in my opinion , not to mention a little cheaper ...
 38DD . You MUST use the Enell specific sizing chart -- as far as I can tell it 's not on the Ammy link , so use the website for your measurements!It 's Ugly , it squishes , and the fit feels weird at first and did I mention ugly?It 's also long lasting , and does what it 's supposed to . Keeps the girls still so I can go running . I would not wear it for anything but exercise because after I 'm done it would get a little uncomfortable . However , I 've done up to 2.5 hrs of running and done sprint triathlons in this bra.There is only one other bra I find as satisfactory -LRB- and only discovered it because Enell would not ship to APO/FPO ... and in fact would not even ship to a different address to let someone else mail it to me -- my BILLING address was FPO and they refused to service that ... so do n't try and buy this as a gift if you are going through Enell ... obviously that was before I could pay for it on Amazon ... but I digress -RRB- . Despite my unhappiness with Enell , I do love the product and I 'm vey happy ordering via Amazon has made purchasing this product a viable option again . Particularly as I start making plans to do another sprint triathlon , this style works very well under my suit.Extremely Highly Recommended for larger busted people who are doing something high impact like running.JTG
 Seriously , ladies . If you have girls which need to be corralled like I do , this is the only bra that will do . I 've tried many others which claim 10 barbells or super-no-bounce , but they are nothing compared to Enell . Really . It ai n't pretty -LRB- though I do like the sweet pink -RRB- and it shows a seam right across your bust , but it 's worth it . Nothing moves . Best . Sports . Bra . Ever . ` Nuff said .
 By far thye best sports bra for large breasts . Good support . Very confortable . Nice with most sports outfits.Easy to wash . Happy with puchase . Would definetly recommend it . It is better to get your size right first by trying it at a store .
 Works really well the first time it was super tight ... kinda hurt . But it molded to my body ... there is a lil bounce 36 DDD somethings arent immune to gravity . But overall A GREAT bra and awesome support !!! Im cheap and will return anything i dont like in a heart beat ... its a keeper .
 I am very pleased with my Enell Bra and the shipping process from the Amazon vendor . When I first put it on the compression seemed a little tight , but when I was able to run comfortably for the first time in a long time I was so happy . You definitly need to hook it from the bottom up and I found it easier to put it on while laying down . As it gets warmer I will be ordering others .
 This is an ideal bra for those of us who were given a little more up top than a regular sports bra can handle . I still nursing and even larger than normal so I was thrilled to find this bra !
 Works very well . Not very stretchy , so it holds things in place . The only sports bra I 've found that works for me .
 Great for any high impact workout . Keeps them from bouncing around especially if you are large breasted
 I love this product ! For the first time in years , I 've been able to go jogging with proper support . I found that I needed to buy a size below what the sizing chart said in order to get the proper fit . The bra feels great and seems very durable .
 This is the bra to have if you are a D-cup or better . I am a big runner and this is the best bra I have found !
 It is hard to find a good sturdy bra when you have big boobs . This company specializes in bigger sizes . When I first got the bra I thought this is never going to fit me , but once I figured out how to do it , it held me up and in and I looked much better in my clothes . They are expensive but I have one in white , cream and black and that is my total bra collection .
 By far the best high impact sports bra for larger breasted women . Originally purchased one through Title Nine website , however found it cheaper here plus free shipping . Measure carefully as there is not much give and only one row of hooks . I also have the Glamoise which is okay for lower impact exercises such as volleyball or walking . But for jogging I have not found a better supporting bra than the Enell .
 This bra is great for running ... The girls stay in place ! It 's a different feel with this sports bra than with others , but once you get used to it , this bra is perfect for high impact activities .
 I have tried several types of sports bras , but always come back to the Enell . Have to admit , they are n't the most attractive but you will not find a better supporting sports bra . I wear a D cup in a regular bra . I can run wearing the Enell with no bounce and it makes my run so much more comfortable . I would tell every women to at least try it . In support and comfort , you will not be disappointed .
 No bouncy at all . High quality product that lasts , does n't stretch out . Worth every penny .
 This bra does the job and is surprisingly comfortable . I just wish is was n't so much bra ... the back covers almost your entire back , and the front is higher than what I am used to . I had to get some new workout tops because the ones I had did not cover the bra . But again , comfortable and holds everything high and tight !
 I love this bra the most comfortable sports bra I have ever had . I have large breasts and have found it difficult to run or do other high impact sports with a regular bra or most sports bras . But , with the Enell bra the girls stay in place and it is no longer painfull to exercise . I have also worn it with regular clothes and not just when I exercise . I have suggested this bra to many of my friends and I will buy another one . Love it !!!!
 This bra delivers as promised - very little bounce when running or doing aerobic . For those women with a large bust you wo n't be disappointed in this one . I 've tried many and this is the best I 've found so far .
 I was shocked by how well this bra holds everything in place . I am a DD and ride horses . Sitting the trot in anything less supportive was VERY unattractive.This bra is extremely comfortable . I have such trouble with sports bras pressing into my shoulders and eventually giving me a headache . This bra is designed with the fabric doing the work so your shoulders do n't have to!I love the closure being in the front . There are lots of hooks , but it really is n't hard to manage . The benefit absolutely outweighs the extra few seconds to close all the hooks.Great bra !!! I have ordered three more .
 I 've been wearing this model sports bra for more than 4 years , and for this 36G , it 's the only sports bra I 'll wear ! All the low reviews complain about it being tight and ugly . Well , if it was n't tight , it would n't work . Sure , I 've worn bras that were more comfortable , but I was still bouncing , so ... kinda missing the point . This bra is tight and does n't move , and neither do my boobs , so I 've learned to deal with the band around the ribcage being tight . At first you feel like you ca n't breathe as well with it on , but soon it either loosens , or you just `` adapt '' to it . Whatever the reason is , after you wear it for awhile , that feeling goes away . It 's really not that big of a deal . It 's just like running . The first time you go beyond your comfort zone , you feel like you are going to die . But you do n't ! You keep going - and things feel better . Same deal.As far as ugly goes ... I 'm working out , not walking down the runway of a fashion show , or trying to find a date ... so the sheer ugliness of this bra does n't phase me . It is n't some cute spaghetti strap sportsbra that can be worn alone with matching patterned running tights like all those 32B 's wear around -LRB- because they can ! Lucky ducks ! -RRB- As someone else mentioned , its a `` fabric breastplate '' . It goes from a few inches below my collarbone , to the bottom of my ribcage . It has ugly seams that show through shirts , and the bra is so big that I can see the top of it if I wear a v-neck tee . Maybe it 's because I 'm a married mom , and lost my will to care about this crap , but I do n't think its that bad ! It 's not offensive , just ugly ! Many of the lower scorers point the seam issue out as a huge problem . I would rather `` call attention '' to that area with visible seams or a sliver of fabric showing over a v-neck than calling attention to that area by uncontrollably bouncing all over the place . I think we all know what would attract more attention . So , seams it is ! Until something better comes along -LRB- and I 've tried them all , and have n't found one that comes close -RRB- I 'll stick with the functional , yet unfashionable .
 These are expensive , but it 's worth it to be able to run or do jumping jacks with a C-cup or over . They seem tight at first , but that is because they actually work .
 This is the best sports bra I 've found for large breasts -LRB- 40DDD -RRB- . I can now take zumba and other &#34; high energy &#34; classes without embarrassment or injury . My only complaint -LRB- and it 's a small one -RRB- is the seam that runs across each breast that is very noticeable under shirts . I can only assume it 's necessary for the structure of the bra which is what makes it work so well . Overall , I 'm very happy with my Enell sports bra and will buy more in the future .
 I have tried on more sports bras than I ever want to again . I am a 34D -LRB- natural -RRB- so my girls tend to move when i move making high impact workouts and running very difficult . My Boyfriend came across this bra on amazon and ordered it . Let me just say at first try on i thought there is no way , this thing was tight and being a bit claustrophobic I was not so sure . To my great surprise as I wore it around the house for a bit things got better , no it was n't comfort like the cotton bra you wear to clean house in but lets face it this bra has some work to do if I want to go for a run . Within the first half mile I was hooked and knew this was the bra I had been needing . It 's not that the bra loosens up as you run , I think that you 'll feel more comfort in the bra being tight with NOTHING moving verses a more relaxed cotton bra that still allows bounce -LRB- which is far more uncomfortable -RRB- . Hands down best running bra ever !
 History/Experience : I have struggled to find a good sports bra for my large chest since I was in middle school . Growing up playing soccer really made it hard to adjust when things started bouncing more . My mom -LRB- being smaller busted -RRB- also struggled to help me find a solution . Keep in mind , this was before the internet/google/amazon days . I finally settled on `` doubling-up '' when getting ready for a game or practice - which was a daily occurrence . Looking back now , that was terrible . I could barely breath correctly , getting in and out of two very tight bras was a nightmare not to mention quite embarrassing . So , playing soccer ended soon after I became more full-figured . Recently -LRB- at age 23 -RRB- I started running , having my new sports bra from the sporting store , made `` specifically for larger breasts '' . Well , that was a crock . Sorry , but bras off the shelf just do n't cut it . After researching and reading about several of the newer sports bras on the market , I decided upon the Enell . I was careful not to get my hopes up too much however , because I did n't I could ever wear something that truly cut out the bouncing , but I remained hopeful . I measured , remeasured and finally ordered my new bra . As soon as it came , I had to go run around the neighborhood to give it a try . Oh , the joy of running!The Real Product Review : I am VERY HAPPY with the Enell . I can finally jog/run and truly enjoy what the sport has to offer , without worrying about hurting myself or being out of breath from non-stop chest thumping ! The bra is quite tight but I think that is a necessity . I still move a little bit but since my breasts are held very close/tight to my chest , the up and down motion is very minimal . It took a few days of getting used to but now I love putting on my Enell -LRB- I always lay down to hook the clasps - much easier ! -RRB- I love the tight feeling across my back when I am wearing it . I have even worn it all day at the zoo and other family activities . So easy , so comfy and SO worth every penny . The greatest thing , I do n't have think twice when chasing the toddler ! I do n't have to worry anymore about wanting to enjoy an impromptu game of frisbee or catch at the park . I can run and play with the kiddos comfortably and confidently.I would recommend the Enell to anyone with a larger bust that is tired of having to deal with improper support , doubling-up and not being able to breath , having constant chest-thumping when exercising , or just wants to feel better when playing with their kids . It has truly become one of my most essential pieces of clothing . As for the price
 I 've always had a pretty full bust . I remember walking at the track with a friend and trying to jog a bit during the straight stretches ... only to have her comment that I really needed to wear a sportsbra to minimize all the bounce . She was shocked when I told her that I actually had two on . Since a pretty dramatic weight gain , the bounce has gotten worse . When I found out my job was sponsoring free zumba classes , I could n't wait to enroll but felt self-conscious ... plus jumping around without good support is very uncomfortable . So when I saw the Enell bra featured on a plus sized fashion blog -LRB- with rave reviews -RRB- , I went ahead and splurged . I have to say that I 'm very pleased . The bra compresses but it also provides a lot of lift from below . I feel supported AND lifted instead of just getting squash-chest like the other bras out there . And for the first time since I hit puberty I was able to go for a light jog without feeling like I was pulling a pectoral muscle . Also , because of the unique satin-like material -LRB- versus the traditional all-cotton sportsbras -RRB- , my shirts do n't ride up or get stuck on my chest like velcro.Still , I could n't quite give it a perfect 5-star rating . For one thing , I 'm still getting a little bit of a uni-boob . The band fits perfect but the cup size seems a tad small , but I do n't want to go up a size and risk not getting a good fit around ... speaking of which , it is a bit of an non-traditional fit . The shoulder straps are pretty short and sort of has the bra hiked up in the back ... really high . Also , the price makes this a luxury item . I do n't know if I will ever own more than one at a time , especially if my weight loss is successful and I go down a size or so . I just hope this bra holds up well with frequent washing .
 Great bra ! I would suggest this to any woman who is active and do n't want their friends moving around . Enell Enell sports bra
 I wear a 38DDD bra size and it makes exercising very difficult , and sometimes painful . I 've tried just about every exercise bra I could find , but this bra is the only one I 've found that gives me the support I need to do Muay Thai . The price seems steep , but if I consider all of the other sports bras I 've tried and thrown away , the $ 60 + prize tag does n't seem so bad.This is also the most unattractive bra I have ever seen . It makes my boobs look strange under my shirt , especially shirts made out of wicking fabric , and it looks like I 'm wearing some sort of cybernetic breastplate . It can also get pretty warm . Finally , it takes practice putting it on . But the Ennell web site has a video that is actually pretty helpful . You 'll also want to hand wash this bra . My husband was being sweet to me one day and did my laundry for me . My Ennell bra shrunk drastically after being in the dryer . I could n't wear it anymore and had to buy another.Even though it 's ugly , it 's comfortable and it does the job . The wide straps do n't dig into my shoulders and they do n't shift like bras with regular size straps . Once you get yourself into the bra , everything inside of it stops moving . Once I started wearing this bra , I realize how distracted I was during Muay Thai when wearing a regular sports bra . Pulling up bra straps when you 're wearing boxing gloves is not easy , nor is it fun.I recommend going to the Ennell web site to view the video on how to measure yourself before you purchase the bra . You should n't just go from your regular bra size or depend on your memory . Measurements are the way to go .
 For busty gals , this bra is the penultimate ! Highly recommended for both support and comfort ! Less jiggling and firm back support for any sporting activity .
 This is by far THE BEST bra I 've ever owned . I 'm a 46G and have never had a bra that keeps my chest from bouncing up and down while working out . And even when I 'm not working out I have to wear TWO bras at the same time just so I can have any kind of support . I do n't have to do that with this . When I first put this bra on , I struggled with getting it over half of my chest , you have to pull really tight to get it to meet in the middle and also have a good enough grip to be able to close the clasps . I recommend laying down to put it on , close it halfway up , adjust whatever needs to be adjusted , sit up and finish closing it . And it 's not like other sports bras I 've had , you do n't get the whole `` uni-boob '' thing . It really makes your boobs look perfect . You 'll be sad everytime you take it off ! But this bra works as described . I can jump rope now ! And you may think you should get a size down or up just in case . Do n't . Go by the inches on the size chart -LRB- enell.com -RRB- and it 'll be perfect . I 've recommended it to every woman I know . I will buy more when my bra size goes down . I might even buy another to wear when I 'm not working out seeing as it 's so hard to find a good bra in my size . And the price is n't bad at all compared to how great it works . They could charge way more , but they do n't .
 This bra is really the difference between participating in sports and not . I ca n't imagine martial arts without this product . I think if they ever went out of business , my life in sports would cease to exist . It creates a tight hold , with no flex like a normal woven material sports bra . All other brands say they make sports bra , but they must be made by men because I have never been able to use one that performs well . This one changed everything . After purchasing this bra , I could do jumping jacks without embarrassment . It is expensive , but if you are serious about performance and do n't want to be bothered with bounce this is for you .
 I read through the reviews on here about this bra . I was skeptical -- supportive bras for large chested women are not that easy to come by . One reviewer recommended locating the bra and trying it on in person before purchasing it -- great recommendation!Here are my recommendations : First , measure yourself or get measured to make sure you know what size you need ! The sizing chart can be found on the Enell website -LRB- enell.com -RRB- . Second , READ the instructions -- it makes a huge difference !!! You have to start attaching the hooks at the bottom of the bra and work your way up . After every 2-3 hooks , you have to readjust your breasts . -LRB- My size 3 had 11 hooks total . -RRB- When you are finished your breasts should be `` held firmly in the upper center portion of the bra , '' according to the Enell website.Is it hard to get into ? Yes ! I almost could n't get the darn thing started the first time , but if you do it correctly it is a nice , snug fit . I felt like I was held in place but not squashed -LRB- I actually felt like I could go into battle with that thing on -RRB- . I tried the jump test and I had a very small amount of up and down movement -LRB- was n't going to knock myself out -RRB- but no side to side movement . It 's also pretty pricey , but let 's face it -- if you have large breasts , you 're going to pay alot for good bras . I have had mine less than a month and am pretty pleased . Here 's hoping it lasts for a while!Another bonus is that it comes in a larger variety of colors than most other sports bras that I can find for my size -LRB- 38DDD -RRB- . I purchased mine at a local store in pink , but I 'll probably purchase my next one here on Amazon in purple . -LRB- On a side note , at the same store I tried on a Moving Comfort Jubralee in my size and was not satisfied with it . I felt like I had too much movement and felt like I was falling out of the sides of the bra -- not what you want in a sports bra . -RRB-
 I first purchased an Enell bra 8 years ago . I used it for horseback riding and loved it then . After about two years that one finally wore out . I did n't buy another one until now . I regret all the other sports bras in between the two Enell bras . From now on , I will only be buying Enell sports bras for my athletic activities . I 'm a large busted woman and it works wonderfully .
 This is the best sports bra I have ever worn . It takes getting used to as it is tight and requires a `` technique '' to get it on properly but it is well worth it . I wo n't wear another sports bra and have already spread the word to friends who have made the purchase of their first enell bra .
 Very comfortable , with good support for the active woman with a larger bust . Very well made with high quality materials . True to size .
 The Enell Maximum Control Sports Bra has the best support of any bra I 've ever used . There is NO BOUNCE and this is the only time I 've ever experienced that . It is a little confining as a result and it almost feels hard to breathe so , I would only recommend it for very high impact activity .
 This very comfortable to wear during a workout . The only drawback is I do n't care for the satin -LRB- glossy -RRB- look of it nor do I like all the fasteners in the front .
 Very solid sports bra from larger sizes . Prompt mailing and product was described perfectly . The material and workmanship are excellent .
 I received the bra very quickly . It turned out that it was too small and the color was not what I expected . I returned it and got a refund very quickly . Good company !!
 How wonderful to trot and run on my horse out on the trails without holding one arm across my boobs trying to keep them from bouncing and hurting . This bra is the answer to my prayers . In frustration I said there must be a good sports bra somewhere , I will have to look on the internet ! They sure are n't in the stores , what they sell for sports bras are a joke if you have any bust at all . What did we do before the internet . It was hard for me to pay $ 64.00 for a bra but I am so glad that I did .
 I love this sports bra ! It is very supportive and fits me . I have never found a sports bra that fits until now . I measured as 30.5 '' rib cage and 40 '' bust and size 0 fits me perfectly . If you 're in between sizes , order a size down - It 's a sports bra and is supposed to fit tightly to support you !
 The most supportive sports bra I 've ever owned . Fits extremely snug so do n't be alarmed , but you will not bounce an ounce with this bra on while exercising or running .
 This bra is the best sports bra ever ! As a 32DD , bras can be a challenge to find , let alone sports bras . This bra holds the girls in place for an entire work out and then some . I can run and spare in this bra and no bounce ! While the bra is tight and I wouldnt choose to wear it everyday just for fun ; it does get the job done ! No more wrapping the girls down and no more uni-boob , now I can focus on the activity at hand and not be self conscience . If you have tried everything as hand or perhaps just want the best from the start . you need not look any further .
 This is one of the best sports bra 's I have owned . For the first time I have been able to wear 1 bra and feel secure -LRB- figuratively and literally -RRB- . In the past I have had to wear 2 bra 's . The only thing that I would change is to have more separation between the breasts but otherwise this is a winner !!! Make sure you size yourself correctly as that is one of the reasons I think this bra works so well.Go forth and enjoy minimal movement : -RRB-
 This is the most fabulous sports bra for a DD or DDD chest ! Absolutely no bounce for miles and miles and miles . Have never chaffed . Most awesome support . This is the second Enell bra I have owned . My first one is 4 years old and still as good as new . I am borderline between 00 and 0 but went with the smaller size and it fits even with a heart rate monitor belt under the band . It might feel tight at first but loosens up with wear but if taken care of -LRB- delicate cycle/hand wash cold water NO DRYER -RRB- it will last for many many years . I wear mine 5 days a week for working out and running . An act to get into it
 I definitely would n't say `` no bounce '' but it gives excellent support . It 's comfortable and fits nice and tight , but I can breathe . Gives the feeling of great support and I notice I stand up straighter too . I bought it for the gym and ended up wearing it every day . Wish it did n't cost so much , and I mean in general , but I 'm happy with it .
 I had heard many good things about this bra , so I ordered one . I went running and I felt like I was running faster . Cool ! I realized I was because I did n't have to do my modified run , where I attempt to run without moving my upper body and I could swing my arms instead of holding my breasts ! I 'm an all natural 34DD -LRB- meaning I do n't have silicone `` scaffolding '' perking-up my breasts -RRB- , so bounce is always a problem and is painful . This bra is tight in the band , but I do n't feel any pull on my shoulders , nor have grooves cut into my shoulders by straps . I would recommend this bra to any well-endowed woman who does high impact activities . It also launders well and I even dry mine in the dryer on low with no problems . The hooks are a bit difficult to close , since your breasts get in the way , so those with dexterity issues may have a problem hooking it .
 If your boobies are larger than an A cup this is the bra for you !!! It holds you in place and does not let you bounce around . GREAT BRA !!!
 my last enell was 10 years old , ran a marathon no prob . -LRB- with the bra anyway -RRB- . I accidently ordered one size too small but breathing is overrated anyway .
 This may be a pricey bra , but the support it provides is PRICELESS . If you are blessed with an abundance of curves up top , this bra will save you pain and frustration , and eliminate the discomfort that comes with the purchase of other support systems that just do n't work . Whether you run , do aerobics , horseback ride , or just wear it day in and day out , you can not go wrong with the Enell No Bounce . Buying it from Amazon ensures fast delivery of exactly what you ordered .
 The second I received the Enell sports bra in the mail I rushed to put it on . I was glad I read the instructions first because they warned me that it would seem tight and how to put it on , which I immediately did . I then proceeded to jump ... and it was wonderful ! Whereas before jumping was painful , and embarrassingly bouncy , now there is minimal movement and I could join a double dutch team if I wanted to ! For all the women out there who put on 2-3 sports bras when they want to work out , stop torturing yourselves ! The Enell bra is extremely comfortable and it works ! Sure it 's a nice chunk of change , but it 's an investment , and one you wo n't soon regret ! The only downside is that now I have no excuse for not running !
 It 's not the prettiest looking bra in the world but it does it 's job perfectly . When running in other sports bras I felt like I had trouble regulating my breathing because of the extra pressure being put on my chest from the bouncing but I do n't have that problem with this one at all . I 've been able to run farther than I ever had in my life . The only thing I do n't like is the seams running through the middle of the chest can be seen through a t-shirt and the feel of the bra takes a little bit of getting used to . I would still recommend this product to any other large chested women .
 This is the sixth Enell sports bra I have purchased and I can honestly say this bra has changed my life ! As a large-busted professional doing active work , I was never able to find a sports bra that fit correctly . The enell gives me the support and `` containment '' that I need to do my work more confidently . I originally bought this bra just for work , but found it so awesome , that I ended up wearing it everyday . No more constantly pulling up straps or readjusting the band . My clothes fit better , and I do n't feel like I am always in danger of `` falling out . '' I also have had a huge improvement of headaches and back pain since wearing this bra . I now feel this bra is something I ca n't live without . Make sure you follow the size charts , as sizing can be a little difficult at first , but once you find the right size it is well worth the extra effort . I do n't mind that it costs a little more , because of the awesome comfort and support , and superb quality that lasts a long time . Thank you Enell !
 I have very large breasts , a 38G , and this is the only sports bra I will ever wear.PROSfits greatMinimzes bounce - almost NONE!flattens boobs out , also seperates - sounds like a strange pro , but it comes in handy when lifting weights in positions you typically could n't because your boobs stick out too muchfront closure - so great to not have to pull a sweaty gross bra over your head!Keeps them high up ! - other sports bras make big boobs sag , this one keeps them up for the whole workoutCONSPricey - worth it , but people may think $ 60 is too much for a braWorth the money !!!!!!
 This Enell Support Bra is the best bra for all my active workouts . It is constructed very well . I lay on my back across my bed to put it on at first . shake the girls in place and I am ready for the gym .
 Yes , it 's a little on the strange side getting into it but once you get the hang of it , this is an awesome bra . I love it , love it , love it . No jiggle , no shortness of breath Scarlett O'Hara style , just comfort . Give it a whirl but remember , you have to lean over and sort of shove those puppies in while directing them neck-ward while you fasten yourself in . Sort of like a corset with the ties in the front .
 I have a much larger chest than average , so it amazes me that the sports bras I 've found in my size have tiny straps -- tiny straps which dig great red gouges into my shoulders when I attempt to run . The Enell bra is much more comfortable on my shoulders and is flattering under shirts too . And though there is bounce -LRB- you ca n't defy physics -RRB- , it is an acceptable amount .
 As a 40DD , I 've had plenty of challenges in finding an adequate sports bra . The Enell does exactly what it says ; bounce is absolutely minimal , comfort is fantastic . I do n't experience the `` squeeze out '' effect like I have with other sports bras - nothing squeezing out over the tops , under my arms or on my back . The full back is very supportive and helps with posture while I 'm working out.The Enell will fit differently from any sports bra you 've ever owned , an it might seem strange at first , but as soon as you begin your workout , you 'll notice the effectiveness . I might avoid this bra if you have arthritis that limits hand strength or mobility , because the hook and eye closures can be difficult to use because the fit is so snug . Otherwise , buy and enjoy !
 Look no further for a no-movement sports bra . I do n't care what activity you do . . if you do n't want bounce , you want this bra !!
 Absolutely amazing . The best sports bra I have ever worn . True to its promise it 's absolutely amazing for big sizes . Now I can run freely without a care in the world . Please come out with more styles and colors .
 I recently had a breast augmentation surgery performed and went from a 32B to a 32D and am a very active woman who runs , bikes and rides horses . I tried several sports bras and this has been my favorite as it is definitely the most supportive . There is no bouncing , even when running down hill . When I first tried putting it on -LRB- I ordered size 0 which was my size according to their sizing chart -RRB- I thought it was way too small and there was no way I would get it on . Once I did get the bra on , it felt very compressive at first and not that comfortable to just hang out it . But then I went for a run , and wow . I felt incredibly supported and felt no movement at all in the chest area . I have gotten more used to how initially compressed I feel when putting it on and love the full support it gives me during high impact sports . Definitely worth the cost and bit of a struggle squeezing into it as I have yet to find a more supportive sports bra .
 If you are looking for a sports bra that REALLY controls the `` bounce '' factor , you will love this sports bra . I am a high impact runner , and this is the ONLY bra I wear to exercise/run . High compression , but comfortable , this sports bra has handled holding me in place , from my heaviest weight -LRB- size 38DDD -RRB- to my current size now wearing 34DD ... . I will not workout without it !!!!
 When I first put this product on , I thought `` there is no way this will fit '' , but it did . The bra is super snug and thus supportive . Strangely enough , it 's still rather comfortable . I 'm a full busted girl , and although movement is n't completely eliminated -LRB- understandable so -RRB- , it is definitely reduced . I will continue to buy these bras .
 I now can jump rope without pain , my pushups are harder because my boobs do n't implant themselves in the ground ! I bought 4 more ! I wear a 40DDD and the size 4 fit perfectly , where them on my 12hr shifts , my back is less tired .
 This is the best sports bra ever invented for those of us who have fuller figures . It is comfortable and very stable and secure . I do CrossFit training and I never have to worry about security .
 This bra is extremely uncomfortable , but it has given me the freedom to be able to run and work out , which is SO worth it !! It provides SO much support and straps your chest down so much , it really works !!
 This bra is FABULOUS ! It 's so soft and supportive at the same time , does n't dig in anywhere . I am planning on ordering one in every color . One Sweet One was amazing to work with . I originally ordered the wrong size , and the exchange was quick and painless .
 I love this bra !!! I am able to run and jump without the pain.It is well worth the price , Amazon 's price and shipping was better than the Enell website .
 I just got one of these bras and it is INCREDIBLE . I go between a 44 DDD to 44 G , and I hate every bra out there . The ones with wires are supportive , but the wires gouge my sides . The wireless ones are n't supportive at all , but they do n't cut into me . This bra is the best of both worlds . Wildly supportive and wireless . When you first put it on , it feels too small . As you button up the eyehooks , you have to keep pulling your boobs up and out . As soon as I put this beast on it looked like I 'd dropped 20 pounds and I could move my arms around withough knocking into my boobs . I plan on getting the lighter version when I have some money . This thing is expensive , but it 's no worse than any other decent bra . I highly recommend it !!
 This item truly works for women with a large chest who like to workout . I use it for running and no problems or chaffing . Sturdy material lasts a long time . Learned about it from Oprah .
 Best sports bra for larger busted ladies . I 've tried many and this is the only one I have loved enough to purchase again and again .
 I am a very large chested woman who just recently started Zumba . A lot of the jumping around moves were hurting because no sports bra could support me . I tried this Enell sports bra ! It 's amazing ! I have always shied away from this type of exercise because there was n't a product out there that could support . Well , thanks to Enell , I am active the way I was as a kid ! Thanks Enell !
 Well , I ordered the wrong size , but just feeling the material I would have to say that it would have been exceptionally comfy ...
 i love this bra absolutely NO bounce ! i 'm a size 36 ddd and run 3-5 miles a day , i swear no bounce . it 's the best ever
 I am a 165 pound female who is a workout fanatic . I wear a 36DDD and have never been only able to wear one sports bra when exercising until now ! I heard about this bra on Oprah and gave it a shot . Worked perfect for me and held everything in place perfectly . It feels so great to only have to wear one bra now instead of 3 regular sports bras . I own two of them and the size I have is a 1 ! Highly recommend to all you big busted workout fanatics out there !
 This product is everything it promises and a bit more !!! thought at first it was to small , then I tried it in action and loved it !! I totally recommend it !
 Very impressed with product . 38 DDD and found running not an option for me until I purchased this bra . Keep in mind Enell offers two types of bras -LRB- one that is a little less supportive -RRB- . I went to the local retailer and tried the less supportive one on first . Glad I did , they did n't have the more supportive bra in stock -LRB- i.e. shiny material one -RRB- and the clerk tried to talk me into a larger or smaller size - not good . Hence , I went back home to order on-line from Amazon . The size conversions are spot on 38 DDD equates to a size 3 . I did some research and relied heavily on the reviews for this product . I would purchase again .
 I ride horses and some of them are a little on the rough side when it comes to trotting . I feel totally secure with this item holding in the ` girls . ' There is a little bit of bounce , but I guess if there was n't any , I 'd be a boy . ha haDefinitely want to order a size larger than what you 'd usually wear . It can run a little on the tight side . After washing , it feels tight , but then after a day , it stretches out enough to be comfortable.It does take a few wears to get used to it and to `` mold '' it to your body . It can be quite uncomfortable at first ... feel like a straight jacket ... but only at first , then it 's great . You do n't notice you 've got it on.I 'd recommend this for anyone who wants a good hold . I 'm not crazy about the pink color , but what the heck , it 's not lingerie !
 i ca n't wait to try it on . it is so hard to find comfortable bra 's that fit big busted women . i like the fact the hooks are in the front . order came fast !
 I have worn an Enell bra for running for years -LRB- literally , the same one for years -- they hold up incredibly well -RRB- . It was time to get another , so I ordered the same color and size , but the fit is weird on this one . It 's too baggy in the top portion , above the seam . Going to return or exchange -- hope it is a fluke , as it does n't fit like my last one . Otherwise , I wish every woman knew about Enell . I have not found a better bra for my large chest -- no bounce , no back fat , no annoying/unflattering racerback . Once you get one that fits -LRB- should be snug -RRB- NOTHING moves in this baby .
 This is an incredible bra !! If you are serious about minimizing movement during high impact activities this is the bra for you ! I am a 32 D , and I was so sick of re-adjusting multiple times during each run or dealing with back pain from bras which allowed to much movement . I am amazed that there is so little movement ! The trade-offs are that it is 1 . -RRB- tight - only comfortable during high impact workouts 2 . -RRB- constricting - nearly impossible to wear your Garmin heart rate monitor under the bra and 3 . -RRB- `` noticeable '' - most singlets will not fully cover . I 'm so proud that I can run and not be bouncing all over the place , that I do n't care if people can see my bra - heck let 'em look . If you are a `` well endowed '' women looking to END your bouncing and back pain woes , you should try this bra!Although the product is incredible , I 'm writing a review because the lifespan has greatly exceeded my expectations ! I bought my first Enell from a local running store in January 2011 and was told to expect about 6 to 8 months of use . I dutifully purchased another in June 2011 , but the first was fine so I alternated use between the two . After more than 1.5 years of moderate use -LRB- I average four 60 minute high impact workouts per week primarily running , sports conditioning , and plyometrics -RRB- the only signs of wear on either bra is that the paint is worn from the clasps ... incredible ! I actually can not tell which one is older and even the tags are not worn ! I always wash cold in a wash bag and air dry.The Enell bra has truly have exceeded my expectations by miles and miles . Thank you for making such a functional and durable product !
 Amazing support and fairly comfortable , rather homely but do n't care . The next best thing to breast reduction , no other bra comes close .
 I am 40 DDD and this is the only bra that works for me . I can run , jump , kickbox ... I can do whatever I want and there is no bounce , no pain , no jiggle . It provides serious support . If you are well endowed and fight with sports bras do yourself a favor and buy this .
 have to say this is the only sports bra that keeps my watermelons up . It does more than its job . I love this bra a lot , it sits my breast ups and hold them in place .
 While this certainly is n't the most comfortable sports bra I 've put on , it is certainly the best . I will definitely be buying another one . As a 34G , I need a sports bra that can handle some serious bouncing . This bra will have none of it . No bouncing whatsoever . It has exceeded my expectations .
 I typically wear 40DD bras , so I purchased this the first time in size 3 - it fit just right -LRB- meaning I could breathe and everything -RRB- , but it only had the same hold as my regular sports bras ... When I wear three of them . Which is n't a lot . So I sent that back and got my size 2 . I 'd been all set up by other reviews for an almost suffocating-ly tight hold , but either I wear tight clothes -LRB- I do n't -RRB- , or they were exaggerating.The bra does what it claims to do , to a degree . Me , with my high expectations , was hoping that it would 100 % eliminate bounce . It does n't . I would say it 90 % eliminates bounce . I 'm doing theTurboFireprogram , so there 's a lot of jumping around and general craziness -LRB- not as bad as insanity , thank goodness -RRB- . This bra gets the job done , but I wish that it had a bit more support on the top , since that 's where most of my bounce is.tl ; dr
 I have used this product for over a year as I began a running program . It offers great support for those who have need of larger cup sizes while providing great fit for smaller band sizes . I have experienced no chafing , rubbing , or discomfort . I would highly recommend this Enell Sports Bra for any woman who runs or does other physically demanding exercises !
 This is a great product ! It offers the best support for me when I go for a jog or just working out at the gym . It holds you in place and you do n't have to worry about any bounce . You 'll feel super supported and wo n't want to use another bra after trying this one out !
 I ca n't workout unless I wear it . I have always held myself back from energetic activities because of my chest size . With this sports bra , I am willing to do any activity that involves running , jumping , etc. . I got to go horseback riding last weekend because I wore the Enell bra ; I have n't done that since I was a kid !
 This bra is terrific . I needed a size -LRB- 4 -RRB- Enell . I 'm on the larger size of the scale in size and also a nursing mom . I am training for a half marathon and even when I am semi-full , I am able to run comfortably in this sport bra . I would recommend it to anyone who is active and nursing .
 This is the first sports bra that keeps me in place during cardio workouts . A great product , highly recommended for women with large breast who wish to do high impact cardio without much moving around .
 This is the most durable , reliable , comfortable bra I have ever worn . Other manufacturers simply do not make bras that account for the need for women with larger cup sizes . While Enell may not recommend this bra for daily wear or for those larger than DD , I have found it to be the only one I trust to get me through a long day at work and flexible enough to accommodate the slight changes in weight up or down that I experience every month . You WILL NOT BOUNCE or fall out of this bra ; your back will thank you every morning you wear it .
 Great sports bra . Very little movement . Holds the girls in wonderfully , and provides excellent back support .
 These sports bras were purchased for my daughter , so I can not speak from my own experience , but she says these are the best . She wears a DD size and is a frequent runner . I gave her one a year ago and she has used it nearly every day . It held up well through many washings and wearings so the new ones were a much appreciated gift . For people who need the support , they are well worth the price .
 I love Enell sports bras ... they are well worth the money . I started wearing them about two years ago and have bought no other sports bra since . It is a different feeling at first , because they fit very snugly to prevent bouncing , but once you get used to the fit they are amazing !
 This is the most comfortable bra I have ever owned . I have been using them for over 6 years -LRB- well before Oprah endorsed them -RRB- - tossing out the `` normal '' bras in favor of these `` sports '' bras . They are long lasting - I have some that are still in great shape after 4 years . They were a god send for the hormonal changes following child birth . It is my opinion that they are well worth the high price tag because of how comfortable , practical , and durable they are.I recommend them to anyone who prefers to be supported.the only downside - shoulder straps are a little wide - can show a little under wide necked shirts . And they would n't work real well with a prom gown . : -RRB- A truly quality product .
 I bought this bra for someone else in my family who 's been cursed with an oversize bust . She wants to be able to exercise and play on sports teams , but was unable to do so comfortably . With this bra , however , she was able to join a sports team . I ordered two more . They 're a tad pricey at sixty bucks , so we could n't get more than that . But this bra is worth the price because it WORKS .
 I bought this bra not with sports in mind . This is not a ` pretty , feminine ' bra . As a large busted woman , I was tired of being disappointed with ill fitting bras . I needed the back/posture support and ample coverage . This bra provides both -- however the drawbacks are
 If you are a busty woman -LRB- anywhere from C cup or above -RRB- , then this bra is for you . I have tried numerous other -LRB- very expensive -RRB- sports bras , but none has provided the level of support AND comfort that the Enell does . Now , I have no problem with the fact that there are no strap adjustments , but apparently some women find the straps are too short/long for them . It fits me perfectly and I have changed sizes over the years . Be sure to take the time to measure your rib cage -LRB- below the breast -RRB- and across your breasts to determine the correct size to order . The basic calculation is breast size -LRB- let 's say a 40 -RRB- minus rib cage size -LRB- say 34 -RRB- equals your cup size -LRB- 40-34 = 6 -RRB- . Count the alphabet to 6 letters -LRB- in our example , F -RRB- and that 's your cup size . Many products use double and triple D , so an F = DDD as well . As anyone with large breasts knows , it can be difficult to get excited about exercise when every bounce hurts , but exercise is SO important for our physical and mental health . So take a little time to figure out your size , and spend a little extra money , and get a good bra !
 Got this on a recommendation from a friend . Am very happy with it . Initially it felt tight and like a corset but very soon I got used to it and found it to be very comfortable and snug . It eliminated bouce completely . And now when I run I feel completely comfortable as if I am wearing nothing at all , even in a hot and humid climate . Yet to test it on distances longer than 10K . The days of wearing sports bra over regular bra and the attendant problems are over!Would definately recommend it .
 I have a large chest and I put this on and jogged around the house - I felt like I had A cups again ! haha . Since , I have been jogging in it , and I love it !
 My product arrived within 3 days in excellent condition . I have been totally satisfied with this purchase . After 2 months of wearing this bra to work out , I have noticed that I am able to jog & jump with more support . I am planning to purchase another Enell sports bra for my co worker who is also a full figured female , who recently started working out for better health . I recommend buying this product from this seller with out worry , because you will be satified with your decision . It is better than I expected , I love my Enell sports bra .
 I love running , and I hate when flat or small chested woman tell me to get a breast reduction surgery . I wish I could slap them in the face . its not my fault I have big boobs or that guys prefer my boobs over theirs . I love this bra , it is the best ; most supportive bra I have ever had . I can finally run without pain or discomfort .
 I ordered the Enell in a size 4 but had to send it back for a 5 other then that this is a great Bra , and I will be ordering more . Except for trying to figure out the size I needed since I had been buying X Large Sports Bras for a while now ... I can not go back , it is worth the money and my Back feels great now !
 I 've always been ` well endowed ' and many people tell me i should be grateful and I am but they have never had to exercise with those ! That being said i am loving this bra - I do feel like an astronaut and feel like i am hooking about 40 little clasps -LRB- exaggeration -RRB- but LOVE the support and feel of it . I also find it very easy to put on and amazingly accessible since i am nursing ; 0 -RRB- Well I have nothing but GOOD to say about it !! I will definitely buy this one again !
 For 30 years I have worn 2 jog bras at once because I could not find one that controlled bounce and the irritation from that . The ENELL Maximum Control has eliminated that problem . I just wear one now - ENELL and that is all I need . I am very happy with this product . It does support me and prevents bounce . If you have larger breasts and want support and control this is for you .
 I have always had large chest and could not find comfortable sports bras . I would have to put on two or sometimes three to limit the bouncing . When i saw this bra i was skeptical but the reviews made it sound great . When i tried it on for the first time it made me look like a different person . Not only did it support me better but it brought me down about 2-3 sizes . My clothes fit and look better . When exercising , there is little to no bouncing . Will definitely buy more .
 This sports bra is amazing.I 'm a nursing mother who is trying to get back into shape . This sports bra actually feels secure and I can jog in it with very minimal bounce . I would recommend this bra to anyone !
 I misread the size chart ... it does n't accurately reflect the size ` translation ' that Enell does . However , the company was great and I finally got the right one . Really like this bra , its as comfortable as it could be while keeping everything in check . Nice to not have to wear two bras .
 I had no idea just how much my boobs were holding me back while running until I ran with the Enell Sports Bra . It just makes the experience so much more comfortable , and now I feel that I can commit to my running program that much more.I 'm new to running and fairly new to exercise in general . I 've tried to start and keep up an exercise routine several times in my life but always gave up within a few months . Although this was due to other factors such as a lack of time or motivation , I think that my inability to find a sports bra that worked well definitely had an impact . I always felt uncomfortable and self conscious ; there would be cleavage popping out of the top and annoying bouncing during cardio.Now I feel very well strapped in but not it 's uncomfortably tight -LRB- at least once I start my workout -- sometimes it feels tight right after I put it on -RRB- . So far I have only used it for running but I ca n't wait to try it during Cardio Kickboxing ! I also imagine that it will make lifting weights easier when I start doing that again , because the bra compresses my boobs and makes them much flatter across my chest . With a regular sports bra , they got in the way of some machines , when pulling things towards my chest.By the way , I am currently a 36DD but I 've been a 34DDD when slightly thinner . I am hoping that when I lose some weight I will go back to that size and maybe smaller -LRB- back to my 32D days ?? -RRB- though I 'll be sad when the Enell does n't fit anymore . Guess I 'll just have to get another one then . Pretty pricy but totally worth it !
 Love it . I was nervous at first because it almost looks like a vest , but it works great . It holds `` the girls '' in place while jumping around , and is quite comfortable . The moisture wicking is great too . I live in a hot , humid climate , but do not get that yucky damp feeling from it , nor do I get chaffing .
 I bought this bra back in May for my summer softball league . I am size 34E and no sports bra has ever been able to keep me from bouncing . This bra is simply AMAZING ! No bounce , no pain - and it 's pretty comfortable to wear.The only negative is that you would n't want to wear it on a regular basis as it flattens you out . Other than that - if you have n't had luck with regular sports bras , try this one - it 's worth the money !!
 The Enell sports bras does what it says it will do . It holds you in and does n't allow any jiggle . However , it is extremely tight . I do n't think that I can wear it on hot days . I would give it five stars , but it is just so darned tight .
 A co-worker told me about this little bad boy -- thank gawd they make these !!! So comfortable , if its too tight , or you feel light of breath , undo the bottom two .
 This bra has changed my life ! . I never believed I could run ... 36DD and heading into my mid 40 's . However , this bra secured my chest and allowed me to give it a `` real '' try . I did my first 5k on Thanksgiving , and run 3-4 times 3-5 miles weekly now ... I feel great , and my chest feels great !! NO movement , no soreness , nothing ! I love it , and now own 6 .
 This bra is worth every penny . If you are blessed with large breasts , this bra is a must have . I have never been able to run for any extended length of time without bouncing around and discomfort before using this bra . I even wear it while playing Wii Fit . I encourage anyone with curves trying to get into shape to start here .
 For years I have tried to find a sports bra that was supportive . I have always had to wear two sports bras to get enough support . Luckily I found the Enell ! It has changed my running life ! I highly recommend it !
 What a releif this bra is for me . I can run , jump rope , and perform other aerobic athletic activities without a hint of a jiggle ! This is a muist have for the active well-endowed !
 Works wonderfully , once you get used to the tightness around the ribs . Great trade off to painful running though . : -RRB-
 This is the second Enell bra I 've purchased and it has changed my world . I used to have to wear 2 or even 3 , ` high impact ' or ` running ' sports bras because nothing seemed to keep the girls in place as I wanted . This design is like armor - which I love - -LRB- and it 's not a pretty frilly thing -RRB- - and because of that I feel confident to go running or play tennis or jump on a trampoline , whatever - cos everything is protected ! It is the perfect sports bra for well-endowned women .
 After trying on dozens of sports bras that did n't fit , I would have to say that this was the best one . It is great to do aerobics and be contained . My only complaint is that it is a little tight ; I am a 36DDD which is a really hard size to find , but now that i am working out more it is fitting better ! I would recommend it .
 Absolutely AWESOME product . Trust me ... it is worth the money to feel `` secure . '' The `` girls '' are not going anywhere !!! which is exactly what you want .
 I love Enell Sports Bras . I find it extremely uncomfortable to exercise in a regular sports bra . The Enell bras provide the perfect amount of support.They resemble a corset because they hook in the front with about 20 latches.The perfect bra . Well worth the investment !
 I started running , and I 've been looking for a sport bra that actually works for people like me who do not have a runner 's body . Nothing in the store came close . This one works exactly as described . High quality construction and worth every penny .
 I have worn an Enell sports bra for several years and would n't wear anything else for fitness training . I had always wanted to run but at a size 32DDD I never could find a sports bra that would fit and be comfortable for running until I found out about Enell from a newspaper article . I called the company and was fitted over the phone and info 'd on the way it would fit . When it arrived I tried it on and yes I was trussed up like a Thanksgiving turkey and it does not look attractive under shirts but I could jump , run and turn cartwheels -LRB- in theory , I ca n't turn a cartwheel regardless of the bra I am wearing -RRB- and the girls do not move . Now it is no problem to run or do Zumba or Boot Camp type exercise classes . I would recommend and buy this bra again .
 My chest size almost kept me from enlisting in the Army ! I was a 38F cup at age 18 , and in order to do any high impact sports , I need to wear four or five bras to strap my breasts down - extremely inconvenient and uncomfortable . I even considered having a breast reduction ! I happened to stumble across these bras online back in 2007 . I figured what the hell , I 'll give them a shot . I ordered one , and I was so impressed that I purchased 5 more ! I took these bras with me to basic training -LRB- AKA `` boot camp '' -RRB- , and they did not let me down ! They are comfortable , and my breasts do n't move a bit ! I 've since lost weight , and I 'm now down to a size 36D , but I still wear these bras -LRB- albeit in a smaller size -RRB- . They 're a bit tricky to put on at first , and they 're a bit pricey , and they are n't as cute as something you might find at Lululemon 's , but they get the job done !!! I have recommended these bras to every woman I know , and I will never purchase anything else !!! Moral of the story : IF YOU ARE A BUSTY WOMAN LOOKING FOR A GOOD SPORTS BRA , BUY THESE !!! THEY GOT ME THROUGH ARMY BASIC TRAINING !!!! I LOVE THESE BRAS !
 I really needed an `` industrial size '' bra for horseback riding . Even with a regular bra & regular sports bra overtop could n't compare to the Enell bra I just bought . The Enell bra gave me superior support & comfort while sitting a trot and canter which I had serious doubts about before the experience . If you need serious support , I highly recommend this bra - it is n't inexpensive but well worth the price !
 I absolutely love this sports bra ! I am very blessed in the girl dept and I can jump w/o my girls bouncing horribly ! Its great ! I recommend this bra too any big boobed chick
 For the longest , I 've been searching for a bra that can accommodate my ample chest . When I read online that Christinia Hendricks wears Enell I had to try it . I do a lot of cardio and with this sports bra I have minimal movement -- which is great ! I will definitely order more .
 I 'm not sure what came over me , but I was talked into running a half marathon by my friend next year . I had to get training asap . I had done other high impact exercises in my existing sports bras with no problems . I finally worked my way up to 5 miles -LRB- 1 hour -RRB- and bam ! The underside of my breast were eaten up ! The skin had been rubbed off to show the white meat ! I was shocked that had never happend before , and I was in a panic to try to find something that would work to keep the girls safe . -LRB- Instead of quitting , which I would normally do :--RRB- -RRB- I searched the internet and read all the reviews about this bra and decided to order from Amazon becasue as usual they had the best price . I went to their website to get my sizing correct and was a 4 . Like another reviewer said , it is easier to lie down to put it on , and I was leary about all the hooks . But , it 's pretty easy to get on that way and it feels like the bra is holding you in place well . I jumped up and down a bit and was disappointed at the amount of movement I still felt . I expected the girls to be held firmly in place . But if I went down another size , I would n't be able to breathe . Anyway I hooked myself in and went for my first 5 miles . No chafing ! It feels comfortable and the wide straps keep the bra from digging into your shoulders from the bounce . The bouncing is limited , but not as much as I would have liked so I 'm disappointed in that aspect . But still better than my old sports bras and so far doing their job well . So far they have held up well after washing . I wash and then hang/air dry to try to keep them in good shape , because they are kind of pricey . But so far worth it . By the way I 'm a 40DD .
 The Enell Bra is the best bra for big girls ever !! I started running 3 years ago and could n't find a decent running bra for a plus size women . Every bra I tried chafed , so I would have to Glide up everytime . Then my husband found the Enell bra last year . I have two now and only use these for running . No Glide needed .
 The product was exactly as described , well made and arrived very promptly . The sizing suggested was spot on . Would certainly purchase again .
 I 'm a 36DD ; they are all natural and very heavy . Its difficult to find a sports bra that eliminates the bounce . This is a fantastic bra ! Better than the Jogbra . I will never purchase another kind of sports bra again . Only downside is , it 's not a `` cute '' sports bra . But if support is more important than looks , this is the bra for you .
 I hated it when putting it on . I loved it when I started running in it . Not hot , not uncomfortable and my form has improved without everything moving around . I 'll be buying more Enell in the future .
 I 've read the negative reviews and most of them complain about the bra doing what it 's supposed to do . I wanted to address some of the negatives in the reviews , not to mock or belittle the reviewers , but I think if they knew these things in advance , they either would not have chosen this bra , or would have known what to expect .1 -RRB- `` It 's too tight . '' Yes , it is tight . But I suspect it feels extra tight because we 're just not used to supportive clothing . It is a lot tighter and covers more of your body than a regular bra . If you REALLY ca n't breathe , that 's one thing . But if you order the right size , it will feel incredibly tight at first , but you get used to it . I find I appreciate the support of not only my boobs , but my whole upper body .2 -RRB- `` My back hurts '' Face it . Out posture is horrible . If you 're forced to have good posture , you might hurt for a while because your muscles are weak . Work on those core muscles and it wo n't make your back hurt .3 -RRB- `` The hook and eyes are hard to do . '' Yes , they can be , especially if you 're large enough that the girls get in the way and you ca n't see the bottom ones -LRB- like me -RRB- ! Always start at the bottom , use a mirror if you have to in order to see them . Your girls should be pressed flat against you , not pressed down . You can lie on your back while you put it on , which helps .4 -RRB- `` It gives me uniboob '' , `` It 's not sexy '' , `` You can see the bra line under my shirt '' and `` It shows at the neckline of my t-shirt '' . So ? This is not an everyday fashion bra . This is a serious workout bra . It 's utilitarian . It 's not sexy . It 's there to do a job . When you go to the gym , are you there to show off your cute workout clothes , or there to get fit ? If you do n't like it showing , buy the purple or pink one and act like you meant it to show .5 -RRB- ` It 's too expensive '' . It is expensive . But as long as you do n't lose/gain significant weight that would cause you to need another size , this bra will last FOREVER . Think of it on a cost per use basis . If you exercise just once a week , the bra will cost you less than $ 1.50 per workout . You pay that for a bottled water.This bra WILL stop your girls from bouncing , which is not only painful and unattractive , but can cause breakdown of the tissue , giving you saggy boobs . So if you 've got a large chest but want to run , do aerobics , or whatever , this is a fantastic bra .
 I 've never owned a sports bra that made me feel 100 % confident until now . Having a larger bust , it was much more difficult to participate in high impact activities . This bra gives me the support in all areas without hurting my shoulders and ribs . It comes up higher on your chest to keep everything secure .
 I can run , jump rope with the kids , do aerobics . No jiggling , no wiggling , just a nice firm hold . It is not a hard bulky corset , it is satiny smooth but strong . This is a dynamic sportsbra made to support your boobs during very physical movements , it will not match your victoria secret panties . The support feels good because it 's not like the straps are straining to hold you up . This entire bra has wrap around support . You are free to move around and jump and run without holding your chest . A freedom I have n't had since I was a kid . I am a very frugal person so I was a little reluctant to buy because of the price BUT , it was worth every penny . Size E boobs are hard to contain but this sportsbra gets the job done .
 I started running several months ago and used other sports bras . I had to wear 2 at a time and I still experienced pain due to the bouncing . No more with this sports bra ! -LRB- Make sure to review the Enell website to determine your size -RRB- . The first time I wore my Enell bra I was amazed ! No bounce , no pain-it was awesome !!
 This is the second Enell women 's sports bra that I 've bought . The first one -LRB- 9 months old -RRB- has been worn almost everyday , and has held up remarkably well . No wear and tear noticeable . When I bought my first one , I was only going to walk ; however , after about 2 months , I was able to &#34; wog &#34; -LRB- walk/jog -RRB- with complete confidence knowing I was n't going to have a hassle with straps falling down or it riding up . Even though I 've lost enough weight to warrant another sports bra , I still wear this around the house most days . When it was necessary to buy a smaller one , there was no hesitation as to which one I was going to buy . I highly recommend this sports bra . As a side-note
 I have searched high and low for a good sports bra for my large bust and finally found a keeper with this bra ! It is not pretty by any means but it holds them in tight and limits bounce ! I highly recommend this bra !
 Absolutely love these bras . Was given my first one by a riding friend . What a differance . Would recomend for anyone that is into any sports . Comfortable and excellent support .
 I recommend this for anyone who experiences pain from fibro yet loves to work out . The bra is a little pricey but worth it .
 I love this sports bra ! I have four of them . It 's hard to imagine getting excited about a sports bra , but I 'm a big girl with large breasts that loves to work out . Most sports bras just do n't hold `` my girls '' still . It can be painful and distracting for them to be bouncing around . Most `` motion control '' sports bras work ok as long as I 'm not working out very vigorously . This one works no matter what I 'm doing ... running , jumping on a trampoline , step class or yoga.It 's sort of a cross between a corset and a harness . There are about 15 hook and eyes to hitch up the front . The fit is very snug and it presses your breasts flat against your chest to keep them from moving around . The back is solid and the straps are very wide , so they do n't move around or dig into your shoulders . There are large seams that run across the center of the chest that will show through if you 're wearing a tight fitting shirt . It 's not sexy . It 's functional . And it works really well . I highly recommend it for any active full-figured woman .
 I have used this bra for the last four years for running . My bra size ranges -LRB- depending upon pregnancy and nursing -RRB- from a 36DD to 38G . This is the only bra I can run with . There is no bounce .
 I wear a large bra size -LRB- 46 DDD -RRB- , and have found that it 's nearly impossible to find a good sports bra in my size . Thank goodness I finally discovered Enell . Not only do Enell 's bras come in my size , but the bra actually does what Enell says it will do . I experience minimal bounce , and most importantly , my breasts do not spill out of the top of the bra . I got so sick of adjusting my boobs between reps at the gym ! Enell put an end to that embarrassment . My Enell bra is the most comfortable bra I have ever owned -- sports bra or otherwise . In addition , I 've had it for more than a year now , and it is only experiencing minimal wear -LRB- some mild pilling , but it still supports me just as well as it did when it was new -RRB- . Good fit , wears well , and it 's comfortable too ! You just ca n't go wrong with this bra . : -RRB-
 About a year ago I started doing Dance Dance Revolution -LRB- A dancing game for playstation 2 -RRB- for weight loss . -LRB- lost 50 pounds -RRB- I did have one problem however , I 've never been able to do any kind of aerobics or running because my 44DD would flop around and kill whatever bra I was wearing . I had began wearing TWO sports bra 's which helped but it still was n't exactly what I had hoped for.I saw a review for Enell and how Oprah swears by it . Well that was enough for me to research it and though it was pricey , I decided to give it a shot . I was very skeptical and I found a store 40 miles -LRB- This is how bad I wanted a good bra -RRB- away from me . I gassed up the car and went in person . I wanted to try it on for myself over ordering . I did n't quite know what size I wore , I thought I wore a 2 and while I could get it hooked up the front , I could barely breath and I knew it would drive me nuts . I changed out and went to a 3 perfect ! If you ever wanted the wonder woman -LSB- ... -RSB- that stayed straight ahead while you turned left or right , this is your bra.Enell is made from a soft material that feels almost like satin against your skin . It is n't a sexy bra by any means of the wor but it gets the job done . I can run , I can jump and my hand never gets the urge to grab my bust to hold it in place as it did with my old bras . Enell is worth every cent , I just in fact ordered my second bra.The one negative I can tell you is that it holds your bust together so tightly that you tend to sweat between your cleavage and this can lead to chafing . I usually take it off once I 'm done exercising . If you want it for everyday , maybe go a size larger to avoid that problem.One more thing the Enell does , it holds you in so well it looks as if your bust is about 2 inches smaller . I 've been able to get into once to small shirts after putting on this bra . As a sports bra , it ca n't be beat .
 I love this bra . I am a competitive , thin , fit 44 yo with 34F busts so over the years certain body parts have moved a bit southward and there is a lot of postential for jiggling to outright flopping . In this Enell Sport Bra I can run and jump with no unwanted movement . It is a compreesion bra , so you are going to have a mono-boob , but it is the only bra I can run in that does the job without chafing . And when I am working out hard I 'm a make-upless , hair-puled-back , sweaty mess , so what do I care if I have one compressed motionless boob?Most of the negative reviews of this bra are folks who could n't get into it , so I figured I wuld tell you the easiest way :1 . First put your arms through the arm holes as though you were putting on a vest .2 . Leave your boobs where they are
 I had a hard time choosing between the size 2 and 3 . -LRB- 42 bust and 37 rib cage -RRB- The 3 seemed like the best fit for the rib cage , but I thought I 'd need a 2 to really compress everything . I 'm glad I went with the 3 , because if it were any tighter , and it would probably hurt my rib cage . As it is , it seems just right.When I first put it on , I thought it would n't control bounce enough because it felt just a tad roomy in the top part , but it works ! There 's still some movement , but it does n't hurt at all , and I do n't feel like the breath is being squeezed out of me . In fact , I hardly feel constricted at all , other than in the band around my rib cage , and that part is n't uncomfortable at all . The top and bottom control panels do exactly what the video says -- they minimize bounce . I did several jumping jacks without a problem . It 's really hard to believe that it can do that without being squished too much.It does make you look a little like you 're wearing body armor , and under a shirt it definitely does n't look like you 're wearing a normal bra . But I think it looks fine . It just flattens you , and depending on the fabric you 're wearing you can sometimes see the seam between the top part of the bra and the bottom support . Turbo Kick and the elliptical trainer are n't places to have fashion shows , anyway , though , so I 'm definitely keeping mine.Shipper , OneSweetOne , was also fast . I ordered on a Wednesday , got it on a Tuesday -- one day earlier than indicated.UPDATE Jan 31st 2012 . I wore my bra to a hip-hop aerobics class and it worked great ! We did a lot of jumping around and bouncing , and I enjoyed it more than I 've enjoyed aerobics or dancing in YEARS . I think there 's still a shifting movement in the bra , but I honestly do n't notice it since it 's not impeding my workout . I feel like I have better balance and control as I move .
 I wear a very large bra size , and have been wanting to remain active but could n't find a sports bra . If you can ` hold a pencil ' this bra is for you . Now I am ready to run and play with my kids , maybe even get back into horseback riding . Can be a little tricky to get on the first few times , but well worth the effort
 I am a 38D equestrian that has always had `` bounce '' problems . This bra is the answer . No bounce , ever . Not pretty , not easy to get into and out of , but NO BOUNCE EVER . I 'll buy more when I need them .
 I have searched high n low ... worn two bras ... made my own ... almost did a breast surgery ... then finally met Enell through reading an article on Oprah and something or the other.What caught my attention was that it was being advertised for the very big , small or average.Well i got myself to Amazon -LRB- coz they have never failed me in fifteen years despite living so far away , your packages always reach me in good time.Listen if you are searching and as big as I am ... i mean really 44L then go for Enell and dont look anywhere else.they have changed my whole life in the mornings , i look forward to wearing my clothes again.Thank you , for putting sunshine back into our lives . the reviews that are disapproving of this bra are just the nay sayers of this world who have not suffered trauma as a result of being big breasted.I have bought two and was just stopping by to buy another two.Thank you
 This belt buckle is adorable -- very funny . It 's perfect for a Texas beer/dance hall man .
 I got this for my son for a 6-week camping trip to the Canadian Rockies and rainy Alaska and believe me this little jacket got a workout ! Never a leak , never a split seam . These are fantastic ! The only nit I would pick is that they are not at all warm . If you will be in a place that is cool -LRB- or cold -RRB- , get a size larger so you can wear layers underneath . As a straight rain jacket in warm weather , it 's perfect !
 I love this jacket . I 'm looking forward to using it in the rain.I 'm a woman 's XS and found the boys jackets significantly cheaper priced . It makes a great replacement to a woman 's XS , well-fitted except it is a little baggy around the chest -LRB- length of jacket and sleeps are great -RRB- but nothing significant . If you 're a woman 's XS looking to save some money - definitely recommend it !
 We bought 3 - one for each kid . They 're lightweight , easily compress for stuffing into a book bag , and keep the rain off . They also have held up to the general rough-and-tumble exposure that any child puts clothing through .
 This coat is great ! My son is a large nine-year-old -LRB- about the size of a typical 10 year old -RRB- , and the size Large fit him perfectly , with a little room to grow . It is warm and waterproof . Very sharp looking , too .
 El material esta perfecto , transpirable y completamente impermeable . Excelente producto . solo le falta que le coloquen un bolsillo tipo Napole&oacute;n .
 Great coat ! Well made , light weight , awesome colors . My son is green obsessed and he loves it . Marmot is awesome .
 Love these Jackets . VERY good quality . I bought 2 . Kids stayed warm and DRY . Rolling and going crazy in the snow . Major snowball fights . Jacket worked perfect ! Also thin so we can use during warmer weather too . Packed in the suitcase easy .
 Bag is exactly as described . It 's the quintessential backpack - one large pocket for textbooks , notebooks , laptop , etc. . . and one smaller pocket to store pens and the like . I 'm convinced I 'll be pleased with the durability and functionality for time to come .
 I purchased for a great price . my daughter was looking for this color to match luggage she received .
 my daughter loves this clock . She 's 7 and wanted to start waking up by herself . It works !
 I received the shippment in about three days . The backpack was in perfect condition and it has been very good and stirty.It is very clean and looks good . It might not look like it can fit many books but I 'm a college student and I 'm doing fine with this back pack I definitely recomend this item .
 The backpack came in perfect condition and it came pretty fast . Since it 's new , the first few weeks you need to be brake it in , cuz it 's hard .
 My old back pack was ripping at the seams . I 've only had it for a year , so when it started getting too bad I looked up backpacks here on Amazon . I found the JanSport backpack and bought it after a bit of research . I 'm very happy about my purchase . I love the front pocket . It holds A LOT of stuff . It does n't even look like it would hold so much , but you can just keep piling things in there . The backpack itself also holds a lot . I always saw other people at school with these backpacks and thought they did n't have much in them , because they still looked fairly empty . Now I know that that is just how the back pack is ! Glad I bought this backpack . Very sturdy and a lot more comfortable/compact than my old one .
 Im really glad I chose this bag among the others I saw . I really like it ! No complaints at all !
 You ca n't go wrong with JanSport . Do n't know why but their backpacks last a really long time while the other brands rip and break . My son loves anything camo and this one fit the bill . He loves it and it is very durable . Thrilled that I could get it mid-school year because his old backpack died . Plus it 's original , no one else at school has it ! Highly recommended .
 I bought this backpack for my son for Christmas and he loved it . I had been looking all over for a Jansport backpack that was n't so expensive and I found this one . It is now a couple months later and no complaints . Good deal !
 I bought this pack bag for my high school niece and she loves it ! The size is perfect for her school stuff and the color is pretty .
 Bookpack arrived as expected . My 7 y.o. boy loved the green and black fabric design . It appears durable and plenty large for his needs . Would recommend .
 I got this back pack and use it for school , it is quite nice and stylish . It is made up of very good materials and the stitching is very nice . But I have two complaints , the plastic part that controls the straps is very cheap and I bet it will break easy and the material is good but kind of thin not that good when it rains . But over all very good product I recommend you should buy it .
 I looked around for a backpack for quite a while and this was the cheapest one I could find . Despite it being the cheapest , Jansport will always be my favorite brand . The quality is excellent and it 's perfect for traveling or carrying books around .
 I owned one of these for over 10 years . It went through college with me and was big enough for all of my books , etc. . Post college , my son used it for school and during it all , it went traveling with us several times a year . I probably would still have it and use it for travel except that on one of those trips , I parked my car across from the Air & Space Museum in D.C. and someone broke in . All they took was my pack and a knit cap ... so even the homeless -LRB- ? -RRB- know a good pack when they see it . They left all kinds of electronic games they could have sold for some dough !
 In these days and times backpacks , bookbags , etc have become so outlandish . This is a classically styled all american backpack . No bells , no whistles , just a good ole standbye bag ! Hard to find now-a-days .
 I love this bag because it is light and roomy . However after laying it on the concrete a few times , it has 2 small holes at the bottom because the bag is so thin . I got my money 's worth , but will look for something with a leather bottom if you lay your bag on the ground at all .
 This backpack is very large inside . It is the third year I am using this brand and style . Being a girl I have to have a new color every year . This one is green . I like the color , it 's very vibrant . Last years ' was pink and though it was durable , it got dirty too easy and had to be washed quite often . Yes , I wash it in the washer on gentle cycle and hang to dry . It can hold all of my school books , but I 'm thankful that I do n't have to bring them all at once . Front zipper pocket is very large and holds my pen pouch , a small purse , and cd player . All around great backpack and it 's washable , what more could you ask for ?
 I think this backpack was so amazing to me because I used it from 2nd grade to 7th grade and I still have it now . I happen to love rainbow , so I chose the color of `` Peace Out . '' You Can Fit almost anything in there and the backpack can fit into almost anywhere . I definetly recommend it to anyone , any age is perfect . I want to keep this backpack for a long time . But best of all , if you want to keep it forever , the colors never fade out . So you will still notice the colors even ten years after you purchased it . I think I will definetly buying more things from Amazon . At least I 'll be sure it will last a very long time.Horray for Amazon !!!!!
 This bookbag is amazing . i love the whole look of it , and the style , and the fact that it can hold a lot of my books and papers and what not . It 's great . . thanks amazon for the speedy delivery too .
 It 's got ta be good if 4 months of school passed and there are no rips , tears or broken zippers ... especially if it belongs to one of my kids !
 I purchased this backpack for my 6th grade daughter . Many of the girls in her class are also toting this pack in the various designs available . As a parent it 's great to have purchased something at a resonable price that is highly in fashion and is of excellent quality . This is the first year she has not requested a new backpack within the first month of school .
 After trying many different daypacks , this one is definitely the best one if weight is a problem . Many backpacks have so much padding that the bag is already somewhat heavy before you even put your books and other things in them . I 've given away countless bags due to the weight issue , until I found this basic JanSport . Another added bonus
 With 5 sons attending school , backpacks are a large financial investment each year . We have learned through trial and error that Jansport is one of the best investments that you can make in backpacks . The zippers last , and believe me we have had our share of wimpy zippers . The material is completely durable , washable and can withstand a lot of experiences . We love the SuperBreak backpack , for the great price and functionality . You ca n't go wrong with Jansport !
 Although I had offered her several other brands of backpacks similar in price , my daughter was insistent that we purchase a Jansport bag . I now see why ... This bag is just right for carrying several of her textbooks back and forth to school . The straps rest comofortably on her shoulders without being bulky . The fabric and the constructions appears to be well thought-through and well-made , ready to endure the abuse that my daughter will certainly wreck up her new backpack . She tells me that she expects this bag to last through the last two years of high school on into college . I believe , after actually seeing the pack in person , she may be right ! : -RRB-
 Yea this backpacks basically perfect . Its comfortable and portable its the perfect size and it holds alota stuff definitely a good school backpack .
 The product is simple and such a classic . Will never go out of style !! Durable and easy to use/clean . Highly recommend for college students . Jansport also provides a lifetime guarantee for their products . Got it fast from the seller !
 I bought this bag for my son . . He likes the fit as it is compact and not bulky . . Plus the colours are cool !!
 Jansport has always been a favorite of mine . In fact , I do n't think I have ever purchased any other brand backpack ! I could n't quite afford the suede bottom style this time , so I ordered this one , and it is just as good . Of course , I got it in my favorite color . The Electric Purple is even more vibrant in person . It 's a gorgeous color . This is the best deal that I found on the internet .
 This is like the 10th Jansport SUperbreak backpack I have bought and loved them all the time . . Sometimes the colors are not the same as perceived online but they are fine nonetheless ... I reccommend this product . . I am a fan of Jansport backpacks all day everyday . Super strong . Always look to buy it from seller Amazon first .
 This item was listed as being instock . I chose this item over others because I needed it within a week -LRB- according to the listing that was possible . After I paid for the item I received an email stating it was out of stock and would be delaied for one week . Beware is all I can say .
 I ordered this backpack for my son . The pack we received does n't look like the photo at all , not so many stars and the other graphic looks like polka dots ! But good construction otherwise .
 I like Jansports backpack because it is made very strong and light weight . Also Jansports has excellent lifetime warranty .
 As expected , I had this same backpack a few years ago but lost it . I 'm glad I purchased a replacement as I 've used it for college , camping , carrying photos for meet & greets for celebrities and much more . It 's made very high quality .
 I love this book-bag . Small , durable , and looks really nice.Would recommend to anyone that 's in college or high school .
 I purchased this for my son and he loves it . I purchased it because of the Jansport name and I am very pleased with quality of the backpack . Would highly recommend .
 My sister earned some cash for doing some yard work , and decided to spend it on this backpack . When it came in she said she loved the color . It looks durable . After a period of about a month , she has been using this backpack and it is still in great shape . It fits everything she needs in it . Jansport is a great brand , I have a Jansport backpack myself .
 I got the white one came brand new in sealed bag so it was still white . Very hard to keep clean but im older wouldnt reccommend white for a child . Very durable simple bag . I throw mine in washer no probAny questions just ask-Bee
 This back pack was a good value for the money and came in time for my daughter to take it to college even though we ordered it at the last minute .
 The backpack is great . My boyfriend uses it for school everyday . It 's managed to carry a couple of heavy textbooks as well .
 All I ever used in HS were JanSport backpacks . They served me well then and the one I ordered off of Amazon is working great for me in college . Fits my 2 college books , binder , calculator , vitamins , water bottle . Anything I want to throw in there fits ! I am very happy with my purchase .
 The book bag is perfect for a 9 year old , I chose it for my son , he is very happy with it . It 's light , cool , and tough.I really recomended for any one .
 I did a lot research on those backpacks , I was first settled with jansport right pack , but after looking at my pal 's superbreak I decide to get that one . Right pack is just long , not much of a impact on volume , just long ... I settled with Dark French Gray because I havent seem anyone use it in school , it arrived today with nice package , the fabric feels strong , and it look bigger than the photos . I can put in
 this bag was just what i was looking for and it came really fast with just regular standard mail .
 This product was shipped fast and in perfect condition . I bought it for a Christmas present for my daughter and she really loved it . They had a great selection .
 My daughter was looking for a turquoise and brown backpack . This was exactly what she wanted . It has great quality at a great value . We received our order very fast .
 The product was just as described and it works wondefully . I recommend this product !
 i use this bag while attending classes in college and it is perfect for all my needs .
 I always liked JanSport bags for their durability . I bought one for my husband 5 years ago . He uses it to go back and forth from work , to rock concerts and when we go rock climbing .
 So far , this has been a great backpack for my daughter . It is very strong & durable and she loves the pattern . Unfortunately she brings a lot of heavy items home from school on a daily basis and her last backpack strap tore because it could n't handle the weight . However this new Jansport backpack seems like it will hold up for a long time . Love it !!
 I was looking for a backpack for a three week vacation to Cambodia , Vietnam , and Thailand.It may not be the right bag for travel but it was cheap , simple , durable , and met my needs.I did n't want a big backpacking type bag with many pockets that would be too heavy to carry when full or at risk of having things stolen . This one had adequate storage for my electronics to keep my iPhone4S alive in all sorts of places , some clothing for the unexpected temperature changes , toiletry bag , bug spray , and sunscreen.I also had the ability add a flexible Master Lock to secure all three zipper tabs.Overall it came back home like brand new .
 Got this for my son 's first year in High School & it 's exactly what he wanted . It 's the standard Jansport . Heavy duty & durable , no frills .
 Purchased for my daughter , and she likes it . Roomy enough to carry her books . Quality seems pretty good , I hope it will last .
 I 'm in high school and this backpack , although it looks small , works just fine for me . I carry 2 1.5 inch binders , and 3 textbooks comfortably . It 's easy to access the pouch in the front and is the perfect size to fit in a locker if needed .
 Good size for school , cute pattern and adjustable stripes . Love it ! Must be really cool for school . Fair prices as well : D
 I got the BlueStreak back pack . It fits all my necessary college text books and notebooks . What more do you need ? Its durable and it also comes with a LIFE TIME warranty . It just takes like 3min to fill out on their website . So 5 stars for me .
 As my daughter said , she has plenty rooms for her books and she 's very happy with the style , the color . It 's worth to buy . She said she loves it so much and would use it for long time . Thanks
 Purchased two of these for my high school age daughter . So far so good , it seems to be made well and the color is great .
 Thanks for the great service . The shipment was done very quickly and the bag arrived even sooner than expected!I was impressed . .
 I bought this backpack for my daughter in high school and it fits it 's purpose . It 's a really nice purple color , sturdy , and fits all her books . She loves it , and the best thing was it was priced reasonable . Great product , fast shipping and I plan to order again next year !
 Because of the price , it is good enough . But it seems not be able to carry heavy stuff , the skin is so thin .
 i hadnt used a backpack since middle school , but my large shoulder purse/bag was hurting my shoulder so i finally convinced myself to get a backpack . jansport is awesome , it got here in time and my 15.6 laptop fits in it , their warranty is a major reason why i also decided to go with them . plus its a great color
 Not really much to say about a backpack other than it holds items in it . 2 zippers for the big pocket and 1 zipper for the little one . Very roomy and never had it open up accidentally .
 Just what my daughter wanted ! She loves the classic look of JanSport . I love the durability . They last a long time .
 I have used it for more than 1 month and i am so satisfied with it . the color is beautiful
 I liked it . It 's just it 's not as good as the old jansport bags . The skin of the bag is not as thick as the old ones . But over all its nice and will recommend to other people
 I bought this bookbag for my son for school . He loves the color and so far it 's holding up well .
 seems to be holding up really well - had it for about 3 months . The colors are great and it 's unique .
 This is a durable backpack not too small and not too large . It does appear to hold my 15 inch macbook pro laptop in it with a few books but it seems like the bottom fabric is under stress when I do so therefore I am using it just for the books which it does just fine .
 I love it , so good comfortable affordable price and nice shape for me for any of college student . I am suggesting you to buy . .
 Exactly what I was looking for !! The perfect present for someone who loves the color orange !! She loves it and was so happy !!
 Nice backpack for my elementary school child . Only two pockets which is much better than a lot of the backpacks out there . With too many pockets he was always losing things . It fits him well and hopefully will last a long time .
 Classic bag you ca n't go wrong with . This bag is black and grey -LRB- forge grey -RRB- . The straps are black and the part of the bag that sit 's on your back is also black -LRB- you do n't see the black part of the bag when its on your back -RRB- . The rest of the bag is a nice neutral grey . This is a great quality bag at a great price . Amazon sells this bag for at the very least , $ 10 cheaper than any other store . If your looking for a new bag that lasts ... this is the one . I 'm replacing my old jansport that lasted me approx . 10 + years . Great investment .
 We bought this for our daughter 's birthday and she uses it daily , it stands up to her packing it full and dragging it around . It is very durable .
 I 've had my JanSport backpack in black for about 6 years now . It 's gotten me through High School and now my first year of college . It has carried things from clothes to about 30lbs . of textbooks for school and it 's still in prestine condition . Buy these backpacks people ! They wo n't let you down ! = D
 My son is very happy with it . He was using a Swiss Army pack , prefers this one .
 I bought this Jansport backpack for my daughter after the one her grandmother got her for school broke . I always bought jansports in the past for my cousins and little sister and so on ... I love the fact of the life time warrenty ! If it ever breaks or rips it just gets sent back and either fixed or replaced ... what more could you ask for ! And the backpack is as described ! My daugther loves it and never wants another one ... well for now anyhow ... lol
 This backpack is everything a backpack should be ; simple , functional , and well-fitting . I would undoubtedly buy it again , although it seems as though it will be holding up for a long time to come .
 Excellent quality for a reasonably priced backpack ! If you want a simple backpack without the frills and on a low budget , this is your backpack . Backpacks can be expensive , and children from K-6 do n't need a complicated-many-pocket backpacks . It 's just enough for their things they need to store , and it is not huge or big on the child . It 's a well made !
 the color is great !! and the bag is well packed . very satisfied with this itemso lucky to buy such a good stuff with a good price
 Good backpack for a great price . Daughter is still using it with no complaints . Product looks like the picture in color and design .
 This bag is a nice , simple bag with few pockets . Not useful for carrying a laptop , but it is a reliable brand .
 My daughter wanted white so she could draw on it . It is a nice purchase and no problems with it.JanSport Classic SuperBreak Backpack
 it was worth a money . i would recomment anyone to buy this . good . It was very nice and comfortable and durable .
 This backpack is excellent . The color is even better than it is in the picture . It 's closer to a purplish magenta than a pure purple . The back and straps are more of a violet . It 's very cool looking . However , while well-made the canvas is a little lightweight . No problems yet though . God , it 's cool .
 Perfect condition , exactly how it looks in the picture . it is everything i imagined and more . spacious , yet small . pretty , yet simple . love it !
 It was a excellent purchase.It have lots of room inside.It is very resistant.I love the material print.I highly recoommend this backpack .
 I bought this to carry my folders , notebooks , and occasional texts for my freshman year in college . It looks fairly small on the outside but has enough room to hold four folders , four one-subject notebooks , a 32-oz water bottle , a two-inch thick binder , and two 500 page books . The small pocket in the front is good for pens/pencils and anything you do n't want to lose track of in the main compartment.I 've been using the bag every weekday for almost a month now and it is n't showing any signs of wear yet -LRB- which is more than I can say for other backpacks -RRB- . The colors are bright but not overly dramatic -LRB- Black Cabesa Blue Perry Plaid -RRB- . My only complaint is that the padded part of the straps feel like they 're a bit high . Maybe it should be a little longer ? Either way , it 's still a perfectly good backpack and not uncomfortable at all .
 it value its price.you know the fabric is not so thick as I imagined and the design of it is simple.It can hold my sony laptop which is enough for me.I recommand it to the school girls or boys.The bag can hold one laptop and three books or if you like you can put the pet dog in it .
 Service and products both nice , material is good quality and product reach on time ziplock use very good quality I 'm really like it
 i did give this 4 stars as i remember these being larger when i was in high school but maybe i got bigger . Quality stitching and craftsman ship i ordere one about 6months ago as a gift and it looked to have been cut with a box knife but i didnt notice till after it was to late to return as it stayed in box till i wrapped it to gift so inspect yours well other than that quick deleivery and good product
 so it only has one main pocket which can make it difficult for more tha one textbok along with notebooks and binders however is pretty hardy . Doesnt look axactly as the picture advertises though . the blue strips dont go directly across but its still really cute .
 This backpack was great and withstood heavy weights and use every day . In school , it held up all of my books -LRB- which was a lot -RRB- and it did n't hurt my back -LRB- I trek 2 miles everyday -RRB- . I chose to buy an orange backpack . It got nasty and black on the bottom pretty fast . I would suggest a darker shade . Overall , very good !! Zippers did NOT jam .
 My son is rough with his backpacks and this one is tough and still looks like new . The grey and black colors are really popular at his school so this one looks great as well .
 I RECEIVED MY BAG WITHIN A WEEK AND HALF AND I AM CURRENTLY WORKING IN AFGHAISTAN . IT IS N'T TOO BIG OR SMALL AND STURDY ENOUGH TO LAST OUT HERE . GOOD BAG FOR THE PRICE .
 Always lasts for years with my tough High School Teens!Last one lasted my son 3 years and that was part Middle school too!Worth the extra $ $ $ $ $ $ to save in the long run!Love this product .
 I liked my new backpack a lot . The colors are beautiful and the orginiser pocket is the best.Thanks a lot
 My daughter is not easy on her stuff this back is great strong and durable I highly recommend worth the extra $
 This is a great backpack it has plenty of space for all my stuff .
 The bookbag was exactly what I was looking for . It was so easy to find on amazon , and inexpensive . It come quickly , and was in perfect condition .
 I ordered this backpack as a temporary solution . I thought it was cheap -LRB- $ 20 item , around $ 10 shipping -RRB- , but now I realize it is n't . Maybe I will start with the negative aspect of the product
 This backpack is very soft cloth . Not what you 'd think of a back pack as being , but I find it works a lot better . Its more like a sack . Because of the material its made of , it conforms easier to larger items , such as books and lunch boxes and purses . I 'll buy another just like it when school starts again , just so she 'll have a choice .
 hello , this bag is excelent you can chose from over like 40 colors instead of the usuall , black , navyblue -LRB- well the black is pretty cool it is the one i am buying -RRB- it can store alot verrrrrrrrry confortable even if you are hualing alot of wieght = D
 The pattern on the backpack is really cool . I bought this backpack because it does not have a plain jane color design , I wanted something different .
 My last JanSport lasted me about 5 years , and that was after I had found it used . I expect the same out of this one , and they 've improved a lot of the design as well . Plus the new exteriors are great .
 Speedy delivery and I loved the bag . Very practical and sturdy . Protects books even in the rain ! And is strong enough to carry all my stuff .
 I ordered two of these for my kids for Christmas , they look way cuter in person than in the photo . I hope that Jansport still has the same great quality as they did when I was kids . So far so good .
 Ca n't go wrong with JanSport . Good backpack - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 I bought mine when I started to study again . I always wanted one , and it exactly what I was looking for . I love mine .
 My son loves his backpack ! His old bookbag was a JanSport bookbag that he had for years -LRB- about 6 to be exact -RRB- . They are durable , fashionable , washable , and last longer than other brands that I have purchased . Due to my son being in middle school , he needed a durable backpack that could take on the weight of multiple school textbooks . He can get all of his supplies in it too , so that 's why I rated the backpack like I did .
 i love it , im very happy , the backpack is for my daugther and she is very happy , i like very much the color
 The price is suitable . And it looks like pretty . It is big enough for me to carry my books in whole day .
 I am a college student and I bought this bag to be easier on my back for when I have to run around campus . It is the perfect size to hold all my notebooks and my iPad , and it is extremely comfortable . I love this brand .
 I 've been using this backpack since my 2nd semester of college and it has been holding up very well . I just wish it had more padding though .
 Someone else in my school even had this backpack I recommend for middle school . Its awesome . I got the purple/blue zebra one .
 Jansport backpacks are always lightweight and durable . The one i got in middle school lasted me until mid high school and its still laying around . I bought this blue streak color for my brother and its spacious enough to carry four thick textbooks and his notebooks for all 6 subjects . The strap has good padding so it wont leave marks on your shoulders . It only has two zippers but its more than enough . The color is somewhat bright but can be used by both guys and girls . There was a tag that came with the backpack saying that it has a lifetime warranty . Not sure about the terms and conditions but i doubt ill be using it . Overall it is a good backpack and i would recommend it for school use . Its durable enough and wont rip easily . I used to put mine on the classroom floor and it never got scraped or ripped , just dusty .
 I bought this backpack because it was about $ 20 dollars cheaper than what they sell it for in stores . I am a junior in high school and I wanted to carry my books around in a backpack rather than a tote bag that I usually carry . I have to say that the straps are rather uncomfortable even with just a few books in it . My shoulders were sore while carrying it just within the distance of me walking home from my bus stop -LRB- 1 block -RRB- . I never had this problem with my oakley backpack ... but for the price I ca n't really complain . I pretty much traded comfortableness for the looks . I wanted a small backpack to carry around through the hallways in school too and my oakley was just too big for that purpose . All in all , this backpack is great for just carrying books . It 's a small , plain , original Jansport backpack . It fits multiple textbooks and notebooks , -LRB- but beware of putting strain on your shoulders with the more books you add -RRB- ... just do n't plan on using it for hiking . Overall , I give this backpack 5 stars because I could n't ask for more of the backpack for the price of $ 22 bucks . It gets the job done .
 I bought this backpack for my brother and from the moment that he took it to school all he can say is that he loves his backpack and that everyone at school wants it , both girls and boys are begging to buy it off of him . It 's not too big nor too small , and can easily carry what is needed for middle school and high school .
 The bag is small in size and thinner than most jansport bags but serves its purpose and seems sturdy for the price . I got it with free shipping so made the purchase worth it .
 I got this for my daughter and she loved it , she got tons of compliments on it.It is kind of thin fabric , but it sure has hold up to the test , we are pretty ruff with it , and it is like new .
 I like the bag b/c it resembled one that I had before . This one seems to be a lot smaller but I it serves the purpose as to why I had purchased it .
 I love my backpack ! I use it everyday because I carry a lot of stuff and it 's so easy to carry , so comfy ! It 's super resistant ! It 's the best backpack ever !
 I really enjoy that I found this bag here , since the heiny color Superbreak is discontinued I believe . The bag shipped quickly too . Standard free shipping and it arrived in about three days . They 're trustworthy .
 I bought this for my third grader and it 's the perfect size . The material is very lightweight , but seems to be strong enough . The padding in the back and on the shoulder straps is sufficient . My daughter loves the bright colors .
 the backpack came in perfect condition and arrived faster than anything I have ordered from amazon before . ******
 The bag looks baby blue on the internet but its really green but it looks nice still . My niece loves it .
 Great product . Shipping was fast and product is exactly what was advertised . Highly recommend
 It holds everything my daughter needs for school and looks classy and not `` loud '' . Quality looks very good , her other JanSport lasted for 3 years ! It is a good buy .
 I HAVE PURCHASED SEVERAL BACKPACKS FOR MY 14 YEAR OLD SON . TYPICALLY , WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME UNDER MY SON 'S DAILY USE , THEY FALL APART . THIS BACKPACK HAS NOT ONLY WITHSTOOD THE TEST OF MY SON 'S HEAVY SCHOOL BOOKS , TOSSING AROUND ON THE BLACKTOP , ETC. , BUT THE LITTLE COMPARTMENTS ARE GREAT TO EASILY ACCESS HIS PHONES AND GADGETS !! HIGHLY RECOMMEND !
 delightful back pack just what i wanted . just a little thin on the fabric . colors very good hope it hold up for a long time
 I was looking for a backpack for my fiance to have for her classes . And this pack is great for her because its small and yet can hold all her books for class .
 I 've used these backpacks for years , and I 've only owned two so far . I like that it looks simple . It does n't have too many unnecessary pockets . I sling this over my right shoulder to keep from being pickpocketed during my commute . My current backpack has been used for maybe four years , and it 's still going strong . It has enough support padding on the straps , but could use some padding on the back for heavier things to carry . This is n't a big deal since I do n't like bringing a lot of stuff in my bag too often . Classic backpack . Would recommend .
 I love it . . the quality is great too . . small and nice looking . . perfect for high school students.fits about 2 textbooks . . perforated pockets in the smallest pocket -LRB- the one in front -RRB- . .
 JanSport is always a great product and very durable . This was bought for my son in college . I personally think it was too small for a college student . But since his classes were spread out , he only needed to carry 1-2 books at a time ; so it did n't matter anyway . Great product though !
 Try finding a decent packback in March . My daughter needed to replace her backpack during the school year and this is perfect . We tried all the local stores but they had no selection . So of course we looked to Amazon and bought this backpack . We are very pleased .
 This is just what I was looking for for my son . He 's rough with his stuff so I got him this and it 's working out well . It can handle being lugged around everyday without any issue . It has a `` cool '' design which he loves . Highly recommended .
 Bought 2 years ago and still it looks like new . I love this stylish design and from time to time I get compliments about how coll my backpack is .
 I was looking for a basic backpack for my daughter that is smaller than the one she uses for all of her school items for a trip to Europe . This pack fit the specs perfectly . It is a good size for walking around all day , is sturdy , and the front pouch gives her easy access to small items . The pack is made with both a sturdy zipper and strong material . It also is perfect for carry on . I was happy to see that basic backpacks are still available .
 For as long as I can remember I have wanted a JANSPORT BACKPACK . In middle school everybody had them . They were great because they were lightweight , relatively inexpensive , and had just enough room for what one might need . However , growing up , who usually buys your school stuff , your parents , so that was that . Fortunately , I needed one for bicycling , -LRB- running around town or whatever , going to the mall , shopping , etc. -RRB- and finally decided to get one . The idea behind buying a YELLOW one was , -LRB- if you 've ever bicycled in traffic before , then you would understand . The brighter and more visual you are , the greater your chances of being seen.This backpack appears small , but looks are deceiving . It 's quite roomy , even for athletic gear , as I discovered by putting a pair of Reebok leather hi tops in the main compartment , two books , a lunch bag , and my wallet , and that was just in the main compartment ! I have n't tried the smaller front compartment , but I 'm sure this is just fine as well . The straps are comfortable , maybe not as comfortable as other packs , but for the price , you ca n't beat this one . I also love the fact too about the brighter colored packs , if you 're biking in traffic on a sunny day , believe me , after trying it out , the sun will catch the nylon in which JANSPORT backpacks are made out of , -LRB- at least the SuperBreak ones -RRB- . Overall , definitely worth the money . I would n't recommend to somebody who has to use it every single day carrying more than 25-30lbs of books . But , if you 're looking for something for college use , community college , night school , running errands , exploring , whatever along these lines , this I would recommend . I get looks when I have this on , -LRB- are people staring at the backpack because they 've never seen a yellow one before or are they just in awe over it ? I have no idea , as long as I 'm safe & comfortable with it on me -RRB- .
 This year , I am glad I decided to buy a backpack for my kid that looks great and wo n't fall apart on him . The cheapo , $ 15 Wal-mart bags do n't look nearly as nice , and never last us more than a few months . This size is perfect for a few folders , a couple books , and a lunchbox .
 i got this bag in september for school and it is very durable , good looking , and i do n't have an issue with the size of it . i love jansport backpacks and amazon made it easier for me to enjoy them !
 Jansport is still popular and `` trendy . '' Not because everyone has it , but because the quality of it . This is my third jansport backpack . They do n't rip easily for up to years , zipper is well made and durable . Comfort is always great , and the classic two zip pockets never get old . Amazons always good w receipts and shipping .
 MY DAUGHTER BOUGHT THIS BAG FOR SCHOOL . IT IS A GREAT COLOR AND VERY LARGE AND STURDY . SHE HAS A LOT OF HEAVY BOOKS AND IT IS HOLDING UP VERY WELL .
 My 7 year old LOVES this back pack , It is very sturdy and holds all her stuff and is not too big . Love the zebra print too !
 Bought this for my 11year old son just starting Middle School -- looks and is as stated on the description . Works fine for school back pack purposes !
 I especially love the color of this backpack , it is very cute , however since this backpack only has two pockets it does not have a lot of space for textbooks . Other than the space issue it is a very nice backpack .
 very satisfied with school bag and binder . . good quality and material . . everthing fits in the binder nice and neatly and without it being extremly oversized . love it
 Its very comfy to wear . I wore it for 2 + hours on the back of a motorcycle with presents inside and it was n't uncomfortable at all . It even rained and got dirty , but nothing inside got wet and the dirt just brushed off the backpack . Plus the color is perfect , exactly like in the photo ! Totally recommend !
 At first when I received this backpack I was a little taken aback with just how thin and light it was . I admit that I thought it would be shortlived . I bought this for my son in elementary school , and anyone who has young juds know they live to destroy things . I 've had to replace backpacks every year like clockwork , and around this time -LRB- about 5 months into the school year -RRB- I would start to notice tear , splitting seams and broken zippers . This backpack is pristine , not a single sign of wear . I 'm beginning to think I may get away without having to replace his backpack this year . As far as the unit is concerned , the colors are a lot more vibrant than the pictures indicate . Its a georgeous backpack with brilliant white , skyblue and black colors . It definitely stands out . Inside it 's very spacious in both the main compartment and smaller accessory compartment.Overall its a good unit and I would not hesitate to buy it again , in fact I think I 'm gon na get one for myself as well .
 Wow , i really love this one , it 's a perfect one.it 's so strong ; it can hold a lot of book . You should buy this : D
 I bought this for my kid sister at the beginning of the semester and she loved it because I also gave her a package of fabric markers . It let her personalize it without it looking tacky . It is now December and it is holding up great .
 Perfect for school or for travel . Best backpack I have ever bought . The corduroy stays clean and is perfect for a carry on .
 well i ordered this back in 2009 and man its so sturdy i still use it now i hasnt really shown a sign of and damage nothing falling apart and i throw my backpack around everywhere at home the floor at school its shoved in lockers blah blah blah i really do love this backpack it is really great and it isnt bootleg if its bootleg then the small pocket of the back packs zipper is on the leftso bootleg backpack = small pocket zipper opens from left nd in this picture it starts on the right and the jansport is blue and yupp not bootleg i guarentee you
 I bough this guy as a replacement for my old jansport backpack that died after about seven years -LRB- I tend to destroy things -RRB- . I use this for everyday use in college . I like the design , but most importantly I picked jansport because their products tend to last a long time . It 's a great backpack . I 'd recommend it especially if you like no-nonense backpacks like I do .
 honestly happy to have found this at lowest price then anywhere else , I purchased it for my son for school and he has no complaints .
 Jansport backpacks are well made and are always a fan of students . All of my 4 children have this backpack in varying colors and they all are happy with how they function and how they look .
 I regret not getting one of these for high school , I still would have trashed it eventually , but it would have lasted til I graduated . I 've been using it for college for years and it still looks like new . It 's in such good shape I could probably sell it once I get through my education . I love that water beads off the material , too . I never have to worry about my homework getting wet in the rain .
 It is an amazing backpack that is affordable for the quality . You 're getting a nice Jansport backpack that holds books and a laptop . The smaller pocket holds various pens and highlighters.If you are a college student looking for something to get you to class and back , this is a great backpack . I love the gray simply because it is something different yet sleek .
 This backpack was just what my daughter wanted . The only issue was that the Jansport label was placed directly on the face of the humming bird so we removed it .
 I bought this for my sister for Christmas , she actually specifically asked for this color in a jansport backpack.She loved it when she opened it on Christmas morning !!
 I always own jansport in high school now I am in college decided to buy this again and it seem pretty cool overall . Nothing wrong with it used it for few months and still holds up great
 My son loved it . Sturdy , yet lightweight backpack . Great color and good quality , just what you 'd expect from a Jansport product .
 muy buen producto los recomiendo , fue enviado en el tiempo ofrecido y muy bien empacado , el producto es bueno muchas gracias
 I love backpacks so much very useful when I 'm in school in like five textbooks and my binders.This is my favorite backpack .
 Very cute and good price too ! I do n't know why this design is so cheap while some other solid colors are like $ 50 !
 I purchased this backpack last semester as my laptop bag simply was n't cutting it anymore . First off , I will say that this backpack is well made . The material is very tough and seems like it would take years of abuse to even begin to wear . As stated in the title , I found the blues to be of a deeper shade than depicted in the photo ; however , this turned out to be a good thing because I ended up liking the deeper colors better anyway . Just something to note if you are super set on the color shown . The main pouch of the backpack easily fit my usual compliment of overpriced textbooks -LRB- three 500 pagers -RRB- and two 2.5 &#34; binders . The front pouch provided ample room for a few packs of pencils and headphones , etc. . To sum it up , this is an awesome looking backpack at a killer price . I have received many compliments . The quality is great and the material is top notch . You wo n't be disappointed !
 Am very satisfied , I love this swag product ;-RRB- am from Algeria and I am very happy with this magic back pack thank you amazon
 this is a purchase of exactly what i thought i was buying ... sturdy , fashionable , color matches the look in person . . attractive print
 This item is exactly what I wanted and it works perfectly . I would buy it again . And it shipped very fast too .
 We have to source them from the US , but they are a great schoolbag . Light and strong . Great fabric.Highly recommended .
 Bought this about two yrs ago . I have to walk across campus all the time -LRB- and my campus is HUGE -RRB- . The shoulder straps are comfortable , It does n't rip easily , and it can carry a good amount of books , computer , etc. . Easy to wash , and is pretty sturdy . I love it.Cons
 My grandson is tough on backpacks . My granddaughter had asked for a new JanSport backpack for Christmas , and that request was handed off to her aunt . Auntie said she still had the JanSport she used in college , and still used it regularly ! I thought if it was that sturdy maybe it would be good for my grandson , too . And the variety of colors and prints and plaids is so great ! So I got him the Red Riff Bomber Plaid because it looked like a 13 year old boy 's sort of print - and he loves it . So far no rips and tears , the zippers are still stitched in place and still work - and he 's proud to be seen carrying it . Five stars are well earned !
 It looks nice its not to flashy so people wont feel to overwhelmed lol its perfect for college SWAG ! AWESOME
 I purchased this for my husband , and he loves that it is so simple . It fits lots of books/notebooks but it could use more pockets
 Its a simple Jansport bag . In the front pocket it has three slots for writing utensils and space for other small items such as lotion , hand sanitizers , calculator , etc. . The main portion of the bag is just one compartment . It can carry two of my 2.5 &#34; thick textbooks and my laptop comfortably . . . Good buy .
 The Original black Jansport backpack is a classic . I have an old one that still has not broken after at least seven years . My boyfriend liked mine so much that I got him one , too . It 's big enough to hold a good amount of stuff -LRB- especially books -RRB- and has a couple compartments inside the front pocket , but there are n't too many pockets .
 The backpack was very good , however , it was packed in a box that was wayyyy to big and i have to incurred additional charges since it was shipped out of the US to the Caribbean . I will really like it if you guys can send make your packages much smaller . ThanksRemo .
 La mejor mochila para un estudiante , muy c&oacute;moda y el precio vale la calidad que compras tengo otra desde hace mas de 10 anios y sinceramente eh abusado de ella y aun sigue aguantando .
 Very nice and fun to take to school I would definitely recommend it to my friends and family . You should buy more than one . Woot woot !!
 Basic back pack elegant color I really enjoy having this back pack to take my groceries and this was the purpose , so it 's perfect . The plus is that this gray color is pretty elegant and I can go other places before food shopping and it does n't affect my looks . I think the price is great as well , smart choice !
 Gave this as a birthday present to a young friend , who reports that it is very pretty , and holds all her school things . Probably very similar to the JanSport backpacks of my younger days , but in more modern colors .
 Best prices anywhere around for these super trendy and stylish packs all the kids want today . I mean under $ 15.00 is what I paid right before Christmas for a super cute one for my daughter . Quality is as expected from this brand , which I always have viewed Jansport as durable and made for use and abuse without ripping or fraying etc. , not a cut rate discount item sold for cheaper because it is defective or flawed . 5 stars all the way around !!
 this backpack was well worth the price . it 's a bit thin , but it 's really light and comfortable even when you 're carrying around tons of books . the front pocket has lots of storage room and although this backpack looks small , it has lots of space . i 'd get this again if i needed . great backpack ! u wo n't go wrong buying this
 I 've always liked Jansport brand backpacks . They weigh absolutely nothing and this is kind to my back and the extra padding in the straps is nice , too . The material and stitching is always far superior to other brands.I love the new fabrics they are making these out of ! I got the Black Tattoo Love and simply adore it . I can feel the eyes on my backpack when I go out in public . It 's cool to have a unique backpack .
 I 've used Jansport backpacks for years and the quality is great . I wanted to find a rare color so I purchased it in Light Purple Passion and love it ! The color was slightly different as I thought the strap/padding part of it was black but it turned out to be a dark violet & the strings to the zipper were striped not solid . Even though it was n't the same as shown -LRB- not really a good thing -RRB- I ended up liking it better than the sample picture .
 I can not leave it at home since I bought it . It became my everyday friend . Not big , not small , just the best size and beautiful .
 Got this bag for my sister , who loved it ! Recommend these bags and this seller as well .
 My son selected this bag though I wanted him to take other model . He loved it sooo much . It is light one and very comfortable for his back . All his friends liked it .
 This is a great standard backpack , simple and sturdy . My kids do n't need iPod ports and tons of little pockets ; generally those go unused . Maybe when they 're all older ... I do like the huge variety of colors and fabrics . My daughter loves the pattern and how it is unique . I wish Jansport was cheaper , but then again when I do buy cheaper backpacks , the zippers break and the seams unravel . Recommended for all !
 This is my favorite backpack . It never fails me ... even though I do n't think a backpack can ...
 This backpack , although it took a long time to ship , is great . The materials are very sturdy and the zippers are great . It is an overall greak backpack .
 Not a whole lot to say . Classic JanSport backpack in black . Solid construction . Excellent room with organizer in the front pouch . Worth the purchase .
 My son picked this backpack to carry his school stuff . It 's the perfect size for him and he 's very happy with his new backpack . From my perspective the backpack is well built -LRB- expected -RRB- , zippers are good quality and straps are comfortable enough to carry the weight it holds . It lacks an outside pocket to carry a water bottle .
 I really like this bag , but its a little smaller than I expected . It also gets rather uncomfortable to carry if I try to stick my laptop in it .
 I bought Jansport because my daughter has one and it is high quality and has lasted for 4 school years already . So I got this one for my other daughter who seems to go through one a year - I told her Jansport this year . Well we ordered this and it is too small for middle or high school . It 's more for elementary kids size wise . It 's too much trouble to return so I will hang on to it in hopes of being able to use it somehow .
 We have been buying Walmart $ 10 backpacks because my kids want a new fresh one every year to be cool and in style . But my tween thought the Walmart packs were not cool this year , so we went on Amazon and she picked this one . It cost about $ 30 with shipping , but it 's easy to see this backpack will haul all of her heavy Jr. . High books and last a long time . It 's thicker , better sewn and way sturdier . I 'm thinking it 's about ten times the backpack , but not 10 times the price . Now that is cool even to a mom !
 This backpack has room to carry lots of books and binders for an 8th grader . We especially like the padded back and straps . We shopped a long time to look at the myriad colors and designs . What we received matches what was shown in the picture . The colors and designs are very pretty . When we shop locally , someone else at the school usually shows up with the same backpack . Going through Amazon , with the many different choices , means we have a unique backpack this year ! -LRB- I do n't have to hear , `` Mom , a sixth grader has the same one as mine ! '' You may scoff , but these things are important . -RRB- We saved a few dollars , too , which is very cool because we never before wanted to spend the money on the JanSport name brand . Doing it this way made it feel affordable . Now that we have the brand , we can see the difference in the quality . With free shipping it was delivered before the promise date -LRB- hurrah for Amazon Prime -RRB- . There 's something fun about receiving and opening a box -- a nice little reward for my straight A student .
 This is a fabulous backpack for schoolbooks . The front pocket holds alot of supplies too ! I would buy this style again !
 I bought this for my teen daughter and she likes it alot . Very well made and perfect size , not too big , not too small .
 This is a Jansport so of course quality and durability are n't even a problem . This is the cutest Jansport bag I 've ever had -LRB- and I 've had QUITE a few -RRB- . What you see is exactly what you get . Cute purple and white argyle pattern , the back of the pack is a solid purple -LRB- maybe more of a plum color -RRB- . The zippers are silver metal with purple flaps connected for easy zipper use . Straps adjust very well so the pack can fit very snug or very loose depending on how you 'd like it . The small outside pocket has a built in open pocket inside for various items and also has two small slots made for pens or pencils . Overall great buy and of course the lifetime warranty is included with the Jansport bag . Great for college students . I used this same line of Jansport packs -LRB- in a different pattern -RRB- for the first 3 years of college with no problems .
 Great backpack ! My son goes through them like you would not believe . This time , I think he 'll have no choice but to make this one last !
 I thought it is a really nice backpack . Not to big and not to small . the only bad thing was that it got dirty after 4 days of using it because its so white ! but ofcourse you can wash it . also there are different colors too . Anyways , overall , it is a very good backpack and I still use it for everything !
 I 've one of these for 12 years ! For one of those years it was on my back every day on the back of a motorcycle . Incredibly sturdy , faded from the sun , but still going . Only now the zippers have gone out . You ca n't beat this bag .
 This backpack is really cute , and hides dirt really well ! It is big enough for what I needed for college classes . I wish it had at least another pocket , but it served its purpose really well !
 very good and efficient , is holding up very nice and no signs of wear after being used daily for one month
 Most amazing school backpack you could have!Its light weightIts comfortableLooks goodGood room not to big not to small.Good qualityCant go wrong with this !! * Ive had mine for a 2 years and still no tears or anything !
 I have had this reliable pack for years and for the cost I can honestly say this is the best backpack . Although the straps are n't the most comfortable under a heavy load and the zipper has failed on occasion , all in all this backpack has helped me through some tough times . I have carried loads in it of over 40lbs . -LRB- literally 40lb . weights -RRB- and the straps still show no signs of tearing . There 's easily enough room to hold plenty of books and and a laptop , but I would add cushioning . . It 's light , durable , and very economical , what more do you need ?
 I bought this backpack because its convenient , its cheap in price , durable , and its what everyone else is using ... overall its one of the best packpack out there , ive had it for a month and no problems so far
 My high school daughter loves this backpack & selected it because her college siblings love theirs . Well-made , fair price & the right size .
 This backpack is very sturdy , and it 's the perfect size for carrying a couple classes ' worth of books . It 's also reasonably priced , which is a plus . There are only two main pockets , the body of the backpack and the front pocket , which is nice . Other backpacks usually seem to have two main pockets , which is not very helpful organizationally in the first place and sort of annoying after a while . This is also a good bag for hiking , as it 's comfortable to wear and it dries quickly . I got the navy color , and it 's very true to the picture , possibly more vibrant.Bottom line , I 'd buy it again , and I probably will .
 It 's a great book bag . Very roomy , and sturdy . The pattern is pretty
 The backpack looks very nice and the color pink bring out the details in it casual is , ore of my style and well be order more from you 'll in the future
 It was the exact replacement for the backpack I used for several years . Exactly as ordered .
 Product came in right on time , in brand new condition . Awesome brand named product for a cheap price ! Would recommend anyone who need a cheap brand name backpack !
 her favorite color is purple , so its perfect for her , she had told me to buy it for her at the mall , but me as always got on my android amazon app and checked the prices on amazon , and for sure found a better price .
 This eye-catching pattern is really with it ... with strong stitching and easy to clean finish I expect many years of good usage .
 When i got it , it was neatly in a box.Took it out no tears , no stains or spots.Brand new even came a day earlier . -LRB- :
 I had a JanSport follow me from my freshman year in high school to my sophomore year in college , that was over 10 years ago . Well , going back to school after a long hiatus and thought buying something else would be smart ... . WRONG !!! Should have remembered how much abuse my first JanSport went through and how long it lasted . Lesson learned , now I am a proud owner of another JanSport and could not be happier . If you 're looking for a simple pack for books and misc . junk your kids will haul throughout their years in school , look no further .
 Okay so this came two days before expected -LRB- I ordered the Forge Grey -RRB- and I am very pleased with the shipping , the cost & the color ! I got this with free super saving shipping . The quality feels different , but overall I am very pleased.-Besides , in the stores this is 34.99 , but I only got it for $ 26 ! : D
 I am the mother of 5 kids - I have purchased this backpack , in different colors , for each of my children before they have started kindergarten . I have taken them to a local embroidery shop and had their first names written on the outer pocket - so that they do n't get lost in the shuffle of 500 kids , some with the same bags . My oldest has been using the same bag for 5 years , and it is still perfect . Each year , the week before school starts , I throw them all in the washer , on cold and gentle , with mild detergent , then I hang them to dry - and they look like new ! I am so glad that I have n't wasted money on crappy kids ' backpacks that fall apart and look horrible in 6 months . I have an adult friend who got one of these in kindergarten , and used it for ALL 13 years he was in school , then went on to use it through 4 years of college , and is STILL using the SAME bag now , and he is 30 . These things are workhorses , worth their weight in gold .
 Not much to say , really . It is light , reasonably durable , and very comfortable to carry . I would definitely buy it again .
 My favorite backpack ! Great color , decent price ... I 've had it for a few months and it definitely has been awesome ! Got ta love Jansport !
 My daughter uses this bag in high school and loves it . Great quality and very roomy inside . I washed it in the machine and hung it up to dry . It looks brand new !
 clean cut , stylish , boy/girl , very durable , most likely for school , price could be lower though , in 2007-08 I bought this item for about $ 35.00 + , too expensive for this type of product I say , but a good choice
 I prefer just the plane and simple jansport backpack . . holds quite a bit and lasts forever -LRB- well . . not if u constantly drag it on the ground -RRB- but u can throw it around and it still looks nice ... well . . anyways . . great backpack . .
 Blue Backpack - Haiku of Praise : Like clouds of canvasBag that floats upon my backHolds all of my stuff
 Jansports are always great backpacks . This one was no exception . Two simple pockets and the black just goes with everything . An excellent basic backpack for all ages
 It 's nice and very classic . Exactly what I want ! And the shipping is fast too ~ I highly recommend it ! -LRB- It 's not as big as the other type though . -RRB- But it 's enough for school I think .
 Very comfy and extremely cute - I especially love the alien green color -LRB- easily identifiable in a crowd ! -RRB- . Ordered this two days ago and received it a day later - very pleased : -RRB-
 Back pack has all the space I need and nothing more to make it bulky . Great for me to be carrying around college , perfect size , tons of color options , and you can adjust the size to whatever you want . Cool backpack !
 I bought this backpack for my son I love it ! He loves it also . The quality is outstanding and it has a lifetime warranty . It 's water resistant .
 I Love this back pack !!! It 's perfect for college students . you can fit up to 3 text books and a folder .
 My daughter loves zebras and when she saw this of course we had to listen to the whining until it was bought . School has been in session now for 5 weeks and so far so good . Nothing has broken or ripped which usually does happen with backpacks . It is big enough to even carry her 3 inch binder with some of her other school books .
 My son loves this backpack . He is 9 and it is his first . I was concerned about the color but its very gender and age neutral and looks great . He will be able to use this for many years .
 The item is great . Purchased two , one for each of my boys . They loved it . I also received it when promised and the price was great . Loved the service . Thank you .
 My daughter has always been really hard on her backpacks for school , and so far this one is holding up to her usual abuse ! It has plenty of room for her notebooks , reading material and her lunchbox . The fabric repels liquids as well , so it still looks clean after weeks of use , dropping it in the dirt , etc. . I have hopes that it will last through an entire school year !
 The product was what I ordered and expected . It was of good quality not inferior . I was very satified as it was also delivered in a timely manner . The price was indeed affordable and I would recommend it to others .
 When I bought this , I saw that the picture was a medium turquoise , but I hoped that there was a lighter turquoise to choose . I ordered it anyway because of its cheap price . When I got the backpack , I was really happy because it was a light turquoise ! It looked great and it gave me confidence when I walked through the school hallways .
 I had this kind of bag back when I was 6 y/o , it 's very classic . Although there 's a noticeable change on how this product was made before and how it is made now , I mean , the way they made this product before looks more `` expensive '' , today it looks like it has cheaper materials , I 'm still glad with my purchase .
 Great product :-RRB- I 've been using it for months and it still looks and functions same as the first time I used it . Satisfaction guaranteed . : -RRB-
 I 'm in college so I still need a backpack . It 's the cutest bluish purple color in person . It 's more purple than what the image shows . It looks and feels strong too , so it should last me awhile . My siblings think its nice and it 's unisex looking .
 The backpack is simple and yet still girly . I 'm not normally one for purple but it looks really a nice color . It 's great for carrying books around . The main reason I got it was because I am starting to ride a motorcycle but now I love it and would not choose anything else even when I am not riding .
 what 's not to love ... Its a JanSport . Great colors to choose from , great size even for kids in high school and they last forever . LOVE , LOVE , LOVE THEM !!
 I 've ordered this Bag for my daughter . . she loves it and happy with it . this Bag is simply cute , and very useful .
 This bag is sturdy and a great buy !!!!!!!!!! I bought this for my 14 year old who has already gone thru 2 bags and it 's only the end of october.So far so good !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 Even better color than the display ~ I believe it would be a perfect bag for girls . Multiple usages.Love it !
 This backpack has lasted me for over 2 years now , and I have not had a single problem with it . Zippers are still working perfectly , and straps are still as comfortable as they 'll ever be . It 's a perfect backpack for college and beyond.Now , I do n't toss and drag my backpacks across asphalt and concrete -LRB- like I used to in elementary school :P -RRB- , but I have stuffed this bag many times with textbooks , paperwork , clothes , etc , until the seams seemed -LRB- hah ! -RRB- like they were going to burst . Much to my satisfaction , the bag still held strong each and every time.Only issue I have with this bag is that it 's almost too commonly used ! So make sure you personalize your backpack before you accidentally switch it with someone else !
 I needed this simple old school backpack for use as a toddler diaper bag . this works perfectly and was a great price !
 it 's good , and the color is the same that i saw in the internet . i love it so much . the express speed is fast .
 Durable and worth the money . Light weight , fits a lot of stuff and my 13 year old ca n't destroy it , no that says a LOT !
 Exactly what my daughter wanted ! the color matched the photo . great small backpack perfect for the skinny lockers now located in schools
 My son is says that it is compact but hold a ton of things . He is very happy with it .
 It arrived within 2 days of ordering it and it was the exact size he wanted . Great price great backpack .
 It was a Christmas present for my son and that is what he was looking for . It was perfect . These are the only kind of backpacks he likes .
 I was looking for a bigger pack , and did n't have ideas on size dimensions . Oddly enough , I 'm growing fond of it . I carry my gym shoes and clothes , towel , protein bottle , vitamins , and bathroom goods . With a main pouch and single size zipper pouch , the pack is essentially full . It serves it 's purpose .
 Structurally , this backpack is amazing and everything I was looking for . It 's sturdy , lightweight , and very spacious . My only problem with it , is that the color was not accurately depicted . The picture shows it as a pale green , but it 's really more vibrant and almost the color of the Hulk . I would recommend Googling what the color actually looks like before placing the order .
 These backpacks are great for school , my daughters have always used Jansportthey last all year and wash up nicely to use for the summer.They are very sturdy , zippers are strong for all that tugging . i recommend to all parents with kids in school .
 This is a great backpack , it is very durable and looks great . I would buy again probably next school year .
 This backpack is very resistant . I have many heavy books that i need to carry around and this backpack has n't ripped yet . I ordered the Black/White Torn Triangle . The color was n't what i expected since the picture makes it seem purple/blue but its actually purple/pink . Other than that this backpack is very good .
 The pattern looks good , light and convenient for student . It 's the gift for a friend 's child . Will buy this brand again .
 So nice , it 's a gift for my brother , he like it so much ! The quality is also good !
 bought this and it 's a perfect sized backpack for a student ! not the mini but a full size jansport ! You could easily fit 2 textbooks and some notepads in it !
 This is a great quality backpack . After watching my school age child go through 1 to 2 backpacks a year I decided to spend a little more money for a better one . This JanSport is holding up great . It 's well padded at the shoulders so it 's comfortable to carry and it fits a lot of books and folders . The zippers are easy to pull and do n't snag . There are several pockets to help organize things . It 's a good investment .
 Their are so many types of back packs . But , if all you need is your basic back pack this is it . It 's made of tough material , sewn together well . Has large main compartment . A smaller compartment that has two pen holder slots and a wallet size pocket . I recommend this prodent .
 My seven year old LOVES red . We could n't find a red book bag in stores . This is a classic jansport bookbag that he will be able to use for years to come . Shipping was fast , bookbag exactly as you remember it from when you had your Jansport in grade school . Ca n't go wrong .
 Nice quality , good space , great for preschoolers specially if you need to send bulky things like a blanket or toys for nap time .
 Bought this backpack for my 4th grade daughter . She is very happy w it and loves the colors . It 's holding up well I just wish it had a lining . No pics of the interior of the pack .
 i love this backpack ! the color is so vibrant and beautiful . the color grabbed my attention quickly and i knew i had to have it . the jansport website didnt even have this color in stock and i was very fortunate to find it on Amazon . i got this backpack brand new with the original tags and everything ! : -RRB-
 My daughter is in 2nd grade this year and its good to know that JanSport makes a light weight but yet durable backpack that will fit in her locker at school ! We had so many colors and patterns to choose from but this one was an instant wow ! Hope it lasts the whole year but it came with a lifetime warranty , so no worries ! The shipping was great , just in time for school ! The price with shipping was within my budget , so it worked out great ! Thanks : -RRB-
 We received this really fast and we were very happy with it 's vibrant colors and good quality . We saw it at the retail stores and it was usually marked higher than for what we got it .
 Great price , brand new , had alot of colors available no problems with the bag my daughter loved it . I would definetly buy again . Thanks
 This is even more vibrant in person ! My daughter wanted a fun , bright backpack and absolutely loves this . Very sturdy and the perfect size . I 've had a Jansport since Middle School and I 'm now in my thirties . These are very well made backpacks !
 We are over all very happy with this backpack . My six year old chose it off here herself . The only thing I do n't like is there is no water bottle pocket . Therefore almost daily she comes home with water spilt in her bag . On the bright side the fabric seems to be waterproof . My twelve year old cousin also chose this back pack and loves it . So I think it 's good for multiple ages . The fabric print is cool !
 I ordered this book bag to use for the new semester of college . I must say that the color is fantastic ! I got it in electric purple . While purple is my favorite color , I do n't see myself changing this bookbag until it wears out ! The material feels great and its lightweight . I wish the bag was a bit bigger but nonetheless , I love it ! Thanks , Amazon !
 Okay so i just got the bag 20 minuets & so far i 'm impress . the shipping was fast . the bag was packaged nice & neat . the only problem i see with this is if it gets rained or wet on i could see the dye running . perfect cute bag !
 My nephew found this and had me buy it for him which i sent it in the Philippines just in time for school . His classmates loved it ! In fact , he 's the only one in his class who has this kind of backpack which made him very happy !!!
 JanSport has the best quality with there products have bought them before would buy again and if you ever have a issue with it they with repair it or replace the best .
 Great , just what I wanted . Not much to expect but a regular backpack . Since it is brand new the straps are all stiff , so it takes a while to break it in and get it comfortable .
 Love my throw back , Jansport.I ordered the all black.I 'm pretty satisfied.It came brand new with all tags and a lifetime warranty.It did n't take long to arrive either.Thanks Amazon !!!
 This Jansport Backpack was exactly what my daughter was looking for . It 's the perfect size for middle school books/homework/etc . It 's not too big & bulky but fits a ton of stuff ! Very cool design and excellent quality !
 Lifetime warranty , Nicely finished and good quality . I recommend this for any student . It will be nice having a warranty with teenagers . For the price it 's worth it . We usually are pretty hard on our backpacks , multi usage - school , hiking , walking , and other activites . She LOVED it , she is 17 yrs old .
 The product was shipped with professional care and arrived almost a week before the start of school . Absolutely love the color , and loved how it was not damage at all during the shipping . Very lightweight , but spacious . Have no problems with the backpack and will absolutely adore it forever .
 When our church started taking collections for school supplies and backpacks , I knew I would order nothing but a Jansport . It 's a good size , carries a decent amount of supplies -LRB- I stuffed it full of supplies , including 3 binders ! -RRB- , and the quality is great . In my opinion , you ca n't go wrong ordering a Jansport . I 'm hoping the child who receives this bookbag is pleased , and that it lasts them a good few years . : -RRB- As far as shipping and cost , this bookbag is a steal and was shipped promptly . Very happy with my purchase . : -RRB-
 My daughter is really into zebra print right now , and she just loves her book bag . She is a first grader and just loves this !!
 I was nervous to get this , because i was worried it would n't be up to par for a college student . I got it , and loved it . Cute color , I got Blinded Blue . It holds all of my books ANd my lap top with extra room . This is a huge plus for me , my last backpack was so tiny . I will definitely be a big fan of this brand
 Got this backpack for school and it is just about perfect . It is durable and comfortable . Jansport makes quality products .
 The yellow in actuality is a little too bright for my taste and it runs a little big for my body but well , I 'm small -LRB- 4 ' 10 '' -RRB- so what do I expect . The item came quickly and it was exactly as described . It stands out a lot so if you do n't mind catching peoples ' attentions and being associated with a yellow backpack , then go for it1
 I 've been using this backpack for about 3 weeks now , and it 's in great condition still . It holds all my notebooks and binder well . I have no complaints other than the fact that it gets dirty really easily . I have to place it on the ground from time to time when I go to tennis and there would be marks that can only come out if I wash them.Other than that , it is waterproof . That comes in handy since the weather here in Texas is bipolar and rain may hit randomly . Saves all my notebooks and homework from complete disaster . This was the first product I 've order from Amazon and I definitely love how fast the shipping is and how well they send the product -LRB- in protective packaging -RRB- .
 I wanted a jansport backpack for quite awhile now and I finally decided to order one from amazon its perfect to fit all books and even my netbook . Amazon is excellent with the shipping it was extremely fast I ordered my backpack Friday Night and with the exception of the weekend I recieved it Monday afternoon ! Very Satisfied THANKS AMAZON !
 I bought this backpack for my 10 year old son because i know its awesome and will last along time . My dad has the same one and hes has it for many years .
 Very pleased with the product . Good quality , colour and standard . Happy with the purchase . Everything seems to be in order . Highly Recommended .
 I bought this bag because I am studying abroad in the UK for one semester . I needed a good sturdy bag , that would n't look awkward or out of place . A bag that I could take anywhere and not be looked at twice . It has a lot of room for your things , and it does n't strain your back . I used it as one of my carry ons , and as I walked around Liverpool.The dark color hides dirt , and it is durable . All in all , a great buy , and definitely worth the money . I gave it 4 out of 5 because although it is comfortable and what not , I just wish it had longer straps , but that is mainly for me and my long back.If you are traveling , this is a MUST , and if you are just using it for school , then GET ONE !!
 grandaughter loved it . We got 2 and I was charged for 2 but only ordered 1 . Guess we will have one for next year . Thanks
 The product is nice and I got it faster than I expected . Very nice purchase experience !
 I would normally wear totes from abercrombie or hollister . When I saw the black crazy dots I thought it looked really cool ! This is the best backpack I have ever found and I wish that I figured that out a long time ago . Bit you know what they say it is better late then never finding that out . Overall JanSport mad another great , durable , and cute backpace . I reccomend it for anyone that needs a new , stylish backpack !
 This is the best . I have always used Jansport backpacks they last forever .
 These bags I bought for my son and daughter are great . Last year I bought a bookbag for my daughter and it broke close to the end of the year . I was quite upset because I bought this from a reliable department store . Well this time around the bookbag is holding up even with all the books that my fifth grader brings home .
 This backpack is very sturdy and great for my son who is in high school . It was not as roomy as I thought and he would of liked more compartments .
 I 've always loved Jansport backpacks and this is no different . I purchased a Jansport backpack similar to this one about 3 years ago and up to now it 's still in very good shape . Not to mention some of the newest designs they have to offer . This is well worth your money !
 The Jansport SuperBreak Black Crazy Dots Backpack is a great product . My niece likes it because it is fun and colorful , and I like it because it is durable . Not to mention , it was nice to have the product delivered right to our door . It was one less stop we had to make during the busy back-to-school season .
 My 14 year old daughter loves this backpack . It shipped quickly , arrived fast and was a good price .
 The back pack is sturdy and compact but seems to hold a lot of books without being bulky .
 purchased before and will purchase again . the external pocket has divisions that are kind of useless , should have bigger slots for pens , only complaint , perfect size
 I like the color and the material can always stay in shape . But I think I need more small bags for my small things .
 Jansport backpacks has been trusted and known worldwide by their quality and cool design . This one is no exemption . It is light but strong enough to hold hardbound books . This make perfect for my kid .
 Thank you for getting this product to me in a timely manner and in the shape you said it would be in .
 I always buy Jansport backpacks . As a mother of 3 I have bought a lot of backpacks for my kids . The only ones that seem to make it through a whole school year and even longer is Jansport . I will always spend the extra money knowing I 'll only have to replace it half as much .
 The bookbag is a very pretty print ; and very versatile . Jansport has always been a favortie brand of mine and I 'm very lucky I got it for such a good price .
 I expected something a little cheezy but , in fact it was a great purchase . I was very satisfied with my purchase .
 This is a great quality product and holds up well with big loads . It is comfortable to wear as well . Recommend this seller as well . Fast service and item was exactly as described .
 Bought this backpack because I 'm sick of carrying tote bags . Love it and I love all the cool designs but I like to keep it simple so I went with navy .
 These jansport backpacks are amazing . they are durable and can hold a lot of stuff comfortably . the padding on the shoulder straps are a little thin though.One thing i would not recommend is to put an unprotected laptop in the backpack . the backpack has very little padding on the bottom so most likely the comp would be damaged.another great thing is that this pack contours to your back so that there is not a hole inbetween your back and the backapck
 Great item . My daughter loves her backpack and uses it extensively for school every day . It is about 30 % smaller than I thought it would be from the picture however .
 I bought this for my grandson who is 13 and he seems to like it and uses it all the time and I think that is a really good product , that holds up well .
 EL PRODUCTO LLEGO SIN INCONVENIENTE ALGUNO , ESPERABA MAS DE LA CALIDAD , PERO POR LO DEMA ESTA BIEN SON BONITA , EN LA PROSIMA COMPRA QUISIERA ENCONTRAR DESCUENTA PARA PODER VENDERLA
 Item was mailed in a timely manner . Item was received as described . Very pleased with the purchase and the amount paid . Thank you for great customer service !
 I ordered this backpack on the 15 and it said it was going to come on the 25 but it did n't so im still waiting . Hopefully I 'll get it on monday
 Justm what my son wanted and I did n't have to go anywhere with him except amazon !! Thanks so much more than I can say !!!
 Maybe can be cheaper ? I bought my previous Jan 's port for 22 on amazon , but it was 3 years ago .
 The Backpack arrived promptly and is exactly as advertised . Pretty pattern on it and nice and roomy . We will get lots of years of service from this backpack .
 Love jansport , always wanted a white bag and now i have it . I have no idea how i 'm going to keep it clean but the white look so crisp i 'll try my hardest . I heard scotchgaurd should help and if it 's like my other jansport bag its and easy as tossing it into the washing machine and hang drying it . LOVE THE BAG !
 I was weary of getting this bag after reading that the bags were of thinner quality , but I went ahead and purchased it . Although the bags being thinner was true , it has n't been a problem yet and I 've had the bag for over six months . The bag is still very durable , despite me having thrown my bag around on the floor . I 've been using JanSport since I was in elementary school , and it still serves my needs as a college student . Thus , I definitely still recommend it !
 purchased this bag for my daughter since she already had a janSport and she loves it .
 THe colour is great . It has a desgin in the interior pocket that is extremely cute !
 All my backpacks I 've had since 2nd grade have been a Jansport backpack . I 've never had any problems with any of my backpacks . When you first get the backpack the straps are a little stiff but they quickly form to your body . The backpacks are cute and durable . With all of the different kinds of backpacks it 's great .
 The shipping was on time & the quality of JanSport never seems to fail me ! I 'm finally ready for school .
 I bought this backpack for my daughter for kindergarten . I was concerned it might be too big for her because she is petite and only five . However , the adjustable straps make it fit her perfectly . I really like that the bag itself is very lightweight but can hold lots of stuff . She should be able to use it for many many years to come .
 Love the bag!It is everything I hoped for and as advertised . Received it promptly too !
 I WAS SO IMPRESSED WITH THIS BACKPACK . I ORDERED IT FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR SCHOOL AND AND SHE WAS HOPING THAT IT LOOKED AS GOOD IN PERSON AS IT DOES IN THE PICTURE AND IT DOES . SHE LOVES IT . THE COLORS ARE SO VIBRANT . PAID $ 29.99 ON AMAZON . SAW IT OTHER PLACES FOR $ 69.99 .
 works as advertized . the only drawback is its lack of pockets . its got just the one pocket with an inner pocket . not a big deal to me but for some it might be a problem . its simplicity is a strength and also a weakness i guess .
 I love this backpack ! It is just like the one I used to have in elementary school and I LOVE it ! It is the perfect size for my college load and it is the most durable material ever !
 This is a nice looking , sturdy back pack for most elementary school children . The only drawback is , it 's a bit small.I bought it for my middle school son . He loved it , but could not fit all of his books and school supplies in it . My fourth-grader , who is notorious for tearing up back-packs , uses it every day . It 's a perfect fit for him . It is holding up quite well !
 This was a beautiful back pack , just as described and seems well made . Are kid 's school bags ever sturdy enough . Sadly , no . This is the 3rd we have been through this year . We can only hope it lasts the rest of the school year . Can somebody come out with a super strong and lasting bag ? Mine from back in the old days lasted 2 years or more . It 's a thought .
 I ordered this backpack for my high-schooler . She loves it ! At first she was worried that the straps would be uncomfortable or not hold up since they are thinner and lightly padded vs. the big , thick , heavy padded ones on her past backpacks , but three days into school and she says they 're good and she likes that they do n't add extra weight . She loves the daisy pattern and reports that she 's the `` only one '' to have it ! Which means it 's `` totally cool '' ! Product shipped in a timely manner and came in perfect quality . I would buy again from this dealer .
 The Superbreak backpack has been my daily companion for the past 2.5 years . It 's been through 5 full-time-college semesters , always handling extremely heavy bookloads -LRB- think lots of hardcover science , math and english texts -RRB- very well . It 's a great fit for someone of small-medium stature -LRB- 5 ' 2 '' thin-to-average female -RRB- . I 've just ordered another one , only because I like my current Superbreak so much that I do n't want it to begin to fade or tear -- that 's right , it has n't even begun to fade , or wear , or tear , after 5 semesters of heavy daily use ! This is a freakin ' awesome backpack .
 I 'm 17 . I 've been looking for a backpack b/c my handbag was really starting to hurt my shoulder . This backpack is great !!!!!!! I take it everywhere . It 's light and the straps are comfy . It 's always on the ground in school and never gets torn . There is alot of space too . I carry a typical 3 in . binder , two folders , 4 journals , 2 english books , a pencil case , 4 oz water bottles , and my handbag ! Its very cool . I recently took it on a trip when I was traveling and it fit all my clothes and other necessities . I 'm glad I got this backpack . It also arrived 2 days later . BOOST !!!
 I thought that this bag was very useful and had a very nice appearance . I think it is value for the money and I recommend it .
 This is the same backpack you would buy at the mall or anywhere you go to buy a JanSport backpack .
 I bought this backpack for my niece . We saw it at Penney 's , but it was much cheaper here . It is quite cute and very durable .
 I love the JanSport backpack ^ - ^ I probably have a diffrent design than anybody else in my school.It was definitely worth the money I payed for it .
 We purchased this backpack for our daughter going into kindergarten and are very pleased with it . The color and size are perfect for her . It is very roomy and holds everything she needs for school with plenty of room to spare . We purchased the larger Jansport Big Student Backpack for our fifth grader because he has so much more to carry . The zippers on the Jansport backpacks work really well and do n't get hung up like some of the cheaper backpacks we have had in the past . Hopefully this backpack will last for several years until she has to start carrying larger books and binders to and from school .
 this was on my daughters MUST HAVE list for back to school . she adorned it with PUFFY PAINT . shipped easily and school starts in a week .
 Exactly what i needed for school :-RRB- Very nice look , and the zippers are really durable . I 'm sure i wont have any problems with this backpack when the new semester of college starts .
 I bought this Book bag for my eleven year old son who wanted an all black bag . I was pleased in the look and the durability of this bag . My son seems to be happy with it so I am happy . Also I ordered it and four days later I had it . So shipping was very fast . I am very pleased with this Seller .
 This is a typical Jansport backpack , the basic kind , the navy color goes well with the logo . My daughter loves it and takes it everywhere -LRB- trips , sleepovers -RRB- .
 I received my package within a short amount of days . Was very excited to get a new backpack . I love Jansport .
 I 've owned 3JanSport classic backpacksand have different usages for each one
 On time and perfect quality I am using the book bag at school as I type ! Filling in space to be able to submit this lol
 this is just what i was looking for . it is a backpack.no bells or whistles , just a backpack.no secret packets , no extra hooks , nets , holders , or containers . just a backpack . it is perfect !!!!!
 Only reason I gave this item 4 stars is I grew up when JanSport backpacks were made of THICK canvas material throughout and lasted for years in school for the same price as this one . Im not saying this product is not sturdy because it held a full sized laptop and charger , baby formula dispenser , ten diapers , portable baby wipe container , 10in tall baby snacks , 2 medium pouches of baby snacks , 3 burp rags , 1 medium sippy cup , two full 10 oz bottles , a change of clothes for 8 month old , large womens wallet , three prong manilla folder and a few more smaller items that were crammed into it and held up without rippng through airport security . But the material isnt the way they used to make them 10 years ago . It feels like canvas from the outside but has an almost smooth plastic interior . I was dissappointed when I revieved it because of the change in manufacturing . I was fully expecting it to rip half way through my flights but it held up and held everything that I had crammed into it .
 I like this backpack for the design AND durability . Very sturdy unlike the Nike & Adidas backpacks I 've had in the past . Keep in mind that this bag is very simple as far as compartments go , but that 's what I like about it . Lifetime warranty ai n't bad either .
 awesome color , as i saw on the photos !!! i got it super fast and was everything i expected , besides the prices was amazing!free shipping and fast shipping what else i can ask !! . super happy with my purchase ! = D
 This backpack is a classic ! I use it all the time when I travel . Its just big enough to hold anything I 'd need on a plane but not too big to get in the way or be too heavy once stuffed full . It has held up very well over 6 years and 10 countries . I 'm sure I 'll buy another one if this one ever gives up on me .
 This lives up to Jansports reputation . Excellent quality . Perfect size.Shipping was super fast . My son is still using it .
 This is your basic backpack , great for school , the beach , or a day trip anywhere . It is sturdy , lightweight , durable and can withstand teenage boys . I have used Jansport backpacks for over twenty year and they never disappoint .
 Nice quality bag . Good size for a teenage girl . Roomy enough to carry a few textbooks and the other essentials .
 ESta es la segunda mochila de estas que compro para mis hijos , son resistentes durables y comodas de llevar a mis hijos les encanta .
 I bought a Jansport bookbag for my 6 year old daughter . While the size was perfect for her , the material is a lot thinner than the canvas Jansport bookbag I have from 10 years ago that I used . But is does have a lifetime warrantee so we will see how it holds up .
 Good fashionable backpack at an affordable price.not much to it just a simple straight forward backpack , perfect for high school students and people who do not carry much and just want something that is pretty straight forward .
 Its Excelent it arrived earlyer then expected and the back pack is roomy if your a college student and need alot of room this bag is the one for you !!!!
 I got it in rosebuff pink ~ I really like the size and all . . Always satisfied with JanSport backpacks : D
 I used to own one of those `` I 'm - a-mountain-hiker '' bookbag and for quite a while , the bookbag actually weighted more than the notebooks that I carried inside . So I finally decided to invest in one of these . Let 's just say , I will never go back !! It 's simple in design , yet it 's everything you want in a bookbag . It 's spacious , EXTREMELY light , and it does n't have a tons of pockets for you to lose your pencils in ! I was actually impressed at the amount of stuffs that this thing carries . However , the straps are a bit uncomfortable ... I supposed I have to `` break '' them in ...
 When I first saw this bag it was love at first sight . I wanted to have a unique design for a jansport backpack and this is it ! Barely anyone has this design . I 've only passed by 2 people in 3 years that had this exact design . I always get complements on it . I love it . I 've used it for 3 years straight , and it has served me well . The wear and tear produced a hole in the bottom where the material meets the black backing . But that 's expected after such a long time . I 'm tempted to buy a new one just to keep this around . It 's too cool . Buy it if you 're looking for something edgy and unique ! :D There 's more than enough room for books and looks cool wearing it !
 The retail price for this backpack at your local Sports Authority runs for about $ 40 not including tax . I received the package today and I am impressed with the quality and price . Great buy if you want to save a couple of bucks . Would buy from seller again !
 This backpack is perfect for pre-K . It is large enough to hold regular size papers without being too bulky . Color choices are great , and we found just what we wanted .
 this is a great backpack love it had it for 5 years lasted through middle and half of high school but then my brother dropped it in a lake .
 I have had this bag for a while now and I must say it looks exactly the same as when I bought it . This is a bag that was made to last . But anyways I would recommend this as more of a casual bag than a school bag . So overall a great product .
 My grandson chose this backpack -LRB- he 's 11 -RRB- and also the black and white graffiti so he can change up once in a while . He likes them very much and feels quite cool in school . Thanks Amazon for your great selections and fine products.Linda Phillips -LRB- better known as `` YaYa '' to my Grands -RRB- .
 Sturdy backpack , roomy for all necessary items for school . Color is nice and cleans up easily with soap and water .
 Great backpack ! Really fits nice on ma back ! Its a classic American bag with extra frills , I like that , and you will too .
 I had a friend that used to work for JanSport and she told me that it maybe a little pricey and may not be cars or monster High but is totally worth the money b/c they have a lifetime guarantee . Well with the previous back pack I ordered breaking the first day of school I decided to go for it . I found that they have more than just basic colors now and actually have really cool prints to choose from now . So when my daughters big girl back pack arrived she loved it and I have had not one problem with it yet and guess if I do I will send it back to have it repaired :--RRB- .
 I think the backpack is fine and it 's really cute . Just wish it had more pockets , it only has a big one and a small one . otherwise fine .
 My 5th grader has the need to carry more books then ever , Jansport is simple , durable & gives us exactly what we need . TOTALLY RECOMMEND !
 This Jan-sport backpack is Top notch , nice for carrying on the go items like books , electronics , etc.It does get dirty fast if placed on ground but poofs right off . Its adjustable to fit your comfort and a great buy !
 It 's very dependable . My kids love its looks and color . Size is just right for their books in middle school .
 As soon as I got this product I must admit I was a bit scared . The bag seemed so small and I was worried I would have to return it . But thankfully once I got some books and folders in there I realized it was the perfect size . Easily carried two large textbooks and a binder with room to spare . Though , it int without its flaws.One thing I do n't like about it is how plastic-ey it feels . Feels kind of cheap , but I think it will hold up nicely.It also collects dust fairly easily when laid on a floor . Its easily wiped away though.My last complaint is that the straps are very cheap and thin and need to be worked in.Other than that its a great bag . Suites my needs nicely .
 No problems with this product from Amazon . Great quality and extremely satisfied . I love it and reccomend it for anyone !
 It is a very nice sturdy backpack . The color is a pretty pink.We are very happy with our purchase .
 You ca n't go wrong with this backpack . The color is what hooked me because it 's my favorite color and the backpack is very durable .
 I bought this a few weeks ago . It 's great for school . Initially I could n't decide between Jamsport and eastpak . I 'm glad I chose this .
 I love it because it 's generic and sturdy . I use it daily and it fits my laptop and it 's sleeve perfectly . -LRB- 15.6 '' -RRB-
 The backpack is great . It has room for all my child 's book , plus other items . It 's sturdy and will last for years . Jansport is the only backpack my family uses .
 Great backpack , nice and sturdy but not too big for my 10 year old daughter . It has plenty of room for what she needs and seems like it will last !
 Great buy , my son loves this backpack . Jansport is always the best bags to buy , specially because of their warranty .
 I needed a backpack to hold up under a 3rd grade boy . Zippers , straps and handles are the trouble zones . This backpack is very well made . Everything fits , there are not 20 pockets to lose things in and it looks great . JanSport will be it for us from now on .
 Just what my daughter wanted for back to school . Not too bulky but room for her books and lunch and the quality you 'd expect from Jansport . Great find on Amazon and a great price .
 This was a present for my granddaughter and she loves it ! It was exactly what she wanted for a reasonable price .
 This backpack is simple , durable , and pretty awesome . The color vibrant and fantastic . Sturdy and the lifetime guarantee is fantastic .
 Was exactly what Grand son asked for . He does art work on white back pack . We received item very punctually .
 I 'd almost go so far as to call it flimsy - the material is quite thin.Aside from general impressions of not being particularly sturdy , the bag is pretty well constructed and my 7th grade daughter loves the way it looks -LRB- she got the blue streak tone deaf model -RRB- .
 The backpack is great . the size is a little small . There are know places to put your water . It fits everything yo put in it .
 The simplicity of this backpack is what makes it great . There are no extra pockets or straps . It is very comfortable and the material used to make this backpack seems quite durable .
 Out of all the backpacks we have purchased throughout my son 's school career thus far this backpack is their favorite . It is light weight , made well and simple . My sons have said they do n't like all the pockets other backpacks have . . they can never find their stuff . This has one large zipper pocket for books , etc. and one smaller zipper pocket right in the front for pencils , etc. . Will purchase this again .
 My black JanSport Superbreak Classic Backpack rocks ! It is very well made and constructed . The material feels great and sturdy . It holds all of my heavy college books and then some!There is a pocket inside the smaller compartment that is great for holding my wallet when I don ' feel like having it in my pocket . The bag is not too big . Its simple and just right , not bulky.The top loop is great for hanging it on the hook that 's on the door of the restroom stall when you do n't want to place it on the floor.This thing looks great in black . I was afraid that the blue background of the JanSport logo -LRB- that is on the black bags -RRB- was going to be too bright , but thankfully it is darker than it is in the photo . It is a dark navy color.This bag comes with a lifetime warranty that I doubt I will ever need . I 'm sure that this is the last backpack I 'll ever need to get ! : -RRB-
 I 've been using this bag for my commute now for about 2.5 weeks . And I have to say , so far I 've been pleased with it , except for one afternoon when we got a torential downpour . The backpack is not waterproof , but I knew this before purchasing , so it 's more of an observation rather than a complaint . This bag does n't repel water much at all , and almost all of my stuff in my bag was socking wet after 15 minutes of waiting for my bus in the rain . However , during a mist or a light sprinkle , this bag is great.I 've been a fan of Jansport bags since I was little , and they have lasted me through middle school , high school , and college , and one bag had even lasted through 9 months traveling through Europe.I chose this bag because of it 's design . I wanted something simple and black , without a lot of doodads attatched to it . The front pocket is quite spacious and holds my -LRB- very fat -RRB- wallet , phone , iPod , keys , pressed power compact and a few other things . The main compartment holds my stuffed travel pillow -LRB- which does not compress down at all -RRB- an 6 '' x 8 '' x 3 '' hardcase lunchbox , my Kindle , makeup bag , folders and paper I carry back and forth , and when I 'm not carrying my Kindle , a book , and a water bottle . My only complaint really about this bag is the lack of an outer water bottle pocket . I always have a liquid on me -LRB- I ca n't tell you how many times that 's saved me on delayed trains -RRB- and I like it easily accessible . However , with this bag , I either have to hand carry it , or put it in my bag . This is a problem in the mornings as my bottle comes out of my fridge , and by the time I get to work , the condensation has made things in my bag damp . The lack of a water bottle pocket is the only reason this bag will not be making the cut for my back packing trip through Eastern Europe next spring . Instead , I 'll be taking my other Jansport bag that 's larger and a bit heavier , but has 2 outer water bottle pockets.Overall a great bag , as long as you do n't take it into the elements , and you do n't mind not having your water bottle immediately accessible .
 JanSport backpack is a perfect size and fit for textbooks ! It goes well with my laptop as well ! A great buy for the price !!!
 I use this pack every day , and while the main compartment is huge , the front compartment could use a couple of more pockets . Other than that , it is well-made , durable and quite functional . The appearance is utilitarian but it performs pretty much as promised .
 I purchased this backpack to carry my oil paints in to give my arms a rest . This light weight back pack is roomy - tough ; takes a load of weight off this adult woman and the dots are excellent . Lots of compliments . My niece covets the dots - she will have to get her own . I highly recommend this product !
 I bought this pack for hiking . I find all JanSport products to be of good quality . I do n't like lots of `` bells & whistles '' on a day pack and this one is pretty basic . It is a decent size to allow me to carry all my necessities and some extras but not so big to tempt me into over-packing . A larger pack would be preferable for a winter hike to carry bulkier items . This pack is fully functional and if it lives up to previous Jansport packs I 've owned , then it will be around for some years to com .
 All in all a very nice backpack . My daughter could n't get too excited about the backpack as it reminded her she was going back to school . Fast shipment and nice price .
 I bought this for my great grandaughter . She found it on the computer when staying a few days with me . She always finds something when visiting . She loves it and when I saw it -- Wow it was more than I expected . Very nice . I will give this backpack five stars as it is so well constructed and very true to color . Girls , you will love this if you like this Zebra print . Lot of room too . This is the second backpack ordered from this we site . Five stars to them .

 I 've used this backpack for school from 7th grade to 12th grade . It 's also gone with me to summer camp several times , been on hikes across mountains , traveled to Germany and Italy , etc. . It is a wonderful backpack . I 'm sad that I 'll have to retire it for a bigger backpack when I go off to college this fall , but I will still use it often whenever I need a smaller bag . The only part of the back that has been damaged is some of the stitching has worn off on the very bottom of the bag . I 'm very impressed that the shoulder straps and zippers are still in perfect condition . I love this backpack !
 i bought this pack as a more ergonomical pack/purse for a girlfriend with back problems , and she love 's it !!!! a great product !!!!
 I 'm just finishing up my Freshman year of high school , and I used the Jansport Superbreak backpack in Electric Purple for part of the year.I really like this backpack . It 's lightweight , so I do n't mind carrying it around when I have to . It also could fit a bunch of stuff , but being in high school , no one actually wants to do that.So if you 're in/going into high school , I recommend this bag .
 JanSport is a great brand . The quality of their backpacks is great and the size is perfect . I would recommend it to everyone .
 To say the least , this backpack is everything that I 've needed . For years I 've been using designer bags for my schoolbooks but finally decided to switch to an actual backpack . I will never be going back -- especially considering the price ! I 've had bags that break after a semester or even a month because they 're not made to hold the weight that I require for school , they 're made for style . I am absolutely 100 % sure that I will have this backpack for years to come , which so far shows no indication of wear or tear after about a year of use . I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a classic , simple and powerful backpack.By the way , I purchased this bag in navy and it matches with everything , but CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT LIST ??! Kudos to JanSport and Amazon for all of the possibilities .
 jansport backpack , this is the second time I am buying jansport backpack , it is so light , and you can fit lots of stuff in it . I love it : -RRB-
 Overall it 's pretty good . It 's a simple backpack with a main compartment and then a small one . I recommend it : D
 Perfect for going on tours when you are vacationing . Large enough to hold your necessary articles , but small enough not to be too heavy .
 Im a college student and I have a lot of heavy books to carry around on campus and this backback is just right . Its not too heavy when I have 2-3 heavy books in it or just my work stuff . I say its a great backpack for an everyday college student but if you have to carry a big load this is not going to be for you . I like how its a simple backpack it had one big pocket for books and my laptop and a smaller pocket for my pens and other random items . I like this backpack a lot .
 Great backpack but when it came in the mail i guess it was squished and when i first put on the backpack it did n't look / feel right and it just needed some wearing before it got to feel / look right . Great backpack order one ... . I do n't know why they complain about the size its just fine but if you do need a bigger backpack they do have a bigger version of this backpack just bigger with 2 large zipper places and 2 small ones . But they do have a lot of room unless you 're crazy and carry around like 5 textbooks and 3 binders . Good size not to big or small just fine great backpack .
 The backpack is well fit , perfect size , and is a plus with only two pockets . Having multiple pockets is a hassle , you forget where you put things . Great backpack though , I recommend this to any student .
 Very Durable , but I warn you DO NOT GET THIS IF YOU ARE GOING TO GET IT DIRTY ! 1st week into school and I got a scratch on it , also you ca n't bleach it .
 I bought it to my son . He liked it very much . It 's a good quality product and seems durable . Reasonable price .
 this product was great , it was my first time purchasing from amazon and i must say it was exactly what i was looking for i did not want some cheap quality back pack . i got the real deal just what i was looking for i was very satisfied and i made my little sister very happy with her new orange back pack . the shipping was great did not wait very long received it quick and the price was great , i look forward to buying more products in the future .
 the backpack looks the same as the one online but just not as solid as I thought . But it 's worth the price .
 When I was in High School , I had a Red Jansport which I still use up to now . This is actually for my brother who had an Addidas backpack and wanted a sturdier one . I was browsing at a Sunday newspaper and saw that Sports Authority has a JanSport sale . I saw this exact color and design and it cost $ 29.99 plus tax . I checked in Amazon if they have the same style and they did ! I have a Prime Membership and it 's cheaper by $ 4 no tax . Now he 's been using it for a week and he never said anything bad about it . JanSport is a great bag especially for High School kids . They could hold very heavy books and last for 10 years .
 This backpack was soo worth the price . Although the material is quite thin , it makes it really light and comfortable even when you 're carrying around tons of things in it . the front pocket has lots of compartments and storage room and although this backpack looks small , it has LOTS of space . i 'd get this again if i needed . great backpack ! u wo n't go wrong buying this
 My daughter loves this backpack , because it is not heavy , and more spacious inside of bag . And she told me it was easy to put in or out from her locker at school . She wants to buy one more ...
 If you are a student this backpack is for you . I keep my small things in the small front pocket and put my books in the main pack . It 's convenient if you do n't have lots of things to carry . I 've had this for over 2 years now and I 'm still using it , the color faded a little but other than that , the quality is great . Would buy another Jansport backpack in the future as soon as the one I have right now wears out !
 Well first , to no fault of amazon or UPS , I couldnt get my bag almost 1 week later though I requested two day shipping ! - Due to disastrous conditions in GA. . So I was a bit upset , but this bag is well worth the wait . Its cute , and actually fits WAAAY more books than I thought , plus a binder !! It has tons of space , the design on the inside is as awesome as the outside . Its not just a boring bag . Adds character
 Admittedly , I have n't had the chance to use my new Jansport backpack very much , since I just received it this month . However , if I wait a year to write a review then it will never happen . Lesser of two evils is writing one now . It 's still very valid , IMO.Mine own Jansport yellow has only taken a few short trips to visit my girlfriend in NYC , but it 's held up well -LRB- as expected -RRB- . I write `` as expected '' because I 'm familiar with Jansport quality . My brother has been a Jansport owner/user for the past 20something years , first purchasing his forest green version in high-school . His pack has served him well over the years , and held up remarkably . He 's used it to carry books -LRB- high school and college -RRB- as well as assorted clothing , which is to be expected . However , my bro was also in a local band for many years , performing often in different locations around the city . It was during this time that his Jansport earned it 's respect . He used it to carry musical equipment such as pedals and cords , which are n't light . Some equip has sharp edges , none of which penetrated/damaged his pack . The bag held up through all of this use , without even a small hole or tear.I 've borrowed his pack over the years for various reasons and uses , and until recently we 'd never discussed it 's quality . When I finally asked `` How long have you had this ? '' , I was floored . And I wanted one sooooo bad.I just purchased a backpack that I may use for the rest of my life . -LRB- Seriously , go to the jansport website and read the guarantee . -RRB- For under $ 25 !!! If my review seems glowing , that 's because it is . If my opinion on Jansport changes over the next few months/years , then I will update my review accordingly . Trust me on this.If Jansport ends up disappointing me YOU WILL KNOW ABOUT IT !
 The review title says it all . The bag is n't very bulky so it does n't get hot on your back . It 's simple in design and works great . The only con I would have to list is that for those who like pockets , this are n't very many .
 when i was in high school i had one of these bookbags and i loved it . they are really durable and will last forever . i was buying bookbags from old navy for my daughter and she was always complaining that it did n't fit all her stuff and she 's in the 4th grade . so i finally decided to put a little money into buy a jansport because it 's actually an investment . she loves it and i know i wo n't have to buy her another one for a long time .
 I have been using my Jansport -LRB- different color , same style -RRB- for over 11 years since my freshman year of college in 1999 . It is dirtier than it used to be and the mesh extra pocket has a minor snag on it but I use it everyday as a teacher , for traveling , to throw my laptop in , etc. and the zippers are all still great , there are no tears in the bag , and the bright orange color still makes me smile.I remember just how many backpacks I went through as a kid and can truly say had I had a Jansport I would probably still be using it two decades later rather than just one .
 I saw this color on a jansport in the store , but it was n't the style I wanted . Found it here online and they delivered it within 2 business days ! Very happy with my purchase !
 JanSport on the whole is a strong and certified bad !! The only problem is deciding on a design ... I bought two JanSport 's for myself , a pink from the classic series , which is still in mint condition and a shoulder side-strap bag -LRB- pink of course -RRB- which doubled up as my trendy laptop bag and book bag.I got this one for my boyfriend after and when he first put it on there was a confidence in him and everybody commented on the style of the bag . It was an unusual type in our campus , so it definitely caught their attention.A simple black and white but with such a statement . Love It ...
 I purchase this backpack for my son . I did n't want one with tons of pockets and one that was too big . I was looking for a simple , basic , durable backpack , and that 's what I got . He loves this backpack and it 's held up good . We are going on year 2 with this bag and it 's still super durable and clean looking . No unraveling of strings or seams , no stuck zippers . It 's perfect ! I would highly reccommend this item .
 This was a great purchase ! It was as if I had bought it at the store brand new , but for half the price ! I recommend it to anyone who wants a new backpack , but does n't want to pay a lot for it .
 This product is a great product . Also shipping was very fast ordered Tues got it Thurs
 This is a classic backpack that has been around forever . Works great for basic `` campus '' uses . I have had a few of them and the only problems I 've ever encountered involve the stitching by the zipper coming apart . Could just be me , the heavy load I carry , or something else , but it 's something to be aware of if you 're looking to have a really heavy load in there or use your backpack in beyond the average way . If so , JanSport is a great brand and has some other models which are meant for heavier and harder use . For most people though , this model will work great . Even with the problems I 've had , I keep going back to it .
 This is exactly what I am looking for . Thanks to the seller , I receive it in only a few days . The backpack is light , fit to my back , not bulky but can hold my mac . The nice thing is that I can choose my favorite color out of many choices , which is impossible in local grocery .
 I bought this as a present for my sister who is in high school . I think its neat how the Jansport is now branching out and doing more designs . The peacock feathers are good graphics and the colors go with a lot of looks .
 I have a broken leg and am on crutches so I needed a light weight backpack to carry all my stuff and have my hands free . This has been perfect . It is very light but big enough to hold a sweater , etc as well as the former contents of my purse .
 Super cool book bag . Purchased as a last minute birthday present for my son . It arrived the morning of his birthday so I was able to have it for him when he returned from school . Excellent shipping time.Roomy enough for my high-schooler . Thrilled , as always , with the quality of a JanSport .
 This backpack is cute and functional , I cant wait to use it this summer . The design is awsome and the color really pretty . The seller had it for a great price and shipped it to me quickly . Thanks .
 Used for a highschooler , great simple design without a ton of pockets/bulk , son loves it !
 This backpack is awesome . Its simple and perfect . I had one all through High School and go this one for college an it will probably last a long time ...
 this is the best thing ever . full of swagalicious products like three zippers . sexy beast bookbag will get you all them girls . so get this bookbag and feel like a god . keep the jeep ridin '
 This product is sturdy , the color is what we expected . My high school student is very happy with it.The backpack has plenty of room for eveything he needs to carry . The straps are adjustable for a comfortable fit .
 I ordered this a few weeks ago for college and its great ! It was shipped quickly and it was the cheapest out of all the places I looked at it . I use it everyday and have had zero problems with it !
 I use it for school every day . only wish it had a couple more pockets and side nets . other than that , very durable backpack .
 I like the fact the you can put stuff in it , and you could also wear it on your back . I prefer the one-strap because it makes you look a lot cooler .
 Nice backpack but not very comfortable . Straps need more padding . Only one at school with this one ' ! I would purchase another next year .
 Great backpack . My daughter ordered the hit pink and got lime green monogram . Big hit , well made , great price ! Love it .
 We have purchased many different brands of backpacks for our daughter and nothing handled up to her level of abuse other than the JanSport brand . It did n't matter what model of the Jansport bag we had bought . All of them handled up to the task and I will always purchase a JanSport backpack for ourselves as well as our daughter . That 's quality I can trust .
 My oldest started middle school this year and she wanted a black jansport backpack . I looked around and found out quickly just how expensive they were . When I looked on Amazon I was excited that the price was right in my budget !! She was so happy when it came .
 I purchased this pack to take to a MLB Baseball game . The dimensions complied with what was allowed to be taken into the ball park . Simple pack with real nice construction . Great price for the quality !
 My daughter found this backpack on ebay - price was n't bad , but I searched other online retailers and Amazon 's price saved me about $ 6 ! The color is intense , the backpack 's design is not revolutionary , but it a time-tested design which is durable and functional . It can withstand the weight of the textbooks she has to carry . It is generally true , and I find it to be the case here - you get what you pay for . Highly recommended backpack !
 This pack is perfect . It 's light by itself , so really the only weight you feel is what you 're carrying . I use this bag for my laptop , camera and a change of clothes . It 's comfortable , sturdy and I 've heard great things about Jansport packs . :-RRB- Its a smart buy for the quality and guarantee .
 Bought this backpack for my daughter and she loves it , it looks exactly like the pic and fits the description perfectly .
 Really nice backpack in LOTS of designs . I currently have this backpack in navy and since I love it . . I want to get one in a more prettier design . What do you guys recommend ? Please comment .
 i loved this backpack , the color , the accessibility , everything . Although I wish that there was a pocket on the side for a water bottle or something .
 this packpack really does live up to its name . it seems like it will last a very long time . its got a lot of room for things inside despite the fact that it doesnt look that big as well , so if you want to be able to carry a lot without feeling like you have a mountain sitting on your back you might like this . the seller i got it from was CJTECH and they shiped very fast and the backpack arrived in prestine condition . it is perfect for people anywhere from 6th grade up to 12th grade -LRB- I am in 10th -RRB-
 Super cute . Loved it . But not black in color more of a dark grey . Still like it and durable and washable like all jansport backpacks
 Finally something we agreed on ! I really like how roomy this backpack is and it has a large pocket in front for her to keep all the markers/hi-lighters/pencils / index cards etc. required !! She loved the black & white pattern and the shoulder strapps are well cushioned ! I do n't know how they carry all those books !
 it looks great , arrived fast and is a nice back pack for my college . I had one of those when I was in high school but I lost it , jansport backpack 's are the best !!!!
 Jansport is an excellent brand of backpack . They carry stylish and durable products . Jansport stands by their products and will replace if damaged from what I understand
 It was just as we expected - love the color and JasSport Quality . Came well eithin the time we expected . My daughter loves it and needed a strufy backpack this year -LRB- high school -RRB- .
 I have been using a bulky one and it was unmanageable ... this is perfect size and weight . It looks good also .
 You ca n't go wrong with a well made Jansport backpack for kids . Those cheap backpacks with cartoon characters on them that you get for cheap are exactly that ... cheap . Jansport is classic .
 This backpack is very durable and has a cute design . I 've been using it for over a year and it has n't become worn or been damaged in any way . Recommended .
 I 've only ever owned Jansport backpacks , they 're fantastic , very sturdy and hold more than it looks like they would . The colors are bright and are noticeable .
 Great Backpack ! Love the color ! The only thing , is that it gets dirty easily . I got a pen mark on the pocket , and I 'm not sure how to remove it : -LRB-
 Great item . My daughter will love decorating it . It 's great quality , and I 'm glad Jansport is that go-to back pack brand that has been around for what seems like forever ! They always hold up really well .
 jansport is a product you really ca n't go wrong with . It has a lifetime warrenty on it . if the zipper breaks just contact the company and they fix it.kids love them - my son did not need it but every few years it is nice to get a new one vs. use the old one . i donate the old ones
 I would totally recommend this book bag its super reliable !! i 've been getting one since I was in middle school .
 It was a gift to my little sister . She liked it so much . I would like to recommend it to others .
 Backpack was a gift to my grandson . He liked it very much and is very please with it . I would recommend the product to those who need a backpack for school .
 The color of this backpack is so bright and pops awesomely!I bought this backpack because my old one was falling apart and everyone where I live has some kind of Jansport , but NO ONE has this one!The backpack looks pretty tiny but it definitely is not ! I was pleasantly surprised at how much room this backpack had . I originally was debating between the Big Student and Superbreak and I am so glad I purchased this one because its perfect for travel and school.Currently I have 2 hard 1 &#34; binders , 1 3 &#34; binder , 2 3 subject notebooks , and 2 600 + page books in my backpack and there 's still a little more room.HIGHLY recommended !
 Bought this for my grandaughter who wanted it to do her own design on with markers ... it looks GREAT ! Bright white worked out great .
 Pretty much the average JanSport ! I still recommend getting a DAKINE , just because it lasts longer , but this is pretty good too .
 JanSport bags are always great
 I got this bookbag for a friend during Secret Santa . She loved it and it came fairly quickly in the mail !
 It has a lot of space for my child to hold all of the items she needs for school and it 's easy to carry and the padding is great support for your back .
 Its great and in my favorite color :--RRB- . Its great use for a college student on the run or super chic as a handbag .
 Great backpack . Durable and has plenty of room for materials . I use it to bring books lunch and activities to my job and have used it for travel as well . . Love the color options .
 I had a Jansport that was passed down to me and used throughout highschool and college . I finaly got this new one and it has a unlimited warranty on it . I know these backpacks are dependable . I would recommend it . Nice price too .
 looks great and packaging was good too . good price for product and really enjoy having it . its perfect thanks again
 This is a great book bag . It is smaller than I thought it would be . The color is so pretty though .
 its just a normal backpack , with an exceptionally awesome selection of patterns . everyone should have one , but not in my pattern because i 'm trying to be pimpin with it . perfect for social sports ; -RRB-
 Item shipped fast and arrived in perfect conditions , it has been suitable to my needs and I have nothing negative in response .
 I brought it for me son and he loves it ! It is washable and very , very sturdy . He puts a lot in it , too .
 this bag is very useful and it has a lot of space which is a good thing and i love using it !
 I love the size , the color , and the simplicity of it . It 's small , which is what I wanted for myself .
 It 's the same color . It has a lot of room , but it 's also not too big and weird . It came like a week after , ... I think you guys should consider it . : -RRB-
 I bought this bag for my son for school . It is everything we expected and more . It was the right price and size . Jansport bags are also very durable . Thanks again for quality products
 great bag , shipped in time . good to bring for college or university classes and used in casual . i like the color too .
 My son wanted a bookbag that starts out light , as he is in middle school with NO LOCKERS ! He puts so much in his bag , it gets really heavy . He wanted this bag specifically - -LRB- he saw other kids with it last school year . -RRB- It has few pockets making it simple , it 's light but it 's sturdy so it will last .
 My two eldest daughters and I all three each have one of these packs . I am a college student , they are middle school and elementary school age . These packs stand the test of time and durability and you can not beat the price via Amazon.com . And they are so cute too ! I 'd recommend these to anyone and everyone I know that needs a bookbag , or even a bag for every day events and activities . Great product !!!
 I was expecting the bag to be larger than it was . It is smaller than ordinary backpacks , but since I will be in college this fall and not carrying as many books , it is not an issue . I like the color , the quality , and the speed of shipping.The only complaint I have is that it does not have a drink carrier on the side.Thank you Amazon for your cheap prices ! : -RRB-
 I bought this back pack because its durable fashionable and i love it . It was shipped very fast and defenely recommend to buy it .
 My son wanted a Jansport for the new school year . We ordered it here on Amazon and we got it much quicker then estimated . He was really excited and the product was new and in perfect condition . Thank you .
 i like the color and its style . It looks great with its appearance with $ 25 price . It 's suitable for students .
 I love this backpack ! As for the reviews of being small , I 've carried two books , a notebook , iPad and leapfrog explorer for my daughter . Will definitely hold up ! Buy it !
 It came right on time and was the proper color and the price was as stated in their Ad . This is a very sturdy bag . I am happy as a Clam . : - -RRB-
 Purchased this backpack almost a year ago now . I knew what I was getting because my kids have used Jansport backpacks for years , and this was no exception . A year later , it 's going strong , no tears or breakage at all ... And kids have a way of throwing their backpacks around ;--RRB- Shipping was lightening fast and the price extremely competitive . My kids are always happy to use their Jansport backpacks for several years running . I would -LRB- and will someday -RRB- buy another just like it .
 Product was just as described and it arrived right when it was said to be delivered.This same backpack was double the price in the stores so it was a no brainer to buy it off of amizon even with shipping it was half the price then it was in the store.The backpack was not some no name brand either it is a Jansport which is well known name in packbacks.I am total satisfied to say the least .
 Ever since the 6th grade , I 've never owned any backpack but a Jansport . Before , I bought cheap Walmart backpacks that only lasted about a semester of school -LRB- and I do my best to take care of my things -RRB- . Now , I get one for each school year , but I still have the old ones for trips and travel . I have both the super break versions and two big student packs , and they both work great and have a sufficient amount of room . I will probably have these packs for many years to come , and I 'm quite content with that . I heart Jansport .
 really like this backpack its super strong its holds all my text books and my super heavy laptop . the backpacks are just a lil different from the ones that sell at tillys or any other store
 My daughter had been searching for the right backpack in our local stores and was unable to find one in-stock when she found one she liked . I decided to check Amazon and low and behold I was able to get her the one she originally wanted at a much better price .
 This is an awesome backpack !! I have had this backpack for about a year now and it still looks like new . I use this backpack almost everyday and it has held up well . I use this backpack to keep my planner in and as a school backpack . It 's just the right size . I think for the price , you cant get a better backpack !! I would so recommend this backpack to anyone looking for a new backpack !!
 Great Backpack ! It fits everything that i need for school ! Must buy for anybody attending school . Incredibly cheap price , compared to instore prices .
 Arrived quickly and as described . Love the JanSport backpacks . Simple and roomy for all the necessary school needs . The brand my kids will only choose .
 The color looks exactly what is shown in the picture . The backpack is strong and it is comfortable to use .
 This product is so worth the money . The back pack is so comfortable and durable . It can carry lots of notebooks and class books . If your in high school or college , this is a good back pack to purchase .
 Just as expected cool , contemporary back pack and just the right size . The material was a tad lighter than expected . Overall very happy . Thanx !
 My five year old son loves this backpack . Straps are nice and thick good shoulder support , also the organiser in the front pocket helps him sorts out his stationary .
 This is a fantastic compact book bag . It does n't have a ton of pockets or `` features '' but it is perfect for students with a small to medium amount of belongings to carry around . And you can not go wrong with a Jansport bag for under 30 bucks . Well made and highly recommended !
 Bought this for my 15 year old daughter and she loved the fact that it does n't have a ` bajillion ' pockets ! She also loved that nobody else in her school has the same one , and knows what a deal we got on this !
 Product came in perfect shape and was earlier than i expected , i was expecting it here next week or so , but it came just before starting school how great is that !!!!!!
 It 's just what I wanted !! Quality stitching , and perfect size for my two college books and supplies - if you need to carry more you might not want to get it ... its on the small side.I searched all the stores first before buying it on here-white is a hard color to find AND I ended up saving about 5 dollars . I cant say how durable it is because I just got it but it seems sturdy.good buy !
 I originally decided to purchase this brand Jansport for my 7 year old twins because last year we purchased the little cutesy hello kitty and G.I Joe character back packs . Although they were adorable the quality was horrible . I had a Jansport brand backpack throughout college 1998-2003 and I never had to replace it . In fact o still have it . My kids just started using the back pack when school started on August 17th . But I have no doubt that these back packs are made with the same quality as they were in the past . I will keep you all posted .
 Great bag for a elementary school kid . Has the necessary compartments to fit personal and school stuff . One star taken off for not having a water bottle holder .
 this backpack is great as a basic backpack ... we got it for my 11yo who fell for the colors and print and we have had Jansport backpacks before and they do hold up for lugging school books and supplies - so we are happy with this one . there are cheaper versions available but we reached a compromise with this one because it 's fun * what she wanted - well made * what I wanted : - -RRB-
 My daughter loves the color . It looks a little different than on the computer , but the real color is even better . It 's up to the Jansport quality and is used to carry school backs every day .
 My old Timberland backpack was too big and ugly . But it did n't strain my shoulders . I needed a new backpack and I was gon na pick an Everest but I saw everyone in school wearing this . I decided to get this and it 's really good . The front pocket is good for storing my iPod and pencils and stuff , and the big pocket was for my books and work . It 's easier than my other backpack because that one was a hassle trying to find my pencils . Overall , I have no complaints and it looks stylish and fits . I would recommend this to a collage student . Just do n't carry a load with it .
 I purchased a cheap knock off version of the black Jansport backpack a few years ago in Chinatown . After having that one for years and putting it through hell it finally ripped and fell apart , almost instantly . So I decided to splurge and buy the real deal . Boy is it amazing the material quality is amazing , it is very roomy , and has all the bells and whistles . Definitely a great buy .
 We got tired of replacing backpacks for school every 6 months or so and bought one of these . I had an older style that I used for 6 years with minimal wear . Lasts so much longer than the spiderman or hello kitty bags it is worth the extra money .
 Been using one of these for about 6 months to travel , take to gym , and take to work . No problems with it and it still looks brand spanking new . Very simple , clean , and surprisingly durable . If this one ever wears out I plan on purchasing a couple more .
 love it great for my laptop and running to class and not too bulky . I have a 13.5 '' laptop and it still fit
 The backpack i received was better than i expected it to be but it took over a week for it to get here when i was told that i t would take only two days.i was extremely dissatisfied with the time it took for this to be delivered .
 This backpack is ideal for my 15 year old son . It 's strong enough for him to throw around with books in it . We love it .
 I gave this Backpack as a gift to my daughter to use a a diaper bag for her new born son . It 's perfect .
 Ok ... the last time I owned a jansport backpack was about a decade ago ... so I ca n't really remember and compare the quality back then and now but I 'll tell you that for around $ 15 that amazon had the shocker pink in ... it was a steal . So to me I ca n't really tell the difference.Will make a nice gift for the `` tweenies '' god daughter or niece still in school who like it simple.This is the same model that my wife used to carry and she loved that it came in this kind of pink -LRB- shocker pink bag/dark charcoal strap and back -RRB- ... she said that if there were n't any `` unwritten rules '' to professional attire , this would 've been a practical bag to use . Fits everything she needs , not small as in , it wo n't stuff till it bursts from the zippers and is n't too big like a black hole waiting to engulf a whole set of encyclopedias.For amazon 's low pricing -LRB- $ 15 + for my order -RRB- on some of the colors , 5 stars ... but for the other color 's around 29.99 , it 's just so and so ... probably 3 stars .
 This is a super cute backpack . Not exactly for heavy school books but quite enough for in-between period loads . A great buy for the price .
 It looks smaller than what it says , but quite able to pack your huge college text books in it . Simple and clean design and light weight can save your strength to carry all the stuff you need around the campus.I only wish it had thicker zip teeth like a sport backpack , then I would have given it 5 stars .
 It seems to be made very well and has alot of room for books and/or a laptop .
 My Grand-daughter loved her new book bag for school and was verypleased with the bright colors also .
 I really like the quality of JanSport . I remember in college that this was the backpack to own ! Now that my 5 year-old will be enjoying it , our school year will be off to a great start . I also liked the many color and pattern choices available . I do n't think there will be a problem for her mistaking her backpack for a classmates ' . Other than Amazon , I have not seen this pattern available in any retail store . Yea !! The only thing I wish it had was an outside net pocket for a water bottle . I 'm told that she will need to bring one to school each day . I like the padding on the part of the backpack that rests against the child 's back . My daughter even commented on how soft it felt . We are very happy with our first `` ready for school '' purchase !
 The bag I initially ordered was out of stock becuase their inventory was off - at first I was really upset because I really wanted that color . However , they worked with me and got me a great backpack that I was very happy with !
 I was on a search for a simple backpack that would fit all of my books and binders for an affordable price . Jansport was my answer . This bag is perfect for my needs . The large component is perfect for my binders and textbooks , I can even fit books and drinks in it too . I did n't want a backpack with a lot of designs all over or bright colors as I wanted it to be semi-professional looking . I highly recommend this backpack , especially for those looking for an affordable , simple bag .
 I got this backpack for my granddaughter for Christmas . She is a backpack collector , but this quickly became her favorite . This is sturdy and put together well . We expect to get a lot of use from it . Very attractive too . We are extremely pleased with this purchase .
 Love , love , love this backpack . Perfect color , really like the size and look of it . Totally old school and functional . Shipping was fast and I 'm really glad I went with this choice .
 this is a must have backpack its really great to have ... its a heavy duty backpack that can last you through out your school year ... i love my new jansport backpack thank you
 It 's been known Jansport backpacks are of A1 quality . I just luv this newbud green color in particular .
 My bag has remained fresh since its still wrapped in plastic , but everyone should know what to expect from Jansport bags
 We bought this for our 16 year old grandaughter for school . Besides being the popular backpack to have this year , the quality and durability are good . It has held up well to the rigors of high school day ins and outs . Jansport has always made quality products . I have owned them over the years myself .
 The quality seems to be nice as does the design . I got this at 70 % off and feel like I got a great deal . I do n't know if I think it is worth the list price but if you can snag this for half off you are getting a good deal . One thing I did notice about this backpack is that it is rather small . If you are a larger person -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 1 , 195 lbs -RRB- then this is going to look silly on your back with both straps on . I carry it on just one shoulder so it 's not a big deal to me but just something to think about . It seems to be made for the 12-16 age group more so than adults . But still works for my needs .
 Arrived quickly , great value for a bag that would cost over $ 35 at a store , exactly what I ordered and saw was what I recieved in great condition .
 The Backpack is so roomy . It is great for when you are taking two or more classes at college.Also it will be great for a weekend trip somewhere . You can put all your clothes and accessories in backpack .
 i love this hoody . the piping gives it a little point of difference from the standard adidas trefoil hoodies , but it still has that ` old skool ' kinda thing.gotta say though , that this hoody is brown just as it appears in the picture - perhaps that is what ` turf grey ' means ?
 It 's the first time that I see this style , and I loved it . As usual , I got it fast.Highly recommended !!
 cuteness ^_^ i love anime patches . i have them all over my backpack .
 VERY CUTE VERY QUALITY CAME QUICK AND VERY NICE I HAVE N'T EVEN USED IT SINCE I WANT TO USE IT ON THE PERFECT THING BUT HEY ITS QUALITY AND FITS DESCRIPTION
 I purchase this backpack for my son . I did n't want one with tons of pockets and one that was too big . I was looking for a simple , basic , durable backpack , and that 's what I got . He loves this backpack and it 's held up good . We are going on year 2 with this bag and it 's still super durable and clean looking . No unraveling of strings or seams , no stuck zippers . It 's perfect ! I would highly reccommend this item .
 My high school daughter loves this backpack & selected it because her college siblings love theirs . Well-made , fair price & the right size .
 This backpack is very sturdy , and it 's the perfect size for carrying a couple classes ' worth of books . It 's also reasonably priced , which is a plus . There are only two main pockets , the body of the backpack and the front pocket , which is nice . Other backpacks usually seem to have two main pockets , which is not very helpful organizationally in the first place and sort of annoying after a while . This is also a good bag for hiking , as it 's comfortable to wear and it dries quickly . I got the navy color , and it 's very true to the picture , possibly more vibrant.Bottom line , I 'd buy it again , and I probably will .
 It 's a great book bag . Very roomy , and sturdy . The pattern is pretty
 The backpack looks very nice and the color pink bring out the details in it casual is , ore of my style and well be order more from you 'll in the future
 It was the exact replacement for the backpack I used for several years . Exactly as ordered .
 Product came in right on time , in brand new condition . Awesome brand named product for a cheap price ! Would recommend anyone who need a cheap brand name backpack !
 her favorite color is purple , so its perfect for her , she had told me to buy it for her at the mall , but me as always got on my android amazon app and checked the prices on amazon , and for sure found a better price .
 This eye-catching pattern is really with it ... with strong stitching and easy to clean finish I expect many years of good usage .
 When i got it , it was neatly in a box.Took it out no tears , no stains or spots.Brand new even came a day earlier . -LRB- :
 Perfect for going on tours when you are vacationing . Large enough to hold your necessary articles , but small enough not to be too heavy .
 I bought this for my teen daughter and she likes it alot . Very well made and perfect size , not too big , not too small .
 This is a Jansport so of course quality and durability are n't even a problem . This is the cutest Jansport bag I 've ever had -LRB- and I 've had QUITE a few -RRB- . What you see is exactly what you get . Cute purple and white argyle pattern , the back of the pack is a solid purple -LRB- maybe more of a plum color -RRB- . The zippers are silver metal with purple flaps connected for easy zipper use . Straps adjust very well so the pack can fit very snug or very loose depending on how you 'd like it . The small outside pocket has a built in open pocket inside for various items and also has two small slots made for pens or pencils . Overall great buy and of course the lifetime warranty is included with the Jansport bag . Great for college students . I used this same line of Jansport packs -LRB- in a different pattern -RRB- for the first 3 years of college with no problems .
 Great backpack ! My son goes through them like you would not believe . This time , I think he 'll have no choice but to make this one last !
 I thought it is a really nice backpack . Not to big and not to small . the only bad thing was that it got dirty after 4 days of using it because its so white ! but ofcourse you can wash it . also there are different colors too . Anyways , overall , it is a very good backpack and I still use it for everything !
 I 've one of these for 12 years ! For one of those years it was on my back every day on the back of a motorcycle . Incredibly sturdy , faded from the sun , but still going . Only now the zippers have gone out . You ca n't beat this bag .
 This backpack is really cute , and hides dirt really well ! It is big enough for what I needed for college classes . I wish it had at least another pocket , but it served its purpose really well !
 very good and efficient , is holding up very nice and no signs of wear after being used daily for one month
 Most amazing school backpack you could have!Its light weightIts comfortableLooks goodGood room not to big not to small.Good qualityCant go wrong with this !! * Ive had mine for a 2 years and still no tears or anything !
 I have had this reliable pack for years and for the cost I can honestly say this is the best backpack . Although the straps are n't the most comfortable under a heavy load and the zipper has failed on occasion , all in all this backpack has helped me through some tough times . I have carried loads in it of over 40lbs . -LRB- literally 40lb . weights -RRB- and the straps still show no signs of tearing . There 's easily enough room to hold plenty of books and and a laptop , but I would add cushioning . . It 's light , durable , and very economical , what more do you need ?
 my daughter loves this clock . She 's 7 and wanted to start waking up by herself . It works !
 This is my favorite backpack . It never fails me ... even though I do n't think a backpack can ...
 Out of all the backpacks we have purchased throughout my son 's school career thus far this backpack is their favorite . It is light weight , made well and simple . My sons have said they do n't like all the pockets other backpacks have . . they can never find their stuff . This has one large zipper pocket for books , etc. and one smaller zipper pocket right in the front for pencils , etc. . Will purchase this again .
 My black JanSport Superbreak Classic Backpack rocks ! It is very well made and constructed . The material feels great and sturdy . It holds all of my heavy college books and then some!There is a pocket inside the smaller compartment that is great for holding my wallet when I don ' feel like having it in my pocket . The bag is not too big . Its simple and just right , not bulky.The top loop is great for hanging it on the hook that 's on the door of the restroom stall when you do n't want to place it on the floor.This thing looks great in black . I was afraid that the blue background of the JanSport logo -LRB- that is on the black bags -RRB- was going to be too bright , but thankfully it is darker than it is in the photo . It is a dark navy color.This bag comes with a lifetime warranty that I doubt I will ever need . I 'm sure that this is the last backpack I 'll ever need to get ! : -RRB-
 I 've been using this bag for my commute now for about 2.5 weeks . And I have to say , so far I 've been pleased with it , except for one afternoon when we got a torential downpour . The backpack is not waterproof , but I knew this before purchasing , so it 's more of an observation rather than a complaint . This bag does n't repel water much at all , and almost all of my stuff in my bag was socking wet after 15 minutes of waiting for my bus in the rain . However , during a mist or a light sprinkle , this bag is great.I 've been a fan of Jansport bags since I was little , and they have lasted me through middle school , high school , and college , and one bag had even lasted through 9 months traveling through Europe.I chose this bag because of it 's design . I wanted something simple and black , without a lot of doodads attatched to it . The front pocket is quite spacious and holds my -LRB- very fat -RRB- wallet , phone , iPod , keys , pressed power compact and a few other things . The main compartment holds my stuffed travel pillow -LRB- which does not compress down at all -RRB- an 6 '' x 8 '' x 3 '' hardcase lunchbox , my Kindle , makeup bag , folders and paper I carry back and forth , and when I 'm not carrying my Kindle , a book , and a water bottle . My only complaint really about this bag is the lack of an outer water bottle pocket . I always have a liquid on me -LRB- I ca n't tell you how many times that 's saved me on delayed trains -RRB- and I like it easily accessible . However , with this bag , I either have to hand carry it , or put it in my bag . This is a problem in the mornings as my bottle comes out of my fridge , and by the time I get to work , the condensation has made things in my bag damp . The lack of a water bottle pocket is the only reason this bag will not be making the cut for my back packing trip through Eastern Europe next spring . Instead , I 'll be taking my other Jansport bag that 's larger and a bit heavier , but has 2 outer water bottle pockets.Overall a great bag , as long as you do n't take it into the elements , and you do n't mind not having your water bottle immediately accessible .
 JanSport backpack is a perfect size and fit for textbooks ! It goes well with my laptop as well ! A great buy for the price !!!
 I use this pack every day , and while the main compartment is huge , the front compartment could use a couple of more pockets . Other than that , it is well-made , durable and quite functional . The appearance is utilitarian but it performs pretty much as promised .
 I purchased this backpack to carry my oil paints in to give my arms a rest . This light weight back pack is roomy - tough ; takes a load of weight off this adult woman and the dots are excellent . Lots of compliments . My niece covets the dots - she will have to get her own . I highly recommend this product !
 I bought this pack for hiking . I find all JanSport products to be of good quality . I do n't like lots of `` bells & whistles '' on a day pack and this one is pretty basic . It is a decent size to allow me to carry all my necessities and some extras but not so big to tempt me into over-packing . A larger pack would be preferable for a winter hike to carry bulkier items . This pack is fully functional and if it lives up to previous Jansport packs I 've owned , then it will be around for some years to com .
 All in all a very nice backpack . My daughter could n't get too excited about the backpack as it reminded her she was going back to school . Fast shipment and nice price .
 This is your basic backpack , great for school , the beach , or a day trip anywhere . It is sturdy , lightweight , durable and can withstand teenage boys . I have used Jansport backpacks for over twenty year and they never disappoint .
 Im a college student and I have a lot of heavy books to carry around on campus and this backback is just right . Its not too heavy when I have 2-3 heavy books in it or just my work stuff . I say its a great backpack for an everyday college student but if you have to carry a big load this is not going to be for you . I like how its a simple backpack it had one big pocket for books and my laptop and a smaller pocket for my pens and other random items . I like this backpack a lot .
 Great backpack but when it came in the mail i guess it was squished and when i first put on the backpack it did n't look / feel right and it just needed some wearing before it got to feel / look right . Great backpack order one ... . I do n't know why they complain about the size its just fine but if you do need a bigger backpack they do have a bigger version of this backpack just bigger with 2 large zipper places and 2 small ones . But they do have a lot of room unless you 're crazy and carry around like 5 textbooks and 3 binders . Good size not to big or small just fine great backpack .
 The backpack is well fit , perfect size , and is a plus with only two pockets . Having multiple pockets is a hassle , you forget where you put things . Great backpack though , I recommend this to any student .
 Very Durable , but I warn you DO NOT GET THIS IF YOU ARE GOING TO GET IT DIRTY ! 1st week into school and I got a scratch on it , also you ca n't bleach it .
 I bought it to my son . He liked it very much . It 's a good quality product and seems durable . Reasonable price .
 this product was great , it was my first time purchasing from amazon and i must say it was exactly what i was looking for i did not want some cheap quality back pack . i got the real deal just what i was looking for i was very satisfied and i made my little sister very happy with her new orange back pack . the shipping was great did not wait very long received it quick and the price was great , i look forward to buying more products in the future .
 the backpack looks the same as the one online but just not as solid as I thought . But it 's worth the price .
 When I was in High School , I had a Red Jansport which I still use up to now . This is actually for my brother who had an Addidas backpack and wanted a sturdier one . I was browsing at a Sunday newspaper and saw that Sports Authority has a JanSport sale . I saw this exact color and design and it cost $ 29.99 plus tax . I checked in Amazon if they have the same style and they did ! I have a Prime Membership and it 's cheaper by $ 4 no tax . Now he 's been using it for a week and he never said anything bad about it . JanSport is a great bag especially for High School kids . They could hold very heavy books and last for 10 years .
 This backpack was soo worth the price . Although the material is quite thin , it makes it really light and comfortable even when you 're carrying around tons of things in it . the front pocket has lots of compartments and storage room and although this backpack looks small , it has LOTS of space . i 'd get this again if i needed . great backpack ! u wo n't go wrong buying this
 I love it , so good comfortable affordable price and nice shape for me for any of college student . I am suggesting you to buy . .
 When I bought this , I saw that the picture was a medium turquoise , but I hoped that there was a lighter turquoise to choose . I ordered it anyway because of its cheap price . When I got the backpack , I was really happy because it was a light turquoise ! It looked great and it gave me confidence when I walked through the school hallways .
 I had this kind of bag back when I was 6 y/o , it 's very classic . Although there 's a noticeable change on how this product was made before and how it is made now , I mean , the way they made this product before looks more `` expensive '' , today it looks like it has cheaper materials , I 'm still glad with my purchase .
 Great product :-RRB- I 've been using it for months and it still looks and functions same as the first time I used it . Satisfaction guaranteed . : -RRB-
 I 'm in college so I still need a backpack . It 's the cutest bluish purple color in person . It 's more purple than what the image shows . It looks and feels strong too , so it should last me awhile . My siblings think its nice and it 's unisex looking .
 The backpack is simple and yet still girly . I 'm not normally one for purple but it looks really a nice color . It 's great for carrying books around . The main reason I got it was because I am starting to ride a motorcycle but now I love it and would not choose anything else even when I am not riding .
 what 's not to love ... Its a JanSport . Great colors to choose from , great size even for kids in high school and they last forever . LOVE , LOVE , LOVE THEM !!
 I 've ordered this Bag for my daughter . . she loves it and happy with it . this Bag is simply cute , and very useful .
 This bag is sturdy and a great buy !!!!!!!!!! I bought this for my 14 year old who has already gone thru 2 bags and it 's only the end of october.So far so good !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 I bought this backpack for my daughter in high school and it fits it 's purpose . It 's a really nice purple color , sturdy , and fits all her books . She loves it , and the best thing was it was priced reasonable . Great product , fast shipping and I plan to order again next year !
 It 's nice and very classic . Exactly what I want ! And the shipping is fast too ~ I highly recommend it ! -LRB- It 's not as big as the other type though . -RRB- But it 's enough for school I think .
 Very comfy and extremely cute - I especially love the alien green color -LRB- easily identifiable in a crowd ! -RRB- . Ordered this two days ago and received it a day later - very pleased : -RRB-
 Back pack has all the space I need and nothing more to make it bulky . Great for me to be carrying around college , perfect size , tons of color options , and you can adjust the size to whatever you want . Cool backpack !
 I bought this backpack for my son I love it ! He loves it also . The quality is outstanding and it has a lifetime warranty . It 's water resistant .
