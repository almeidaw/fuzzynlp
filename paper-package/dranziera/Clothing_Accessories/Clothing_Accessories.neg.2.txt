 I bought three pairs of jeans in two separate orders and only one pair was right . The other two were smaller than advertised , even though the tags displayed the dimensions I ordered . I measured the waistline myself and found that one pair was just under 2 inches smaller than I ordered and the other was four inches smaller . One of them came with several belt loops torn away from the waistline . The first order had paid for my return shipping and a full refund because they were torn , but the second return was at my expense and a restocking fee is to be applied since they were not damaged.The pair that I kept were perfect in every way , so no complaints there .

 Once I opened the bag I noticed some broken stitches , I was very dissapointed , the logo is beautiful and is true to size , but the quality is very very poor
 These shirts were not what I expected . As soon as I washed them , they shrunk and did not hold their original shape . The end of the sleeves began to roll up ... and that was only after one wash straight out of the package . Will wait until I get back to the US to buy the correct type .
 This is not a t-shirt suitable for outer wear.It comes out of the wash wrinkled , a bit shrunken and with misshapen collar and sleeves.Care directions followed to the letter with the newest digital laundry equipmentokay for sleepwear and as a hidden under layer . I wo n't buy again .
 I received these shirts to wear under my flight suit but they are more of an Air Force greenish tan than brown tan . Not what I expected from the picture . Also I ordered large and the necks are huge and look like crap . I can not wear these in a military uniform . They may be good if you work as a mechanic and need a grease rag that is why I will give two stars .

 These tights are basically a t-shirt material and useless if your purpose is to keep warm . Opt for the Mec Ankle tights instead , which are more like spandex performance wear material .
 I was very disappointed because the hoodie does not match the picture . This was supposed to be a pullover hoodie and when shipped it is a Zip front hoodie . I also felt it was not good quality fabric ... rather stiff . Overall very disappointed .
 I recently purchased my first pair of these work PANTS . Size 30 x 32 . I have been happy with OTHER Dickies pants ... namely the workhorse jean with double knee . But if you are on your knees at all with these work PANTS , the lower seam of the double panel falls directly under your kneecap , making it almost impossible to kneel down on a hard surface without pain . Note that on their double knee JEANS , the reinforcement panel starts 10 inches above the bottom of the pant leg and works like it should . On these work PANTS , the panel starts 13 inches above the bottom of the pant leg . Why would they change it up like that ? I assumed when I bought them , the positioning of the knee reinforcement panel , within the same manufacturer , would be the same . When kneeling down , they ride up just enough to be too high for knee reinforcement . More like thigh reinforcement.When Dickies Customer Service was contacted for explanation , and refund , I got just the standard , non-personal form letter , not signed by anyone -LRB- but still saying to `` just call me '' if you have questions -RRB- They want me to pay shipping , handling , and insurance to send them back , and all they can do is send me another pair of the same style , size etc. . Very disappointed in this product and their customer service .
 AS SOON AS I PUT THESE ON I BEGAN DEVISING A PLAN TO RETURN THEM TO OUR LOCAL KMART FOR AN EXCHANGE ... TOOK TWO TRIES BUT I GOT THEM SWITCHED FOR A KMART BRAND THAT WAS MUCH BETTER ... AND YOU COULD SIT DOWN IN THEM .
 Im not sure if this review will link to the seller at all , but this seller is ridiculous . For one pair of pants , it took them 12 days to ship it and THEN another 12 days to arrive once they were marked as shipped , and I paid over 8 $ in shipping costs . bogus . The specific seller that i suggest avoiding is Silberman 's .
 I just purchased these double knee along with 2 regular pair of Dickie workpants . All three pair were 32 x 30 , but the pair of double knee were more like a 34 '' waist . So I am returning that pair and will try again . After reading all reviews , it seems as though the problem with fit isnt new to this company .
 Not even kidding ... brand new they are stiff as cardboard and extremely uncomfortable , especially when you walk or sit/crouch . Washing them a dozen times may help slightly , otherwise wear them everyday for a couple years without washing them.Unbelievable .
 Got my work pants and found they sent the completely wrong size . The slip with the correct size was sitting in the bag . Laziness is what I call it . Unacceptable .

 Upon trying this on , the first thing that became clear was the cheapness of the zipper , which feels like it 's going to catch and break at any moment . Secondly , the poor quality of the vinyl used makes noise with every move you make . And third , the lapels would n't fold like they are in the picture , even after I tried to weigh it down with books -LRB- heat would not be an option for the material -RRB- . There are better quality costumes out there at similar pricing , try one of those .

 Well I purchased this shirt about a week ago for and airsoft operation i was attending . When the package arrived it looked good so I did n't assume anything was wrong at that point ... Then I opened it and to my surprise the shirt was terrible . The quality of the material was horrible and the seams had been sown wrong causing the entire shirt to twist and be unwearable . I was very disappointed in the quality of this product and would suggest to pay a little more to get something that would actually be functional .
 I received these shirts to wear under my flight suit but they are more of an Air Force greenish tan than brown tan . Not what I expected from the picture .

 This is only designed to be placed on the head as shown in the picture . I was under the impression that I was buying a solid color bandanna , square piece of cloth . This fabric is sewn to only be a `` hat '' .

 Update
 Packaged nicely , seem like a quality build , but do n't fit me . I ordered the XL -LRB- 34-36 -RRB- and I am just about a size 35 , and they felt like a 33-34 on me . All the other boxers in size 34-36 I ordered fit me fine . No real way to return them since they come straight from thailand .

 I do not recommend these.I fell for this twice , as I made the purchase more than once . These were not the same as what I bought in the store . I 'm not really sure why . I honestly ca n't blame Amazon/the vendors , so perhaps a repeat of defects or inconsistency?Basically these ran quite a bit smaller than what I had expected for the size measurement . Too tight ; not good.I recommend going with American Apparel underwear . They might be bright and make me feel like a kindergartner , but at least they fit consistently and are made in the USA !

 I bought these in khaki for work . Problem is I ca n't use them for work , because in florescent light they are green . They are perfectly khaki in natural light , but in a big box retail store they are green . Yep , definitely green .
 I bought these socks for a Halloween vb tourny . I was disappointed when I got them bc they were n't what I expected . The vb socks I usually wear are thinner and these are very thick . The thing I did n't like the most about them , is that you ca n't see from the picture , but the socks themselves have a sort of ribbing to them - so you see the lines of the material and the lines of the web - not as a clean of a look as I got from the picture . Also , the inside has all the extra stitching hanging out . I got the blue ones b/c my vb shoes are white and blue , and someone jokingly asked if the webs were my vericose veins !! lol Anyways , great sock as far as socks go , but for vb , not for me personally . Plus , the shipping prices were pricey for shipping socks .
 never got to see it because shipping company carelessly left it on my porch and someone stole it along with other items . contacted seller and u.p.s. both told me basically I was out $ 45.00 . tryed to report it to amazon but they intentionally have no contact info . on their web site . live and learn wo n't shop amazon again ! thanks 4 nothing amazon
 The dress was beautiful and looked like it would of fit , but when I took it out of the packaging the flower quite literally fell apart , you could see the glue on the beading , and there was a snag in the dress . They were fast with delivery and do pay for postage . Overall , the quality of the product was poor .

 If you are looking for a more modest , relaxed workout/yoga pant , maybe these would work for you . For me , I found the fit to be baggy in most areas & overall unflattering . I put them on & my butt instantly got flatter & I looked like I gained 10 pounds - um , no thanks ! The description boasts `` maximum compression '' & I think that even if I were to order an extra small -LRB- I am 5 ' 10 '' , about 145 lbs & wear a Medium -RRB- , there would really be no compression at all . Sorry , these are a miss & I returned them . Looking for a true compression pant ? Try the Reebok Women 's Easytone Pant . I have them & love them !! -LRB- see my review on the product page -RRB- .
 I had purchased these pants with the hopes of wearing them for yoga and then able to use them in other instances . The waistband was not a waistband at all - but rather a thin piece of elastic covered by fabric - as opposed to a thicker flattering waistband allowing for easier movement in yoga.The pants also came up very high on my hips , in comparison to many other yoga pants I have had . I was not impressed - and I returned them without incident .

 I was lured into buying this due to all the great reviews people had put up and when I got the product I was sorely disappointed . First , if you have the new style passport -LRB- the one with the RFID chip in it -RRB- you will have a hell of a time getting this in to the cover as you ca n't bend the passport covers without damaging the electronics in it . Second , the quality of the leather is ok at best . nothing to rave about . Finally , inside there was some plastic covers to hold it in and they were covered with some kind of black dust that if you had n't noticed it and slipped your passport in would gotten all over the passport . So overall , a disappointment .
 I believe the manufacturer/vendor needs a lesson on the definition of embossing .1 Carve or mold a design on -LRB- a surface -RRB- so that it stands out in relief
 Several weeks ago , I had ordered a `` Genuine Blue Leather Passport Cover Holder Case Wallet '' with a gold embossed USA seal and the word `` Passport '' on top , exactly how a U.S. passport cover looks . What I received was a plain blue leather passport case with just the word `` passport '' very cheaply embossed -LRB- in gold -RRB- . I was n't even aware that it was the case I had ordered , since there was no invoice or company name on the envolope or inside ! Additionally , when I check the order status , it shows as `` not yet shipped '' so I ca n't even cancel this , and am very anxious to discontinue any further dealings with this seller .
 This item would have been just right exept for one thing . Its design is fundementally flawed , in that you must damage your passport to get it in . The sleeves on the inside leave only a one inch gap between them . I believe that other designs which have half sleeves on the inside , may work better.The quality of it 's materials and construction is exactly what I anticipated , good enough to hold up for a while with typical use , but not something that will be around for you to hand down to your kids . It looks like the gold printing and emblem on the cover will wear away , or the interior stitching will come loose , unless you handle it rather gently . This would be ok for the price of the item , exept that you can not get a passport into the thing , unless you bend one of the passport covers severely or splay it completely open , thus damaging the binding of the passport . What 's the point in getting a cover to protect your passport , if you ca n't get it into the cover without causing irreperable damage ? There is no point .
 The quality of material and its flexibility does not permit good print jobs , so the edges of printed Passport and Logo are not crisp and clear , however it might be due to leather anyway next time I will pick up a vinyl product that has crisp and clear appearance of printed material on it -LRB- logo and letters -RRB-
 I got the black version . Appears to be of high quality , however the clear plastic on the inside of holder -LRB- which holds the passport -RRB- has a 3/8 inch black strip that blocks the name information on the passport . This requires you to take the passport out of the holder whenever you must present it . Fail .

 I tried on this bra -LRB- even though I never really liked the `` Double Support '' bra in its cotton and regular versions -RRB- and thought it was worse than ever!It suffers from `` weak band syndrome '' - I fall between two band sizes , and when I tried the larger one in this style , it was ENORMOUS ! and very , very stretchy . But ! The smaller size was a LOT smaller . I have found this kind of thing a lot with Bali lately - strange size discrepancies between different styles and even within the same style . * No matter what band/cup size I tried -- and I did find one that more-or-less fit -- I did n't find the bra to be supportive or shaping . The girls were just resting on a shelf , low and rounded -- and that 's when the bra is new ! Just wait a few washings.I recommend Glamorise or Le Mystere . But I 'm a fairly biggish size , so smaller gals might do better with this bra than I did . * Bali used to be considered a fairly high-end bra brand , like back in the 60s , but keeps getting less and less appealing . I suspect that the Hanes company -LRB- bought the Bali brand -RRB- influence has been causing this change .
 I bought this product because the ad said it was made to be super comfortable ... NOT . The so called padded closure has sharp edges on the top and the bottom that scratches . Very UNcomfortable .
 I have worn this style of bra for a number of years . The first time I ordered two bras and I was thrilled . They were comfortable and supportive . So of course , when it was time for new bras , I ordered the exact same style again . When the new bras arrived , I immediately noticed that the fabric lining the inside of the band under the cups was extremely itchy . This was just from trying it on ! I compared the inside band to my old Bali bra and they looked exactly the same , so I figured I would just get used to it . WRONG ! It got worse , way worse . I ended up with a very itchy back and lumps under the closure in the back . Maybe it is just me ; maybe I am allergic to the fabric . What I do n't understand is why the first bras I ordered in this style a few years ago did not itch , yet the new ones itched immediately . Got ta wonder where these bras are made and what has changed in the fabric that they use . Read all the reviews for Bali 's , I am not the only one itching and scratching . Drag is , that it is too late for me to return these . If you buy this bra and it itches , make sure you return it in time to get your money back . Bali does not deserve to keep my money for bras that I had to toss in the trash .
 I hated this bra . Fit was terrible . Material was itchy and extremely uncomfortable . Made my girls look like they were trying to escape to the floor .
 This bra looks nice , good quality , is comfy , but does n't fit me well as far as the cup goes . Seems to pull my girls down . I want to keep them up where they belong ! I do not like the shape of this bra at all , not for me .
 I 'm barely 5 `` 4 '' and the shoulder straps on this model - when set to as long as they can be - are a tad short so that brand new this bra pulls up the portion that goes across your back . I went back over to Victoria 's Secret bra measuring guide before posting this just to be sure I was n't off . I 'd ordered the right size but the band that hooks in back is also made small , the cups are fine . These do not follow standard bra measuring guidelines .
 This bra is technically supportive , in that it lifts my 36 DDs , but it definitely does n't do so in the most flattering way . Because of the lack of padding and the weird location of the seaming , my breasts end up looking about as good as they would if I supported them by sticking one arm underneath them . Also , I 'm usually pretty round and well separated on my own , but this bra gives me slightly pointy uniboob , which I hate . The model in the picture does n't seem to be having the same problem with the middle part stretching between the cups and lifting up -LRB- would have been solved by underwire ! -RRB- , most likely because of the smaller cup size , so this bra might be better suited to women who wear C and under.As far as comfort , this one definitely is n't my favorite . The straps are on the stiff side , and since there are no wires and all the support is up to the straps , they dig a little . None of the seaming on the inside is covered , and the silky material is on the scratchy side . The worst part , though , is the clasp in the back , which has sharp bits here and there . I also want to mention that there are no cute little eyelets on the straps like in the picture . They are about as attractive as underwear elastic.I imagine all of these problems would have been solved by padding in the straps , clasp area , and cups , but hey , you get what you pay for . I 'm not returning it because it technically does what I wanted it to do , which is prevent uncomfortable everyday wobbling . However , this is going to remain an in-the-house only bra unless I can get some padded inserts . If only it were easier to find bras in my size so I did n't have to settle !
 I usually wear Bali bras , and have several of this style , thought that these were the same as the ones that I have , and these are not.The ones that I had bought before came from a retail store and look just like these , except the other ones had the stretchy shoulder straps , that make them far more comfortable . These are very uncomfortable because the shoulder straps are not stretchy at all , so they dig into my shoulders , and they do not move with you at all . They just plain hurt ! Which is not good.It would have been great if they mentioned that the shoulder straps are not made of stretchy material , had I known in advance , I would n't have ordered them .
 THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST BRA THAT I HAVE EVER , EVER PURCHASE ... AFTER HAVING A BABY I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO GIVE ME SUPPORT AND COMFORT , AND THIS BRA FALLS WAY SHORT ON ITS PROMISE ON EITHER . I THOUGHT THAT AFTER READING SUCH ` GOOD ' REVIEWS ON THIS BRA THAT I HAVE FINALLY FOUND WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR BUT I WAS PROVEN WRONG.MY HUSBAND AND I WAS SO DISGUSTED WE LITERALLY WENT INTO THE BCKYARD AND LITE IT ON FIRE !!! CHEAP BUT NOT EVEN WORTH A PENNY !!!!
 I am a 36DD , 27 y.o. female and I was looking for a bra that could support me and at least be a little cute for me to wear under shirts with no cleavage popping out . I tried this bra out and it dug into my skin . I like the look of it but , obviously , comfort comes first . I tried to send it back but it must have been lost en route back to Amazon because I have n't heard anything about it .
 I just received this bra in the mail , and I have to say , I was expecting better . It lifted me up a little , but it did n't hold anything in hardly at all . I 'm a 34C .
 I bought three pairs of jeans in two separate orders and only one pair was right . The other two were smaller than advertised , even though the tags displayed the dimensions I ordered . I measured the waistline myself and found that one pair was just under 2 inches smaller than I ordered and the other was four inches smaller . One of them came with several belt loops torn away from the waistline . The first order had paid for my return shipping and a full refund because they were torn , but the second return was at my expense and a restocking fee is to be applied since they were not damaged.The pair that I kept were perfect in every way , so no complaints there .

 I have been wearing Fruit of the Loom undershirts for nearly 40 years . They have gradually changed over the years , but the changes were generally acceptable . A few months ago , I purchased some new crewneck undershirts in a 5-pack similar to what is being sold here at Amazon.I will likely never again purchase undershirts from Fruit of the Loom.First , as other reviewers have pointed out , the shirts are thin . They are , in fact , the thinnest I have ever owned . Brand new , they were thinner than the ones that I had been washing and wearing for years.Second , the fit is terrible . The sleeves are too short -LRB- the picture provided by Amazon is misleading -RRB- , but the collar/neckline is too high , often revealing itself from underneath fully-buttoned buttondown dress shirts . They are also a bit short , more easily becoming untucked than my older undershirts.As a result of these problems , I have come to prefer my OLD undershirts to the NEW ones , instead of the other way around.I will likely be buying Hanes-brand undershirts from now on .
 I purchased these T-shirts last week along with a competitor 's T-Shirts -LRB- Dockers 4 Pack -RRB- . When I opened both packages and saw a significant difference , I decided to do a technical comparison for Amazon shoppers . I measured two shirts from each package both before and after washing them for the first time . I used warm water and the warm dryer setting . Despite the claims by Fruit of the Loom , their T-shirts are not `` softer fabric and shrinks less '' . Both brands of shirts shrank by the same amount in every measurement . They shrank at least an inch in width and 1.5 to 2 inches in length.Although the Fruit of the Loom shirts are nearly 1/2 the price -LRB- $ 3.66 each vs. $ 6.11 each -RRB- , I would encourage you to chose the Docker T-shirts . After washing , the Docker T-shirts are whiter , softer , and nearly one size larger . If these two brands were close in quality , I would not have spent my time to do this comparison . But the quality of the Docker shirts is significantly better that the FTL shirts . If you want a soft and comfortable T-shirt , pay the extra for a better shirt .
 I have 10-15 year old Fruit of the Loom white T 's that are my favorite undershirts . They fit me like a glove , are made of quality material , and are very comfortable . This current cut of shirt is horrendous ; I immediately threw them in the garbage after giving it 2 cycles through the washer/dryer to see if it helped.You see , a fit-to-moderately-fit person will not fit into these shirts . I 'm a basic 170 lb , 6 ' frame and typically wear medium shirts . A decade ago these shirts fit perfectly . Now , I lay my old cut of Fruit of the loom on top of these new ones and what do I see ? There 's about 2 inches of extra fabric in width . Basically , unless you are overweight , this will basically fit like wearing a square cardboard box.Not only that , they managed to completely screw up the sleeves . The new sleeves hitch up about 2 inches higher than their old cuts , making it so that it constantly cuts into your armpit . Furthermore , they somehow attached X-large sleeves onto the medium shirt . If you do n't have bodybuilder arms , you will have 2 sails flapping off of either arm . Heck , look at the official pics on the website and you can see this ; even the super-cut models wearing these t-shirts are somehow made to look awkward.CAVEAT
 Just the collar alone is enough for me not to wear this T-shirt any more and I do n't know what FOTL was thinking on this design . The back portion of the collar is half the width of the front but I was willing to live with that . However what I ca n't deal with is that both collars starts rolling back on itself . If I would 've noticed this weird collar design before I washed them , I would 've taken them back.Also , the first time out of the dryer they shrank more than expected . That 's when I held it up and looked at the collar and thought how strange it was . I wore it anyway . It was n't long before the collars rolled over onto itself that it appeared I was wearing a girls shirt with piping ... I 'm laughing thinking about how silly I looked but I 'm out of good money . I will say that the material felt nice and I love that there are no tags . Although they did shrink more than usual I was willing to look past that but if you are particular about the collars on your undershirts like me , then I 'd avoid this brand until hopefully they change designs.FOTL does have a satisfaction guarantee in which they 'll replace or refund my money but I have to ship the shirts to them . No thanks . I 'll just do my part to make sure other guys know about the collar issue and just be happy that I have new shop rags .
 I seldom post reviews , but I have to now . I purchased these because I wanted the `` thinner '' `` undershirt '' -LRB- see prior discussions on these topics -RRB- . The good news is that they are thin as a undershirt should be . The bad news is that that they are useless . I bought a package and sent them to the washer . I washed in the warm/cold combo , dried them only to damp , and hung them to complete drying . Then I tried them on . Wow . Either there was carnival prize t-shirt shrinkage or they came off of the kid 's line-up initially . They were tiny . They were so tiny I actually measured . The length of the sleeve underarm , in a size large , was 2 1/2 inches.I took them back and bought some Hanes . Washed and dried them the same way . They fit like they should , and had another two inches in under-sleeve length . Huge difference in quality.Beware the Fruit on this one .
 I was happy with the first go around with these , but after 1 wash they became a wrinkled mess . That would n't be a big deal , but the collar was all folded and looked terrible . I 'm on the hunt for a new brand ...
 Just remember that t shirts like these shrink . I 'm lazy when it comes to shopping but next time I 'll carry my butt to the store . Shrinkage is awful . Order a size up please esp if your man has a gut or is tall . Too much shrinkage for me . Waste of money and time .
 what else can I say ? they are practically see through . material so thin , i can see my body in the mirror in a well light room . it is thinner than the Fruit of the Loom i have wore for three years . -LRB- but from what i have gathered , all brands are like super thin now ? -RRB- Use five star review : - material
 Historically a trusted name brand . Took a chance and the shirts are a very poor quality that after two washes are not holding their shape . I wont by this product again .
 I wear undershirts nearly every workday , so I 've gone through quite a bit . I have purchase Fruit of the Loom a few times at my local Wal-Mart or Target , and they serve me well enough for the small amount I spend on them.I found them on Amazon on a great Buy One Get One Free deal . I always need undershirts , so I tought , `` why not ? `` Well , I love a great bargain , but you get what you pay for . I have compared these to the Hanes shirts in my undershirt collection , and I have noticed that the Fruit of the Loom variety seems remarkably thinner and wears out considerably faster . I also notice they get that dingy , dull `` worn '' look much faster than other undershirts I 've worn in the past.Pass this one by .
 These look like cotton t-shirts , but feel very coarse and scratchy . I would not buy them again . How now brown cow .
 The T-shirts were so thin , you could almost see through them ! These were purchased for a Christmas present . I had to run out -LRB- 3 days before Christmas -RRB- and buy new ones that did n't look so cheap ! The only good thing I can say is they were delivered early enough that I had time to replace them !
 The large size is generous . The material is aboutthe thickness of a tissue . the shirt on the model isof a higher quality then the actual -LRB- in hand -RRB- product.I used to trust Fruit of the Loom , but their qualityhas been lowered to poor . I imagine it 's from thepoor quality fabric they buy . the actual fabrication -LRB- sewing -RRB- is good , it 's just so flimsy.NEW REVIEW
 These shoes are not practical . The ribbons just wo n't stay on my legs no matter how unbearably tight I tie them around my legs . The rings the ribbons go through are cheap and the ribbons fall through the gaps most of the time , so the ribbons fall out before I even get to try to make them stay on my legs . These shoes suck !
 This is a really cute Tinkerbell costume ! The problem is the size . On the package it says that it will fit up to size 16 , however it does not . I could barely squeeze into it . While trying to get out of the costume some of the sheer material ripped , so now I 'm stuck with a costume that does n't fit . My friend bought another costume by Disguise and it said it would fit up to a size 14 and it fit me with plenty of room for breathing and some more . I would not advise anyone over a size 6 to buy this one . Also , it is very short . I could n't find any reviews or more info on the costume before I bought it , so I hope this helps others looking for costumes .
 Do n't trust the sizing on this costume . I 'm a 10 and squeezed into it , but it 's much better suited to about a size 6 .
 They looked OK for a low-priced pair of Vinyl Gloves . However , these should come in two sizes -LRB- S-M & L-XL -RRB- , as they are too big -LRB- way too -RRB- for small hands like mine . I ended up not using it as I thouhgt I looked like wearing men 's gloves -LRB- not even for a costume which is what I bought these for -RRB- . So , in sum , if your hands are somewhat big , you can go ahead and get these , but for smaller hands they definitely do n't look good .
 I have a thing for gloves . All kinds , especially leather ones . But , ordered these . They really are n't as `` wet '' look as I thought they would be . They actually DO appear to look like more of a satin glove . But , for the price , I just kept them .
 If you are looking for a more modest , relaxed workout/yoga pant , maybe these would work for you . For me , I found the fit to be baggy in most areas & overall unflattering . I put them on & my butt instantly got flatter & I looked like I gained 10 pounds - um , no thanks ! The description boasts `` maximum compression '' & I think that even if I were to order an extra small -LRB- I am 5 ' 10 '' , about 145 lbs & wear a Medium -RRB- , there would really be no compression at all . Sorry , these are a miss & I returned them . Looking for a true compression pant ? Try the Reebok Women 's Easytone Pant . I have them & love them !! -LRB- see my review on the product page -RRB- .
 I had purchased these pants with the hopes of wearing them for yoga and then able to use them in other instances . The waistband was not a waistband at all - but rather a thin piece of elastic covered by fabric - as opposed to a thicker flattering waistband allowing for easier movement in yoga.The pants also came up very high on my hips , in comparison to many other yoga pants I have had . I was not impressed - and I returned them without incident .
 Warm , but too short -- and I have a short torso ! Blah blah that was truly all I had to say
 This is a beautiful case . The leather is buttery soft . It also matches perfectly with the lining and leather of my Coach Chelsea handbag . However , the case is extremely small . With five business cards in each side of the case , it does not close properly . I 'm not sure what this could really be used for effectively . Credit cards do n't fit at all ; they 're too large for the sleeve.So , unfortunately , while it is gorgeous , I have yet to find a practical use for it due to the size .
 I first purchased these boxer briefs years ago and they were an excellent fit . However , Fruit of the Loom apparently redesigned them because the fit is now terrible . They are very tight and constricting . Avoid .
 These underwear run small like 2 sizes smaller then what I would wear in any other brand . Will not purchase again .
 The seam near the waste came undone before I even wore one of the 3 . Just washed them after I got them . Comfortable . First time trying this style . But I imagine like the hanes products that are sold dirt cheap they will stretch and elastic will be useless in no time at all . But I do n't want to spend $ 15 for one pair of `` designer '' underwear . So ... Update - if you do n't like boxers you wo n't like these . There is no support . Nothing `` brief '' about them . Support is there for a minute . Take 3 steps and ... just dangle . Every time I sit down I feel like a nut cracker is being used ... down there . Ouch !!!
 I usually find fruit of the loom products to be acceptable , this particular package does not meet any standards . After only two times in the wash the waistband is unraveling from the short . They were far too expensive to be so poorly made .
 I have purchased other fruit of the loom boxer briefs and these that I just purchased are less in quality than I purchased at a store .
 The construction and fabric are less than what I was looking for . I returned them and found something better at the local discount store . Also , the image showed &#34; trunks &#34; but what was shipped were shorter in the legs and not at all what was described in the ad .
 Boxer briefs much smaller than usual , and material very scratchy and uncomfortable ! It appears that Fruit of the Loom has lowered their quality and standards .
 Did I make a big mistake . I bought the robe as a birthday present . My sister did not want it because it was the wrong style and the wrong color . I sent it back , and now I 'm only getting $ 37.00 back when I paid $ 47.00 . Besides I paid $ 9.00 for shipping when I received it , and $ 10.00 shipping when I sent it back.What does that mean . It had hardly been taken from the plastic bag because she saw immediately it was n't what she wanted.How can a company reduce the refund by that much ? Altogether it cost me $ 66.00 , and I 'm receiving a credit card refund of $ 37.00 . I disgusted and am a lot smarter now . No more ordering from Amazon or from their website .
 the photo makes it appear solid . it actually has a pattern which everyone in my family of 7 finds hideous . My wife refused to let me wear it and threw it out .
 The shirt is NOT at all of a good quality . It does not worth $ 6 at all . I doubt if it will come for a single wash ! Please save your money and buy a better quality shirt .
 I ordered two for its low price.It arrived 2 weeks afterward -LRB- usually only needs 1 week -RRB- and when I opened them up , I was amazed by its stunning cheap quality and unapproachable bad workmanship.The threads are flimsy and cloth is coarsely fabricated and it 's only about 30 % cotton . The cuffs and collar are flimsy too and I wonder if it gon na deform after machine wash.I was wondering why Amazon sell such junk peices ... they may get it for free somewhere?Anyway , if you are looking for something you can wear more than one wash , keep away from it .
 I only bought this shirt because it carried a known brand name.you wo n't beleive how cheap its quality is.the fabric is too thin . Do n't try to pull any loose thrid because you will tear the whole thing apart . I think a paper shirt will be more durable !
 This shirt is just too thin . I 'm not real picky with my dress shirts but this shirt is thinner than my under shirt .
 I did not like the texture/material . The fitting was also loose for me . Having used Eddie Bauer cotton shirts , these shirts were disappointment .
 These shirts were not what I expected . As soon as I washed them , they shrunk and did not hold their original shape . The end of the sleeves began to roll up ... and that was only after one wash straight out of the package . Will wait until I get back to the US to buy the correct type .
 This is not a t-shirt suitable for outer wear.It comes out of the wash wrinkled , a bit shrunken and with misshapen collar and sleeves.Care directions followed to the letter with the newest digital laundry equipmentokay for sleepwear and as a hidden under layer . I wo n't buy again .
 I received these shirts to wear under my flight suit but they are more of an Air Force greenish tan than brown tan . Not what I expected from the picture . Also I ordered large and the necks are huge and look like crap . I can not wear these in a military uniform . They may be good if you work as a mechanic and need a grease rag that is why I will give two stars .

 Well I purchased this shirt about a week ago for and airsoft operation i was attending . When the package arrived it looked good so I did n't assume anything was wrong at that point ... Then I opened it and to my surprise the shirt was terrible . The quality of the material was horrible and the seams had been sown wrong causing the entire shirt to twist and be unwearable . I was very disappointed in the quality of this product and would suggest to pay a little more to get something that would actually be functional .

 Disguise is one of the largest costume manufacturers in the world . They have the exclusive license for Disney costumes * . Disguise is a wholesale company and the consumer can not buy directly from them . But all the other companies that sell Disney costumes get them from Disguise , including Amazon . I am also one of those companies
 The size that they give is misleading ! On the package that I recieved , the costume said that it is a size 12-14 . Now I know that America is becoming more obese , but when did the standard size become 12-14 ?! When I tried to return it , the company never answered their phone and never returned my emails ! Do n't every buy anything from them !

 Product is too small and I have no idea how to exchange it . Way too complicated . I wo n't be using Amazon .
 The same time i tried to correct the size and they would not let me
 This product is misleading , the sizes are waaaaay off . I have a wonderful brand new pair of shorts that are going to goodwill I guess .

 Fits well , does not hold breast in place and the bottom seam rolls.Feels uncomfortable . You have to keep unrolling all day.Straps are nice .
 I bought it because Im large chested and the elastic band keeps twisting and curling . Not happy with the purchase : -LRB-
 After hearing all the great things about this bra , I bought it for running and was excited to give it a try . Boy was I greatly diappointed . This bra is flimsy and did not provide any support . I 'm only a 36B , I do n't know how anyone larger could like this bra . My old Champion bras give much better support . I returned this bra , the material was thin , provided no modesty coverage and had no support . I ca n't see how it 's rated to be a high support bra for running .
 I wear a 34D bra , and ordered this in the same size . The bra was ok in the band measurement , but the cup size was a B , at most . It was ridiculously tiny and also weirdly centered . If your breasts grow out of your sternum , I suppose this will work . This was definitely not a size D or C bra . It was labeled 34D but in actuality must have been a B to be this tiny . Returning . Disappointed . All 3 bras I bought from this brand are going right back and I am never buying from them again . Stick to Nike , Under Armour , Adidas .
 I 'm so confused . I thought this was a supportive sports bra for C 's and up ??? I needed another sports bra for my high cardio workouts , and contemplated buying this for the longest time -LRB- I have previously bought a moving comfort racerback bra that I love but is now no where to be found -RRB- and seeing that there was over 300 reviews figured it would be awesome ! Bought my regular bra size , which fits great and I love the non-racerback/velcro straps design , but here 's the thing . When you say a sports bra is supportive , I 'm thinking supportive under the bust and it keeps the ladies from BOUNCING . One of of two ai n't bad right ? It 's definitely supportive under the bust , but the bouncing ? I was simply trying it on and jumped up a down a couple times , and I could n't handle all the bouncing . Oh and it 's barely lined ! So beware ! Because if it 's cold in the room , others will definitely know . This is definitely going back .
 The moving comfort Fiona bra would have been met my needs had it had truly molded cups like Hind -LRB- Saucony motion -RRB- or Under Armour -- it lacks suppression cups and the thin fabric coverage caused nipple show through and rub so it really is not useable for running for me -- fine for yoga but not for other sports . It is supportive but the hooks in the back are difficult to do even when the bra hooks are done up front so this one went back . Instead I purchased the Under Armour Endure zip front in D cup -LRB- comes in S , M , L with D cup -RRB- , which though runs a little small , provides good support , easy removability -LRB- a plus after a good workout -RRB- . I loved it so much that I bought several of these . I wish bra manufacturers would add some color and ease of removability to the sports bra selection . I am sick of the black or white options . The colored sports bras usually are less supportive and pull off variety . Hind made some excellent ones but Saucony has gone back to black and white.I rated this low because of 1 -RRB- insufficent fabric for good nipple coverage and comfort up front ; 2 -RRB- difficult to hook when compared to other bras with back hooks .
 I wanted to love it . . all the glowing reviews gave me immense hope . Seriously , I do n't understand the attraction . Wish I had returned it , instead of giving it the chance it did n't deserve . : -LRB- It 's awful !! 1 . Offers very little support and zero bounce control .2 . Flimsy . No structure whatsoever .3 . A limp , shapeless piece of fabric .4 . Cups are strange and loose .5 . Bottom band shifts out of shape in the front , turning and twisting .6 . It 's very noticeable under tee shirts.I measured carefully , per instructions . The result was my usual bra size . That 's what I ordered and it 's so oversized ! The cups seem huge.Bummer .
 Tried this bra . I am a DD , and this was not nearly supportive enough while running . Also , the straps adjust at the front/shoulders , and that extra bit of fabric really rubbed on my skin , and a week later I still have actual scabs from it . I would highly recommend going with the Enell sports bra , it is so worth the extra money .
 I have another sports bra like this but this one is not very good - the way the straps are built rub against my inside shoulder . Also the back end adjustable strap is too clunky and also rubs . No way I could wear this for a long run - which is why I bought it as a marathoner .
 It 's not like the picture at all . I expected firm cups and more contouring and shaping and it is not . It is just like a soft cup , wireless bra . I wanted something that supports my breasts so that I can move , like run , or jump rope , but it does not do that . I am returning it : - -LRB-
 Although the design is good -LRB- adjustable straps and Three plush-backed hook-and-eye rows on band , as described in Product Features -RRB- , but the material used is something that gets malodorous just in 2-3 hours . I have other brands I can use several times before such a bad smell is felt ! So it 's not my body problem , but the quality.And there 's also no cup as described in product features ! Honestly , I spent this much for getting these cups . Actually this was the distinguishing feature I was craving , and it made me happy when I read here that it has cups . But when I received it , there was no cup!So I feel it has really been a waste of money .
 bra does n't have padding in the front so when it is cold everyone can see know what happens . otherwise it fits ok but does n't provide the support a sports bra should . It fits like a regular bra so it 's not a good buy for a sports bra
 Just purchased this bra and was very disappointed . I am a runner and DD cup . There was no support . The bra was also very stretchy , so it felt loose . I do not recommend this for any big-busted girl doing high-impact activities .
 I was a bit disappointed with this bra , as a 38D I did n't find it supportive enough for my sports needs . I found the Juno much better .
 This bra did n't offer enough support for larger cup sizes . I 'm a 36C , and I run and play soccer . I 've tried many different sports bras and this one did n't come close to supporting my chest while running . I felt the material was way to stretchy to prevent `` bounce '' and keep everything strapped down as a good sports bra should .
 I did n't like this bra as well as the other one I had bought at the same time -LRB- same company , different style -RRB- , it fit different and I did n't like the Velcro straps . I returned it .
 So I rarely review anything online , but I really just wanted to say few things about this bra.so someone else does n't get caught out.im a 38d with a 27 waist so im just big on top . . and I can not get over d reviews by people with bigger bust than me , dunno how they were supported by this bra.it is honestly for me anyway , was a glorified shelf tank top , absolutely no support total bounce and just very light.sports bras arent supposed to be VERY comfortable so I knew once I put it on that it was n't gona be much use for running.i log 35 + miles a wk , its prob good for yoga etc low impact sports.i would highly recommend the Juno great great bra for running or the enell 100 , this is only my experience but I have it now and ca n't return it so tis a bit of a waste.good luck gals .
 This sports bra offers minimal support . I bought it based on reviews and that it called itself a high motion control / high impact sports bra . I went jogging in it once and hated it .
 For starters , I am a 34DD in my mid twenties and to me this bra is only useful for yoga at home . I purchased this bra because of all the amazing reviews , which I now totally disagree with . I enjoy running , hiking , yoga , and gym activities.The disapointment started with the look of the bra , as a curvy woman I hope to at least look like one , but in this I felt like a B. I told myself to suck it up , because nobody cares at the gym . On the drive to the gym , I found myself wobbling in this bra , bad sign . The `` molded cups '' they claim to have are nothing more than a very thin layer of tightly shaped fabric , nothing like say , the Juno . Additionally , the only way to avoid a lot of movement is to tighten the straps to the point that your shoulders end up hurting by the end of cardio , before I can even get to strength training . I get that enough in my daily life.The two biggest failings were ones I encountered on a hike . The `` compression '' aspect of the bra does nothing more than mash you together . Beneath the thin fabric the girls are free to wobble about and between them there is no breathing room . To put it lightly , I was uncomfortably sweaty and still wishing for a real sports bra . While walking ! Then , when a cold wind blows , anybody around is free to see exactly how chilly you find it . Embarassing , to say the least.I honestly do n't understand how this is a high impact bra recommended to women my size . I gave the company a second chance and picked up a Juno on sale . After just one gym use I love it so much more in every way . I look good and I feel good . We 'll see how it holds up on a hike . Do not buy this online if you are curvy , try it in a store . Even on sale , now I 'm out that money because I was desperate for a sports bra .
 I 've been looking for a new sports bra and when I researched this one , it sounded like just the ticket . I 'm a little over 50 and wear a 34DD . The bra is well made and comfortable , but there really is n't much support . It may be enough for a younger woman or someone with small breasts , but it did n't work for me at all . Darn it , I loved the green !
 I was fairly disappointed with this bra . The materials are good quality and construction is clean -LRB- no weak seams , loose threads -RRB- , but bounce control was n't optimal and some of its `` features '' actually hurt a bit . I usually use two fairly cheap compression sports bras and can achieve minimal movement with them . This bra felt like 1.5 of those bras and cost about 2x more . The straps are looped through a slit at the top edge of the front of the bra and are secured by Velcro . You adjust them by unlatching them , pulling them tighter , and reattaching to the Velcro strip . This system is far inferior to the normal sliding adjustment most bras have . The straps dig into my skin at the point of attachment , and by the end of a workout those two spots on my chest are really sore.Pros : Good materialsGood constructionCons : Straps hurtStrap adjustment system is badBounce control is just so-so given the price
 Bought this sports bra in a 32D based on reviews that said it is `` true to VS sizes '' , but I did not find this to be true . My VS size is 32D , but the cup size on this bra is huge . I plan on returning it , but I 'm debating going down to a B or C cup size -LRB- it 's really that big -RRB- . Chest size fits perfect though . I do love that it functions like a regular bra with the back closure since I do the `` sports bra hop '' to get out of my other MC bras . I just ca n't give it a better rating because I ca n't wear it in the size I got .
 i 'm actually not a 32B but am a 30B/C , and got this thinking , sports bras are usually too tight so why not try the next size up ? well , this was so tight i had to return it . i could barely breathe with it on , and it squashed my chest without supporting it . felt like one of those chest-binder things . the good
 Despite the Moving Comfort &#34; bra finder &#34; on their website giving this bra as an option for a 40DD doing high impact activities such as running , I found this bra to be almost completely lacking in support . By the end of my run , I was clutching my boobs in my hands to keep them from knocking me unconscious.Additionally , the lining is only stitched to the body of the bra at the edges , so after wear , the bottom band has rolled up so much that the lining is all but hiding the main fabric.It looks like Enell is going to be my next stop .
 not the same fit as others of the same brand , model purchased the same size . Factory defect ? You tell me . ran larger than normal
 It was small in & tight u would need almost 2 sizes bigger , I 'm a 38c but this was no way close ,
 I love this bra , it 's made extremely well and i was excited to find it in my small band but semi-large cup size . But I returned it , bcuz the only reason I chose this bra was because the description said it had molded cups . It does n't . I tried it on and had MAJOR `` poke thru '' and that 's just not cute . I 'd never leave the house like that so Unfortunately I returned it . had it had molded cups -LRB- like the description said it did -RRB- , I would hve kept it and it would hve been easily a 4 star , maybe 5 .
 If you are larger in the bust area and do high impact aerobics , this bra is not for you ! It does n't look good either . It does not create a separation between your bust . I thought I had finally found a good sports bra , and once I received it in the mail and tried it one , I was so disappointed .
 this sports bra has okay support , however there is nothing to cover up how cold you are ... The adjustable sraps are weird , I guess you could get use to it , but the straps are secured with velcro which if I remember correctly from the 80 's does not last very long .
 Found out after I was sent an email that the product had been shipped that it was on backorder and was refunded my money . I should have never been able to order it if it was on backorder .
 I found immediately after putting it on that the adjustment velcro on each strap was very uncomfortable . They are located in the front of the bra , and felt like two big bulges pushing in underneath each side of my collarbone . I have heard great things about MovingComfort , so I do n't think it means their other bras are unpleasant . I just found out that this one would n't work for me .
 I bought this in my normal size 38D but it is too big . I will keep it anyway because I do n't want to hassle with an online return/exchange when I am not sure what my correct size should be in this bra . I have to wear this on the last set of hooks and put the straps up as high as they will go , then it is okay for strength training and low impact cardio , but the fit is still too loose to support high impact activities . The other thing I do n't like is that the material is very slippery , so it is hard to fasten the hooks . On a positive note , the colors are beautiful . I got the mojito , which is a nice bright green . A lot of sites only offer basic black or white , so you may need to shop around to find the pretty colors .
 I usually do n't take the time to write reviews , but I do n't want anyone else who is looking for a supportive sports bra to waste there money . This bra offers no support at all ! I bought this bra for my daily walks hoping it would offer me average support . All I can say is that It offers NO support at all . I can say that It is comfortable , that is if your looking for a bra to wear while sitting on the couch . However if you actually need support because your active , KEEP on looking this is NOT the bra you want . People who gave this bra positive reviews must have implants or have never had children .
 To start off , I returned the Moving Comfort Fiona Bra . The material is very thin -LRB- 2 layers thin -RRB- . Fiona has absolutely NO nipple coverage . There are no ` cups ' in this sports bra . Secondly , yes it does have adjustable straps , but they are velcro and fasten under the straps . I like to do a mix of excercises , but mostly cardio . I tried doing jumping jacks with this sports bra on . It offerd moderate support , the ladies did some bouncing . I did n't feel like there was enough lift or support for high impact activity . I am a 36-38C and ordered a 38C . It had an ok fit . Not too tight , but not too loose either . -LRB- That is with it fastened as tight as it would go . -RRB- If I were going to keep it , I think a 36C would fit better . Overall , it is fine if you do n't mind nipple show , a few bounces , and the velcro straps . If you want compression and minimal bounce , take a pass .
 Seemed well built , but not true to size order bigger than you are . cup size OK but around smaller than regular bras .
 This style/make of bra is not for a full figured woman . There was no support at all for a 44D/DD size . Needs more padding/support .
 No molded cups . . so this can not be a high impact support bra . . it 's ugly w / o cups . . color is as shown . .
 I read that this bra fit small but I did n't really expect it to be as small as it was . I wear a 34C on the loosest hook so I ordered a 34C and when I recieved it , I was disappointed to find that it did n't fit well at all . I could do it up but it was n't comfortable . Reading other reviews , I thought it would have more padding then it did . Even though my boobs were pancaked , due to the fact the bra was too small , the bra still showed headlights . The adjustable straps is a great feature but I do n't think I 'll be ordering this bra again in a different size .
 For me , this was way too tight . I 've never had a 40D bra be this tight . I 'm all for support but this was just constricting and uncomfortable and so I 'll send it back . I 'm really disappointed because if it were just a tad bigger in the band I would have kept it . I 'm not quite sure how this can be considered a size 40 .
 I bought this bra after reading all the great reviews and have to say I am very disappointed . The bra is very well made and fits comfortably , although you have to take care to get the velcro on the straps lined up perfectly to prevent it digging into your shoulders . If I was just wearing it for walking it would be fine , but I wore it to a Zumba class and it was anything but okay . First of all , I was bouncing all over the place . The worst part though was that when I took it off after the class , I had never seen such a wet bra . So much for the wicking material . Even my old compression bras keep me drier . In short , not for high impact and not for women who sweat when they work out .
 I loved this sports bra . However , the last time I washed it the clasp end of the back had completely melted ! The bra is now completely useless .
 Two years ago I bought this bra for my grand daughter who plays volleyball and she loved it because it gave her good support and no bounce -LRB- 38DD -RRB- . The new lining is n't as good as it once was and therefore she wanted me to return it and look for a bra with more support . I am disappointed with the changes to a once great sports bra .
 There is nothing good about this bra . It does n't move , true . It flattens , true . Does it do that well?NO !!! To use a common metaphor , the headlights are still on and visible . If it worked for others , I 'm glad . Me ? No ! Wished I had returned it .
 I would not recommend this sports bra . After trying the Maia and Juno , I was very disappointed in this sports bra . The straps are kind of bulky and did n't line up very well . I did not find this sports bra to be very supportive and it seemed awkward to adjust .
 I read the reviews and ended up ordering this bra . I 'm a 40D - this thing was not comfortable at all . Sure it had support but I ended up returning it .
 Mia bra has so much more support . Did n't realize this one did not have underwire . Gives you a uni-boob . Thought I 'd try it to see if this was any cooler but it is n't . Would not recommend this for any high impact aerobics . Mia does not let you move an inch & keeps you from having uni-boob . Wish they would come up with a seamless version , though . But , this is better than a regular bra for sports & it does hook in the back . One thing to be careful , though , is the velcro strap adjustments . Get them precise or the velcro will rub your arm pit area .
 At first I really liked the bra , it definitely holds my DDs in place , but it puts SO much pain and pressure on my shoulders . I only wear it in moments of desperation now : -LRB-
 Bra fit well , but it did n't provide enough support . When I tried it on , there was as much bounce as if I were wearing a regular bra -- not a sports bra . I would not recommend this bra for high or even medium impact sports .
 I own two Maia 's by Moving Comfort so I tried this one out when I found it on sale . It does n't have underwire , I had total uniboob . The band at the bottom would n't stay put , it kept rolling up a bit . I bought a 38C , the same as I wear in the Maia , but the weird uniboob look is just too unflattering . I may try wearing a regular bra underneath , but I never do that with the Maia . I would n't wear it unless my other two are n't clean .
 I figured this HAD to be a great bra with all of the glowing reviews from other busty ladies , but it failed to deliver . Not comfortable , does not support well and just creates a big `` uniboob '' look like all other sports bras . Go with the Champion Powerback if you are looking for support , lift and separation in a sports bra and you have large breasts .
 If you 're a petite woman , I do not recommend this bra . To achieve any control of the bouncing at all , I had to pull the straps so tight , that the bra almost cuts into my armpits , because it 's sides are too wide .
 My Moving Comfort Cara works beautifully for yoga , running , and backpacking . When I tried to order another Cara , the seller sent a Fiona instead . I tried it out to be fair . Unfortunately , it felt like a grudge against my breasts
 I ca n't see how this bra is any better than much less expensive ones that pull on over your head , in fact , not as good . I stiil had the same old uni-boob problem and they 're still bouncy , only more in tandem . It did n't seem as secure as the pull-on types . I ordered a Glamorise Sports bra at the same time which is bulit more like a regular bra , only with enhanced structural details . It was much more secure , very minimal bouncing , and without uni-boob .
 I have read such positive reviews on this style of bra , that I had to give it a try . I have the Moving Comfort Maia , and absolutely love it . It is an under-wire style and does the job so much better . I am returning this bra , and plan to stick to under-wire styles from now on .
 I returned this . Even though I ordered the same size I ordinarily would for a sports bra , it was a very strange fit . The band was fine , but the cups were too big . I 've had trouble with this brand before & will not bother trying any of their other styles .
 I bought this based on past reviews but am disappointed . It is extremely difficult to get on and off . I read earlier reviews commenting on this but thought how hard could a bra be ? Well , it is difficult to fasten once on and even harder when you are sweaty . It also cuts into my arm pit on my left side . I have never spent this much money on a sports bra and regret doing so .
 I have been buying `` THE MOUNTAIN '' T-shirts for years , and I will no longer continue to purchase this product as the quality of `` THE MOUNTAIN '' T-shirts has severly deminished to the point it offends me . On reciept of my order , these shirts look nothing like what is posted on amazon , the colors are completely different-of low quality , and the quality of the material is nothing short of a cheap shirt out of mexico .
 I ordered this product on October 19 expedited deliverly so it would get here in time for my son 's Halloween Party which was October 26 and it did not come ! My son was very disappointed there was so tears too ! He was so excited to finally be SpongeBob his favorote TV charater . I will not order from you again and I will tell others if they need to buy a costume from you and to look else where . If you did n't have in stock you should of emailed me and told me . I emailed you several times asking about costume when is going to be shipped and a arrivial date , and I got no response . That is not the way to do business ! So buyers BEWARE!Very DisappointedKarla C
 I purchased this set for my 5 year old son . At first it worked okay . The cars are a bit slow and they do n't stay charged up for too long but it seemed to work fine . Yet ... . after a few days the cars would run on the straight track but not on the turns . You pretty much had to push it along . Sometimes they wo n't even go on the straight track . For the price of this item It 's not worth the aggravation . Needless to say this is going back to the store . Save your money !!!
 I like the flydanna . Just put it on and tie it at the base of the skull . The colors are great until the first wash . It faded at least 50 % and I did not use bleach . Plan on sending it back .
 Seams coming apart after two washings !! I bought two and one has unequal top panels that are sewn together to make a lop sided top . Look elsewhere .
 We just ordered one and got it today . Super thin cheap material - not using good bandannas to make these from , crooked sewing , raw edges of the material left to fray , some of the seams are just a knotted mess of thread where the machine messed up and they just left it , material panels are even and the gathers at the back of the head are different sizes as well .
 One washing and it almost disintegrated . Colors also faded - it aged one year after one washing . Enuff said - stay away .
 I got this before halloween in standart size and when I try it it did not fit me I am medium size and I could not even put it init was way to smallperhaps is standar for kids but not for adults .
 I read reviews about this costume running small , but was n't worried because my daughter wears a 5/6 . This costume is so small and poorly made , it 's ridiculous . From the waist down , it is fine . From the waist up , it would n't fit a five year old ! The sleeve with the hand only comes down to my daughter 's elbow !! And it cuts off her circulation , it is so tight . She ca n't close the velcro behind her neck . There is a hole in the mesh under one arm . There is a bunch of material sewn under the other arm -LRB- poor sewing job -RRB- . When she took it off , the mesh ripped from the bodice . Only four days until Halloween so there is no time to return it and order something else . Besides we already purchased the matching wig from another store . I ended up cutting off the sleeves and sewing/mending/altering to make it fit . Luckily I am a sewer ! Hopefully it does n't fall apart on Halloween . This costume is a ripoff . Do n't waste your money !
 The costume arrived with the package disassembled and looking like it was tried on and returned . There were ripped seams -LRB- not where they were supposed to be -RRB- , and it is VERY , VERY small , especially in the bust . I would say someone bigger than a size 6 would not fit into it well , and my daughter is not a large person . I would not recommend . I finally salvaged the situation by cutting pieces off of it and sewing to another costume we already had .
 I had a pair of these IZOD Chino pants that I bought in a department store about a year ago that were well made , using good , thick cotton material . I wanted another pair just like them and I could n't find them in the store , so I found them on Amazon and ordered them . They are not making the pants with the same material , they are cheaply made out of some thin cotton material . I usually do pretty good ordering through Amazon , but this time I did n't .
 Chinos are made from a much lighter fabric than these pants . The Sizing was horrible . I wear a 36 waist . My Levi 501s are a 36 and fit like a glove . I wanted a more comfortable fit for work , so i ordered a 38 . First , the waist is WAY too small . It feels like a 34 . Second , the rest of the pants are VERY baggy and loose . They look and feel horrible . My waist is being choked and the rest just hangs off . I bought Gap original khakis as a replacement , and they are an improvement in every way including cost -LRB- they were $ 15 on clearance -RRB- .
 I bought these for work , and while they 're OK for very casual days , they do n't hold a crease sharply , and they do n't drape well . They just look thick and clumsy .
 These pants looked , felt and wore beautifully but after 2 weeks the seams started to loosen and tear.Aweful .
 It is really sad to get a different color degree than you saw and except from the photo . I was really disappointed and I had to get another one from different place .
 Pants indicated in the paper labels and bag which is size 36 x 32 , but in reality is size 38 x 32 , as says the label on fabric attached to it . Very nice pants but I can not use .
 Izod fits me well and ordered these pants to replace one that I was very happy with . However , these were cut way too skimpy and did n't fit . Additionally , the color is pumice , which I thought would be an off white like the pants they were replacing , but there very white .
 The Izod American Chino is not worth the cost . While they are comfortable -LRB- the minimum requirement of any pant -RRB- , they are more comparable to Lee Stain-Resistant pants which sell for about $ 18 at Kohls and that is what these pants should sell for . I ordered 3 but returned 2 . I kept the Pumice ones only because I liked the color a lot . If you want Izod casual Chinos I recommend the Madison series instead . More comfort , better material , better made .
 They are stiff , crinkly , and much too big . I ordered the right size but I am swimming in them . The waistband goes up over my navel or else the pants cuffs drag under my shoes . Oh well , pay cheap , get cheap .
 This is a ONE SIZE dress . I wear an XL in shirts , and the top fit me great , because the blue material is stretchy . The yellow skirt is HUGE and it does n't lay on the waist as shown in the photo . . it comes up very high . . only a few inches below the bra . . so the full skirt that high up made me look HUGE ! The sleeves are puffy , but the red band around the bottom of the sleeves does NOT stretch . It was cutting off the circulation in my arms , and I could barely get the arms through the holes . I ended up cutting them and sewing an elastic band on the inner part -LRB- near my armpit -RRB- so that my arms fit better . Also , the white collar is very floppy , and does n't stand up unless you hold it -LRB- like the woman in the photo is doing -RRB- . . however , it 's 2 layers , so I was able to cut it open in the back where it velcros together , and I slid in some bendable foam that I got at the craft store . . sewed it up , and it stayed .
 It is n't made to hang on bike as stated . Good for a key chain though . Or charm . It 's not a gaurdien bells like they make you think
 I purchased the medal for my husband . It is not the quality the picture portrays . I was very disappointed in the quality -LRB- or lack of -RRB- of this product .
 Very disappointing item . For the $ $ I thought that it would be more substaintial . Instead it looks and feels like something you would win in a bubblegum machine .
 I love Amazon.com , but these Wrangler jeans look similar to Wrangler jeans sold in America ; but they are NOT the same as Wranglers sold in America . My husband says the cut is different and they do n't fit him as well . We noticed that the Wrangler label on the jeans is the older style than what is used on their jeans now . I 'm not sure if they 're just really old old Wranglers that were found in some warehouse or if they are impostors made in another country with the older Wrangler label on the back . Also , these jeans have stitching on the rear pockets and I guess the current -LRB- official -RRB- Wranglers do n't have back pocket stitching anymore . My husband says , `` no more internet jeans for him ! '' He wants to try on clothes in person .
 I received my jeans in reasonable time and the label on the jeans indicated they were a 28 inch inseam . However , when I wore them , they were dragging on the floor . I then measured them with a tailor 's tape and the jeans inseam measured 30 inches . My wife will now have to correctly size them .
 Ordered up a pair , reviews look good , got them fairly quickly , tried them on , they fit good . The right hand from pocket felt like there was something in it , like an `` Inspected by # 277 '' note , but it was just the wrinkled and crispy pocket itself . I inspected it closer , and it was full of holes ! The front left pocket had the same problem . Bummer . Sending back for refund . . not taking another chance , I 'll just go to the store and get jeans .
 I ordered Men 's Wrangler Relaxed Fit Jean size 40x34 . When we received the package the shipping receipt AND the label attached to the outside of the pants said the pants were size 40x34 . However , when he tried the jeans on the jeans did not fit right . We then checked the inside tag and found that they were really 36x32 . We will be returning the jeans . I am usually pleased with Amazon.com however this particular item was a birthday present -LRB- he received the jeans one day before his birthday so there is no way to get a replacement pair here by tomorrow , his birthday -RRB- . Hopefully the return process will be smooth and they will send us the right size .
 If you are a long time Wrangler wearer , as I am , do n't be fooled by these . I made the mistake of keeping the three pair I ordered even though it is obvious that they are NOT the same as the original 31MWZWK jeans . They felt pretty good , so I decided to give them a try . These jeans are thinner material , have a different label , and shrank in size right after I washed them . They do n't have the rivet on the pockets and are generally cheaper in feel . Since these are the jeans that came up when I typed in 31MWZWK , I believed that that was what I was getting . I actually think that they might be a `` knock-off '' rather than the real thing . By the time I realized I no longer wanted them , it was too late to return them for a refund . I feel really ripped off .
 I usually never order jeans online and against my better judgement did so . If you dont really care about how your jeans sits on your body then you will find it fine , but the cut and fit was simply too relaxed for me . At the end of the day , leaves you looking sloppy .
 I had ordered the Wrangler loose fit jeans of the same size last week , and LOVED them . I was looking for a replacement for Levi 550s and 569s , as they had turned to junk recently -LRB- easily ripped , shrank up in both directions -RRB- . The loose fit Wranglers were a PERFECT fit . Not so with these . The exact same size in the relaxed fit was OK for length , but instead of a 38x32 -LRB- as on the sticker -RRB- , I think it was about a 32x30 . Never have I seen such a difference in sizing amongst the same manufacturer . Poor quality control ; I 'd lose my job immediately if I let product like this ship !
 Wranglers have always been sized perfectly for me for years -- buy them at Target , do n't even bother to try them on , wash them , wear them . But the first time they were ordered from Amazon , the `` relaxed fit '' is so tight I have to do the old 80 's trick of lying down on the bed to get them to button . The waist might stretch , but the hip pocket is so tight I ca n't get my wallet in/out without making a scene . I asked the gift giver for the Amazon return label , and she looked so offended I dropped the subject.I think Wranglers are great jeans -- if these were factory seconds I wish they had been marked -- and priced -- accordingly .
 The jeans fit well and looked nice when they first arrived . However , they have already fallen apart . I am very disappointed with this purchase . I picked up a pair of Levis and a pair of Kirkland -LRB- Costco -RRB- jeans all around the same time . I am not very happy with the expensive Levi jeans either but at least they are n't falling apart . The most comfortable of the 3 pairs is acutally the Kirkland brand which I got for under $ 10 . I have worn them many more times than the Wrangler jeans and they are holding up just fine . I will NEVER buy another pair of Wrangler jeans .
 On me , they fit poorly when compared to the &#34; other &#34; big brand who makes lots of denim jeans . Tight in the wrong places where the others are looser fitting . No problems with the quality , just not a good fit for a mid sized round guy with short thick legs , lol .
 When I got it and tried it on , I discovered zipper sticks all the time ~ 1/2 way down , 3/4 way down , etc. . That 's the cheap part . Now , having worn it several times , I 've discovered that the white pocket bulges out as a matter of course - but just on the right side . That 's the poorly made part . Headed for the Salvation Army .
 I bought three pairs of these jeans for my husband and they have all ripped in only three months . All the rips start in the back pocket . Save your money and buy a brand that will last longer -- if you can find one .
 I purchased 3 of these jeans -LRB- 34x32 -RRB- and they are not 34 at all . I have other jeans and they fit perfectly , these one are too small . Very disappointed .
 nice jeans however the belt loops were to small , it would be nice if wrangler made the loops the same size .
 These have to be counterfeit , as the seams are sub-standard . No where near the quality of Wrangler jeans bought at a brick & morter store.Stay away , these are FAKE Wranglers !!
 I 've been wearing Wrangler relaxed fit jeans for many years now , always ordering from Amazon because they always have my size . I may have to reconsider after the last few pair . As previous astute reviewers have mentioned , these jeans are not only missing the rivets , but they shrink A LOT . I have my own washer and dryer . I wash cold and tumble dry with cold air and still these jeans shrink WAY too much , going from comfortable to ballcrushers in one wash and dry cycle . Some reviews have mentioned defects and I have now joined that crowd . I bought a pair back in April . Do I wear my new jeans right away ? No , but I like to have a backup pair or two because I wear them to work and having a new clean pair on hand is important . I tore open the packing on the new pair this morning and was wondering if I had brain damage as I sipped coffee and tried unsuccessfully to get my belt in the belt loops , wondering what was going on ... until I realized the jeans HAD NO BELT LOOPS . What in the holy hell use is a pair of Wranglers without belt loops ? And what has happened to the quality control of these jeans that a defect like that could go unnoticed ? Since it is now near the end of June it is too late for me to return the jeans without going through all kinds of bull ____ , so I am EXTREMELY disappointed with Wrangler AND Amazon . Now some of you might say , `` Jack , why did n't you just open the goddamned package when you got them and give them a look see ? '' My response ? `` They are Wranglers from Amazon . I checked that I got the right size and color , why should I have to check for belt loops ? '' Please note I 'm a long-time Amazon shopper who has rarely had to return anything . So ... anyone want a free pair of jean with no ____ ing belt loops ? For Christ 's sake . I guess I 'll see what Levi 's has to offer in relaxed fit and hope I do n't get shafted again with missing belt loops or one giant pantleg or some other insanity.-Update 2011 07 18 - Two weeks ago I unwrapped the last pair of Wranglers I had tucked away from my last purchase . For two weeks they were great - a good fit , with a bit of room in the butt and crotch -LRB- I have to bend and squat and sometimes get right down on the floor under desks at work , so a bit of room helps avoid the dreaded testicular crush -RRB- . On the weekend I washed these jeans . NO detergent , just water . COLD water only , for a 20 minute wash and rinse cycle . They went in the dryer , COLD AIR DRY only , for about twenty minutes . Then I let them hang and finish drying at room temperature . When I put them on this morning they had shrunk at least 1 full size . I felt like my gonads were being crushed by an angry Sumo wrestler . That CA N'T be normal . Should I just buy jeans 2 or 3 sizes bigger from now on and assume they will shrink ? This is crazy .
 Disappointed . Size I ordered from Amazon is the size I always buy/wear from stores . The pair received , while marked as correct size ordered , were almost too small for me to even get on and zipped-up right out of the bag . I ca n't imagine how I would have gotten them on after a few washings/shrinking . They were made in Mexico , for whatever that is worth . I do n't see the point in buying clothes online anymore if you cant trust accuracy of sizing , and if that is n't trustworthy , what can one conclude about quality of materials , workmanship , etc. . ?
 I ordered a pair of these for my husband in November 2011 and he loved them . Great fit , super comfy and looked good . So I ordered him two more pair for Christmas in the same size . Well , they fit nothing like the exact same item we 'd ordered in November . They were easily a size too small and he could barely get them buttoned . I agree with the earlier reviewer ; these jeans bore no resemblance to the pair we bought from Amazon only a month before . I returned them and I 'm reluctant to order anymore -- even in a larger size -- because now I really do n't know what we 're going to get . Both orders of the Wrangler Men 's Rugged Wear Relaxed Fit Jean were made in Mexico and had tags indicating size 33x30 , but the first pair were easily an inch larger in the waist and you can tell by the numbers on the tags they must have been made in different factories . It 's disappointing to say the least . If Wrangler is going to have other countries make their jeans , they need to apply consistent patterns and standards . It 's called `` quality control '' !
 Ped&iacute; unos pantalones 34x36 y me llegaron unos 36x32 . Afuera en la etiqueta dice 34x36 sin embargo dentro del pantal&oacute;n en la etiqueta dice 36x32 . Por tanto no me sirvieron y me quedaron super grandes .
 The material is a little thin for hard work . Good think I ware them around the house and not on the farm
 I bought one jeans jacket , and was looking for a colour match pant . The colour did not match , and I was highly displeased . I would have returned it .
 Tried these in a 66 waist . Their characterization of these as &#34; Relaxed Fit &#34; is ridiculous . The waist was a 66 -LRB- I ordered larger to get a loose fit -- my waist is really a 64 -RRB- but the seat and thighs were nowhere near proper proportions for a person this large . It was as though I was trying to fit into a funnel that was overly wide at the waist and impossibly small at the knee . I 'd recommend skipping this brand in larger sizes .
 No era lo que se mostraba en las fotos , los sujetadores de la correa vino con 5 y en la foto salen con 7 . .
 I do n't know where they are making these jeans now a days , but be prepared to have them altered , The measurements are all off . I had to have mine altered by a taylor .
 I ordered 1 pair of Wrangler 's and they could n't seem to get them shipped out for whatever reason . When I order something simple , I do n't expect to wait weeks to receive it and if there 's a problem that holds the order up , I expect an e-mail to let me know , which never happened ! I finally canceled the order because my son started school and they were still telling me it would be a couple more weeks before they even shipped ? Unless you plan on waiting forever for your order , I do not recommend this company !
 Smaller than they should be -- I 've ordered these exact brand , model and size at several other retailers in the past , with no issues . But even though the Amazon product showed the same information , including the same product numbers on the actual tags , their size is definitely not the same . I ordered the 40x38 , but when I compare these to supposedly identical jeans purchased in the past , these Amazon ones are about 2-3 inches smaller at the waist.Other than that they are good jeans , but for online clothing sales it 's imperative to carry accurate sizes since people ca n't try them on in advance ...
 I needed a new pair of Wranglers because all of my jeans were 4-5 years old - and looked it . I was shocked and disappointed to find that these Wranglers did n't have that new-blue look . They look like the 5 year old Wranglers that they were supposed to replace ! Amazon 's description did n't mention that these pants had a used look ; I 'll be returning them . I learned an important lesson
 Their the smallest 35 's I have ever seen . They would n't fit my son at all and were very tight on my grandson that wears a 33 .
 We bought two of these to use for emergency/natural disaster kits , so hopefully we 'll never actually have to use them . The bag seems pretty sturdy from first inspection and it 's nice and roomy with lots of pockets.The only problem I can see so far is that the bags stunk to high heck out of the box . It 's a moldy smell with a hint of plastic/chemicals that literally made me feel sick . I left them in a room for 5 minutes and it stunk up the whole place . Right now they 're airing out outside so hopefully that 's enough to solve the problem.UPDATE
 This book bag is good at first ... . the first day of school was fine ... but the second day after my friend pat my back the bag ripped at the top ... such a nice way of spending 25 bucks
 I 'm 5 ' 6 and got the medium . The cloth feels tough on the body and overall it just seems too big for my taste .
 I liked the color of the bag but I did not know it was not a full size backpack .

 Do n't do it , unless you are completely color blind , what you get is not what you see ! They fit small , go up a size or two and pay attention to length of sleeves or you will feel like a midget / child wearing Dad 's oversized shirt . . But if you enjoy the action of Vegas / Carnival ring toss , enjoy , it 's a gamble .
 Why is the emblem placed right at chest level , it is inappropriate and stopped me from buying it . All the little girls ' batman costumes on here are suggestive and why would somewhere were a little skirt at the end of October ?

 I 've had two pair of these , while optically they are good , the rubber ear piece hardens and crumbleafter being left in the car in the summar . I had to replace them twice in a year . The lenses chipeasily at the corner by the hinge . especilly if are flexed to adjust curviture . Or ear pieces openedtoo wide . Not very durable .
 Was led to believe in description that the pajamas were ankle length when we received them come to find out they were knee length , and when the shipping was half of what the item had cost we found it to be more of a hassle . . will not order again
 poorly made and not true to size ! Gave it to a friend who was shorter -LRB- since it was also short -RRB- and smaller -LRB- she usually wears medium -RRB-

 Buy this only if you need to rob a bank . Seriously ? this is horrible ... I cant believe I Bought this crap .
 Got a bunch of these mustaches for a pub crawl costume . Personally , the attachment to the nose was rather tickly for me and I could n't keep this thing on for long . In addition , it started to fall apart fairly quickly if you tried to shape it too much . Do n't really recommend it - I prefer the glue on ones .

 No doubt that it is a pretty dress , but the zipper broke the first time I put my daughter into it . I would expect that an expensive dress would have a better zipper .
 I returned this because I did not feel the quality was commensurate with the price . Target had the dress and all accessories including shoes for less money . Quality was as good or better than this one .

 in the discription it says it has a firm brim which is false . it 's floppy and would n't hold up a penny .
 I do n't know who this hat is supposed to fit , but not a grown man . Very disappointed , am returning it .
 I was looking for a sun hat with a little style for playing golf in S. Florida . The pictures depicted a fairly rigid brim but the brim as well as the crown is very floppy and does not hold shape . Item description states that the sweat band is elastic but the one I received has no elastic . I 'm keeping it only because I can always use an extra sun hat for guests .
 Leather on the exterior is very nice looking , however the inward facing side is cheap vinyl and I expect it to begin cracking shortly .
 I do n't know that I 've had a belt this stiff . I had to punch another hole in this and another belt I bought , perhaps I need to reduce my waist size for future pants , but I would have done better to have bought only one size over . I bought a 34 '' and note that the internal most hole is at 34 '' . I know that makes sense but you might consider your size is a minimum size when you make your purchase.Update : The back of the belt is cracking around all the holes . Its really bad around the holes I use , but the belt still looks good from the front . Clearly cracking should n't happen so early .
 A very unnatural shine , which does n't show in the illustration , caused me to return this belt . Construction quality looked good , but could n't get past that plastic-y looking shine .
 I purchased a cap from pro-line about 5 mos ago and was happy . It faded after numerous washes so I purchased another a week ago . Huge mistake ... Apparently pro-line decided to alter the composition of the hat and sent me a POS with horrible stitching , bad design , and poor quality material . This hat looks to be comparable to the 5 dollar hats you could buy at a gas station . I am not sure what the material is , maybe nylon , but it looks piss poor . If you notice the cuts made on the interior you will see that a drunken sailor could have done a better job . Looks like some illegals are busy at work somewhere in california churning out piss poor products .
 Amazon I 'm blaming you guys for this one . The seller even though I may buy from them again did not give full discloser on this item.THEY ARE CHINESE KNOCK OFFS the velcrove and American flag are good but that is where it ends . The caps are not felt they are not canvas they are light cloth with single stitche -LRB- not straight -RRB- . I would not be caught dead at the range with these on my head . I throw both of them back in the box and considered it a -LRB- you get what you pay for -RRB- lesson the only redeeming value here was my sons found them and now play army with them so 2 stars .
 I got a Large timbuk2 and from the rides i 've taken it on , it is n't very comfortable . I got a strap pad , hoping this would fix the problem but it still persists . When i bought the bag it did n't come with the strap pad or a cross strap but from carrying a chrome citizen messenger bag and this , the chrome definitely beats it in at area of comfortability . The one plus is that it definitely is very roomy .
 The Timbuk 2 Classic Messenger Bag is a very roomy bag . The large can fit a ton of Stuff . Unfortunately the strap is very uncomfortable.The 2 '' wide strap cuts my shoulder when the bag is loaded . The strap is also sewn on to one end which prevented me from replacing it with something more comfortable . So it sits in the corner ; looks nice but not very functionable .
 This wig is a one time wear only . Tangles easily . We threw it away after one to two weeks .

 My husband has worn L and XL . I purchased a pair of these in the XL but he said they were snug . They looked nice but they obviously run small and since they do n't have an XXL , I will have to keep looking . Very disappointed .
 I was excited about the price and color choices , but this product is cheap . Does n't wash well , and is n't soft . Also , onesie is very wide , and not very long . Would n't fit an average-sized baby .
 I ordered this onesie and got it sent straight to an embroidery shop I use . The onesie was bought for my daughters birthday pictures . When I got this onsie it was all wrong . It 's way bigger than the size they say and the neck hole is very large and not at all proportionate to the rest of the onesie . Also , the quality is very poor . Therefore , I could n't use the onesie for my daughters birthday so it totally ruined my plans for pictures . I would NOT recommend this product and would never order this brand again ! If I could , I would give it 0 stars .
 I bought this bra based on the positive reviews that I read from various sites . The material , style and color are quite lovely . I was excited to try it on . Then my self-esteem fell through the floor

 Be careful , this runs REALLY small . I got the 18-24 for my 14 month old , and it would fit better on an average 6 month old . Otherwise , it seems of nice quality .

 I really like Underamour clothing , but I m actually disspointed with this shirt . The white color was almost transparent . So i didnt like it .
 My husband has worn L and XL . I purchased a pair of these in the XL but he said they were snug . They looked nice but they obviously run small and since they do n't have an XXL , I will have to keep looking . Very disappointed .
 seems warm but it already has a hole where the stitching came apart . very dissapointed in that as i was hoping for a quality piece of clothing . i am a busy developer that wants to keep warm and dont have time to send items back or complain . it also fits very tight even though it is 2XL . i am 6 ' 2 '' , 220 lbs .
 I found this product to be less than desired . I am an avid hunter who hunts staying all night hidden -LRB- without moving for no less than six hours -RRB- waiting for my preys -LRB- mostly boars , hunted at night , with no more lights than the moon 's -RRB- . I was expecting some product that might keep my body 's heat , something critical when you are completely still for hours , at 10F ... perhaps this product will be OK for reigning temperatures no lower than 40/45F and keeping yourself in continuous activity , but for my intended use , it was quite disappointing ... Besides I found they do n't last for long , since mine is already tearing after some mere five time I wore it ! Under Armour is a much better option !

 I ordered the glasses only to find out days later that they were out of stock . Note : They sent me the wrong glasses first and then by calling Amazon customer services , I found out they did n't have the glasses I had ordered .

 The bag is nice , but the shoulder strap is WAAAAY too short . I am 6 ' 3 '' with broad shoulders and this bag rides very high up on my hip instead of at the waist or below where -LRB- I believe -RRB- it should be ... necessitates removing the bag to get anything out of it . I run into this problem a lot , and honestly , would it kill these guys to make the shoulder straps 5 or 6 inches longer ? I usually order custom-built replacement straps from a website , but unfortunately this one is sewn on at one end . Also , it seems to me that there is too much velcro used to hold the flap closed
 This bag looks and feels cheap , nothing else to it . The plastic hardware is terrible and barely works . It is made out of a heavy canvas , but it is put together poorly and does not hold any shape . It is large and can carry a number of things . If you care at all about appearance , and are attracted by the look of this bag , do n't be , save your money for something better .
 Blah - I ordered 3 of these . Only 1 actually fits my infant . Poor quality control if you ask me !
 I bought this hat for my barely 3 month old son . The hat itself is very nice . It is a decent thickness for cold days and the quality was really good . When it arrived it did not fit on my son 's head . He does not have an abnormally large head -LRB- I would say he is average ... and so does the doctor -RRB- . He was never able to wear this so we have passed it on to friends that have just had a baby . It was unfortunate because we got it for our trip to Canada and had to make due with thinner hats and hoods . Just beware that they are quite small .
 The entry for this item shows 10 colors and sizes from 4-14 . Oh sorry , we only have two colors in sizes 8-12 . Tacky .
 I was very unhappy with the quality of the robes I ordered . They were very thin and there was no way I could embroider on them . Not at all what I was hoping for . Aside from that , the free shipping was deducted when I returned the items , and I had to pay the shipping to return them . So it cost me almost $ 20 to try a new product
 I am really disappointed with the quality of this robe . It is labeled as 100 % polyester , and the seller claims it is mislabeled and the product is 80 % cotton . It definitely does not feel like cotton at all . Not the nice snuggly cotton robe I was hoping for . Will be returning .
 This product fell apart after less than six an a half months of use . It is annoying when one purchases what is supposed to be a quality product at a high price to have it not measure up .
 I 've been wearing Wrangler relaxed fit jeans for many years now , always ordering from Amazon because they always have my size . I may have to reconsider after the last few pair . As previous astute reviewers have mentioned , these jeans are not only missing the rivets , but they shrink A LOT . I have my own washer and dryer . I wash cold and tumble dry with cold air and still these jeans shrink WAY too much , going from comfortable to ballcrushers in one wash and dry cycle . Some reviews have mentioned defects and I have now joined that crowd . I bought a pair back in April . Do I wear my new jeans right away ? No , but I like to have a backup pair or two because I wear them to work and having a new clean pair on hand is important . I tore open the packing on the new pair this morning and was wondering if I had brain damage as I sipped coffee and tried unsuccessfully to get my belt in the belt loops , wondering what was going on ... until I realized the jeans HAD NO BELT LOOPS . What in the holy hell use is a pair of Wranglers without belt loops ? And what has happened to the quality control of these jeans that a defect like that could go unnoticed ? Since it is now near the end of June it is too late for me to return the jeans without going through all kinds of bull ____ , so I am EXTREMELY disappointed with Wrangler AND Amazon . Now some of you might say , `` Jack , why did n't you just open the goddamned package when you got them and give them a look see ? '' My response ? `` They are Wranglers from Amazon . I checked that I got the right size and color , why should I have to check for belt loops ? '' Please note I 'm a long-time Amazon shopper who has rarely had to return anything . So ... anyone want a free pair of jean with no ____ ing belt loops ? For Christ 's sake . I guess I 'll see what Levi 's has to offer in relaxed fit and hope I do n't get shafted again with missing belt loops or one giant pantleg or some other insanity.-Update 2011 07 18 - Two weeks ago I unwrapped the last pair of Wranglers I had tucked away from my last purchase . For two weeks they were great - a good fit , with a bit of room in the butt and crotch -LRB- I have to bend and squat and sometimes get right down on the floor under desks at work , so a bit of room helps avoid the dreaded testicular crush -RRB- . On the weekend I washed these jeans . NO detergent , just water . COLD water only , for a 20 minute wash and rinse cycle . They went in the dryer , COLD AIR DRY only , for about twenty minutes . Then I let them hang and finish drying at room temperature . When I put them on this morning they had shrunk at least 1 full size . I felt like my gonads were being crushed by an angry Sumo wrestler . That CA N'T be normal . Should I just buy jeans 2 or 3 sizes bigger from now on and assume they will shrink ? This is crazy .
 Disappointed . Size I ordered from Amazon is the size I always buy/wear from stores . The pair received , while marked as correct size ordered , were almost too small for me to even get on and zipped-up right out of the bag . I ca n't imagine how I would have gotten them on after a few washings/shrinking . They were made in Mexico , for whatever that is worth . I do n't see the point in buying clothes online anymore if you cant trust accuracy of sizing , and if that is n't trustworthy , what can one conclude about quality of materials , workmanship , etc. . ?
 I ordered a pair of these for my husband in November 2011 and he loved them . Great fit , super comfy and looked good . So I ordered him two more pair for Christmas in the same size . Well , they fit nothing like the exact same item we 'd ordered in November . They were easily a size too small and he could barely get them buttoned . I agree with the earlier reviewer ; these jeans bore no resemblance to the pair we bought from Amazon only a month before . I returned them and I 'm reluctant to order anymore -- even in a larger size -- because now I really do n't know what we 're going to get . Both orders of the Wrangler Men 's Rugged Wear Relaxed Fit Jean were made in Mexico and had tags indicating size 33x30 , but the first pair were easily an inch larger in the waist and you can tell by the numbers on the tags they must have been made in different factories . It 's disappointing to say the least . If Wrangler is going to have other countries make their jeans , they need to apply consistent patterns and standards . It 's called `` quality control '' !
 The material is a little thin for hard work . Good think I ware them around the house and not on the farm
 I bought one jeans jacket , and was looking for a colour match pant . The colour did not match , and I was highly displeased . I would have returned it .
 Tried these in a 66 waist . Their characterization of these as &#34; Relaxed Fit &#34; is ridiculous . The waist was a 66 -LRB- I ordered larger to get a loose fit -- my waist is really a 64 -RRB- but the seat and thighs were nowhere near proper proportions for a person this large . It was as though I was trying to fit into a funnel that was overly wide at the waist and impossibly small at the knee . I 'd recommend skipping this brand in larger sizes .
 No era lo que se mostraba en las fotos , los sujetadores de la correa vino con 5 y en la foto salen con 7 . .
 I bought three pairs of these jeans for my husband and they have all ripped in only three months . All the rips start in the back pocket . Save your money and buy a brand that will last longer -- if you can find one .
 I purchased 3 of these jeans -LRB- 34x32 -RRB- and they are not 34 at all . I have other jeans and they fit perfectly , these one are too small . Very disappointed .
 nice jeans however the belt loops were to small , it would be nice if wrangler made the loops the same size .
 I love Amazon.com , but these Wrangler jeans look similar to Wrangler jeans sold in America ; but they are NOT the same as Wranglers sold in America . My husband says the cut is different and they do n't fit him as well . We noticed that the Wrangler label on the jeans is the older style than what is used on their jeans now . I 'm not sure if they 're just really old old Wranglers that were found in some warehouse or if they are impostors made in another country with the older Wrangler label on the back . Also , these jeans have stitching on the rear pockets and I guess the current -LRB- official -RRB- Wranglers do n't have back pocket stitching anymore . My husband says , `` no more internet jeans for him ! '' He wants to try on clothes in person .
 I received my jeans in reasonable time and the label on the jeans indicated they were a 28 inch inseam . However , when I wore them , they were dragging on the floor . I then measured them with a tailor 's tape and the jeans inseam measured 30 inches . My wife will now have to correctly size them .
 These have to be counterfeit , as the seams are sub-standard . No where near the quality of Wrangler jeans bought at a brick & morter store.Stay away , these are FAKE Wranglers !!
 On me , they fit poorly when compared to the &#34; other &#34; big brand who makes lots of denim jeans . Tight in the wrong places where the others are looser fitting . No problems with the quality , just not a good fit for a mid sized round guy with short thick legs , lol .
 When I got it and tried it on , I discovered zipper sticks all the time ~ 1/2 way down , 3/4 way down , etc. . That 's the cheap part . Now , having worn it several times , I 've discovered that the white pocket bulges out as a matter of course - but just on the right side . That 's the poorly made part . Headed for the Salvation Army .
 Ped&iacute; unos pantalones 34x36 y me llegaron unos 36x32 . Afuera en la etiqueta dice 34x36 sin embargo dentro del pantal&oacute;n en la etiqueta dice 36x32 . Por tanto no me sirvieron y me quedaron super grandes .

 I needed a new pair of Wranglers because all of my jeans were 4-5 years old - and looked it . I was shocked and disappointed to find that these Wranglers did n't have that new-blue look . They look like the 5 year old Wranglers that they were supposed to replace ! Amazon 's description did n't mention that these pants had a used look ; I 'll be returning them . I learned an important lesson
 Their the smallest 35 's I have ever seen . They would n't fit my son at all and were very tight on my grandson that wears a 33 .
 If you are a long time Wrangler wearer , as I am , do n't be fooled by these . I made the mistake of keeping the three pair I ordered even though it is obvious that they are NOT the same as the original 31MWZWK jeans . They felt pretty good , so I decided to give them a try . These jeans are thinner material , have a different label , and shrank in size right after I washed them . They do n't have the rivet on the pockets and are generally cheaper in feel . Since these are the jeans that came up when I typed in 31MWZWK , I believed that that was what I was getting . I actually think that they might be a `` knock-off '' rather than the real thing . By the time I realized I no longer wanted them , it was too late to return them for a refund . I feel really ripped off .
 They look nice but they do n't fit . Not even close . They were so unbelievably tight that I measured them . The tag inside the jeans is marked with the size that I ordered , but they actually measure at about 4-5 inches smaller in the waist . The price was pretty low , so I 'm wondering if they were rejects from a third world country manufacturing plant . Better to buy jeans in person than online .
 I do n't know where they are making these jeans now a days , but be prepared to have them altered , The measurements are all off . I had to have mine altered by a taylor .
 I ordered 1 pair of Wrangler 's and they could n't seem to get them shipped out for whatever reason . When I order something simple , I do n't expect to wait weeks to receive it and if there 's a problem that holds the order up , I expect an e-mail to let me know , which never happened ! I finally canceled the order because my son started school and they were still telling me it would be a couple more weeks before they even shipped ? Unless you plan on waiting forever for your order , I do not recommend this company !
 Ordered up a pair , reviews look good , got them fairly quickly , tried them on , they fit good . The right hand from pocket felt like there was something in it , like an `` Inspected by # 277 '' note , but it was just the wrinkled and crispy pocket itself . I inspected it closer , and it was full of holes ! The front left pocket had the same problem . Bummer . Sending back for refund . . not taking another chance , I 'll just go to the store and get jeans .
 I ordered Men 's Wrangler Relaxed Fit Jean size 40x34 . When we received the package the shipping receipt AND the label attached to the outside of the pants said the pants were size 40x34 . However , when he tried the jeans on the jeans did not fit right . We then checked the inside tag and found that they were really 36x32 . We will be returning the jeans . I am usually pleased with Amazon.com however this particular item was a birthday present -LRB- he received the jeans one day before his birthday so there is no way to get a replacement pair here by tomorrow , his birthday -RRB- . Hopefully the return process will be smooth and they will send us the right size .
 I usually never order jeans online and against my better judgement did so . If you dont really care about how your jeans sits on your body then you will find it fine , but the cut and fit was simply too relaxed for me . At the end of the day , leaves you looking sloppy .
 I had ordered the Wrangler loose fit jeans of the same size last week , and LOVED them . I was looking for a replacement for Levi 550s and 569s , as they had turned to junk recently -LRB- easily ripped , shrank up in both directions -RRB- . The loose fit Wranglers were a PERFECT fit . Not so with these . The exact same size in the relaxed fit was OK for length , but instead of a 38x32 -LRB- as on the sticker -RRB- , I think it was about a 32x30 . Never have I seen such a difference in sizing amongst the same manufacturer . Poor quality control ; I 'd lose my job immediately if I let product like this ship !
 Wranglers have always been sized perfectly for me for years -- buy them at Target , do n't even bother to try them on , wash them , wear them . But the first time they were ordered from Amazon , the `` relaxed fit '' is so tight I have to do the old 80 's trick of lying down on the bed to get them to button . The waist might stretch , but the hip pocket is so tight I ca n't get my wallet in/out without making a scene . I asked the gift giver for the Amazon return label , and she looked so offended I dropped the subject.I think Wranglers are great jeans -- if these were factory seconds I wish they had been marked -- and priced -- accordingly .
 The jeans fit well and looked nice when they first arrived . However , they have already fallen apart . I am very disappointed with this purchase . I picked up a pair of Levis and a pair of Kirkland -LRB- Costco -RRB- jeans all around the same time . I am not very happy with the expensive Levi jeans either but at least they are n't falling apart . The most comfortable of the 3 pairs is acutally the Kirkland brand which I got for under $ 10 . I have worn them many more times than the Wrangler jeans and they are holding up just fine . I will NEVER buy another pair of Wrangler jeans .
 If you 're buying this because you sweat alot -- do not buy it . The sweat band is not what you expect - it 's a piece of material about as thick as a man 's dress sock . You sweat through and soak it at first signs of sweating . Good for bad hair day-but not good to keep sweat from forehead .
 First time out with this umbrella was a blustery day in New York City . Gusts up to 35 MPH . Umbrella busted almost instantly . Definitely feel like the construction of this umbrella was n't what it was cracked up to be .
 This product is heavier than similar umbrellas , the release button was problematic and did not allow the umbrella to fully open without manual assistance , and it bent and became inoperable on it 's second day of use -LRB- a windy day caused it to completely invert , bending the ribs permanently -RRB- .
 Had this product only a few months . Needed an umbrella one rainy day , pulled it out of my car and it 's no longer working . For the money spent I would have thought this to be a sturdier product . Disappointed .
 It 's heavy , the button mechanism is hard to push , and retracting the thing is a pain . Much simpler models perform better .
 The umbrella was too small to cover me enough in windy New York rain . I ended up making my first return to amazon.com with this umbrella .
 Item seems well made . Even though it is build as auto-open-auto shut , the shut is manual on the item I received . Advertised as 43 inches , this is measured across the top arc of the umbrella . At the widest point , the diameter is 36 inches ... which for myself is too small .
 Perhaps they are great and I just got a very FLAWED one . However , purchased for a trip to the UK as it is needed . First time we used it failed . Fooled with it all day -LRB- in the rain -RRB- and back at the hotel . I would have returned it but as I was on Holiday in Europe that was a poor option . Just tossed it in the trash so I guess it 's just a total loss for me ... . sorry I had hoped it would be better , still maybe the ONE I got was just a fluke
 I BOUGHT IT AS A MEN 'S UMBRELLA , BUT REALLY IS A SMALL AND HEAVY UMBRELLA I DID ` NT LIKE IT , I WOULD ` NT BUY ANOTHER ONE LIKE THIS .
 I received the umbrella and it was damaged . I did n't realize until I tried to use it the hardware underneath was bent , twisted causing the umbrella to leak . I returned the item

 I ordered this costume for my students in my class as they began a pen-pal writing swap with another classroom . When the product arrived , the postal `` log '' , which is about 5 inches wide on the shirt as well as the cap , has the image of a naked women ! I am very upset that this was not mentioned in the product description write-up or visible in the picture .
 Item appears larger in picture than it actually is . I tried to return it only to find out all items from this vendor are final sale . This info . was conveniently left out while I was making the purchase , otherwise I would not have bought it.Now I am stuck with an item I do n't need or want . I will never again buy anything from this website or any of its vendors .
 I 'm 5 ' 6 and got the medium . The cloth feels tough on the body and overall it just seems too big for my taste .
 Kimono sleeves are very big -- a dog could fit in each of the patch pockets . Entire robe ran VERY large . Had to return it even though fabric very nice .
 I purchased this and gave it to my wife for christmas . But she wanted a lighter weight robe than this . so i followed the return instructions and sent it back to the company . They say they didnt receive it and amazon wont refund my money . Sent through US post office and i have the receipt that i paid for it and shipped it . I do n't get it .
 I tried to return this item , and found it almost impossible to do so . You needed to contact to company to obtain an RMA number , and this must be done via the web site . Despite repeated attempts , and RMA number was never sent . There is no way to contact the company by phone . None . Looking up a phone number on line is futile . You will find a number , but this is the fax number of the company . The ONLY way to contact the company is via e-mail , and in my experience , no one responded . I needed to pack up the robes in the mailing box without an RMA number and hope for the best . As for the quality of the robes , they are extremely heavy . If you are a body builder , I recommend them to you . But , if you are an average person , I can not imagine walking around in a robe that weighs 15 pounds . I would not recommend ordering from this company .
 Sorry , I ca n't agree with the rest . The medium rests at the most unfortunate height -LRB- I 'm slim and 5 ' 6 '' -RRB- , it 's soft but not luxurious , but most of all ... the outer fabric looks like old man pants . I am sure it 's functional , but it 's just not flattering for a woman .
 I purchased this item because of the high ratings . I was surprised to see how unflattering the fit was . My husband actually laughed when I tried it on . The fabric and feel was very nice but the cut seems more suited for a man .
 Robe is infact better than most that you can find in dept stores . It is definitely spa quality , however I dont think that it is worth the price . If you search a little more you can find similar robes at significantly lower price . The inside of the robe was not as soft or comfortable as I expected . And it is a full length robe . The length went to my ankles and I am 5 ' 7 '' , so I can imagine shorter people would need to have it hemmed .
 This item is really not worth it . I got this as a Christmas gift from hubby . Their are strings all over it , the color is very brown , not the color pictured . The robe does not close at the bottom . Maybe we just got a poorly sewn one . I ordered an x-small but it is too big . Also the terrycloth is not of good quality . It is scratchy . There is no reason to charge this much for such a poor item .
 I purchased this item for my wife and she loved it ; however , after trying it on she discovered that the belt was missing . We thoroughly checked the packaging , but found nothing . The photo of the item clearly shows a belt and the robe has belt loops . Inquiries were fruitless . Lesson learned
 when i ordered this for myself i was very excited . it had a classic look and i dont usually splurge on a luxury item ; with that said , i can see wearing for a spa day but not for everyday use . the sizes do run very large and it loses the tailored apperance that drew me to it in the first place .
 The rise , -LRB- measurement from center front waist to center back waist between the legs -RRB- , is 2 &#34; less than identical pair in black purchased last year .
 I 'm 5 ' 6 and got the medium . The cloth feels tough on the body and overall it just seems too big for my taste .
 The product I received was not the product I ordered . I ordered black D&G ; sunglasses on sale for $ 50.00 and received a `` made in china '' gold sunlglasses , the type you can buy in the street for $ 1.00 . I think the seller is not to be selling in Amazon , just Ebay .
 They have an error between the warehouse and whats advertised on the website . The style and color are totally different . Twice , they have sent the wrong product .
 I ordered two scarfs one red and one black . I was sent 2 scarfs both red in color . I was never given a choice as to what color I would prefer since they did n't seem to have -LRB- black -RRB- the color I requested .
 I 'm 5 ' 6 and got the medium . The cloth feels tough on the body and overall it just seems too big for my taste .

 I did not receive the bra 's I ordered.They came from a Bealls store in Florida . The only thing they got right was the size . The bra 's were not even Warners brand name so I had to send them back.I wo n't order again.Debbie Bosley
 If you like shirts that when washed srink to a short and wide look buy this one !
 I did a quick add to cart based on the image above , looks white with a bit of charcoal gray maybe , it 's actually olive green .
 I 'm 5 ' 6 and got the medium . The cloth feels tough on the body and overall it just seems too big for my taste .
 It is exactly as described and pictured ... but I am unhappy with how it looks ... the cheap plastic this item is made of looks even cheaper in person .

 I ordered this in plenty of time for Christmas & got a shipping notice of something like 10-15 business days . When I contacted them after that time period , they said it was backordered . I said I still wanted the order . After having to contact them yet another time , they said I would have it Feb 5 - 7 . I still do n't have it . They do not reply to emails . One time I called it just rang & rang . Another time I did get through ; that was when they said it would be Feb 5 - 7 . I give up . I 'm not fussing with them anymore .
 I was hoping to finally get some relief on long 6 hour plane rides with this neck pillow but i spend most of my time adjusting it and still getting a stiff neck from sleeping with it on the plane , and lugging it around the airport is a waste as well.wish it was thicker and tougher .
 Initial quality of these glasses is fine , as touted in the reviews above ; however , once a screw falls out , you 're screwed . And that is exactly what happened within three months of my purchase . A screw fell out , the lens followed , and was slightly scratched.Okay , now , I just paid nearly $ 140 for these glasses . Why did I spend that amount of money on sunglasses ? Because I needed them for all the driving I do . So , am I going to ship them off , probably not have use for them for a month or more , after I just got them?I replaced the screw , myself.The next problem was that the nose pads would suddenly disappear.So , how do these `` driver '' sunglasses perform on the road ? 1 . -RRB- Driving all day around LA , they work okay as long as they do n't fall apart . I tighten the screws every time I think about it -LRB- naturally , I keep a sunglasses repair kit in the glove box -RRB- , and I take them to the glasses repair shop when the nose pads fall off .2 . -RRB- Driving trip to Arizona , New Mexico . Somewhere along the way -LRB- early in the trip , unfortunately -RRB- a nose pad goes missing . I drive over 500 miles with the metal digging into my nose . Took the sunglasses to Walmart in Roswell , NM , and the young lady there replaced the nose pad for free .3 . -RRB- Trip to Europe . In front of Notre Dame in Paris , I heard a lens hit the ground . Yep , it was one of mine . Today , when I repaired the sunglasses yet again , the lens was cracked ... directly in front of the right eye.So , I wo n't say anything more . You decide . However , I 'll buy Ray-Bans when I return home . In the meantime , I 'll be driving the UK for nearly three weeks with cracked sunglasses .
 After one wash and a few days of wear , the rear pocket started to separate from the seat . The waist seemed a bit larger than stated - I have to wear a belt to keep them up , which is something I did n't expect when I ordered them . Otherwise , the fabric and fit is ok .
 This obviously is n't a rating of the product itself , but I do n't know any other way to do it . Never wore the pants cause they were at least 2 sizes smaller in the waist than labeled so had to send them back . I was very disappointed ; I guess mistakes happen , but ... No chance that I had wishful thinking about my waist size as I have two other Wrangler Jeans in this size and they fit fine , actually a little loose in the waist . The jeans seemed as advertised otherwise , but again , without actually wearing them , ca n't say much .
 These are the jeans I used to love . They used to be rugged , well fit , well made . The last few purchases of these jeans have been very very sub-par . Very thin material . Weak seams . Generally unsuitable for my purposes . If Wrangler wants to maintain the `` Rugged '' label on these jeans , they need to re-think the lousy craftsmanship of recent versions . I know I am shopping around for better jeans .
 My jeans showed up labeled 34x34 - as I had ordered them - but the true length was closer to 36 . Other than that , I like the fit/style and the price is right .
 This shirt 's fabric is stiff and wrinkles like crazy when washed ... obviously it 's a very cheap pique fabric .
 be sure you order a size bigger as these are not true to size . plus when you first get the item it 's kinda scratchy . very unhappy as i bought this to wear for work & i guess i 'll just stick with Land 's End to buy my uniforms from now on - it 's a company that you can trust .
 Shirt was n't exactly as desired . Did still look kind of nice . Wanted a shirt with about two -LRB- 2 -RRB- buttons only .
 After washing/drying these shirts , I found that they wrinkle horribly and need to be ironed . Since I wear these daily for work , that is the last thing I wanted in a shirt . Once ironed they look fine .
 I bought royal blue and color bled . Not comfortable at all , fabric stiff after washing . Tight fit . Not sized correctly , I normally wear large but bought x large . Would not recommend .
 These is a good brand but the shirts are very small . I wear a medium but would need an xl for these shirts to fit .
 I ordered three polos , size 2xl and they are waaaaay too small.I should have ordered a size or two up.also , these polos are made of very rough material .
 poor quality - sizing was on small side . x x x x x x x x x x x z
 I bought these for my girls for school they have to wear uniforms . they were made small and not soft .
 adult 2x is supposed to be a pretty big garment I thought but this 2x is about a medium or a tight large ; definitely not a 2x . besides that nice for the price .
 I had to get a maroon collared shirt for work ... I chose this one . I ordered a small . Bad decision which I will be regretting for a long , long time . I 'm 5 ' 6 '' and fairly skinny . The small just barely fits me . -LRB- The reason I got a small is that on the Hanes website , it said a medium was 28 '' . -RRB- Also , do n't believe that it is `` fitted '' for women . The shirt is baggy , as are the sleeves .
 I wish I had read more . I figured Hanes = Quality = No Problems . I am normally an XL , got a 2X because I wanted it loose and comfy for the summer , and it is HORRIBLE . It 's TIGHT . It should NOT BE TIGHT .
 I normally wear a small/medium depending on a shirt and saw the reviews that this product 's sizes ran small . I ordered a large accordingly , and on washing the item -LRB- I have n't even worn it yet ! -RRB- it shrunk to the point where my midsection was showing -LRB- Washed the item in a cold water setting and line dried it -RRB- . Unfortunately , my polos need to be tucked in for work -LRB- which is why I purchaised this product -RRB- and these will not suffice .
 I ordered this shirt in spite of the reviews which mostly stated that the shirts were far too small . All those reviews were RIGHT . I ordered what is supposedly an adult 3x . I ordered a size larger than usual -LRB- I can normally wear a 2x VERY comfortably -RRB- to account for the size issues stated by other reviewers . When I received the shirt and tried it on , the fit is more like an adult LARGE . The fabric stretched enough that I COULD wear it , if I chose , but the fit was tight enough I would not choose to EVER wear it in public.I 'm not sure where these ` adult ' sizes were determined , but no 3x adult I have ever seen would be able to wear a shirt of this size . If you choose to buy this shirt , make sure to order AT LEAST two sizes up . Or , more preferably , look for another shirt to purchase . I am returning mine and really wish I had not paid extra for expedited shipping since I will not get that back in the refund .
 Work uniform requires that I wear a polo in royal , navy , or red . This technically fits the bill but it is both too small and way too short . I am normally a 3x but I should have just passed on it . It 's too short to tuck in let alone cover my stomach .
 It is too small to be considered &#34; large &#34; as indicated . Once washed , it will shrink even smallerj . All the sizes comply to the teeny bopper .
 I 'm 5 ' 6 and got the medium . The cloth feels tough on the body and overall it just seems too big for my taste .

 Julbo makes some great products , some of which I also own , but the Nomad is n't one of them . In this case , Julbo 's engineers designed sunglasses which actually scratch themselves , a flaw which is utterly inexcusable.When the temples are folded inward , as we always do when we put them in the case or our pockets , the temple tips make contact with the inside of the lenses , and as they move slightly up and down , you soon have a line of vertical scratches on the inside of both lenses.This design flaw aside , the Zebra lens is probably the most scratch prone lens that I have ever used.A terrible product !
 I 'm not sure what others see in this pant . It is not women 's sizing like the caption says . I ordered an XL which is the size I wear , and no part of it fit me . The waist was the right size , but the hips were too big and the inseam too long . And the leg length ! I could have cut off 10 inches and it still would have been long enough . I was going to return it but had my husband try them on and they fit him ! He is 6 ' 2 '' and 240 lbs and they were too long on him ! They are definitely cut for a man 's shape .
 I thought they were like the regular adidas pants but they are not . I hate how the bottom is cut , its like a flare kid of cut .
 I guess the fit was odd for me because they 're a mens size . Fit everywhere except the length , way too long and there was no way I could make them work for me . Easy return and refund .
 I mistakenly ordered these pants in an x-large , the size I used to be but am no longer , and they were gigantic , so I exchanged them for a large . The large went back as well because they were about 4 inches too long . I am not short ; I am 5 ' 6 &#34; and have pretty long legs -LRB- about 32 &#34; inseam -RRB- and I do n't think I should have to shorten workout pants . I have two pair of Adidas workout pants and , including these , none are of a uniform length . Most likely this reflects different factories . These pants fit more like unisex pants than women 's . I do n't know why manufacturers of athletic wear can not make their pants with a choice of lengths . Some do , but it is not easy to find them .
 I have no clue why the sizing is so off on these pants but I sent them back . They are like 4 inches too long and the waistband is too small for the way the pants are made . It 's like they were made for someone who is n't proportionate ? I 'm not sure but they did n't work for me .
 Purchased the pink pant and the gray pant with red stripes . The pink is really ugly . I bought it because it was on sale for about 60 % off . The gray is less ugly but not particularly attractive.The material is not up to par with the adidas pants of a decade ago . Then again , most things are not like they were a decade ago.Three stars for the downgrade on quality and the ugly color.Good pants , though , for lounging around the house and being lazy.UPDATE
 The fit is awful , color not the same , nothing like any Adidas pants I own . . do not buy , it is a waste of your money !
 I bought this bra based on the positive reviews that I read from various sites . The material , style and color are quite lovely . I was excited to try it on . Then my self-esteem fell through the floor

 My son desparately wanted this toy for his 5th birthday . I found one in a clearance bin for $ 5 ... it seemed like a bargain since they go for about $ 20-25 . Now I know why it was there ! I feel like I got ripped off for $ 5 . Definitely do n't waste your money . It does work well as a water gun , but I agree with the first reviewer ... the web fluid is really cool but only works well for about 30 seconds and at $ 6 a can , you do n't get a lot of bang for your buck . Too bad ... if it actually worked it would be a really cool toy .
 I bought this for my 5 yr old grandson . He was n't able to use it because the spining gear would not engage . He was able to hold the can and quirt the string and use the water squirter seperately but the thing would not work as advertised . The thing is cheap China plastic and not worth buying .
 This is junk and a major rip off . The commercials entice the kids but it hardly worked -- replacing the web fluid is a fortune and even if you do replace the canisters . . they run out of fluid very quickly.Don ' t waste your good money .
 I got this for my son after seeing all of the commercials on tv and saw how `` cool '' it was . We got it home , put it together , and started spraying all over the back deck , the house and the window . It came out like silly string so I figured it would dissipate . The web shooter only lasted about a minute . We bought an extra one and were finished in less than 5 minutes total . Very disappointing . It has been about 4 weeks and our deck still has blue goo all over it . We have to get the deck redone because when we try to clean it up , the finish comes off . It is still on the house and the door . I can only imagine what it would do to a car . Will not buy again . Fun for about 5 min and that 's it .
 My 6 year old son had to have this toy because of the tv commercials and he 's spiderman 's number one fan.Opening the battery compartment was difficult . I had to try 4 different phillips head screwdrivers and then resorted to prying the compartment open.When I put the fluid cannister in , at first it would not discharge . When I moved it around some , I got it to discharge but rather than spray a `` spinning web '' it released a growing blob of sticky , toxic smelling goo which stuck to the front of the `` blaster '' . I had to tell my son that one of his key christmas gifts did not work . I felt really bad for a family that could only afford one gift for their child and this was it.Because the goo smelled toxic and because it came from China , I took some outside and tried to light it with a match -LRB- the box says it is not flammable and not toxic -RRB- . The goo immediately went up in flames . I suggest that Habro recall this sorry P.O.S. before someone burns their house down with it .
 this is the worst toy ever ... the web string sticks to everything and stains fabric . i was expecting it to be like silly string but it was very wet and sticky . makes a total mess -LRB- even outside -RRB- !!!
 Parents , go with your gut on this one
 I thought is was going to be a premium product . Serengeti lenses are supposed to be top quality . I received the lenses , in their box . The box seems used -LRB- the external one , and the case -RRB- they are both in less than optimal conditions.The lenses , supposed to be photocromich , are simply NOT . I 've tested them enclosing one lens and leaving the other opened , after 30 minutes of strong direct sunlight , they look the same . There is no additional darkening in the exposed side.I do n't know if this is serengeti fault , or these lenses are not original . In any case . I greatly regreat buying them .
 I bought these and finally set one up on Halloween . Intended to use all three , but it was so cheap and didnt fit together well , I had to tape it together , threw it out today . Asking for a refund for the other two
 I bought this bra based on the positive reviews that I read from various sites . The material , style and color are quite lovely . I was excited to try it on . Then my self-esteem fell through the floor
 This skirt is fine for mild usage , but fell apart more and more as we tried to use it in our theater production . It also is only for small children -- it would n't fit my 5th graders .
 We had this costume just a week and the pants got a huge hole in the crotch area . Not long after that it go a hole in the arm pit . I can say it was not worth the money . Poor workmanship . Wish I could have gotten a refund or something .
 We got 2 costumes for Halloween , this one and a Doctor . They were the same price . The Doc costume was quality fabric with pockets and lots of accoutrements . This pirate costume looked like it might be nice , but up close it 's a super cheap and cheesy costume . The shirt and belt is all just printed on the front on thin material . I saw the same one at Wall Mart and at the time it had n't arrived and I thought `` Thank goodness we did n't buy a cheap one that looks like that ! '' Then I was disappointed to see that exact one arrive .
 finally received product . product was good , and what i expected . package was lost in shipping process and took over a month to receive . sort of puts a damper on the whole gift idea .
 The original price of this product was marked as $ 105.00 so I thought given the original price and the brand the quality would be good . They were marked down 70-75 % so I paid about $ 30-35 for these sunglasses . They are not worth it . They do n't have polarized lenses , they are not very comfortable , and they are a bit crooked .
 The service is horrible ! Nothing was received but the money was charged ! I have to call back after 2 month to get my money back .
 What a load of losers Jos. A. Bank are . Treat your customers poorly . They are stupid . They 'll forget.Sorry losers . We wanted to be your customers , but you screwed us . Let us show you what long memories we have . One by one by one by one .
 I was very disappointed in this item . I bought it for my grandson who loves to dress up in costumes . It was very poorly made , especially the shirt and pants .
 We received the shoes which were ordered in a size 13 . They were tried on by both my daughter who is a size 12 and myself who is a size 11 . There was not a prayer of getting these shoes on . There was no indication on the package or in the package how to contact the seller or return the shoes . I went online and found the email for the seller and asked for instructions on how to send the shoes back . It took 2 emails to get a response and there response was to try to get the shoes to fit , that this type of shoe you have to `` squeeze '' into and it will stretch to fit . This was unacceptable . It took 2 of these emails to get them to give my an address to send the to and a return # which is needed in order to get credit for the return . I was highly disappointed with this whole process and I still had to pay for the original shipping of $ 10.00 and another $ 9.00 to get them back to them .
 I was dissapointed with this item . It was n't , but should have been , listed as a unisex item . I was under the impression that I was purchasing a ladies rain slicker . When I received it , I realised that this was more likely to fit a man . The sleeves were way too long and wide . Even though there is a velcro strip , when it is fastened to a average sized womans wrist , it flares out like a skirt ... not flattering . In my opinion , this jacket would be a much better fit for a man . If you 're looking for a jacket to fit the average proportioned woman , in any size , I would n't reccommend this . I was also dissapointed with the lining . It was a flimsy net . All in all I thought this was a very cheap looking jacket . It would be okay for an emergency rain jacket that you 'd leave in the trunk of your car , but you could purchase those much less expensivly than this particular one .
 I ordered size M for my husband . And it 's bigger than he needs . He usually wears M-L . Small will be better . Do n't like fabris at all / Rough material . Very heavy .

 I am very disappointed with the costume I purchased . The item had good reviews online , and when it arrived it looked like it was used . The costume has spots all over it , and can not be cleaned . I 'm even more disappointed that I will not be able to wear the costume for my party tomorrow night . I do n't understand why someone would ship something in such bad condition . Anyone that intends to buy this , needs to be aware of what condition it might arrive in .
 way , way more flimsy and cheap than it looks in the photo . i guess considering the price i should n't have expected so much but i was super disappointed when i opened the package and realized what i had bought . there is absolutely no shape to the pumpkin , it just hangs lifelessly flat against your body . and it is so thin , you can right through it , even through both layers when you hold it up to the light . the stem hat was also disappointing since it only has ties to hold it on your head . i almost was n't even going to bother with this costume but i decided to make the best of it and ended up spending two hours lining the entire thing with batting . the batting gave it just the right amount of shape and made it not see though anymore . plus it was warm for running around outside . i also bought a little plastic head band and slipped it through a loop on the stem so the hat would stay on my head all night . it turned out cute in the end but was way more work than one would have thought necessary . it may only deserve one star but i am feeling generous today .
 The material is a little too flimsy for my taste . You would difineately have to wear something under it in chilly temps .
 I ordered size M for my husband . And it 's bigger than he needs . He usually wears M-L . Small will be better . Do n't like fabris at all / Rough material . Very heavy .
 I was dissapointed with this item . It was n't , but should have been , listed as a unisex item . I was under the impression that I was purchasing a ladies rain slicker . When I received it , I realised that this was more likely to fit a man . The sleeves were way too long and wide . Even though there is a velcro strip , when it is fastened to a average sized womans wrist , it flares out like a skirt ... not flattering . In my opinion , this jacket would be a much better fit for a man . If you 're looking for a jacket to fit the average proportioned woman , in any size , I would n't reccommend this . I was also dissapointed with the lining . It was a flimsy net . All in all I thought this was a very cheap looking jacket . It would be okay for an emergency rain jacket that you 'd leave in the trunk of your car , but you could purchase those much less expensivly than this particular one .
 This thing is no joke ... I thought it would be cute to buy this for my girlfriend & I for our Safari trip to Africa.I was dead wrong . We hiked through the Albertine Rift in Rwanda to observe Gorilla 's in their natural habitat.I heard a loud rumbling coming from over my right shoulder & before I could make sense of it , a silverback stormed from the bush after apparently locking eyes with my girlfriend 's t-shirt . In what amounts to no more than three seconds , he was firmly groping my girlfriend 's buttocks and trying to tear off her clothing . For a split second I realized we had something in common.That 's where our similarities ended . Short one Gorilla shirt , I grabbed my girlfriends arm & began tugging -LRB- with the help of our tour guide -RRB- her away from him . Luckily our tour guide had half of a bag of local candy called mumbaqua that he tossed 10 meters from the gorilla.The gorilla sprinted towards the candy & we hightailed it out of the bush on the tour guide 's Yamaha three wheeler.Before we could compose our thoughts , we heard gunfire & saw local poachers firing in our direction . Unable to determine why I waved my hands in their direction so they would recognize that we were n't armed.Then it hit me ... much like the Gorilla who mistook my girlfriend for a rival male , these poachers were looking at my T-Shirt & were convinced I was 475 pounds of delicious bush meat & fur.Luckily our tour guide was a native of these lands & quickly turned our Yamaha 3 wheeler down an isolated creek bed getting us to safety.Be very careful when & where you wear this shirt !
 1 . Take ten minutes to get into character -LRB- which in this case is steely-eyed Gorilla -RRB- 2 . Within the duration of wearing the garment , you must jump around , pound on keyboards , and violently peel bananas as if your sad little monkey world will end tomorrow .3 . Avoid eye contact4 .

 I love apes , simply love them - I love their ample heaving chests , peircing blue green eyes , and scat throwing ability . With this in mind I bought the shirt , unbeknownst to me this is really an iron on tattoo of some sort . I can not take the shirt off , woman find me extraordinary and approach me often - here 's the downside every time a woman approaches I ca n't resist the urge to throw scat at them . I rate this shirt a number 2 . Pro - womanCon - Scat

 I had bought these for my boy thinking they had a fly front much like the mens versions I wear . They are my son 's least favorite underwear mearly cause he has to pull the front of them down in order to use the bath room . He 's only 6 and when I had trained him I tought him to use the fly on the front of his underwear . In my personal thoughts are that men 's / boy 's underwear has a fly in the front for need use , unlike that for women and girls whom do n't require it .
 These have no opening !!! Maybe the online advertizement said that , but I missed it !! While it might not matter on a very little boy , I mistakenly purchased these for an 11 yr old that was appalled at my blunder .
 I like this bra , but after wearing it for 1 month , the wire poked out through the fabric . I tried to return it on Amazon , and was not able . I hope the seller will provide me some way to return this bra , as it is a faulty product . I have used this type of bra before , and its just fine . I am appauled though , that after 1 month , the wire would break through on this bra , since it is such a very expensive bra .
 By the way , I 'm not `` John '' obviously , but we ca n't figure out how to change the name . Anyway , I 'm Charlene . I should have know better than to buy a bra recommended by Oprah Winfrey ! This extremely expensive minimizer was fine on the first couple of days , then it started to gap in front between the cups with the ends of the underwires poking through my shirts . Eventually -LRB- 2-3 weeks later -RRB- the fabric in the back started to separate . And it did n't even do a good job minimizing . There are much better alternatives out there , much more reasonably priced .
 This bra constricted my breasts at the top and created an odd pear shape . Not at all flattering for those with breasts that are full on top .
 I did not receive the bra 's I ordered.They came from a Bealls store in Florida . The only thing they got right was the size . The bra 's were not even Warners brand name so I had to send them back.I wo n't order again.Debbie Bosley
 I bought this bra based on the positive reviews that I read from various sites . The material , style and color are quite lovely . I was excited to try it on . Then my self-esteem fell through the floor
 This product came as expected and looks just like the photo . But do not expect to be able to wear them as there is absolutely nothing in them to hold them up -LRB- No elastic , no lycra , no spandex , nothing -RRB- . I am 5 ' 7 '' and weigh 130 . Can not even walk in them , they slide down . Ironically it seems the garter on this product needs a suspender . They are unable to be worn , useless .
 My 5 ' 7 '' / 150 lb wife - who normally wears a size 10-12 - could barely get these above her knees ... the hose were that short . Do n't know if this is typical , or if we were shipped a dud . Anyway , they went into the trash .
 I ordered this for Valentine 's day and I got it a few days before V-day . I was really excited to try it on . It looked exactly the same as in the picture . The only thing is that it 's too short/small . I am 5 ' 2 and I am size a 3 . Imagine those guys who wear their pants really low ? That 's how it looked on me . I ended up scrunching it and tossing it . I 'm so sure that its gon na shrink more if I wash it .
 I orderd this shirt for my boyfriend in Canada . I knew it would n't get there in time for Christmas , but I did n't know this company would deliver it to the wrong address ! Hell , they delivered it to the wrong country ! When I tried contacting them , they did n't even have to courtesy to reply to any of my emails . I will NEVER buy from them again and I would n't recommend anyone buying from them if you want your items delivered to the right place . I hope whoever recieved it enjoys it , because my boyfriend never will . Nothing like paying good money for nothing !!!!!!!
 paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon/this store - NEVER AGAIN !
 First , the shipping and packaging . Very poor for both . Shipping was far too long . I waited almost two weeks to get the four sweatshirts that I ordered . The packaging was in a plastic bag which was okay , however the sweatshirts were just stuffed into the bag . All of them were dirty and needed to be washed right away . They looked like they had been stored in someones garage or worse ... in the trunk of somebody 's car . I would be very surprised if I discovered Fashion Rack was a real store and not some roadside vendor.Second , I ordered XL and glad I did . I normally wear a large , but after receiving four dirt and dust covered sweatshirts and laundering them , they shrunk to just about a Large size . I 'm not sure what will happen with the next laundering . If they shrink more they will be too small and unwearable.The material is very light . This is fine with me . Others may not like a light sweatshirt . It wo n't keep you warm in very cold climates.All in all , I got what I paid for . A cheap sweatshirt .
 Problem is - I do not know how I like this product because I received sweatpants and a sweatshirt . Can you help me with the return ? There was no paperwork mailed in the package received
 This is a very light weight sweatshirt which is available in many colors , but if you want a quality heavy weight sweatshirt this is not it .

 Proof that you get what you pay for , these low-priced sweatshirts are thin and skimpy . Sweatshirts seem to have taken the same quality nosedive as jeans . Ribbing around collar is especially thin . I am still searching for the real thing .

 I wear a size 12 and the garter belt was way too big and the hose were too tight at my thighs .
 If you are tall like me , there is a good chance these will look a little ridiculous on you ... . If you do n't mind the garter being very low on your hips -LRB- or lower if you plan on moving at all -RRB- , then these are very nice ; - -RRB-
 These stockings were very cheap , the material was not good as well , and they were ugly . I threw these out when i saw them .

 paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon/this store - NEVER AGAIN !
 sides come all the way up to the arm pit . not usable at all . does n't hold up . will find someone to give it to I suppose . Would n't buy it again . No way to return . Guess you take your chances when you buy things this way .
 This can be a very comfortable bra but if you are full busted , you will need to go up a size around or it bunches up .
 Glamorise Leisure BraI ordered both a 40B/C/D and a 42B/C/D in the hopes that one of them would fit . In both , the band is too tight . Given the construction of the bra , I would n't buy it for regular use , but for a bra to wear around the house it would be fine , if the band were not so tight . Because of the front closure the band size ca n't be adjusted.Unless you know you can return it if it does n't fit , I 'd skip this one.UPDATE : I returned both the 40B/C/D and a 42B/C/D and ordered a 44B/C/D . It 's like a completely different bra . The band size is slightly looser , but the rest of the bra , in spite of being listed as the same cup size -LRB- B/C/D -RRB- is much , much bigger . The armhole is smaller because the sides have been made much higher while the sides kind of bulge out because the stitching around the armhole pulls the edges in , and the cup size is significantly larger as well . If a large-busted woman tried this one -LRB- I 'm not that big -RRB- I ca n't see how she 'd get her arms comfortably through the armholes and her breasts would most likely slip into the pocketed fabric under the arms -LRB- not attractive -RRB- . Not a good experience for me . This one is being returned , as well .
 Disappointing . I tried 3 different models of Glamorise bras , all supposedly in the same size but only one fit and it was Not this one . The non adjustable shoulders did not fit my shape . the back did not stretch enough for me to get it done up at the front . It has put me off ordering bras online because it costs me too much in shipping to and from Australia .
 Just did not fit at all . The cups are really small so I had to pay to return it .
 Everything about this bra was much smaller than the size it claimed to be.I was very dissappointed and dissatisfied with the purchase .
 I wanted this to be comfortable so I bought it larger on purpose . It 's so tight that it 's almost unwearable . I am a 36DD and I got it in a 40 so that it would NOT be tight . Fail .
 The size is about 2 '' smaller around the chest and the cup size is also small . I 'll just say my cup runneth over !
 My initial thoughts on this bra were that it was too small , but I liked the way it looked on . After wearing it twice , I can see that it 's one of those `` come home and quickly take it off '' kind of bras -- nothing `` leisure '' about it . I ordered my regular size , and I had to pull , push and squeeze to get into it . The arm holes are VERY small , which means that it sits high in the back -LRB- and under the arms -RRB- and puts undo pressure on the shoulders . My shoulders were actually burning after wearing it for a short time . I 'm very disappointed , because I do like the way it looks . I actually think it 's very pretty . Surprisingly , my teen daughter who 's very bra-fussy wants one . It would probably be better-suited to a regular-sized girl . If you are plus size and need that extra room , consider another bra . If you do decide to give this one a try , add at least FOUR inches to your measurement . I ordered a 44 for my mother , and it did n't fit . It did , however , nicely fit my sister who wears a 40 .
 Unfortunately , for me , this bra did not work out at all . I ordered the same size I always wear and could barely get it on . Cup size and all over fit way too small . I returned both bras .
 The bra size does not relect normal bra sizes . I am small sized and yet I could not use the bra even with the help of another person . The design was nice ,
 I THINK THEY MUST GET THE `` SLIGHTLY IRREGULAR '' ITEMS FROM OTHER COMPANIES BECAUSE THIS BRA WAS OBVIOUSLY IRREGULAR DID NOT FIT CORRECTLY WAS WAY WAY TOO SMALL . HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT
 My regular bra size is 38DD . At the recommendation of several reviewers I ordered this bra one size larger in a 40DD-F . I think a 42 might be better because I had intended this as a sleep bra and the bottom elastic is a bit tighter than I would like in a sleep bra . However , the real problem is that the cup size runs very small . If you place your hands over your breasts and press tightly to your chest , you will have an idea of the way this bra supports . The stretch fabric crushes my boobs to my ribs , creating huge cleavage in the middle and with a surprising amount of overflow ending up at my sides - effectively under my arms . I think this may be a contributing factor in other reviewers ' complaints that the bra is uncomfortable under their arms . I can not recommend this bra to full-busted women . It does immobilize the girls , but not comfortably .
 I wear a professionally sized DD bra which is what I bought . This bra looks like I am wearing pasties . It is very small cupped and not the DD-size it claims to be . It is very soft though . I returned it .
 This item must be made with latex ... it is itchy and on the small side . For years I have ordered Serenada leisure bras thatwere described similarly to this item ... but the quality of this Glamorise bra is apalling .
 This is uncomfortable -- do n't like the fabric and it is cut for a very broad shouldered woman . I much prefer the cloth and cut of the Leading Lady brand
 I should have paid attention to the other comments ... although they said it was one size out ... you should make that about 3 sizes out !
 You mine as well call the 34 a 32 . I could hook it but it is so snug I would never be able to wear it .
 Wish I couldv ' e loved this more but the band was so itchy ! Everything else about this bra was great . You need to go up a size though .
 When I first bought this bra and wore it for the first time I hated it . I gave it another chance and hated it even more . First the arm holes are way to small , it cuts up underneath the armpits and is annoying and painful . I am a 42DD , but I 'm not morbidly obese and my arms are n't THAT big . Secondly , it fits like a sports bra and pushes your boobs together and down , there is not definition between the two cups . Lastly , it is hideous looking . I was n't trying to find a sexy bra , just one that would work for day to day use -LRB- I 'm a vet tech -RRB- but this one takes the cake for atrociousness .
 I ordered this bra for my mother , hoping it would be easier for her to dress herself . When I received it , they said it could not be returned if worn . I understand that , I guess , but I immediately returned it without taking it to my mother , because if it did n't fit , I could n't have returned it . So I do n't know if it would have worked or not .
 Terrible fit . Extremly samll and I had to return it . I do not recommend this product unless you order a couple of sizes larger .
 at least at first it would loss a lot of its material which I then find in my beard or on my lips or on my jacket .
 It feels too stiff and tight , very uncomfortable . It 's a good idea but the fabric used needs to be soft and stretchy not like this stuff .
 This is a very light weight sweatshirt which is available in many colors , but if you want a quality heavy weight sweatshirt this is not it .

 When I ordered this product , I thought I was getting the pants too . Nope , big mistake ... so read all your purchases clearly . When I did get this jacket it was all faded looked -LRB- not in a cute way -RRB- . It looked like it had been washed 100 times . This was a waste of my money ... I was too lazy to send it back because I hate Internet returns ... so this is money wasted
 This wand is the equivalent of a drinking straw , with a cheap sequin star , even cheaper looking strands of beads and wrapping paper equivalent ribbon attached . I paid over $ -LSB- ... -RSB- with shipping . It 's worth about -LSB- ... -RSB- . Do n't waste your money .
 I am very dissapionted with amazon and the product that i purchased . I contacted amazon and told of my problem with the product . The reply i recieved was , it is nothing to do with us get in contact with wrangler.I orderd the goods through amazon , piad amazon , they sent the jeans that where faulty . and it has nothing to do with amazon.The jeans that i orderd where a 36inch wiast . On the labels it states a size 36inch wiast . But the jeans are a 38inch wiaste . they are still in the box that they arrived in . Obviosly when amazon take your money and deliver the goods , they are not concerned if there is a fault in the goods . they have your money goodbye customer
 THEY WERE HUGE ! The waist fit , if my waist was supposed to be up to my chest ! Too long , ridiculous . Cant hem them . The inseam is like three feet long . what were they thinking ?

Hell , they delivered it to the wrong country ! When I tried contacting them , they did n't even have to courtesy to reply to any of my emails . I will NEVER buy from them again and I would n't recommend anyone buying from them if you want your items delivered to the right place . I hope whoever recieved it enjoys it , because my boyfriend never will . Nothing like paying good money for nothing !!!!!!!
 paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon/this store - NEVER AGAIN !
 First , the shipping and packaging . Very poor for both . Shipping was far too long . I waited almost two weeks to get the four sweatshirts that I ordered . The packaging was in a plastic bag which was okay , however the sweatshirts were just stuffed into the bag . All of them were dirty and needed to be washed right away . They looked like they had been stored in someones garage or worse ... in the trunk of somebody 's car . I would be very surprised if I discovered Fashion Rack was a real store and not some roadside vendor.Second , I ordered XL and glad I did . I normally wear a large , but after receiving four dirt and dust covered sweatshirts and laundering them , they shrunk to just about a Large size . I 'm not sure what will happen with the next laundering . If they shrink more they will be too small and unwearable.The material is very light . This is fine with me . Others may not like a light sweatshirt . It wo n't keep you warm in very cold climates.All in all , I got what I paid for . A cheap sweatshirt .
 Problem is - I do not know how I like this product because I received sweatpants and a sweatshirt . Can you help me with the return ? There was no paperwork mailed in the package received
 I ordered this tie thinking I was going to get 100 % silk . When it came - the label reads 100 % polyester !! Do n't buy it !
 I purchased a 100 % silk tie , but the merchant sent a 100 % microfiber tie . When I contacted the merchant , he apologized and said to keep the tie that he had sent and he would mail me the correct tie immediately . This never happened and when I contacted him again about the problem , he simple referred me to the original postal tracking that said that I had received the merchandise . Of course , I would never do business with this merchant again . By the way , the microfiber tie is OK , but it is not what I ordered .
 I bought this bra based on the positive reviews that I read from various sites . The material , style and color are quite lovely . I was excited to try it on . Then my self-esteem fell through the floor

 This is a very light weight sweatshirt which is available in many colors , but if you want a quality heavy weight sweatshirt this is not it .

 It gives nice separation . Good fabric . Be careful about sizing . I felt it was a size bigger than other brands . The under wire digs in a lot in the middle . Very uncomfortable .
 This used to be a great bra until they changed it and they no longer make it with a molded cup . It 's a nice bra if you 're looking for that style but I 'm an older woman who need help in the support dept with a molded cup !
 Unfortunately I ordered the wrong size and had to return this product . However , had I ordered the right size , I still would have returned it . The description states `` smooth cup '' which I took to mean that it would be discreet , even in cold weather . This was not the case , the cup has thin material and would not hide anything . Although it is a pretty bra , it 's not good to wear under form fitting clothes . : -LRB-
 I was dissapointed with this item . It was n't , but should have been , listed as a unisex item . I was under the impression that I was purchasing a ladies rain slicker . When I received it , I realised that this was more likely to fit a man . The sleeves were way too long and wide . Even though there is a velcro strip , when it is fastened to a average sized womans wrist , it flares out like a skirt ... not flattering . In my opinion , this jacket would be a much better fit for a man . If you 're looking for a jacket to fit the average proportioned woman , in any size , I would n't reccommend this . I was also dissapointed with the lining . It was a flimsy net . All in all I thought this was a very cheap looking jacket . It would be okay for an emergency rain jacket that you 'd leave in the trunk of your car , but you could purchase those much less expensivly than this particular one .
 I ordered size M for my husband . And it 's bigger than he needs . He usually wears M-L . Small will be better . Do n't like fabris at all / Rough material . Very heavy .
 We picked this costume for our almost 24 month old because we wanted something a little different and this was the cutest indian outfit we found with a headpiece too . For the price , however , the quality could be a lot better . The material is thin , see through , and the waistband on the pants is not made very well and keeps trying to slip down . We thought we might could use it next year too since it goes to 4T and the pants are way too long , but the shirt is almost too short right now . The cutest part of the outfit , the headpiece , does n't fit very well and it 's not made to . You would think there would be some elastic or something to accomodate for different size heads or some way to help it stay on , but no , it just sits there . We passed over another indian outfit because it did n't have a cute headpiece but this one does n't fit our toddler 's head at all . We bought some moccasins to go with it which we can keep using this winter . I was very tempted to send this back but decided to keep it and it is cute . If you buy this and are going to use it outside and it 's cold , some clothes underneath will be needed .
 This item should not be listed as a 2t-4t , I bought this for my 2 year old who is wearing size 3t-4t clothing and it was entirely too short for him , both the pants and the shirt , as well as the wig fitting on his head . But fortunately amazon has great support and is making everything easier with returning and refunds ! As for a 1 year old or one just turning 2 this would make a great costume . Just had to go with a bigger size for my son .

 My husband loves this type of coin pouch , but the ones he has been using for years are bigger . This will work until we can find the other ones . also they seen a little stiff and do n't open very wide .
 I purchased three Rolfs Coin Pouches to give to friends . All three were a big disappoinment due to the FLIMSY leather . They felt like tissue paper and would not hold two dimes . One opened up and would not close when I was caught in a rainstorm and was soaked . It is difficult if not impossible to find a Squeeze coin pouch that is made of stiff enough leather to stay closed . I would have liked to have known they were made so flimsy . No body at all .
 First , the shipping and packaging . Very poor for both . Shipping was far too long . I waited almost two weeks to get the four sweatshirts that I ordered . The packaging was in a plastic bag which was okay , however the sweatshirts were just stuffed into the bag . All of them were dirty and needed to be washed right away .

 Proof that you get what you pay for , these low-priced sweatshirts are thin and skimpy . Sweatshirts seem to have taken the same quality nosedive as jeans . Ribbing around collar is especially thin . I am still searching for the real thing .

 The costume is fine . The boot part is not great . The costume came without the hat which was disappointing for my son .
 At first I really liked the bra , it definitely holds my DDs in place , but it puts SO much pain and pressure on my shoulders . I only wear it in moments of desperation now : -LRB-
 I figured this HAD to be a great bra with all of the glowing reviews from other busty ladies , but it failed to deliver . Not comfortable , does not support well and just creates a big `` uniboob '' look like all other sports bras . Go with the Champion Powerback if you are looking for support , lift and separation in a sports bra and you have large breasts .
 Bra fit well , but it did n't provide enough support . When I tried it on , there was as much bounce as if I were wearing a regular bra -- not a sports bra . I would not recommend this bra for high or even medium impact sports .
 I own two Maia 's by Moving Comfort so I tried this one out when I found it on sale . It does n't have underwire , I had total uniboob . The band at the bottom would n't stay put , it kept rolling up a bit . I bought a 38C , the same as I wear in the Maia , but the weird uniboob look is just too unflattering . I may try wearing a regular bra underneath , but I never do that with the Maia . I would n't wear it unless my other two are n't clean .
 I bought this based on past reviews but am disappointed . It is extremely difficult to get on and off . I read earlier reviews commenting on this but thought how hard could a bra be ? Well , it is difficult to fasten once on and even harder when you are sweaty . It also cuts into my arm pit on my left side . I have never spent this much money on a sports bra and regret doing so .
 If you 're a petite woman , I do not recommend this bra . To achieve any control of the bouncing at all , I had to pull the straps so tight , that the bra almost cuts into my armpits , because it 's sides are too wide .
 My Moving Comfort Cara works beautifully for yoga , running , and backpacking . When I tried to order another Cara , the seller sent a Fiona instead . I tried it out to be fair . Unfortunately , it felt like a grudge against my breasts
 I ca n't see how this bra is any better than much less expensive ones that pull on over your head , in fact , not as good . I stiil had the same old uni-boob problem and they 're still bouncy , only more in tandem . It did n't seem as secure as the pull-on types . I ordered a Glamorise Sports bra at the same time which is bulit more like a regular bra , only with enhanced structural details . It was much more secure , very minimal bouncing , and without uni-boob .
 I have read such positive reviews on this style of bra , that I had to give it a try . I have the Moving Comfort Maia , and absolutely love it . It is an under-wire style and does the job so much better . I am returning this bra , and plan to stick to under-wire styles from now on .
 I returned this . Even though I ordered the same size I ordinarily would for a sports bra , it was a very strange fit . The band was fine , but the cups were too big . I 've had trouble with this brand before & will not bother trying any of their other styles .
 No molded cups . . so this can not be a high impact support bra . . it 's ugly w / o cups . . color is as shown . .
 I read that this bra fit small but I did n't really expect it to be as small as it was . I wear a 34C on the loosest hook so I ordered a 34C and when I recieved it , I was disappointed to find that it did n't fit well at all . I could do it up but it was n't comfortable . Reading other reviews , I thought it would have more padding then it did . Even though my boobs were pancaked , due to the fact the bra was too small , the bra still showed headlights . The adjustable straps is a great feature but I do n't think I 'll be ordering this bra again in a different size .
 For me , this was way too tight . I 've never had a 40D bra be this tight . I 'm all for support but this was just constricting and uncomfortable and so I 'll send it back . I 'm really disappointed because if it were just a tad bigger in the band I would have kept it . I 'm not quite sure how this can be considered a size 40 .
 Seemed well built , but not true to size order bigger than you are . cup size OK but around smaller than regular bras .
 This style/make of bra is not for a full figured woman . There was no support at all for a 44D/DD size . Needs more padding/support .
 I bought this bra after reading all the great reviews and have to say I am very disappointed . The bra is very well made and fits comfortably , although you have to take care to get the velcro on the straps lined up perfectly to prevent it digging into your shoulders . If I was just wearing it for walking it would be fine , but I wore it to a Zumba class and it was anything but okay . First of all , I was bouncing all over the place . The worst part though was that when I took it off after the class , I had never seen such a wet bra . So much for the wicking material . Even my old compression bras keep me drier . In short , not for high impact and not for women who sweat when they work out .
 I loved this sports bra . However , the last time I washed it the clasp end of the back had completely melted ! The bra is now completely useless .
 Two years ago I bought this bra for my grand daughter who plays volleyball and she loved it because it gave her good support and no bounce -LRB- 38DD -RRB- . The new lining is n't as good as it once was and therefore she wanted me to return it and look for a bra with more support . I am disappointed with the changes to a once great sports bra .
 There is nothing good about this bra . It does n't move , true . It flattens , true . Does it do that well?NO !!! To use a common metaphor , the headlights are still on and visible . If it worked for others , I 'm glad . Me ? No ! Wished I had returned it .
 I would not recommend this sports bra . After trying the Maia and Juno , I was very disappointed in this sports bra . The straps are kind of bulky and did n't line up very well . I did not find this sports bra to be very supportive and it seemed awkward to adjust .
 I read the reviews and ended up ordering this bra . I 'm a 40D - this thing was not comfortable at all . Sure it had support but I ended up returning it .
 Mia bra has so much more support . Did n't realize this one did not have underwire . Gives you a uni-boob . Thought I 'd try it to see if this was any cooler but it is n't . Would not recommend this for any high impact aerobics . Mia does not let you move an inch & keeps you from having uni-boob . Wish they would come up with a seamless version , though . But , this is better than a regular bra for sports & it does hook in the back . One thing to be careful , though , is the velcro strap adjustments . Get them precise or the velcro will rub your arm pit area .
 The moving comfort Fiona bra would have been met my needs had it had truly molded cups like Hind -LRB- Saucony motion -RRB- or Under Armour -- it lacks suppression cups and the thin fabric coverage caused nipple show through and rub so it really is not useable for running for me -- fine for yoga but not for other sports . It is supportive but the hooks in the back are difficult to do even when the bra hooks are done up front so this one went back . Instead I purchased the Under Armour Endure zip front in D cup -LRB- comes in S , M , L with D cup -RRB- , which though runs a little small , provides good support , easy removability -LRB- a plus after a good workout -RRB- . I loved it so much that I bought several of these . I wish bra manufacturers would add some color and ease of removability to the sports bra selection . I am sick of the black or white options . The colored sports bras usually are less supportive and pull off variety . Hind made some excellent ones but Saucony has gone back to black and white.I rated this low because of 1 -RRB- insufficent fabric for good nipple coverage and comfort up front ; 2 -RRB- difficult to hook when compared to other bras with back hooks .
 It was small in & tight u would need almost 2 sizes bigger , I 'm a 38c but this was no way close ,
 I love this bra , it 's made extremely well and i was excited to find it in my small band but semi-large cup size . But I returned it , bcuz the only reason I chose this bra was because the description said it had molded cups . It does n't . I tried it on and had MAJOR `` poke thru '' and that 's just not cute . I 'd never leave the house like that so Unfortunately I returned it . had it had molded cups -LRB- like the description said it did -RRB- , I would hve kept it and it would hve been easily a 4 star , maybe 5 .
 If you are larger in the bust area and do high impact aerobics , this bra is not for you ! It does n't look good either . It does not create a separation between your bust . I thought I had finally found a good sports bra , and once I received it in the mail and tried it one , I was so disappointed .
 this sports bra has okay support , however there is nothing to cover up how cold you are ... The adjustable sraps are weird , I guess you could get use to it , but the straps are secured with velcro which if I remember correctly from the 80 's does not last very long .
 Found out after I was sent an email that the product had been shipped that it was on backorder and was refunded my money . I should have never been able to order it if it was on backorder .
 I 've been looking for a new sports bra and when I researched this one , it sounded like just the ticket . I 'm a little over 50 and wear a 34DD . The bra is well made and comfortable , but there really is n't much support . It may be enough for a younger woman or someone with small breasts , but it did n't work for me at all . Darn it , I loved the green !
 I was fairly disappointed with this bra . The materials are good quality and construction is clean -LRB- no weak seams , loose threads -RRB- , but bounce control was n't optimal and some of its `` features '' actually hurt a bit . I usually use two fairly cheap compression sports bras and can achieve minimal movement with them . This bra felt like 1.5 of those bras and cost about 2x more . The straps are looped through a slit at the top edge of the front of the bra and are secured by Velcro . You adjust them by unlatching them , pulling them tighter , and reattaching to the Velcro strip . This system is far inferior to the normal sliding adjustment most bras have . The straps dig into my skin at the point of attachment , and by the end of a workout those two spots on my chest are really sore.Pros : Good materialsGood constructionCons : Straps hurtStrap adjustment system is badBounce control is just so-so given the price
 Bought this sports bra in a 32D based on reviews that said it is `` true to VS sizes '' , but I did not find this to be true . My VS size is 32D , but the cup size on this bra is huge . I plan on returning it , but I 'm debating going down to a B or C cup size -LRB- it 's really that big -RRB- . Chest size fits perfect though . I do love that it functions like a regular bra with the back closure since I do the `` sports bra hop '' to get out of my other MC bras . I just ca n't give it a better rating because I ca n't wear it in the size I got .
 not the same fit as others of the same brand , model purchased the same size . Factory defect ? You tell me . ran larger than normal
 i 'm actually not a 32B but am a 30B/C , and got this thinking , sports bras are usually too tight so why not try the next size up ? well , this was so tight i had to return it . i could barely breathe with it on , and it squashed my chest without supporting it . felt like one of those chest-binder things . the good
 Despite the Moving Comfort &#34; bra finder &#34; on their website giving this bra as an option for a 40DD doing high impact activities such as running , I found this bra to be almost completely lacking in support . By the end of my run , I was clutching my boobs in my hands to keep them from knocking me unconscious.Additionally , the lining is only stitched to the body of the bra at the edges , so after wear , the bottom band has rolled up so much that the lining is all but hiding the main fabric.It looks like Enell is going to be my next stop .
 This sports bra offers minimal support . I bought it based on reviews and that it called itself a high motion control / high impact sports bra . I went jogging in it once and hated it .
 For starters , I am a 34DD in my mid twenties and to me this bra is only useful for yoga at home . I purchased this bra because of all the amazing reviews , which I now totally disagree with . I enjoy running , hiking , yoga , and gym activities.The disapointment started with the look of the bra , as a curvy woman I hope to at least look like one , but in this I felt like a B. I told myself to suck it up , because nobody cares at the gym . On the drive to the gym , I found myself wobbling in this bra , bad sign . The `` molded cups '' they claim to have are nothing more than a very thin layer of tightly shaped fabric , nothing like say , the Juno . Additionally , the only way to avoid a lot of movement is to tighten the straps to the point that your shoulders end up hurting by the end of cardio , before I can even get to strength training . I get that enough in my daily life.The two biggest failings were ones I encountered on a hike . The `` compression '' aspect of the bra does nothing more than mash you together . Beneath the thin fabric the girls are free to wobble about and between them there is no breathing room . To put it lightly , I was uncomfortably sweaty and still wishing for a real sports bra . While walking ! Then , when a cold wind blows , anybody around is free to see exactly how chilly you find it . Embarassing , to say the least.I honestly do n't understand how this is a high impact bra recommended to women my size . I gave the company a second chance and picked up a Juno on sale . After just one gym use I love it so much more in every way . I look good and I feel good . We 'll see how it holds up on a hike . Do not buy this online if you are curvy , try it in a store . Even on sale , now I 'm out that money because I was desperate for a sports bra .
 To start off , I returned the Moving Comfort Fiona Bra . The material is very thin -LRB- 2 layers thin -RRB- . Fiona has absolutely NO nipple coverage . There are no ` cups ' in this sports bra . Secondly , yes it does have adjustable straps , but they are velcro and fasten under the straps . I like to do a mix of excercises , but mostly cardio . I tried doing jumping jacks with this sports bra on . It offerd moderate support , the ladies did some bouncing . I did n't feel like there was enough lift or support for high impact activity . I am a 36-38C and ordered a 38C . It had an ok fit . Not too tight , but not too loose either . -LRB- That is with it fastened as tight as it would go . -RRB- If I were going to keep it , I think a 36C would fit better . Overall , it is fine if you do n't mind nipple show , a few bounces , and the velcro straps . If you want compression and minimal bounce , take a pass .
 I found immediately after putting it on that the adjustment velcro on each strap was very uncomfortable . They are located in the front of the bra , and felt like two big bulges pushing in underneath each side of my collarbone . I have heard great things about MovingComfort , so I do n't think it means their other bras are unpleasant . I just found out that this one would n't work for me .
 I bought this in my normal size 38D but it is too big . I will keep it anyway because I do n't want to hassle with an online return/exchange when I am not sure what my correct size should be in this bra . I have to wear this on the last set of hooks and put the straps up as high as they will go , then it is okay for strength training and low impact cardio , but the fit is still too loose to support high impact activities . The other thing I do n't like is that the material is very slippery , so it is hard to fasten the hooks . On a positive note , the colors are beautiful . I got the mojito , which is a nice bright green . A lot of sites only offer basic black or white , so you may need to shop around to find the pretty colors .
 I usually do n't take the time to write reviews , but I do n't want anyone else who is looking for a supportive sports bra to waste there money . This bra offers no support at all ! I bought this bra for my daily walks hoping it would offer me average support . All I can say is that It offers NO support at all . I can say that It is comfortable , that is if your looking for a bra to wear while sitting on the couch . However if you actually need support because your active , KEEP on looking this is NOT the bra you want . People who gave this bra positive reviews must have implants or have never had children .
 It 's not like the picture at all . I expected firm cups and more contouring and shaping and it is not . It is just like a soft cup , wireless bra . I wanted something that supports my breasts so that I can move , like run , or jump rope , but it does not do that . I am returning it : - -LRB-
 Although the design is good -LRB- adjustable straps and Three plush-backed hook-and-eye rows on band , as described in Product Features -RRB- , but the material used is something that gets malodorous just in 2-3 hours . I have other brands I can use several times before such a bad smell is felt ! So it 's not my body problem , but the quality.And there 's also no cup as described in product features ! Honestly , I spent this much for getting these cups . Actually this was the distinguishing feature I was craving , and it made me happy when I read here that it has cups . But when I received it , there was no cup!So I feel it has really been a waste of money .
 bra does n't have padding in the front so when it is cold everyone can see know what happens . otherwise it fits ok but does n't provide the support a sports bra should . It fits like a regular bra so it 's not a good buy for a sports bra
 Just purchased this bra and was very disappointed . I am a runner and DD cup . There was no support . The bra was also very stretchy , so it felt loose . I do not recommend this for any big-busted girl doing high-impact activities .
 This bra did n't offer enough support for larger cup sizes . I 'm a 36C , and I run and play soccer . I 've tried many different sports bras and this one did n't come close to supporting my chest while running . I felt the material was way to stretchy to prevent `` bounce '' and keep everything strapped down as a good sports bra should .
 I did n't like this bra as well as the other one I had bought at the same time -LRB- same company , different style -RRB- , it fit different and I did n't like the Velcro straps . I returned it .
 I was a bit disappointed with this bra , as a 38D I did n't find it supportive enough for my sports needs . I found the Juno much better .
 So I rarely review anything online , but I really just wanted to say few things about this bra.so someone else does n't get caught out.im a 38d with a 27 waist so im just big on top . . and I can not get over d reviews by people with bigger bust than me , dunno how they were supported by this bra.it is honestly for me anyway , was a glorified shelf tank top , absolutely no support total bounce and just very light.sports bras arent supposed to be VERY comfortable so I knew once I put it on that it was n't gona be much use for running.i log 35 + miles a wk , its prob good for yoga etc low impact sports.i would highly recommend the Juno great great bra for running or the enell 100 , this is only my experience but I have it now and ca n't return it so tis a bit of a waste.good luck gals .
 I have another sports bra like this but this one is not very good - the way the straps are built rub against my inside shoulder . Also the back end adjustable strap is too clunky and also rubs . No way I could wear this for a long run - which is why I bought it as a marathoner .
 Fits well , does not hold breast in place and the bottom seam rolls.Feels uncomfortable . You have to keep unrolling all day.Straps are nice .
 I bought it because Im large chested and the elastic band keeps twisting and curling . Not happy with the purchase : -LRB-
 After hearing all the great things about this bra , I bought it for running and was excited to give it a try . Boy was I greatly diappointed . This bra is flimsy and did not provide any support . I 'm only a 36B , I do n't know how anyone larger could like this bra . My old Champion bras give much better support . I returned this bra , the material was thin , provided no modesty coverage and had no support . I ca n't see how it 's rated to be a high support bra for running .
 I wear a 34D bra , and ordered this in the same size . The bra was ok in the band measurement , but the cup size was a B , at most . It was ridiculously tiny and also weirdly centered . If your breasts grow out of your sternum , I suppose this will work . This was definitely not a size D or C bra . It was labeled 34D but in actuality must have been a B to be this tiny . Returning . Disappointed . All 3 bras I bought from this brand are going right back and I am never buying from them again . Stick to Nike , Under Armour , Adidas .
 I 'm so confused . I thought this was a supportive sports bra for C 's and up ??? I needed another sports bra for my high cardio workouts , and contemplated buying this for the longest time -LRB- I have previously bought a moving comfort racerback bra that I love but is now no where to be found -RRB- and seeing that there was over 300 reviews figured it would be awesome ! Bought my regular bra size , which fits great and I love the non-racerback/velcro straps design , but here 's the thing . When you say a sports bra is supportive , I 'm thinking supportive under the bust and it keeps the ladies from BOUNCING . One of of two ai n't bad right ? It 's definitely supportive under the bust , but the bouncing ? I was simply trying it on and jumped up a down a couple times , and I could n't handle all the bouncing . Oh and it 's barely lined ! So beware ! Because if it 's cold in the room , others will definitely know . This is definitely going back .
 I wanted to love it . . all the glowing reviews gave me immense hope . Seriously , I do n't understand the attraction . Wish I had returned it , instead of giving it the chance it did n't deserve . : -LRB- It 's awful !! 1 . Offers very little support and zero bounce control .2 . Flimsy . No structure whatsoever .3 . A limp , shapeless piece of fabric .4 . Cups are strange and loose .5 . Bottom band shifts out of shape in the front , turning and twisting .6 . It 's very noticeable under tee shirts.I measured carefully , per instructions . The result was my usual bra size . That 's what I ordered and it 's so oversized ! The cups seem huge.Bummer .
 Tried this bra . I am a DD , and this was not nearly supportive enough while running . Also , the straps adjust at the front/shoulders , and that extra bit of fabric really rubbed on my skin , and a week later I still have actual scabs from it . I would highly recommend going with the Enell sports bra , it is so worth the extra money .
 Looking for sturdy shorts , you found em.The fabric is so tough , it will barely bend . More like canvas than cloth.The length is good and long - past the knee.The reason these got sent back is old-man waist - they fasten above the bellybutton .
 I 've ordered these shorts 4 days ago and they still ca n't seem to get it shipped out of their warehouse . Do n't bother with this buy them from your local store . Who knows when I will receive them .
 I have never had a problem ordering clothes online but these shorts are ridiculous . They are a full four and a half inches narrower than advertised , which goes way beyond what is acceptable for a clothing company . Now I know that some clothing companies tend to `` trim '' the patterns a little short and I should n't expect anything less from this particular company , however , I am actually insulted that dickies gets away with such a high level of cheap , scammy bull % # ^ * .
 Stiff , hash material . Poorly fitting . Not worth buying . I got better shorts at a local target for less than half the price .
 Dickies Men 's 13 Inch Inseam Work Short With Multi Use Pocket , Khaki , 36 is my worst buying experience through Amazon . The price is normal but the cloth is so though -LRB- like a plastic table cloth -RRB- that you feel as if you are touching a sand paper . And the style of it ? My wife and my sohn started laughing as I first tried it on . How they produce and sell something like this ? I returned the item right away .
 I have used Dickies mens work pants for the restaurants I have worked at for many years and their sizing is always wrong . I have worn 34 '' waist in them for awhile like all my other shorts/pants but when ordering the red shorts it was like I was trying to fit into pants i wore in H.S. and that was 15 years ago at a 30 '' waist . Also when they say a 13 '' inseem , ya if itis measured 13 '' below ur crotch . the dude in the pic for the shorts must be 8 ' tall !!!!!
 Dickie pants and shorts made in Mexico were comfortable and fit properly . My most recent puchases were made in Nicaragua and were horrible . The cut was wrong , waistline was wrong , the fabric was terrible . I 'll never buy Dickies again .
 I like a little bagginess in my shorts , so I ordered these in a larger size than I usually wear . Apparently , I did n't go large enough . I literally own pants supposedly two sizes smaller than these , and they fit me fine . These should have been quite big on me - and I ca n't even get the zipper up half way . I 'm not returning them because , for what I paid and what I 'd have to pay to ship them back , I just do n't think it 's worth it . I do n't recommend purchasing shorts from this company unless you can try them on - I certainly wo n't be buying from them again . I feel like I got ripped off .
 I was dissapointed with this item . It was n't , but should have been , listed as a unisex item . I was under the impression that I was purchasing a ladies rain slicker . When I received it , I realised that this was more likely to fit a man . The sleeves were way too long and wide . Even though there is a velcro strip , when it is fastened to a average sized womans wrist , it flares out like a skirt ... not flattering . In my opinion , this jacket would be a much better fit for a man . If you 're looking for a jacket to fit the average proportioned woman , in any size , I would n't reccommend this . I was also dissapointed with the lining . It was a flimsy net . All in all I thought this was a very cheap looking jacket . It would be okay for an emergency rain jacket that you 'd leave in the trunk of your car , but you could purchase those much less expensivly than this particular one .
 I ordered size M for my husband . And it 's bigger than he needs . He usually wears M-L . Small will be better . Do n't like fabris at all / Rough material . Very heavy .
 If you are looking for a supportive nursing bra without an underwire that is comfortable , keep shopping . This is not it . It offers little support for the size that it is . The straps , the seamless wrap , and the cups are all uncomfortable and have made me a crabby momma . I paid nearly $ 50 to feel this unpleasant all the time ! My biggest regret is passing along the JC Penney nursing bras I bought in 2005 . They were irreplaceable . Literally . When you find a comfortable nursing bra -LRB- and this will not be the one -RRB- , KEEP IT until menopause just on the off chance that you have an unexpected blessing down the road ! I am still searching for a bra equal to the ones I did not keep .

 Fits well , does not hold breast in place and the bottom seam rolls.Feels uncomfortable . You have to keep unrolling all day.Straps are nice .
 I have another sports bra like this but this one is not very good - the way the straps are built rub against my inside shoulder . Also the back end adjustable strap is too clunky and also rubs . No way I could wear this for a long run - which is why I bought it as a marathoner .
 The moving comfort Fiona bra would have been met my needs had it had truly molded cups like Hind -LRB- Saucony motion -RRB- or Under Armour -- it lacks suppression cups and the thin fabric coverage caused nipple show through and rub so it really is not useable for running for me -- fine for yoga but not for other sports . It is supportive but the hooks in the back are difficult to do even when the bra hooks are done up front so this one went back . Instead I purchased the Under Armour Endure zip front in D cup -LRB- comes in S , M , L with D cup -RRB- , which though runs a little small , provides good support , easy removability -LRB- a plus after a good workout -RRB- . I loved it so much that I bought several of these . I wish bra manufacturers would add some color and ease of removability to the sports bra selection . I am sick of the black or white options . The colored sports bras usually are less supportive and pull off variety . Hind made some excellent ones but Saucony has gone back to black and white.I rated this low because of 1 -RRB- insufficent fabric for good nipple coverage and comfort up front ; 2 -RRB- difficult to hook when compared to other bras with back hooks .
 There is nothing good about this bra . It does n't move , true . It flattens , true . Does it do that well?NO !!! To use a common metaphor , the headlights are still on and visible . If it worked for others , I 'm glad . Me ? No ! Wished I had returned it .
 I would not recommend this sports bra . After trying the Maia and Juno , I was very disappointed in this sports bra . The straps are kind of bulky and did n't line up very well . I did not find this sports bra to be very supportive and it seemed awkward to adjust .
 I read the reviews and ended up ordering this bra . I 'm a 40D - this thing was not comfortable at all . Sure it had support but I ended up returning it .
 Mia bra has so much more support . Did n't realize this one did not have underwire . Gives you a uni-boob . Thought I 'd try it to see if this was any cooler but it is n't . Would not recommend this for any high impact aerobics . Mia does not let you move an inch & keeps you from having uni-boob . Wish they would come up with a seamless version , though . But , this is better than a regular bra for sports & it does hook in the back . One thing to be careful , though , is the velcro strap adjustments . Get them precise or the velcro will rub your arm pit area .
 Two years ago I bought this bra for my grand daughter who plays volleyball and she loved it because it gave her good support and no bounce -LRB- 38DD -RRB- . The new lining is n't as good as it once was and therefore she wanted me to return it and look for a bra with more support . I am disappointed with the changes to a once great sports bra .
 I loved this sports bra . However , the last time I washed it the clasp end of the back had completely melted ! The bra is now completely useless .
 I bought this bra after reading all the great reviews and have to say I am very disappointed . The bra is very well made and fits comfortably , although you have to take care to get the velcro on the straps lined up perfectly to prevent it digging into your shoulders . If I was just wearing it for walking it would be fine , but I wore it to a Zumba class and it was anything but okay . First of all , I was bouncing all over the place . The worst part though was that when I took it off after the class , I had never seen such a wet bra . So much for the wicking material . Even my old compression bras keep me drier . In short , not for high impact and not for women who sweat when they work out .
 No molded cups . . so this can not be a high impact support bra . . it 's ugly w / o cups . . color is as shown . .
 I read that this bra fit small but I did n't really expect it to be as small as it was . I wear a 34C on the loosest hook so I ordered a 34C and when I recieved it , I was disappointed to find that it did n't fit well at all . I could do it up but it was n't comfortable . Reading other reviews , I thought it would have more padding then it did . Even though my boobs were pancaked , due to the fact the bra was too small , the bra still showed headlights . The adjustable straps is a great feature but I do n't think I 'll be ordering this bra again in a different size .
 For me , this was way too tight . I 've never had a 40D bra be this tight . I 'm all for support but this was just constricting and uncomfortable and so I 'll send it back . I 'm really disappointed because if it were just a tad bigger in the band I would have kept it . I 'm not quite sure how this can be considered a size 40 .
 Seemed well built , but not true to size order bigger than you are . cup size OK but around smaller than regular bras .
 This style/make of bra is not for a full figured woman . There was no support at all for a 44D/DD size . Needs more padding/support .
 I bought this based on past reviews but am disappointed . It is extremely difficult to get on and off . I read earlier reviews commenting on this but thought how hard could a bra be ? Well , it is difficult to fasten once on and even harder when you are sweaty . It also cuts into my arm pit on my left side . I have never spent this much money on a sports bra and regret doing so .
 If you 're a petite woman , I do not recommend this bra . To achieve any control of the bouncing at all , I had to pull the straps so tight , that the bra almost cuts into my armpits , because it 's sides are too wide .
 My Moving Comfort Cara works beautifully for yoga , running , and backpacking . When I tried to order another Cara , the seller sent a Fiona instead . I tried it out to be fair . Unfortunately , it felt like a grudge against my breasts
 I ca n't see how this bra is any better than much less expensive ones that pull on over your head , in fact , not as good . I stiil had the same old uni-boob problem and they 're still bouncy , only more in tandem . It did n't seem as secure as the pull-on types . I ordered a Glamorise Sports bra at the same time which is bulit more like a regular bra , only with enhanced structural details . It was much more secure , very minimal bouncing , and without uni-boob .
 I have read such positive reviews on this style of bra , that I had to give it a try . I have the Moving Comfort Maia , and absolutely love it . It is an under-wire style and does the job so much better . I am returning this bra , and plan to stick to under-wire styles from now on .
 I returned this . Even though I ordered the same size I ordinarily would for a sports bra , it was a very strange fit . The band was fine , but the cups were too big . I 've had trouble with this brand before & will not bother trying any of their other styles .
 I figured this HAD to be a great bra with all of the glowing reviews from other busty ladies , but it failed to deliver . Not comfortable , does not support well and just creates a big `` uniboob '' look like all other sports bras . Go with the Champion Powerback if you are looking for support , lift and separation in a sports bra and you have large breasts .
 Bra fit well , but it did n't provide enough support . When I tried it on , there was as much bounce as if I were wearing a regular bra -- not a sports bra . I would not recommend this bra for high or even medium impact sports .
 I own two Maia 's by Moving Comfort so I tried this one out when I found it on sale . It does n't have underwire , I had total uniboob . The band at the bottom would n't stay put , it kept rolling up a bit . I bought a 38C , the same as I wear in the Maia , but the weird uniboob look is just too unflattering . I may try wearing a regular bra underneath , but I never do that with the Maia . I would n't wear it unless my other two are n't clean .
 At first I really liked the bra , it definitely holds my DDs in place , but it puts SO much pain and pressure on my shoulders . I only wear it in moments of desperation now : -LRB-
 not the same fit as others of the same brand , model purchased the same size . Factory defect ? You tell me . ran larger than normal
 i 'm actually not a 32B but am a 30B/C , and got this thinking , sports bras are usually too tight so why not try the next size up ? well , this was so tight i had to return it . i could barely breathe with it on , and it squashed my chest without supporting it . felt like one of those chest-binder things . the good
 Despite the Moving Comfort &#34; bra finder &#34; on their website giving this bra as an option for a 40DD doing high impact activities such as running , I found this bra to be almost completely lacking in support . By the end of my run , I was clutching my boobs in my hands to keep them from knocking me unconscious.Additionally , the lining is only stitched to the body of the bra at the edges , so after wear , the bottom band has rolled up so much that the lining is all but hiding the main fabric.It looks like Enell is going to be my next stop .
 Bought this sports bra in a 32D based on reviews that said it is `` true to VS sizes '' , but I did not find this to be true . My VS size is 32D , but the cup size on this bra is huge . I plan on returning it , but I 'm debating going down to a B or C cup size -LRB- it 's really that big -RRB- . Chest size fits perfect though . I do love that it functions like a regular bra with the back closure since I do the `` sports bra hop '' to get out of my other MC bras . I just ca n't give it a better rating because I ca n't wear it in the size I got .
 I was fairly disappointed with this bra . The materials are good quality and construction is clean -LRB- no weak seams , loose threads -RRB- , but bounce control was n't optimal and some of its `` features '' actually hurt a bit . I usually use two fairly cheap compression sports bras and can achieve minimal movement with them . This bra felt like 1.5 of those bras and cost about 2x more . The straps are looped through a slit at the top edge of the front of the bra and are secured by Velcro . You adjust them by unlatching them , pulling them tighter , and reattaching to the Velcro strip . This system is far inferior to the normal sliding adjustment most bras have . The straps dig into my skin at the point of attachment , and by the end of a workout those two spots on my chest are really sore.Pros : Good materialsGood constructionCons : Straps hurtStrap adjustment system is badBounce control is just so-so given the price
 I 've been looking for a new sports bra and when I researched this one , it sounded like just the ticket . I 'm a little over 50 and wear a 34DD . The bra is well made and comfortable , but there really is n't much support . It may be enough for a younger woman or someone with small breasts , but it did n't work for me at all . Darn it , I loved the green !
 Found out after I was sent an email that the product had been shipped that it was on backorder and was refunded my money . I should have never been able to order it if it was on backorder .
 I love this bra , it 's made extremely well and i was excited to find it in my small band but semi-large cup size . But I returned it , bcuz the only reason I chose this bra was because the description said it had molded cups . It does n't . I tried it on and had MAJOR `` poke thru '' and that 's just not cute . I 'd never leave the house like that so Unfortunately I returned it . had it had molded cups -LRB- like the description said it did -RRB- , I would hve kept it and it would hve been easily a 4 star , maybe 5 .
 If you are larger in the bust area and do high impact aerobics , this bra is not for you ! It does n't look good either . It does not create a separation between your bust . I thought I had finally found a good sports bra , and once I received it in the mail and tried it one , I was so disappointed .
 this sports bra has okay support , however there is nothing to cover up how cold you are ... The adjustable sraps are weird , I guess you could get use to it , but the straps are secured with velcro which if I remember correctly from the 80 's does not last very long .
 It was small in & tight u would need almost 2 sizes bigger , I 'm a 38c but this was no way close ,
 I was dissapointed with this item . It was n't , but should have been , listed as a unisex item . I was under the impression that I was purchasing a ladies rain slicker . When I received it , I realised that this was more likely to fit a man . The sleeves were way too long and wide . Even though there is a velcro strip , when it is fastened to a average sized womans wrist , it flares out like a skirt ... not flattering . In my opinion , this jacket would be a much better fit for a man . If you 're looking for a jacket to fit the average proportioned woman , in any size , I would n't reccommend this . I was also dissapointed with the lining . It was a flimsy net . All in all I thought this was a very cheap looking jacket . It would be okay for an emergency rain jacket that you 'd leave in the trunk of your car , but you could purchase those much less expensivly than this particular one .
 I ordered size M for my husband . And it 's bigger than he needs . He usually wears M-L . Small will be better . Do n't like fabris at all / Rough material . Very heavy .

 No molded cups . . so this can not be a high impact support bra . . it 's ugly w / o cups . . color is as shown . .
 I read that this bra fit small but I did n't really expect it to be as small as it was . I wear a 34C on the loosest hook so I ordered a 34C and when I recieved it , I was disappointed to find that it did n't fit well at all . I could do it up but it was n't comfortable . Reading other reviews , I thought it would have more padding then it did . Even though my boobs were pancaked , due to the fact the bra was too small , the bra still showed headlights . The adjustable straps is a great feature but I do n't think I 'll be ordering this bra again in a different size .
 For me , this was way too tight . I 've never had a 40D bra be this tight . I 'm all for support but this was just constricting and uncomfortable and so I 'll send it back .

 I bought this bra after reading all the great reviews and have to say I am very disappointed . The bra is very well made and fits comfortably , although you have to take care to get the velcro on the straps lined up perfectly to prevent it digging into your shoulders . If I was just wearing it for walking it would be fine , but I wore it to a Zumba class and it was anything but okay . First of all , I was bouncing all over the place . The worst part though was that when I took it off after the class , I had never seen such a wet bra . So much for the wicking material . Even my old compression bras keep me drier . In short , not for high impact and not for women who sweat when they work out .
 I loved this sports bra . However , the last time I washed it the clasp end of the back had completely melted ! The bra is now completely useless .
 Two years ago I bought this bra for my grand daughter who plays volleyball and she loved it because it gave her good support and no bounce -LRB- 38DD -RRB- . The new lining is n't as good as it once was and therefore she wanted me to return it and look for a bra with more support . I am disappointed with the changes to a once great sports bra .
 There is nothing good about this bra . It does n't move , true . It flattens , true . Does it do that well?NO !!! To use a common metaphor , the headlights are still on and visible . If it worked for others , I 'm glad . Me ? No ! Wished I had returned it .
 I would not recommend this sports bra . After trying the Maia and Juno , I was very disappointed in this sports bra . The straps are kind of bulky and did n't line up very well . I did not find this sports bra to be very supportive and it seemed awkward to adjust .
 I read the reviews and ended up ordering this bra . I 'm a 40D - this thing was not comfortable at all . Sure it had support but I ended up returning it .
 Mia bra has so much more support . Did n't realize this one did not have underwire . Gives you a uni-boob . Thought I 'd try it to see if this was any cooler but it is n't . Would not recommend this for any high impact aerobics . Mia does not let you move an inch & keeps you from having uni-boob . Wish they would come up with a seamless version , though . But , this is better than a regular bra for sports & it does hook in the back . One thing to be careful , though , is the velcro strap adjustments . Get them precise or the velcro will rub your arm pit area .

 The moving comfort Fiona bra would have been met my needs had it had truly molded cups like Hind -LRB- Saucony motion -RRB- or Under Armour -- it lacks suppression cups and the thin fabric coverage caused nipple show through and rub so it really is not useable for running for me -- fine for yoga but not for other sports . It is supportive but the hooks in the back are difficult to do even when the bra hooks are done up front so this one went back . Instead I purchased the Under Armour Endure zip front in D cup -LRB- comes in S , M , L with D cup -RRB- , which though runs a little small , provides good support , easy removability -LRB- a plus after a good workout -RRB- . I loved it so much that I bought several of these . I wish bra manufacturers would add some color and ease of removability to the sports bra selection . I am sick of the black or white options . The colored sports bras usually are less supportive and pull off variety . Hind made some excellent ones but Saucony has gone back to black and white.I rated this low because of 1 -RRB- insufficent fabric for good nipple coverage and comfort up front ; 2 -RRB- difficult to hook when compared to other bras with back hooks .
 It 's not like the picture at all . I expected firm cups and more contouring and shaping and it is not . It is just like a soft cup , wireless bra . I wanted something that supports my breasts so that I can move , like run , or jump rope , but it does not do that . I am returning it : - -LRB-
 Although the design is good -LRB- adjustable straps and Three plush-backed hook-and-eye rows on band , as described in Product Features -RRB- , but the material used is something that gets malodorous just in 2-3 hours . I have other brands I can use several times before such a bad smell is felt ! So it 's not my body problem , but the quality.And there 's also no cup as described in product features ! Honestly , I spent this much for getting these cups . Actually this was the distinguishing feature I was craving , and it made me happy when I read here that it has cups . But when I received it , there was no cup!So I feel it has really been a waste of money .
 bra does n't have padding in the front so when it is cold everyone can see know what happens . otherwise it fits ok but does n't provide the support a sports bra should . It fits like a regular bra so it 's not a good buy for a sports bra
 Just purchased this bra and was very disappointed . I am a runner and DD cup . There was no support . The bra was also very stretchy , so it felt loose . I do not recommend this for any big-busted girl doing high-impact activities .
 This bra did n't offer enough support for larger cup sizes . I 'm a 36C , and I run and play soccer . I 've tried many different sports bras and this one did n't come close to supporting my chest while running . I felt the material was way to stretchy to prevent `` bounce '' and keep everything strapped down as a good sports bra should .
 I did n't like this bra as well as the other one I had bought at the same time -LRB- same company , different style -RRB- , it fit different and I did n't like the Velcro straps . I returned it .
 I was a bit disappointed with this bra , as a 38D I did n't find it supportive enough for my sports needs . I found the Juno much better .
 So I rarely review anything online , but I really just wanted to say few things about this bra.so someone else does n't get caught out.im a 38d with a 27 waist so im just big on top . . and I can not get over d reviews by people with bigger bust than me , dunno how they were supported by this bra.it is honestly for me anyway , was a glorified shelf tank top , absolutely no support total bounce and just very light.sports bras arent supposed to be VERY comfortable so I knew once I put it on that it was n't gona be much use for running.i log 35 + miles a wk , its prob good for yoga etc low impact sports.i would highly recommend the Juno great great bra for running or the enell 100 , this is only my experience but I have it now and ca n't return it so tis a bit of a waste.good luck gals .
 This sports bra offers minimal support . I bought it based on reviews and that it called itself a high motion control / high impact sports bra . I went jogging in it once and hated it .
 For starters , I am a 34DD in my mid twenties and to me this bra is only useful for yoga at home . I purchased this bra because of all the amazing reviews , which I now totally disagree with . I enjoy running , hiking , yoga , and gym activities.The disapointment started with the look of the bra , as a curvy woman I hope to at least look like one , but in this I felt like a B. I told myself to suck it up , because nobody cares at the gym . On the drive to the gym , I found myself wobbling in this bra , bad sign . The `` molded cups '' they claim to have are nothing more than a very thin layer of tightly shaped fabric , nothing like say , the Juno . Additionally , the only way to avoid a lot of movement is to tighten the straps to the point that your shoulders end up hurting by the end of cardio , before I can even get to strength training . I get that enough in my daily life.The two biggest failings were ones I encountered on a hike . The `` compression '' aspect of the bra does nothing more than mash you together . Beneath the thin fabric the girls are free to wobble about and between them there is no breathing room . To put it lightly , I was uncomfortably sweaty and still wishing for a real sports bra . While walking ! Then , when a cold wind blows , anybody around is free to see exactly how chilly you find it . Embarassing , to say the least.I honestly do n't understand how this is a high impact bra recommended to women my size . I gave the company a second chance and picked up a Juno on sale . After just one gym use I love it so much more in every way . I look good and I feel good . We 'll see how it holds up on a hike . Do not buy this online if you are curvy , try it in a store . Even on sale , now I 'm out that money because I was desperate for a sports bra .
 Fits well , does not hold breast in place and the bottom seam rolls.Feels uncomfortable . You have to keep unrolling all day.Straps are nice .
 I bought it because Im large chested and the elastic band keeps twisting and curling . Not happy with the purchase : -LRB-
 After hearing all the great things about this bra , I bought it for running and was excited to give it a try . Boy was I greatly diappointed . This bra is flimsy and did not provide any support . I 'm only a 36B , I do n't know how anyone larger could like this bra . My old Champion bras give much better support . I returned this bra , the material was thin , provided no modesty coverage and had no support . I ca n't see how it 's rated to be a high support bra for running .
 I wear a 34D bra , and ordered this in the same size . The bra was ok in the band measurement , but the cup size was a B , at most . It was ridiculously tiny and also weirdly centered . If your breasts grow out of your sternum , I suppose this will work . This was definitely not a size D or C bra . It was labeled 34D but in actuality must have been a B to be this tiny . Returning . Disappointed . All 3 bras I bought from this brand are going right back and I am never buying from them again . Stick to Nike , Under Armour , Adidas .
 I 'm so confused . I thought this was a supportive sports bra for C 's and up ??? I needed another sports bra for my high cardio workouts , and contemplated buying this for the longest time -LRB- I have previously bought a moving comfort racerback bra that I love but is now no where to be found -RRB- and seeing that there was over 300 reviews figured it would be awesome ! Bought my regular bra size , which fits great and I love the non-racerback/velcro straps design , but here 's the thing . When you say a sports bra is supportive , I 'm thinking supportive under the bust and it keeps the ladies from BOUNCING . One of of two ai n't bad right ? It 's definitely supportive under the bust , but the bouncing ? I was simply trying it on and jumped up a down a couple times , and I could n't handle all the bouncing . Oh and it 's barely lined ! So beware ! Because if it 's cold in the room , others will definitely know . This is definitely going back .
 To start off , I returned the Moving Comfort Fiona Bra . The material is very thin -LRB- 2 layers thin -RRB- . Fiona has absolutely NO nipple coverage . There are no ` cups ' in this sports bra . Secondly , yes it does have adjustable straps , but they are velcro and fasten under the straps . I like to do a mix of excercises , but mostly cardio . I tried doing jumping jacks with this sports bra on . It offerd moderate support , the ladies did some bouncing . I did n't feel like there was enough lift or support for high impact activity . I am a 36-38C and ordered a 38C . It had an ok fit . Not too tight , but not too loose either . -LRB- That is with it fastened as tight as it would go . -RRB- If I were going to keep it , I think a 36C would fit better . Overall , it is fine if you do n't mind nipple show , a few bounces , and the velcro straps . If you want compression and minimal bounce , take a pass .
 I found immediately after putting it on that the adjustment velcro on each strap was very uncomfortable . They are located in the front of the bra , and felt like two big bulges pushing in underneath each side of my collarbone . I have heard great things about MovingComfort , so I do n't think it means their other bras are unpleasant . I just found out that this one would n't work for me .
 I bought this in my normal size 38D but it is too big . I will keep it anyway because I do n't want to hassle with an online return/exchange when I am not sure what my correct size should be in this bra . I have to wear this on the last set of hooks and put the straps up as high as they will go , then it is okay for strength training and low impact cardio , but the fit is still too loose to support high impact activities . The other thing I do n't like is that the material is very slippery , so it is hard to fasten the hooks . On a positive note , the colors are beautiful . I got the mojito , which is a nice bright green . A lot of sites only offer basic black or white , so you may need to shop around to find the pretty colors .
 I usually do n't take the time to write reviews , but I do n't want anyone else who is looking for a supportive sports bra to waste there money . This bra offers no support at all ! I bought this bra for my daily walks hoping it would offer me average support . All I can say is that It offers NO support at all . I can say that It is comfortable , that is if your looking for a bra to wear while sitting on the couch . However if you actually need support because your active , KEEP on looking this is NOT the bra you want . People who gave this bra positive reviews must have implants or have never had children .
 I wanted to love it . . all the glowing reviews gave me immense hope . Seriously , I do n't understand the attraction . Wish I had returned it , instead of giving it the chance it did n't deserve . : -LRB- It 's awful !! 1 . Offers very little support and zero bounce control .2 . Flimsy . No structure whatsoever .3 . A limp , shapeless piece of fabric .4 . Cups are strange and loose .5 . Bottom band shifts out of shape in the front , turning and twisting .6 . It 's very noticeable under tee shirts.I measured carefully , per instructions . The result was my usual bra size . That 's what I ordered and it 's so oversized ! The cups seem huge.Bummer .
 Tried this bra . I am a DD , and this was not nearly supportive enough while running . Also , the straps adjust at the front/shoulders , and that extra bit of fabric really rubbed on my skin , and a week later I still have actual scabs from it . I would highly recommend going with the Enell sports bra , it is so worth the extra money .
 I have another sports bra like this but this one is not very good - the way the straps are built rub against my inside shoulder . Also the back end adjustable strap is too clunky and also rubs . No way I could wear this for a long run - which is why I bought it as a marathoner .
 This sports bra offers minimal support . I bought it based on reviews and that it called itself a high motion control / high impact sports bra . I went jogging in it once and hated it .
 For starters , I am a 34DD in my mid twenties and to me this bra is only useful for yoga at home . I purchased this bra because of all the amazing reviews , which I now totally disagree with . I enjoy running , hiking , yoga , and gym activities.The disapointment started with the look of the bra , as a curvy woman I hope to at least look like one , but in this I felt like a B. I told myself to suck it up , because nobody cares at the gym . On the drive to the gym , I found myself wobbling in this bra , bad sign . The `` molded cups '' they claim to have are nothing more than a very thin layer of tightly shaped fabric , nothing like say , the Juno . Additionally , the only way to avoid a lot of movement is to tighten the straps to the point that your shoulders end up hurting by the end of cardio , before I can even get to strength training . I get that enough in my daily life.The two biggest failings were ones I encountered on a hike . The `` compression '' aspect of the bra does nothing more than mash you together . Beneath the thin fabric the girls are free to wobble about and between them there is no breathing room . To put it lightly , I was uncomfortably sweaty and still wishing for a real sports bra . While walking ! Then , when a cold wind blows , anybody around is free to see exactly how chilly you find it . Embarassing , to say the least.I honestly do n't understand how this is a high impact bra recommended to women my size . I gave the company a second chance and picked up a Juno on sale . After just one gym use I love it so much more in every way . I look good and I feel good . We 'll see how it holds up on a hike . Do not buy this online if you are curvy , try it in a store . Even on sale , now I 'm out that money because I was desperate for a sports bra .
 So I rarely review anything online , but I really just wanted to say few things about this bra.so someone else does n't get caught out.im a 38d with a 27 waist so im just big on top . . and I can not get over d reviews by people with bigger bust than me , dunno how they were supported by this bra.it is honestly for me anyway , was a glorified shelf tank top , absolutely no support total bounce and just very light.sports bras arent supposed to be VERY comfortable so I knew once I put it on that it was n't gona be much use for running.i log 35 + miles a wk , its prob good for yoga etc low impact sports.i would highly recommend the Juno great great bra for running or the enell 100 , this is only my experience but I have it now and ca n't return it so tis a bit of a waste.good luck gals .
 Although the design is good -LRB- adjustable straps and Three plush-backed hook-and-eye rows on band , as described in Product Features -RRB- , but the material used is something that gets malodorous just in 2-3 hours . I have other brands I can use several times before such a bad smell is felt ! So it 's not my body problem , but the quality.And there 's also no cup as described in product features ! Honestly , I spent this much for getting these cups . Actually this was the distinguishing feature I was craving , and it made me happy when I read here that it has cups . But when I received it , there was no cup!So I feel it has really been a waste of money .
 bra does n't have padding in the front so when it is cold everyone can see know what happens . otherwise it fits ok but does n't provide the support a sports bra should . It fits like a regular bra so it 's not a good buy for a sports bra
 Just purchased this bra and was very disappointed . I am a runner and DD cup . There was no support . The bra was also very stretchy , so it felt loose . I do not recommend this for any big-busted girl doing high-impact activities .
 It 's not like the picture at all . I expected firm cups and more contouring and shaping and it is not . It is just like a soft cup , wireless bra . I wanted something that supports my breasts so that I can move , like run , or jump rope , but it does not do that . I am returning it : - -LRB-
 I 've been looking for a new sports bra and when I researched this one , it sounded like just the ticket . I 'm a little over 50 and wear a 34DD . The bra is well made and comfortable , but there really is n't much support . It may be enough for a younger woman or someone with small breasts , but it did n't work for me at all . Darn it , I loved the green !
 I was a bit disappointed with this bra , as a 38D I did n't find it supportive enough for my sports needs . I found the Juno much better .
 This bra did n't offer enough support for larger cup sizes . I 'm a 36C , and I run and play soccer . I 've tried many different sports bras and this one did n't come close to supporting my chest while running . I felt the material was way to stretchy to prevent `` bounce '' and keep everything strapped down as a good sports bra should .
 I did n't like this bra as well as the other one I had bought at the same time -LRB- same company , different style -RRB- , it fit different and I did n't like the Velcro straps . I returned it .
 I have another sports bra like this but this one is not very good - the way the straps are built rub against my inside shoulder . Also the back end adjustable strap is too clunky and also rubs . No way I could wear this for a long run - which is why I bought it as a marathoner .
 The moving comfort Fiona bra would have been met my needs had it had truly molded cups like Hind -LRB- Saucony motion -RRB- or Under Armour -- it lacks suppression cups and the thin fabric coverage caused nipple show through and rub so it really is not useable for running for me -- fine for yoga but not for other sports . It is supportive but the hooks in the back are difficult to do even when the bra hooks are done up front so this one went back . Instead I purchased the Under Armour Endure zip front in D cup -LRB- comes in S , M , L with D cup -RRB- , which though runs a little small , provides good support , easy removability -LRB- a plus after a good workout -RRB- . I loved it so much that I bought several of these . I wish bra manufacturers would add some color and ease of removability to the sports bra selection . I am sick of the black or white options . The colored sports bras usually are less supportive and pull off variety . Hind made some excellent ones but Saucony has gone back to black and white.I rated this low because of 1 -RRB- insufficent fabric for good nipple coverage and comfort up front ; 2 -RRB- difficult to hook when compared to other bras with back hooks .
 I 'm so confused . I thought this was a supportive sports bra for C 's and up ??? I needed another sports bra for my high cardio workouts , and contemplated buying this for the longest time -LRB- I have previously bought a moving comfort racerback bra that I love but is now no where to be found -RRB- and seeing that there was over 300 reviews figured it would be awesome ! Bought my regular bra size , which fits great and I love the non-racerback/velcro straps design , but here 's the thing . When you say a sports bra is supportive , I 'm thinking supportive under the bust and it keeps the ladies from BOUNCING . One of of two ai n't bad right ? It 's definitely supportive under the bust , but the bouncing ? I was simply trying it on and jumped up a down a couple times , and I could n't handle all the bouncing . Oh and it 's barely lined ! So beware ! Because if it 's cold in the room , others will definitely know . This is definitely going back .
 I wanted to love it . . all the glowing reviews gave me immense hope . Seriously , I do n't understand the attraction . Wish I had returned it , instead of giving it the chance it did n't deserve . : -LRB- It 's awful !! 1 . Offers very little support and zero bounce control .2 . Flimsy . No structure whatsoever .3 . A limp , shapeless piece of fabric .4 . Cups are strange and loose .5 . Bottom band shifts out of shape in the front , turning and twisting .6 . It 's very noticeable under tee shirts.I measured carefully , per instructions . The result was my usual bra size . That 's what I ordered and it 's so oversized ! The cups seem huge.Bummer .
 Tried this bra . I am a DD , and this was not nearly supportive enough while running . Also , the straps adjust at the front/shoulders , and that extra bit of fabric really rubbed on my skin , and a week later I still have actual scabs from it . I would highly recommend going with the Enell sports bra , it is so worth the extra money .
 Fits well , does not hold breast in place and the bottom seam rolls.Feels uncomfortable . You have to keep unrolling all day.Straps are nice .
 I wear a 34D bra , and ordered this in the same size . The bra was ok in the band measurement , but the cup size was a B , at most . It was ridiculously tiny and also weirdly centered . If your breasts grow out of your sternum , I suppose this will work . This was definitely not a size D or C bra . It was labeled 34D but in actuality must have been a B to be this tiny . Returning . Disappointed . All 3 bras I bought from this brand are going right back and I am never buying from them again . Stick to Nike , Under Armour , Adidas .
 I bought it because Im large chested and the elastic band keeps twisting and curling . Not happy with the purchase : -LRB-
 After hearing all the great things about this bra , I bought it for running and was excited to give it a try . Boy was I greatly diappointed . This bra is flimsy and did not provide any support . I 'm only a 36B , I do n't know how anyone larger could like this bra . My old Champion bras give much better support . I returned this bra , the material was thin , provided no modesty coverage and had no support . I ca n't see how it 's rated to be a high support bra for running .
 If you 're a petite woman , I do not recommend this bra . To achieve any control of the bouncing at all , I had to pull the straps so tight , that the bra almost cuts into my armpits , because it 's sides are too wide .
 My Moving Comfort Cara works beautifully for yoga , running , and backpacking . When I tried to order another Cara , the seller sent a Fiona instead . I tried it out to be fair . Unfortunately , it felt like a grudge against my breasts
 I ca n't see how this bra is any better than much less expensive ones that pull on over your head , in fact , not as good . I stiil had the same old uni-boob problem and they 're still bouncy , only more in tandem . It did n't seem as secure as the pull-on types . I ordered a Glamorise Sports bra at the same time which is bulit more like a regular bra , only with enhanced structural details . It was much more secure , very minimal bouncing , and without uni-boob .
 I have read such positive reviews on this style of bra , that I had to give it a try . I have the Moving Comfort Maia , and absolutely love it . It is an under-wire style and does the job so much better . I am returning this bra , and plan to stick to under-wire styles from now on .
 I returned this . Even though I ordered the same size I ordinarily would for a sports bra , it was a very strange fit . The band was fine , but the cups were too big . I 've had trouble with this brand before & will not bother trying any of their other styles .
 I bought this based on past reviews but am disappointed . It is extremely difficult to get on and off . I read earlier reviews commenting on this but thought how hard could a bra be ? Well , it is difficult to fasten once on and even harder when you are sweaty . It also cuts into my arm pit on my left side . I have never spent this much money on a sports bra and regret doing so .
 At first I really liked the bra , it definitely holds my DDs in place , but it puts SO much pain and pressure on my shoulders . I only wear it in moments of desperation now : -LRB-
 Bra fit well , but it did n't provide enough support . When I tried it on , there was as much bounce as if I were wearing a regular bra -- not a sports bra . I would not recommend this bra for high or even medium impact sports .
 I own two Maia 's by Moving Comfort so I tried this one out when I found it on sale . It does n't have underwire , I had total uniboob . The band at the bottom would n't stay put , it kept rolling up a bit . I bought a 38C , the same as I wear in the Maia , but the weird uniboob look is just too unflattering . I may try wearing a regular bra underneath , but I never do that with the Maia . I would n't wear it unless my other two are n't clean .
 I figured this HAD to be a great bra with all of the glowing reviews from other busty ladies , but it failed to deliver . Not comfortable , does not support well and just creates a big `` uniboob '' look like all other sports bras . Go with the Champion Powerback if you are looking for support , lift and separation in a sports bra and you have large breasts .
 There is nothing good about this bra . It does n't move , true . It flattens , true . Does it do that well?NO !!! To use a common metaphor , the headlights are still on and visible . If it worked for others , I 'm glad . Me ? No ! Wished I had returned it .
 I would not recommend this sports bra . After trying the Maia and Juno , I was very disappointed in this sports bra . The straps are kind of bulky and did n't line up very well . I did not find this sports bra to be very supportive and it seemed awkward to adjust .
 I read the reviews and ended up ordering this bra . I 'm a 40D - this thing was not comfortable at all . Sure it had support but I ended up returning it .
 Mia bra has so much more support . Did n't realize this one did not have underwire . Gives you a uni-boob . Thought I 'd try it to see if this was any cooler but it is n't . Would not recommend this for any high impact aerobics . Mia does not let you move an inch & keeps you from having uni-boob . Wish they would come up with a seamless version , though . But , this is better than a regular bra for sports & it does hook in the back . One thing to be careful , though , is the velcro strap adjustments . Get them precise or the velcro will rub your arm pit area .
 Two years ago I bought this bra for my grand daughter who plays volleyball and she loved it because it gave her good support and no bounce -LRB- 38DD -RRB- . The new lining is n't as good as it once was and therefore she wanted me to return it and look for a bra with more support . I am disappointed with the changes to a once great sports bra .
 Seemed well built , but not true to size order bigger than you are . cup size OK but around smaller than regular bras .
 This style/make of bra is not for a full figured woman . There was no support at all for a 44D/DD size . Needs more padding/support .
 No molded cups . . so this can not be a high impact support bra . . it 's ugly w / o cups . . color is as shown . .
 I read that this bra fit small but I did n't really expect it to be as small as it was . I wear a 34C on the loosest hook so I ordered a 34C and when I recieved it , I was disappointed to find that it did n't fit well at all . I could do it up but it was n't comfortable . Reading other reviews , I thought it would have more padding then it did . Even though my boobs were pancaked , due to the fact the bra was too small , the bra still showed headlights . The adjustable straps is a great feature but I do n't think I 'll be ordering this bra again in a different size .
 For me , this was way too tight . I 've never had a 40D bra be this tight . I 'm all for support but this was just constricting and uncomfortable and so I 'll send it back . I 'm really disappointed because if it were just a tad bigger in the band I would have kept it . I 'm not quite sure how this can be considered a size 40 .
 I loved this sports bra . However , the last time I washed it the clasp end of the back had completely melted ! The bra is now completely useless .
 I bought this bra after reading all the great reviews and have to say I am very disappointed . The bra is very well made and fits comfortably , although you have to take care to get the velcro on the straps lined up perfectly to prevent it digging into your shoulders . If I was just wearing it for walking it would be fine , but I wore it to a Zumba class and it was anything but okay . First of all , I was bouncing all over the place . The worst part though was that when I took it off after the class , I had never seen such a wet bra . So much for the wicking material . Even my old compression bras keep me drier . In short , not for high impact and not for women who sweat when they work out .
 Found out after I was sent an email that the product had been shipped that it was on backorder and was refunded my money . I should have never been able to order it if it was on backorder .
 I love this bra , it 's made extremely well and i was excited to find it in my small band but semi-large cup size . But I returned it , bcuz the only reason I chose this bra was because the description said it had molded cups . It does n't . I tried it on and had MAJOR `` poke thru '' and that 's just not cute . I 'd never leave the house like that so Unfortunately I returned it . had it had molded cups -LRB- like the description said it did -RRB- , I would hve kept it and it would hve been easily a 4 star , maybe 5 .
 If you are larger in the bust area and do high impact aerobics , this bra is not for you ! It does n't look good either . It does not create a separation between your bust . I thought I had finally found a good sports bra , and once I received it in the mail and tried it one , I was so disappointed .
 this sports bra has okay support , however there is nothing to cover up how cold you are ... The adjustable sraps are weird , I guess you could get use to it , but the straps are secured with velcro which if I remember correctly from the 80 's does not last very long .
 It was small in & tight u would need almost 2 sizes bigger , I 'm a 38c but this was no way close ,
 i 'm actually not a 32B but am a 30B/C , and got this thinking , sports bras are usually too tight so why not try the next size up ? well , this was so tight i had to return it . i could barely breathe with it on , and it squashed my chest without supporting it . felt like one of those chest-binder things . the good
 Despite the Moving Comfort &#34; bra finder &#34; on their website giving this bra as an option for a 40DD doing high impact activities such as running , I found this bra to be almost completely lacking in support . By the end of my run , I was clutching my boobs in my hands to keep them from knocking me unconscious.Additionally , the lining is only stitched to the body of the bra at the edges , so after wear , the bottom band has rolled up so much that the lining is all but hiding the main fabric.It looks like Enell is going to be my next stop .
 not the same fit as others of the same brand , model purchased the same size . Factory defect ? You tell me . ran larger than normal
 To start off , I returned the Moving Comfort Fiona Bra . The material is very thin -LRB- 2 layers thin -RRB- . Fiona has absolutely NO nipple coverage . There are no ` cups ' in this sports bra . Secondly , yes it does have adjustable straps , but they are velcro and fasten under the straps . I like to do a mix of excercises , but mostly cardio . I tried doing jumping jacks with this sports bra on . It offerd moderate support , the ladies did some bouncing . I did n't feel like there was enough lift or support for high impact activity . I am a 36-38C and ordered a 38C . It had an ok fit . Not too tight , but not too loose either . -LRB- That is with it fastened as tight as it would go . -RRB- If I were going to keep it , I think a 36C would fit better . Overall , it is fine if you do n't mind nipple show , a few bounces , and the velcro straps . If you want compression and minimal bounce , take a pass .
 I was fairly disappointed with this bra . The materials are good quality and construction is clean -LRB- no weak seams , loose threads -RRB- , but bounce control was n't optimal and some of its `` features '' actually hurt a bit . I usually use two fairly cheap compression sports bras and can achieve minimal movement with them . This bra felt like 1.5 of those bras and cost about 2x more . The straps are looped through a slit at the top edge of the front of the bra and are secured by Velcro . You adjust them by unlatching them , pulling them tighter , and reattaching to the Velcro strip . This system is far inferior to the normal sliding adjustment most bras have . The straps dig into my skin at the point of attachment , and by the end of a workout those two spots on my chest are really sore.Pros : Good materialsGood constructionCons : Straps hurtStrap adjustment system is badBounce control is just so-so given the price
 I found immediately after putting it on that the adjustment velcro on each strap was very uncomfortable . They are located in the front of the bra , and felt like two big bulges pushing in underneath each side of my collarbone . I have heard great things about MovingComfort , so I do n't think it means their other bras are unpleasant . I just found out that this one would n't work for me .
 I bought this in my normal size 38D but it is too big . I will keep it anyway because I do n't want to hassle with an online return/exchange when I am not sure what my correct size should be in this bra . I have to wear this on the last set of hooks and put the straps up as high as they will go , then it is okay for strength training and low impact cardio , but the fit is still too loose to support high impact activities . The other thing I do n't like is that the material is very slippery , so it is hard to fasten the hooks . On a positive note , the colors are beautiful . I got the mojito , which is a nice bright green . A lot of sites only offer basic black or white , so you may need to shop around to find the pretty colors .
 I usually do n't take the time to write reviews , but I do n't want anyone else who is looking for a supportive sports bra to waste there money . This bra offers no support at all ! I bought this bra for my daily walks hoping it would offer me average support . All I can say is that It offers NO support at all . I can say that It is comfortable , that is if your looking for a bra to wear while sitting on the couch . However if you actually need support because your active , KEEP on looking this is NOT the bra you want . People who gave this bra positive reviews must have implants or have never had children .
 Bought this sports bra in a 32D based on reviews that said it is `` true to VS sizes '' , but I did not find this to be true . My VS size is 32D , but the cup size on this bra is huge . I plan on returning it , but I 'm debating going down to a B or C cup size -LRB- it 's really that big -RRB- . Chest size fits perfect though . I do love that it functions like a regular bra with the back closure since I do the `` sports bra hop '' to get out of my other MC bras . I just ca n't give it a better rating because I ca n't wear it in the size I got .
 I was dissapointed with this item . It was n't , but should have been , listed as a unisex item . I was under the impression that I was purchasing a ladies rain slicker . When I received it , I realised that this was more likely to fit a man . The sleeves were way too long and wide . Even though there is a velcro strip , when it is fastened to a average sized womans wrist , it flares out like a skirt ... not flattering . In my opinion , this jacket would be a much better fit for a man . If you 're looking for a jacket to fit the average proportioned woman , in any size , I would n't reccommend this . I was also dissapointed with the lining . It was a flimsy net . All in all I thought this was a very cheap looking jacket . It would be okay for an emergency rain jacket that you 'd leave in the trunk of your car , but you could purchase those much less expensivly than this particular one .
 I ordered size M for my husband . And it 's bigger than he needs . He usually wears M-L . Small will be better . Do n't like fabris at all / Rough material . Very heavy .
 Although the design is good -LRB- adjustable straps and Three plush-backed hook-and-eye rows on band , as described in Product Features -RRB- , but the material used is something that gets malodorous just in 2-3 hours . I have other brands I can use several times before such a bad smell is felt ! So it 's not my body problem , but the quality.And there 's also no cup as described in product features ! Honestly , I spent this much for getting these cups . Actually this was the distinguishing feature I was craving , and it made me happy when I read here that it has cups . But when I received it , there was no cup!So I feel it has really been a waste of money .

After just one gym use I love it so much more in every way . I look good and I feel good . We 'll see how it holds up on a hike . Do not buy this online if you are curvy , try it in a store . Even on sale , now I 'm out that money because I was desperate for a sports bra .

I needed another sports bra for my high cardio workouts , and contemplated buying this for the longest time -LRB- I have previously bought a moving comfort racerback bra that I love but is now no where to be found -RRB- and seeing that there was over 300 reviews figured it would be awesome ! Bought my regular bra size , which fits great and I love the non-racerback/velcro straps design , but here 's the thing . When you say a sports bra is supportive , I 'm thinking supportive under the bust and it keeps the ladies from BOUNCING . One of of two ai n't bad right ? It 's definitely supportive under the bust , but the bouncing ? I was simply trying it on and jumped up a down a couple times , and I could n't handle all the bouncing . Oh and it 's barely lined ! So beware ! Because if it 's cold in the room , others will definitely know . This is definitely going back .
 I wanted to love it . . all the glowing reviews gave me immense hope . Seriously , I do n't understand the attraction . Wish I had returned it , instead of giving it the chance it did n't deserve . : -LRB- It 's awful !! 1 . Offers very little support and zero bounce control .2 . Flimsy . No structure whatsoever .3 . A limp , shapeless piece of fabric .4 . Cups are strange and loose .5 . Bottom band shifts out of shape in the front , turning and twisting .6 . It 's very noticeable under tee shirts.I measured carefully , per instructions . The result was my usual bra size . That 's what I ordered and it 's so oversized ! The cups seem huge.Bummer .
 Tried this bra . I am a DD , and this was not nearly supportive enough while running . Also , the straps adjust at the front/shoulders , and that extra bit of fabric really rubbed on my skin , and a week later I still have actual scabs from it . I would highly recommend going with the Enell sports bra , it is so worth the extra money .
 I have another sports bra like this but this one is not very good - the way the straps are built rub against my inside shoulder . Also the back end adjustable strap is too clunky and also rubs . No way I could wear this for a long run - which is why I bought it as a marathoner .
 Seemed well built , but not true to size order bigger than you are . cup size OK but around smaller than regular bras .
 This style/make of bra is not for a full figured woman . There was no support at all for a 44D/DD size . Needs more padding/support .
 No molded cups . . so this can not be a high impact support bra . . it 's ugly w / o cups . . color is as shown . .
 I read that this bra fit small but I did n't really expect it to be as small as it was . I wear a 34C on the loosest hook so I ordered a 34C and when I recieved it , I was disappointed to find that it did n't fit well at all . I could do it up but it was n't comfortable . Reading other reviews , I thought it would have more padding then it did . Even though my boobs were pancaked , due to the fact the bra was too small , the bra still showed headlights . The adjustable straps is a great feature but I do n't think I 'll be ordering this bra again in a different size .
 For me , this was way too tight . I 've never had a 40D bra be this tight . I 'm all for support but this was just constricting and uncomfortable and so I 'll send it back . I 'm really disappointed because if it were just a tad bigger in the band I would have kept it . I 'm not quite sure how this can be considered a size 40 .
 I loved this sports bra . However , the last time I washed it the clasp end of the back had completely melted ! The bra is now completely useless .
 I bought this bra after reading all the great reviews and have to say I am very disappointed . The bra is very well made and fits comfortably , although you have to take care to get the velcro on the straps lined up perfectly to prevent it digging into your shoulders . If I was just wearing it for walking it would be fine , but I wore it to a Zumba class and it was anything but okay . First of all , I was bouncing all over the place . The worst part though was that when I took it off after the class , I had never seen such a wet bra . So much for the wicking material . Even my old compression bras keep me drier . In short , not for high impact and not for women who sweat when they work out .
 There is nothing good about this bra . It does n't move , true . It flattens , true . Does it do that well?NO !!! To use a common metaphor , the headlights are still on and visible . If it worked for others , I 'm glad . Me ? No ! Wished I had returned it .
 I would not recommend this sports bra . After trying the Maia and Juno , I was very disappointed in this sports bra . The straps are kind of bulky and did n't line up very well . I did not find this sports bra to be very supportive and it seemed awkward to adjust .
 I read the reviews and ended up ordering this bra . I 'm a 40D - this thing was not comfortable at all . Sure it had support but I ended up returning it .
 Mia bra has so much more support . Did n't realize this one did not have underwire . Gives you a uni-boob . Thought I 'd try it to see if this was any cooler but it is n't . Would not recommend this for any high impact aerobics . Mia does not let you move an inch & keeps you from having uni-boob . Wish they would come up with a seamless version , though . But , this is better than a regular bra for sports & it does hook in the back . One thing to be careful , though , is the velcro strap adjustments . Get them precise or the velcro will rub your arm pit area .
 Two years ago I bought this bra for my grand daughter who plays volleyball and she loved it because it gave her good support and no bounce -LRB- 38DD -RRB- . The new lining is n't as good as it once was and therefore she wanted me to return it and look for a bra with more support . I am disappointed with the changes to a once great sports bra .
 At first I really liked the bra , it definitely holds my DDs in place , but it puts SO much pain and pressure on my shoulders . I only wear it in moments of desperation now : -LRB-
 Bra fit well , but it did n't provide enough support . When I tried it on , there was as much bounce as if I were wearing a regular bra -- not a sports bra . I would not recommend this bra for high or even medium impact sports .
 I own two Maia 's by Moving Comfort so I tried this one out when I found it on sale . It does n't have underwire , I had total uniboob . The band at the bottom would n't stay put , it kept rolling up a bit . I bought a 38C , the same as I wear in the Maia , but the weird uniboob look is just too unflattering . I may try wearing a regular bra underneath , but I never do that with the Maia . I would n't wear it unless my other two are n't clean .
 I figured this HAD to be a great bra with all of the glowing reviews from other busty ladies , but it failed to deliver . Not comfortable , does not support well and just creates a big `` uniboob '' look like all other sports bras . Go with the Champion Powerback if you are looking for support , lift and separation in a sports bra and you have large breasts .
 If you 're a petite woman , I do not recommend this bra . To achieve any control of the bouncing at all , I had to pull the straps so tight , that the bra almost cuts into my armpits , because it 's sides are too wide .
 My Moving Comfort Cara works beautifully for yoga , running , and backpacking . When I tried to order another Cara , the seller sent a Fiona instead . I tried it out to be fair . Unfortunately , it felt like a grudge against my breasts
 I ca n't see how this bra is any better than much less expensive ones that pull on over your head , in fact , not as good . I stiil had the same old uni-boob problem and they 're still bouncy , only more in tandem . It did n't seem as secure as the pull-on types . I ordered a Glamorise Sports bra at the same time which is bulit more like a regular bra , only with enhanced structural details . It was much more secure , very minimal bouncing , and without uni-boob .
 I have read such positive reviews on this style of bra , that I had to give it a try . I have the Moving Comfort Maia , and absolutely love it . It is an under-wire style and does the job so much better . I am returning this bra , and plan to stick to under-wire styles from now on .
 I returned this . Even though I ordered the same size I ordinarily would for a sports bra , it was a very strange fit . The band was fine , but the cups were too big . I 've had trouble with this brand before & will not bother trying any of their other styles .
 I bought this based on past reviews but am disappointed . It is extremely difficult to get on and off . I read earlier reviews commenting on this but thought how hard could a bra be ? Well , it is difficult to fasten once on and even harder when you are sweaty . It also cuts into my arm pit on my left side . I have never spent this much money on a sports bra and regret doing so .
 I was fairly disappointed with this bra . The materials are good quality and construction is clean -LRB- no weak seams , loose threads -RRB- , but bounce control was n't optimal and some of its `` features '' actually hurt a bit . I usually use two fairly cheap compression sports bras and can achieve minimal movement with them . This bra felt like 1.5 of those bras and cost about 2x more . The straps are looped through a slit at the top edge of the front of the bra and are secured by Velcro . You adjust them by unlatching them , pulling them tighter , and reattaching to the Velcro strip . This system is far inferior to the normal sliding adjustment most bras have . The straps dig into my skin at the point of attachment , and by the end of a workout those two spots on my chest are really sore.Pros : Good materialsGood constructionCons : Straps hurtStrap adjustment system is badBounce control is just so-so given the price
 Bought this sports bra in a 32D based on reviews that said it is `` true to VS sizes '' , but I did not find this to be true . My VS size is 32D , but the cup size on this bra is huge . I plan on returning it , but I 'm debating going down to a B or C cup size -LRB- it 's really that big -RRB- . Chest size fits perfect though . I do love that it functions like a regular bra with the back closure since I do the `` sports bra hop '' to get out of my other MC bras . I just ca n't give it a better rating because I ca n't wear it in the size I got .
 i 'm actually not a 32B but am a 30B/C , and got this thinking , sports bras are usually too tight so why not try the next size up ? well , this was so tight i had to return it . i could barely breathe with it on , and it squashed my chest without supporting it . felt like one of those chest-binder things . the good
 Despite the Moving Comfort &#34; bra finder &#34; on their website giving this bra as an option for a 40DD doing high impact activities such as running , I found this bra to be almost completely lacking in support . By the end of my run , I was clutching my boobs in my hands to keep them from knocking me unconscious.Additionally , the lining is only stitched to the body of the bra at the edges , so after wear , the bottom band has rolled up so much that the lining is all but hiding the main fabric.It looks like Enell is going to be my next stop .
 not the same fit as others of the same brand , model purchased the same size . Factory defect ? You tell me . ran larger than normal
 To start off , I returned the Moving Comfort Fiona Bra . The material is very thin -LRB- 2 layers thin -RRB- . Fiona has absolutely NO nipple coverage . There are no ` cups ' in this sports bra . Secondly , yes it does have adjustable straps , but they are velcro and fasten under the straps . I like to do a mix of excercises , but mostly cardio . I tried doing jumping jacks with this sports bra on . It offerd moderate support , the ladies did some bouncing . I did n't feel like there was enough lift or support for high impact activity . I am a 36-38C and ordered a 38C . It had an ok fit . Not too tight , but not too loose either . -LRB- That is with it fastened as tight as it would go . -RRB- If I were going to keep it , I think a 36C would fit better . Overall , it is fine if you do n't mind nipple show , a few bounces , and the velcro straps . If you want compression and minimal bounce , take a pass .
 I found immediately after putting it on that the adjustment velcro on each strap was very uncomfortable . They are located in the front of the bra , and felt like two big bulges pushing in underneath each side of my collarbone . I have heard great things about MovingComfort , so I do n't think it means their other bras are unpleasant . I just found out that this one would n't work for me .
 I bought this in my normal size 38D but it is too big . I will keep it anyway because I do n't want to hassle with an online return/exchange when I am not sure what my correct size should be in this bra . I have to wear this on the last set of hooks and put the straps up as high as they will go , then it is okay for strength training and low impact cardio , but the fit is still too loose to support high impact activities . The other thing I do n't like is that the material is very slippery , so it is hard to fasten the hooks . On a positive note , the colors are beautiful . I got the mojito , which is a nice bright green . A lot of sites only offer basic black or white , so you may need to shop around to find the pretty colors .
 I usually do n't take the time to write reviews , but I do n't want anyone else who is looking for a supportive sports bra to waste there money . This bra offers no support at all ! I bought this bra for my daily walks hoping it would offer me average support . All I can say is that It offers NO support at all . I can say that It is comfortable , that is if your looking for a bra to wear while sitting on the couch . However if you actually need support because your active , KEEP on looking this is NOT the bra you want . People who gave this bra positive reviews must have implants or have never had children .
 It was small in & tight u would need almost 2 sizes bigger , I 'm a 38c but this was no way close ,
 Found out after I was sent an email that the product had been shipped that it was on backorder and was refunded my money . I should have never been able to order it if it was on backorder .
 I love this bra , it 's made extremely well and i was excited to find it in my small band but semi-large cup size . But I returned it , bcuz the only reason I chose this bra was because the description said it had molded cups . It does n't . I tried it on and had MAJOR `` poke thru '' and that 's just not cute . I 'd never leave the house like that so Unfortunately I returned it . had it had molded cups -LRB- like the description said it did -RRB- , I would hve kept it and it would hve been easily a 4 star , maybe 5 .
 If you are larger in the bust area and do high impact aerobics , this bra is not for you ! It does n't look good either . It does not create a separation between your bust . I thought I had finally found a good sports bra , and once I received it in the mail and tried it one , I was so disappointed .
 this sports bra has okay support , however there is nothing to cover up how cold you are ... The adjustable sraps are weird , I guess you could get use to it , but the straps are secured with velcro which if I remember correctly from the 80 's does not last very long .
 First , the shipping and packaging . Very poor for both . Shipping was far too long . I waited almost two weeks to get the four sweatshirts that I ordered . The packaging was in a plastic bag which was okay , however the sweatshirts were just stuffed into the bag . All of them were dirty and needed to be washed right away . They looked like they had been stored in someones garage or worse ... in the trunk of somebody 's car . I would be very surprised if I discovered Fashion Rack was a real store and not some roadside vendor.Second , I ordered XL and glad I did . I normally wear a large , but after receiving four dirt and dust covered sweatshirts and laundering them , they shrunk to just about a Large size . I 'm not sure what will happen with the next laundering . If they shrink more they will be too small and unwearable.The material is very light . This is fine with me . Others may not like a light sweatshirt . It wo n't keep you warm in very cold climates.All in all , I got what I paid for . A cheap sweatshirt .
 Problem is - I do not know how I like this product because I received sweatpants and a sweatshirt . Can you help me with the return ? There was no paperwork mailed in the package received
 I orderd this shirt for my boyfriend in Canada . I knew it would n't get there in time for Christmas , but I did n't know this company would deliver it to the wrong address ! Hell , they delivered it to the wrong country ! When I tried contacting them , they did n't even have to courtesy to reply to any of my emails . I will NEVER buy from them again and I would n't recommend anyone buying from them if you want your items delivered to the right place . I hope whoever recieved it enjoys it , because my boyfriend never will . Nothing like paying good money for nothing !!!!!!!
 paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon/this store - NEVER AGAIN !
 This is a very light weight sweatshirt which is available in many colors , but if you want a quality heavy weight sweatshirt this is not it .

 Proof that you get what you pay for , these low-priced sweatshirts are thin and skimpy . Sweatshirts seem to have taken the same quality nosedive as jeans . Ribbing around collar is especially thin . I am still searching for the real thing .
 I have used Dickies mens work pants for the restaurants I have worked at for many years and their sizing is always wrong . I have worn 34 '' waist in them for awhile like all my other shorts/pants but when ordering the red shorts it was like I was trying to fit into pants i wore in H.S. and that was 15 years ago at a 30 '' waist . Also when they say a 13 '' inseem , ya if itis measured 13 '' below ur crotch . the dude in the pic for the shorts must be 8 ' tall !!!!!
 Dickie pants and shorts made in Mexico were comfortable and fit properly . My most recent puchases were made in Nicaragua and were horrible . The cut was wrong , waistline was wrong , the fabric was terrible . I 'll never buy Dickies again .
 I like a little bagginess in my shorts , so I ordered these in a larger size than I usually wear . Apparently , I did n't go large enough . I literally own pants supposedly two sizes smaller than these , and they fit me fine . These should have been quite big on me - and I ca n't even get the zipper up half way . I 'm not returning them because , for what I paid and what I 'd have to pay to ship them back , I just do n't think it 's worth it . I do n't recommend purchasing shorts from this company unless you can try them on - I certainly wo n't be buying from them again . I feel like I got ripped off .
 Looking for sturdy shorts , you found em.The fabric is so tough , it will barely bend . More like canvas than cloth.The length is good and long - past the knee.The reason these got sent back is old-man waist - they fasten above the bellybutton .
 I 've ordered these shorts 4 days ago and they still ca n't seem to get it shipped out of their warehouse . Do n't bother with this buy them from your local store . Who knows when I will receive them .
 I have never had a problem ordering clothes online but these shorts are ridiculous . They are a full four and a half inches narrower than advertised , which goes way beyond what is acceptable for a clothing company . Now I know that some clothing companies tend to `` trim '' the patterns a little short and I should n't expect anything less from this particular company , however , I am actually insulted that dickies gets away with such a high level of cheap , scammy bull % # ^ * .
 Stiff , hash material . Poorly fitting . Not worth buying . I got better shorts at a local target for less than half the price .
 Dickies Men 's 13 Inch Inseam Work Short With Multi Use Pocket , Khaki , 36 is my worst buying experience through Amazon . The price is normal but the cloth is so though -LRB- like a plastic table cloth -RRB- that you feel as if you are touching a sand paper . And the style of it ? My wife and my sohn started laughing as I first tried it on . How they produce and sell something like this ? I returned the item right away .

 It 's a fairly lightweight sunglass , but you ca n't hardly tell from the picture that it 's not a smooth wrap lens , which is what I thought it was . Instead it 's a somewhat ugly lens which is creased in the middle , and it 's striking to see when you get it . It takes away from the cool look it could have had if it was a bubble or wrap lens . It also puts uncomfortable pressure on the bridge of my nose , so that after a little while , just after a few minutes of wearing , causes my nose to feel like it has pressure points on it and stuffed up . I hate irritating feelings on and in my nose , so I do n't plan on wearing this again . I ordered another pair of sunglasses for about $ 18 which I got today , and it has no rubber nose pads , just a cheap plastic thing , and I feel perfectly fine with them except I think I feel a slight residual pressure feeling from the bolle sunglasses I 'm reviewing here from having worn them for hours , yesterday , but not yesterday night . I intend to return it .

 I ordered size M for my husband . And it 's bigger than he needs . He usually wears M-L . Small will be better . Do n't like fabris at all / Rough material . Very heavy .
 I was dissapointed with this item . It was n't , but should have been , listed as a unisex item . I was under the impression that I was purchasing a ladies rain slicker . When I received it , I realised that this was more likely to fit a man . The sleeves were way too long and wide . Even though there is a velcro strip , when it is fastened to a average sized womans wrist , it flares out like a skirt ... not flattering . In my opinion , this jacket would be a much better fit for a man . If you 're looking for a jacket to fit the average proportioned woman , in any size , I would n't reccommend this . I was also dissapointed with the lining . It was a flimsy net . All in all I thought this was a very cheap looking jacket . It would be okay for an emergency rain jacket that you 'd leave in the trunk of your car , but you could purchase those much less expensivly than this particular one .
 I 'm an adult and bought this wig for a Halloween costume , expecting it to be awesome . When it came , I was SO disappointed . The height of the wig was really cool , but there was n't enough hair on it to cover the construction . I guess you get what you pay for .
 I was very disappointed with this purchase . The wig I received looked nothing like the picture , except in that they were both pink . It was overly shiny and rather cheap . Also , it says it 's for a child , but the wig was too big for my adult-sized head . I had to have it taken in .
 I got these for my daughter as her swim yeam uniform . They are a terrible cut . They look really like old school gym shorts .
 I was looking for some gym shorts for my little girl . These said they were for children . The shorts were adult size . I was stuck with them as to ship them back would cost more that I paid for them . I threw them in the garbage .
 The way the products are linked together is misleading . All the sizes on the page make it very hard to tell what are the junior and what are the kids sizes . thought I was ordering one , got the other . Price and quality where great though . I would have spent more sending them back than I spent buying them . So I have 3 pair of worthless shorts now .
 Is this a joke or what ? These are n't an adult X-large they are a childs medium . It wo n't pay to send them back because of the shipping so I wasted $ 7.99 on a cleaning rag .
 I ordered 4 pairs of LARGE , and the shorts are way too small -- might fit a 10 year old !
 IT WAS MY MISTAKE . I DID N'T REALIZE THAT THIS ITEM WAS &#34; JUNIOR &#34; SO OF COURSE THEY DID N'T FIT . I DID N'T HAVE A PACKING ORDER SO I COULD N'T RETURN THEM . I 'LL FIND SOME SMALL PERSON TO GIVE THEM TO .
 I ordered size M for my husband . And it 's bigger than he needs . He usually wears M-L . Small will be better . Do n't like fabris at all / Rough material . Very heavy .
 I was dissapointed with this item . It was n't , but should have been , listed as a unisex item . I was under the impression that I was purchasing a ladies rain slicker . When I received it , I realised that this was more likely to fit a man . The sleeves were way too long and wide . Even though there is a velcro strip , when it is fastened to a average sized womans wrist , it flares out like a skirt ... not flattering .

 I have used Dickies mens work pants for the restaurants I have worked at for many years and their sizing is always wrong . I have worn 34 '' waist in them for awhile like all my other shorts/pants but when ordering the red shorts it was like I was trying to fit into pants i wore in H.S. and that was 15 years ago at a 30 '' waist . Also when they say a 13 '' inseem , ya if itis measured 13 '' below ur crotch . the dude in the pic for the shorts must be 8 ' tall !!!!!
 Dickie pants and shorts made in Mexico were comfortable and fit properly . My most recent puchases were made in Nicaragua and were horrible . The cut was wrong , waistline was wrong , the fabric was terrible . I 'll never buy Dickies again .
 I like a little bagginess in my shorts , so I ordered these in a larger size than I usually wear . Apparently , I did n't go large enough . I literally own pants supposedly two sizes smaller than these , and they fit me fine . These should have been quite big on me - and I ca n't even get the zipper up half way . I 'm not returning them because , for what I paid and what I 'd have to pay to ship them back , I just do n't think it 's worth it . I do n't recommend purchasing shorts from this company unless you can try them on - I certainly wo n't be buying from them again . I feel like I got ripped off .
 Looking for sturdy shorts , you found em.The fabric is so tough , it will barely bend . More like canvas than cloth.The length is good and long - past the knee.The reason these got sent back is old-man waist - they fasten above the bellybutton .
 I 've ordered these shorts 4 days ago and they still ca n't seem to get it shipped out of their warehouse . Do n't bother with this buy them from your local store . Who knows when I will receive them .
 I have never had a problem ordering clothes online but these shorts are ridiculous . They are a full four and a half inches narrower than advertised , which goes way beyond what is acceptable for a clothing company . Now I know that some clothing companies tend to `` trim '' the patterns a little short and I should n't expect anything less from this particular company , however , I am actually insulted that dickies gets away with such a high level of cheap , scammy bull % # ^ * .
 Stiff , hash material . Poorly fitting . Not worth buying . I got better shorts at a local target for less than half the price .
 Dickies Men 's 13 Inch Inseam Work Short With Multi Use Pocket , Khaki , 36 is my worst buying experience through Amazon . The price is normal but the cloth is so though -LRB- like a plastic table cloth -RRB- that you feel as if you are touching a sand paper . And the style of it ? My wife and my sohn started laughing as I first tried it on . How they produce and sell something like this ? I returned the item right away .
 I bought this bra based on the positive reviews that I read from various sites . The material , style and color are quite lovely . I was excited to try it on . Then my self-esteem fell through the floor

 I ordered 12 pairs in barely black - I received 2 pairs in beige . Now 2 months later and many calls to Amazon , the problem has not been resolved . Really terrible service .

 it is too small - the belt is absurd and the material is cheap looking and strange . i kept it to long to send back , but replaced it with a domke f 6 ,
 Size ran small , thin material , shrunk after 1st washing = big mistake purchase .

 I ordered size M for my husband . And it 's bigger than he needs . He usually wears M-L . Small will be better . Do n't like fabris at all / Rough material . Very heavy .
 I was dissapointed with this item . It was n't , but should have been , listed as a unisex item . I was under the impression that I was purchasing a ladies rain slicker . When I received it , I realised that this was more likely to fit a man . The sleeves were way too long and wide . Even though there is a velcro strip , when it is fastened to a average sized womans wrist , it flares out like a skirt ... not flattering . In my opinion , this jacket would be a much better fit for a man . If you 're looking for a jacket to fit the average proportioned woman , in any size , I would n't reccommend this .

 Do not buy this sweatshirt ! I bought 3 as gifts and was embarrassed to give them . Sweatshirt quality is ok , but graphics are totally unacceptable.While the photo shows `` DUNCAN '' as being bright and irridescent with ending letters a shiny silver , the real thing is nothing like that . The letters are printed a drab , dull gray which fade out at the end of the word ! In fact , the last 3 letters appear as if they ran out of ink and are `` irregulars '' . And , since all three I ordered are the same , it 's not a `` mistake '' . Do n't waste your money -- this sweatshirt is not worth it !

 This used to be a great bra until they changed it and they no longer make it with a molded cup . It 's a nice bra if you 're looking for that style but I 'm an older woman who need help in the support dept with a molded cup !
 Unfortunately I ordered the wrong size and had to return this product . However , had I ordered the right size , I still would have returned it . The description states `` smooth cup '' which I took to mean that it would be discreet , even in cold weather . This was not the case , the cup has thin material and would not hide anything . Although it is a pretty bra , it 's not good to wear under form fitting clothes . : -LRB-
 It gives nice separation . Good fabric . Be careful about sizing . I felt it was a size bigger than other brands . The under wire digs in a lot in the middle . Very uncomfortable .
 I felt the product was too small -LRB- at least for me -RRB- . Could hardly fit 2-3 credit cards and a driver 's license . No place to keep change . Did n't like much . .
 I bought this wallet to replace a Coach wallet given as a gift . The price was right and the reviews looked great . When I first got the wallet I was excited and I liked it immediately . Two months later I 'm very unhappy with the wallet for two main reasons .1 . The pockets for cards do n't hold anything after they 've been used for a short amount of time . I definitely do n't keep a lot of cards in my wallet , maybe 8 all together . After keeping cards in there for about one month , if I hold the wallet upside down , all the cards will fall out . I ca n't stress how annoying this is .2 . The pockets are starting to come apart at the seams . The wallet is about to fall apart . Nothing more to say about that.Although I would n't have spent that much money on the Coach wallet , I realize now that wallet was good to me for more than 4 years . I 'll be going to pick up a higher quality wallet now.Don ' t be fooled by the looks and the great price !
 I bought this wallet for my husband 's birthday and the day he opened it we discovered that the wallet is really cheap . It rips pretty easily and it is difficult to fit many credit cards -LRB- it is even harder to remove the cards after you shove them in -RRB- . Also this wallet lacks a big enough billfold for cash . It looks great and is priced nice but be warned it is a waste of money .
 It gives nice separation . Good fabric . Be careful about sizing . I felt it was a size bigger than other brands . The under wire digs in a lot in the middle . Very uncomfortable .
 This used to be a great bra until they changed it and they no longer make it with a molded cup . It 's a nice bra if you 're looking for that style but I 'm an older woman who need help in the support dept with a molded cup !
 Unfortunately I ordered the wrong size and had to return this product . However , had I ordered the right size , I still would have returned it .

 I was dissapointed with this item . It was n't , but should have been , listed as a unisex item . I was under the impression that I was purchasing a ladies rain slicker . When I received it , I realised that this was more likely to fit a man . The sleeves were way too long and wide . Even though there is a velcro strip , when it is fastened to a average sized womans wrist , it flares out like a skirt ... not flattering . In my opinion , this jacket would be a much better fit for a man . If you 're looking for a jacket to fit the average proportioned woman , in any size , I would n't reccommend this . I was also dissapointed with the lining . It was a flimsy net . All in all I thought this was a very cheap looking jacket . It would be okay for an emergency rain jacket that you 'd leave in the trunk of your car , but you could purchase those much less expensivly than this particular one .
 I ordered size M for my husband . And it 's bigger than he needs . He usually wears M-L . Small will be better . Do n't like fabris at all / Rough material . Very heavy .

 Warning - this is a cotton/polyester blend . If you want the comfort of 100 % combed cotton , try Hanes Classics 3-pack Bikini Briefs instead .
 I ordered the `` Sport '' style briefs , not the `` bikini '' briefs which were sent to me . The descriptive material clearly promoted the `` sport '' brief style .
 Very cute but unfortunately it is cheaply made . The handle broke immediately . Be aware that it is very tiny too .
 Size ran small , thin material , shrunk after 1st washing = big mistake purchase .
 This is NOT an NBA authentic Lakers jersey . This is a SWINGMAN jersey . HUGE difference . Had I known this , would have not purchased ... but seeing as how it 's four days until christmas I am obviously stuck with it . Very dissapointed . would not ever buy from again.The NBA makes three types of basketball jerseys to sell
 The item was not of the quality I had expected .
 This was much bigger and heavier than expected ; virtually no different than the regular `` NON-Flat '' folding umbrellas . I was expecting the small , light ones that were in the stores.I 'm sure as an umbrella it 's fine .
 i 'm actually not a 32B but am a 30B/C , and got this thinking , sports bras are usually too tight so why not try the next size up ? well , this was so tight i had to return it . i could barely breathe with it on , and it squashed my chest without supporting it . felt like one of those chest-binder things . the good
 Despite the Moving Comfort &#34; bra finder &#34; on their website giving this bra as an option for a 40DD doing high impact activities such as running , I found this bra to be almost completely lacking in support . By the end of my run , I was clutching my boobs in my hands to keep them from knocking me unconscious.Additionally , the lining is only stitched to the body of the bra at the edges , so after wear , the bottom band has rolled up so much that the lining is all but hiding the main fabric.It looks like Enell is going to be my next stop .
 not the same fit as others of the same brand , model purchased the same size . Factory defect ? You tell me . ran larger than normal
 To start off , I returned the Moving Comfort Fiona Bra . The material is very thin -LRB- 2 layers thin -RRB- . Fiona has absolutely NO nipple coverage . There are no ` cups ' in this sports bra . Secondly , yes it does have adjustable straps , but they are velcro and fasten under the straps . I like to do a mix of excercises , but mostly cardio . I tried doing jumping jacks with this sports bra on . It offerd moderate support , the ladies did some bouncing . I did n't feel like there was enough lift or support for high impact activity . I am a 36-38C and ordered a 38C . It had an ok fit . Not too tight , but not too loose either . -LRB- That is with it fastened as tight as it would go . -RRB- If I were going to keep it , I think a 36C would fit better . Overall , it is fine if you do n't mind nipple show , a few bounces , and the velcro straps . If you want compression and minimal bounce , take a pass .
 I found immediately after putting it on that the adjustment velcro on each strap was very uncomfortable . They are located in the front of the bra , and felt like two big bulges pushing in underneath each side of my collarbone . I have heard great things about MovingComfort , so I do n't think it means their other bras are unpleasant . I just found out that this one would n't work for me .
 I bought this in my normal size 38D but it is too big . I will keep it anyway because I do n't want to hassle with an online return/exchange when I am not sure what my correct size should be in this bra . I have to wear this on the last set of hooks and put the straps up as high as they will go , then it is okay for strength training and low impact cardio , but the fit is still too loose to support high impact activities . The other thing I do n't like is that the material is very slippery , so it is hard to fasten the hooks . On a positive note , the colors are beautiful . I got the mojito , which is a nice bright green . A lot of sites only offer basic black or white , so you may need to shop around to find the pretty colors .
 I usually do n't take the time to write reviews , but I do n't want anyone else who is looking for a supportive sports bra to waste there money . This bra offers no support at all ! I bought this bra for my daily walks hoping it would offer me average support . All I can say is that It offers NO support at all . I can say that It is comfortable , that is if your looking for a bra to wear while sitting on the couch . However if you actually need support because your active , KEEP on looking this is NOT the bra you want . People who gave this bra positive reviews must have implants or have never had children .
 I was fairly disappointed with this bra . The materials are good quality and construction is clean -LRB- no weak seams , loose threads -RRB- , but bounce control was n't optimal and some of its `` features '' actually hurt a bit . I usually use two fairly cheap compression sports bras and can achieve minimal movement with them . This bra felt like 1.5 of those bras and cost about 2x more . The straps are looped through a slit at the top edge of the front of the bra and are secured by Velcro . You adjust them by unlatching them , pulling them tighter , and reattaching to the Velcro strip . This system is far inferior to the normal sliding adjustment most bras have . The straps dig into my skin at the point of attachment , and by the end of a workout those two spots on my chest are really sore.Pros : Good materialsGood constructionCons : Straps hurtStrap adjustment system is badBounce control is just so-so given the price
 Bought this sports bra in a 32D based on reviews that said it is `` true to VS sizes '' , but I did not find this to be true . My VS size is 32D , but the cup size on this bra is huge . I plan on returning it , but I 'm debating going down to a B or C cup size -LRB- it 's really that big -RRB- . Chest size fits perfect though . I do love that it functions like a regular bra with the back closure since I do the `` sports bra hop '' to get out of my other MC bras . I just ca n't give it a better rating because I ca n't wear it in the size I got .
 I love this bra , it 's made extremely well and i was excited to find it in my small band but semi-large cup size . But I returned it , bcuz the only reason I chose this bra was because the description said it had molded cups . It does n't . I tried it on and had MAJOR `` poke thru '' and that 's just not cute . I 'd never leave the house like that so Unfortunately I returned it . had it had molded cups -LRB- like the description said it did -RRB- , I would hve kept it and it would hve been easily a 4 star , maybe 5 .
 If you are larger in the bust area and do high impact aerobics , this bra is not for you ! It does n't look good either . It does not create a separation between your bust . I thought I had finally found a good sports bra , and once I received it in the mail and tried it one , I was so disappointed .
 this sports bra has okay support , however there is nothing to cover up how cold you are ... The adjustable sraps are weird , I guess you could get use to it , but the straps are secured with velcro which if I remember correctly from the 80 's does not last very long .
 Found out after I was sent an email that the product had been shipped that it was on backorder and was refunded my money . I should have never been able to order it if it was on backorder .
 It was small in & tight u would need almost 2 sizes bigger , I 'm a 38c but this was no way close ,
 Two years ago I bought this bra for my grand daughter who plays volleyball and she loved it because it gave her good support and no bounce -LRB- 38DD -RRB- . The new lining is n't as good as it once was and therefore she wanted me to return it and look for a bra with more support . I am disappointed with the changes to a once great sports bra .
 There is nothing good about this bra . It does n't move , true . It flattens , true . Does it do that well?NO !!! To use a common metaphor , the headlights are still on and visible . If it worked for others , I 'm glad . Me ? No ! Wished I had returned it .
 I would not recommend this sports bra . After trying the Maia and Juno , I was very disappointed in this sports bra . The straps are kind of bulky and did n't line up very well . I did not find this sports bra to be very supportive and it seemed awkward to adjust .
 I read the reviews and ended up ordering this bra . I 'm a 40D - this thing was not comfortable at all . Sure it had support but I ended up returning it .
 Mia bra has so much more support . Did n't realize this one did not have underwire . Gives you a uni-boob . Thought I 'd try it to see if this was any cooler but it is n't . Would not recommend this for any high impact aerobics . Mia does not let you move an inch & keeps you from having uni-boob . Wish they would come up with a seamless version , though . But , this is better than a regular bra for sports & it does hook in the back . One thing to be careful , though , is the velcro strap adjustments . Get them precise or the velcro will rub your arm pit area .
 Seemed well built , but not true to size order bigger than you are . cup size OK but around smaller than regular bras .
 This style/make of bra is not for a full figured woman . There was no support at all for a 44D/DD size . Needs more padding/support .
 No molded cups . . so this can not be a high impact support bra . . it 's ugly w / o cups . . color is as shown . .
 I read that this bra fit small but I did n't really expect it to be as small as it was . I wear a 34C on the loosest hook so I ordered a 34C and when I recieved it , I was disappointed to find that it did n't fit well at all . I could do it up but it was n't comfortable . Reading other reviews , I thought it would have more padding then it did . Even though my boobs were pancaked , due to the fact the bra was too small , the bra still showed headlights . The adjustable straps is a great feature but I do n't think I 'll be ordering this bra again in a different size .
 For me , this was way too tight . I 've never had a 40D bra be this tight . I 'm all for support but this was just constricting and uncomfortable and so I 'll send it back . I 'm really disappointed because if it were just a tad bigger in the band I would have kept it . I 'm not quite sure how this can be considered a size 40 .
 I bought this bra after reading all the great reviews and have to say I am very disappointed . The bra is very well made and fits comfortably , although you have to take care to get the velcro on the straps lined up perfectly to prevent it digging into your shoulders . If I was just wearing it for walking it would be fine , but I wore it to a Zumba class and it was anything but okay . First of all , I was bouncing all over the place . The worst part though was that when I took it off after the class , I had never seen such a wet bra . So much for the wicking material . Even my old compression bras keep me drier . In short , not for high impact and not for women who sweat when they work out .
 I loved this sports bra . However , the last time I washed it the clasp end of the back had completely melted ! The bra is now completely useless .
 If you 're a petite woman , I do not recommend this bra . To achieve any control of the bouncing at all , I had to pull the straps so tight , that the bra almost cuts into my armpits , because it 's sides are too wide .
 My Moving Comfort Cara works beautifully for yoga , running , and backpacking . When I tried to order another Cara , the seller sent a Fiona instead . I tried it out to be fair . Unfortunately , it felt like a grudge against my breasts
 I ca n't see how this bra is any better than much less expensive ones that pull on over your head , in fact , not as good . I stiil had the same old uni-boob problem and they 're still bouncy , only more in tandem . It did n't seem as secure as the pull-on types . I ordered a Glamorise Sports bra at the same time which is bulit more like a regular bra , only with enhanced structural details . It was much more secure , very minimal bouncing , and without uni-boob .
 I have read such positive reviews on this style of bra , that I had to give it a try . I have the Moving Comfort Maia , and absolutely love it . It is an under-wire style and does the job so much better . I am returning this bra , and plan to stick to under-wire styles from now on .
 I returned this . Even though I ordered the same size I ordinarily would for a sports bra , it was a very strange fit . The band was fine , but the cups were too big . I 've had trouble with this brand before & will not bother trying any of their other styles .
 I bought this based on past reviews but am disappointed . It is extremely difficult to get on and off . I read earlier reviews commenting on this but thought how hard could a bra be ? Well , it is difficult to fasten once on and even harder when you are sweaty . It also cuts into my arm pit on my left side . I have never spent this much money on a sports bra and regret doing so .
 At first I really liked the bra , it definitely holds my DDs in place , but it puts SO much pain and pressure on my shoulders . I only wear it in moments of desperation now : -LRB-
 Bra fit well , but it did n't provide enough support . When I tried it on , there was as much bounce as if I were wearing a regular bra -- not a sports bra . I would not recommend this bra for high or even medium impact sports .
 I own two Maia 's by Moving Comfort so I tried this one out when I found it on sale . It does n't have underwire , I had total uniboob . The band at the bottom would n't stay put , it kept rolling up a bit . I bought a 38C , the same as I wear in the Maia , but the weird uniboob look is just too unflattering . I may try wearing a regular bra underneath , but I never do that with the Maia . I would n't wear it unless my other two are n't clean .
 I figured this HAD to be a great bra with all of the glowing reviews from other busty ladies , but it failed to deliver . Not comfortable , does not support well and just creates a big `` uniboob '' look like all other sports bras . Go with the Champion Powerback if you are looking for support , lift and separation in a sports bra and you have large breasts .
 I 'm so confused . I thought this was a supportive sports bra for C 's and up ??? I needed another sports bra for my high cardio workouts , and contemplated buying this for the longest time -LRB- I have previously bought a moving comfort racerback bra that I love but is now no where to be found -RRB- and seeing that there was over 300 reviews figured it would be awesome ! Bought my regular bra size , which fits great and I love the non-racerback/velcro straps design , but here 's the thing . When you say a sports bra is supportive , I 'm thinking supportive under the bust and it keeps the ladies from BOUNCING . One of of two ai n't bad right ? It 's definitely supportive under the bust , but the bouncing ? I was simply trying it on and jumped up a down a couple times , and I could n't handle all the bouncing . Oh and it 's barely lined ! So beware ! Because if it 's cold in the room , others will definitely know . This is definitely going back .
 I wanted to love it . . all the glowing reviews gave me immense hope . Seriously , I do n't understand the attraction . Wish I had returned it , instead of giving it the chance it did n't deserve . : -LRB- It 's awful !! 1 . Offers very little support and zero bounce control .2 . Flimsy . No structure whatsoever .3 . A limp , shapeless piece of fabric .4 . Cups are strange and loose .5 . Bottom band shifts out of shape in the front , turning and twisting .6 . It 's very noticeable under tee shirts.I measured carefully , per instructions . The result was my usual bra size . That 's what I ordered and it 's so oversized ! The cups seem huge.Bummer .
 Tried this bra . I am a DD , and this was not nearly supportive enough while running . Also , the straps adjust at the front/shoulders , and that extra bit of fabric really rubbed on my skin , and a week later I still have actual scabs from it . I would highly recommend going with the Enell sports bra , it is so worth the extra money .
 Fits well , does not hold breast in place and the bottom seam rolls.Feels uncomfortable . You have to keep unrolling all day.Straps are nice .
 I bought it because Im large chested and the elastic band keeps twisting and curling . Not happy with the purchase : -LRB-
 After hearing all the great things about this bra , I bought it for running and was excited to give it a try . Boy was I greatly diappointed . This bra is flimsy and did not provide any support . I 'm only a 36B , I do n't know how anyone larger could like this bra . My old Champion bras give much better support . I returned this bra , the material was thin , provided no modesty coverage and had no support . I ca n't see how it 's rated to be a high support bra for running .
 I wear a 34D bra , and ordered this in the same size . The bra was ok in the band measurement , but the cup size was a B , at most . It was ridiculously tiny and also weirdly centered . If your breasts grow out of your sternum , I suppose this will work . This was definitely not a size D or C bra . It was labeled 34D but in actuality must have been a B to be this tiny . Returning . Disappointed . All 3 bras I bought from this brand are going right back and I am never buying from them again . Stick to Nike , Under Armour , Adidas .
 The moving comfort Fiona bra would have been met my needs had it had truly molded cups like Hind -LRB- Saucony motion -RRB- or Under Armour -- it lacks suppression cups and the thin fabric coverage caused nipple show through and rub so it really is not useable for running for me -- fine for yoga but not for other sports . It is supportive but the hooks in the back are difficult to do even when the bra hooks are done up front so this one went back . Instead I purchased the Under Armour Endure zip front in D cup -LRB- comes in S , M , L with D cup -RRB- , which though runs a little small , provides good support , easy removability -LRB- a plus after a good workout -RRB- . I loved it so much that I bought several of these . I wish bra manufacturers would add some color and ease of removability to the sports bra selection . I am sick of the black or white options . The colored sports bras usually are less supportive and pull off variety . Hind made some excellent ones but Saucony has gone back to black and white.I rated this low because of 1 -RRB- insufficent fabric for good nipple coverage and comfort up front ; 2 -RRB- difficult to hook when compared to other bras with back hooks .
 I have another sports bra like this but this one is not very good - the way the straps are built rub against my inside shoulder . Also the back end adjustable strap is too clunky and also rubs . No way I could wear this for a long run - which is why I bought it as a marathoner .
 So I rarely review anything online , but I really just wanted to say few things about this bra.so someone else does n't get caught out.im a 38d with a 27 waist so im just big on top . . and I can not get over d reviews by people with bigger bust than me , dunno how they were supported by this bra.it is honestly for me anyway , was a glorified shelf tank top , absolutely no support total bounce and just very light.sports bras arent supposed to be VERY comfortable so I knew once I put it on that it was n't gona be much use for running.i log 35 + miles a wk , its prob good for yoga etc low impact sports.i would highly recommend the Juno great great bra for running or the enell 100 , this is only my experience but I have it now and ca n't return it so tis a bit of a waste.good luck gals .
 It 's not like the picture at all . I expected firm cups and more contouring and shaping and it is not . It is just like a soft cup , wireless bra . I wanted something that supports my breasts so that I can move , like run , or jump rope , but it does not do that . I am returning it : - -LRB-
 Although the design is good -LRB- adjustable straps and Three plush-backed hook-and-eye rows on band , as described in Product Features -RRB- , but the material used is something that gets malodorous just in 2-3 hours . I have other brands I can use several times before such a bad smell is felt ! So it 's not my body problem , but the quality.And there 's also no cup as described in product features ! Honestly , I spent this much for getting these cups . Actually this was the distinguishing feature I was craving , and it made me happy when I read here that it has cups . But when I received it , there was no cup!So I feel it has really been a waste of money .
 bra does n't have padding in the front so when it is cold everyone can see know what happens . otherwise it fits ok but does n't provide the support a sports bra should . It fits like a regular bra so it 's not a good buy for a sports bra
 Just purchased this bra and was very disappointed . I am a runner and DD cup . There was no support . The bra was also very stretchy , so it felt loose . I do not recommend this for any big-busted girl doing high-impact activities .
 I was a bit disappointed with this bra , as a 38D I did n't find it supportive enough for my sports needs . I found the Juno much better .
 This bra did n't offer enough support for larger cup sizes . I 'm a 36C , and I run and play soccer . I 've tried many different sports bras and this one did n't come close to supporting my chest while running . I felt the material was way to stretchy to prevent `` bounce '' and keep everything strapped down as a good sports bra should .
 I did n't like this bra as well as the other one I had bought at the same time -LRB- same company , different style -RRB- , it fit different and I did n't like the Velcro straps . I returned it .
 I 've been looking for a new sports bra and when I researched this one , it sounded like just the ticket . I 'm a little over 50 and wear a 34DD . The bra is well made and comfortable , but there really is n't much support . It may be enough for a younger woman or someone with small breasts , but it did n't work for me at all . Darn it , I loved the green !
 This sports bra offers minimal support . I bought it based on reviews and that it called itself a high motion control / high impact sports bra . I went jogging in it once and hated it .
 For starters , I am a 34DD in my mid twenties and to me this bra is only useful for yoga at home . I purchased this bra because of all the amazing reviews , which I now totally disagree with . I enjoy running , hiking , yoga , and gym activities.The disapointment started with the look of the bra , as a curvy woman I hope to at least look like one , but in this I felt like a B. I told myself to suck it up , because nobody cares at the gym . On the drive to the gym , I found myself wobbling in this bra , bad sign . The `` molded cups '' they claim to have are nothing more than a very thin layer of tightly shaped fabric , nothing like say , the Juno . Additionally , the only way to avoid a lot of movement is to tighten the straps to the point that your shoulders end up hurting by the end of cardio , before I can even get to strength training . I get that enough in my daily life.The two biggest failings were ones I encountered on a hike . The `` compression '' aspect of the bra does nothing more than mash you together . Beneath the thin fabric the girls are free to wobble about and between them there is no breathing room . To put it lightly , I was uncomfortably sweaty and still wishing for a real sports bra . While walking ! Then , when a cold wind blows , anybody around is free to see exactly how chilly you find it . Embarassing , to say the least.I honestly do n't understand how this is a high impact bra recommended to women my size . I gave the company a second chance and picked up a Juno on sale . After just one gym use I love it so much more in every way . I look good and I feel good . We 'll see how it holds up on a hike . Do not buy this online if you are curvy , try it in a store . Even on sale , now I 'm out that money because I was desperate for a sports bra .
 This was much bigger and heavier than expected ; virtually no different than the regular `` NON-Flat '' folding umbrellas . I was expecting the small , light ones that were in the stores.I 'm sure as an umbrella it 's fine .
 I bought it because Im large chested and the elastic band keeps twisting and curling . Not happy with the purchase : -LRB-

When you say a sports bra is supportive , I 'm thinking supportive under the bust and it keeps the ladies from BOUNCING . One of of two ai n't bad right ? It 's definitely supportive under the bust , but the bouncing ? I was simply trying it on and jumped up a down a couple times , and I could n't handle all the bouncing . Oh and it 's barely lined ! So beware ! Because if it 's cold in the room , others will definitely know . This is definitely going back .
 I 've been looking for a new sports bra and when I researched this one , it sounded like just the ticket . I 'm a little over 50 and wear a 34DD . The bra is well made and comfortable , but there really is n't much support . It may be enough for a younger woman or someone with small breasts , but it did n't work for me at all . Darn it , I loved the green !
 I have another sports bra like this but this one is not very good - the way the straps are built rub against my inside shoulder . Also the back end adjustable strap is too clunky and also rubs . No way I could wear this for a long run - which is why I bought it as a marathoner .
 This bra did n't offer enough support for larger cup sizes . I 'm a 36C , and I run and play soccer . I 've tried many different sports bras and this one did n't come close to supporting my chest while running . I felt the material was way to stretchy to prevent `` bounce '' and keep everything strapped down as a good sports bra should .
 I did n't like this bra as well as the other one I had bought at the same time -LRB- same company , different style -RRB- , it fit different and I did n't like the Velcro straps . I returned it .
 I was a bit disappointed with this bra , as a 38D I did n't find it supportive enough for my sports needs . I found the Juno much better .
 The moving comfort Fiona bra would have been met my needs had it had truly molded cups like Hind -LRB- Saucony motion -RRB- or Under Armour -- it lacks suppression cups and the thin fabric coverage caused nipple show through and rub so it really is not useable for running for me -- fine for yoga but not for other sports . It is supportive but the hooks in the back are difficult to do even when the bra hooks are done up front so this one went back . Instead I purchased the Under Armour Endure zip front in D cup -LRB- comes in S , M , L with D cup -RRB- , which though runs a little small , provides good support , easy removability -LRB- a plus after a good workout -RRB- . I loved it so much that I bought several of these . I wish bra manufacturers would add some color and ease of removability to the sports bra selection . I am sick of the black or white options . The colored sports bras usually are less supportive and pull off variety . Hind made some excellent ones but Saucony has gone back to black and white.I rated this low because of 1 -RRB- insufficent fabric for good nipple coverage and comfort up front ; 2 -RRB- difficult to hook when compared to other bras with back hooks .
 It 's not like the picture at all . I expected firm cups and more contouring and shaping and it is not . It is just like a soft cup , wireless bra . I wanted something that supports my breasts so that I can move , like run , or jump rope , but it does not do that . I am returning it : - -LRB-
 Although the design is good -LRB- adjustable straps and Three plush-backed hook-and-eye rows on band , as described in Product Features -RRB- , but the material used is something that gets malodorous just in 2-3 hours . I have other brands I can use several times before such a bad smell is felt ! So it 's not my body problem , but the quality.And there 's also no cup as described in product features ! Honestly , I spent this much for getting these cups . Actually this was the distinguishing feature I was craving , and it made me happy when I read here that it has cups . But when I received it , there was no cup!So I feel it has really been a waste of money .
 bra does n't have padding in the front so when it is cold everyone can see know what happens . otherwise it fits ok but does n't provide the support a sports bra should . It fits like a regular bra so it 's not a good buy for a sports bra
 Just purchased this bra and was very disappointed . I am a runner and DD cup . There was no support . The bra was also very stretchy , so it felt loose . I do not recommend this for any big-busted girl doing high-impact activities .
 So I rarely review anything online , but I really just wanted to say few things about this bra.so someone else does n't get caught out.im a 38d with a 27 waist so im just big on top . . and I can not get over d reviews by people with bigger bust than me , dunno how they were supported by this bra.it is honestly for me anyway , was a glorified shelf tank top , absolutely no support total bounce and just very light.sports bras arent supposed to be VERY comfortable so I knew once I put it on that it was n't gona be much use for running.i log 35 + miles a wk , its prob good for yoga etc low impact sports.i would highly recommend the Juno great great bra for running or the enell 100 , this is only my experience but I have it now and ca n't return it so tis a bit of a waste.good luck gals .
 This sports bra offers minimal support . I bought it based on reviews and that it called itself a high motion control / high impact sports bra . I went jogging in it once and hated it .
 For starters , I am a 34DD in my mid twenties and to me this bra is only useful for yoga at home . I purchased this bra because of all the amazing reviews , which I now totally disagree with . I enjoy running , hiking , yoga , and gym activities.The disapointment started with the look of the bra , as a curvy woman I hope to at least look like one , but in this I felt like a B. I told myself to suck it up , because nobody cares at the gym . On the drive to the gym , I found myself wobbling in this bra , bad sign . The `` molded cups '' they claim to have are nothing more than a very thin layer of tightly shaped fabric , nothing like say , the Juno . Additionally , the only way to avoid a lot of movement is to tighten the straps to the point that your shoulders end up hurting by the end of cardio , before I can even get to strength training . I get that enough in my daily life.The two biggest failings were ones I encountered on a hike . The `` compression '' aspect of the bra does nothing more than mash you together . Beneath the thin fabric the girls are free to wobble about and between them there is no breathing room . To put it lightly , I was uncomfortably sweaty and still wishing for a real sports bra . While walking ! Then , when a cold wind blows , anybody around is free to see exactly how chilly you find it . Embarassing , to say the least.I honestly do n't understand how this is a high impact bra recommended to women my size . I gave the company a second chance and picked up a Juno on sale . After just one gym use I love it so much more in every way . I look good and I feel good . We 'll see how it holds up on a hike . Do not buy this online if you are curvy , try it in a store . Even on sale , now I 'm out that money because I was desperate for a sports bra .
 Bought this sports bra in a 32D based on reviews that said it is `` true to VS sizes '' , but I did not find this to be true . My VS size is 32D , but the cup size on this bra is huge . I plan on returning it , but I 'm debating going down to a B or C cup size -LRB- it 's really that big -RRB- . Chest size fits perfect though . I do love that it functions like a regular bra with the back closure since I do the `` sports bra hop '' to get out of my other MC bras . I just ca n't give it a better rating because I ca n't wear it in the size I got .
 I was fairly disappointed with this bra . The materials are good quality and construction is clean -LRB- no weak seams , loose threads -RRB- , but bounce control was n't optimal and some of its `` features '' actually hurt a bit . I usually use two fairly cheap compression sports bras and can achieve minimal movement with them . This bra felt like 1.5 of those bras and cost about 2x more . The straps are looped through a slit at the top edge of the front of the bra and are secured by Velcro . You adjust them by unlatching them , pulling them tighter , and reattaching to the Velcro strip . This system is far inferior to the normal sliding adjustment most bras have . The straps dig into my skin at the point of attachment , and by the end of a workout those two spots on my chest are really sore.Pros : Good materialsGood constructionCons : Straps hurtStrap adjustment system is badBounce control is just so-so given the price
 not the same fit as others of the same brand , model purchased the same size . Factory defect ? You tell me . ran larger than normal
 i 'm actually not a 32B but am a 30B/C , and got this thinking , sports bras are usually too tight so why not try the next size up ? well , this was so tight i had to return it . i could barely breathe with it on , and it squashed my chest without supporting it . felt like one of those chest-binder things . the good
 Despite the Moving Comfort &#34; bra finder &#34; on their website giving this bra as an option for a 40DD doing high impact activities such as running , I found this bra to be almost completely lacking in support . By the end of my run , I was clutching my boobs in my hands to keep them from knocking me unconscious.Additionally , the lining is only stitched to the body of the bra at the edges , so after wear , the bottom band has rolled up so much that the lining is all but hiding the main fabric.It looks like Enell is going to be my next stop .
 It was small in & tight u would need almost 2 sizes bigger , I 'm a 38c but this was no way close ,
 I love this bra , it 's made extremely well and i was excited to find it in my small band but semi-large cup size . But I returned it , bcuz the only reason I chose this bra was because the description said it had molded cups . It does n't . I tried it on and had MAJOR `` poke thru '' and that 's just not cute . I 'd never leave the house like that so Unfortunately I returned it . had it had molded cups -LRB- like the description said it did -RRB- , I would hve kept it and it would hve been easily a 4 star , maybe 5 .
 If you are larger in the bust area and do high impact aerobics , this bra is not for you ! It does n't look good either . It does not create a separation between your bust . I thought I had finally found a good sports bra , and once I received it in the mail and tried it one , I was so disappointed .
 this sports bra has okay support , however there is nothing to cover up how cold you are ... The adjustable sraps are weird , I guess you could get use to it , but the straps are secured with velcro which if I remember correctly from the 80 's does not last very long .
 Found out after I was sent an email that the product had been shipped that it was on backorder and was refunded my money . I should have never been able to order it if it was on backorder .
 I bought this bra after reading all the great reviews and have to say I am very disappointed . The bra is very well made and fits comfortably , although you have to take care to get the velcro on the straps lined up perfectly to prevent it digging into your shoulders . If I was just wearing it for walking it would be fine , but I wore it to a Zumba class and it was anything but okay . First of all , I was bouncing all over the place . The worst part though was that when I took it off after the class , I had never seen such a wet bra . So much for the wicking material . Even my old compression bras keep me drier . In short , not for high impact and not for women who sweat when they work out .
 I loved this sports bra . However , the last time I washed it the clasp end of the back had completely melted ! The bra is now completely useless .
 No molded cups . . so this can not be a high impact support bra . . it 's ugly w / o cups . . color is as shown . .
 I read that this bra fit small but I did n't really expect it to be as small as it was . I wear a 34C on the loosest hook so I ordered a 34C and when I recieved it , I was disappointed to find that it did n't fit well at all . I could do it up but it was n't comfortable . Reading other reviews , I thought it would have more padding then it did . Even though my boobs were pancaked , due to the fact the bra was too small , the bra still showed headlights . The adjustable straps is a great feature but I do n't think I 'll be ordering this bra again in a different size .
 For me , this was way too tight . I 've never had a 40D bra be this tight . I 'm all for support but this was just constricting and uncomfortable and so I 'll send it back . I 'm really disappointed because if it were just a tad bigger in the band I would have kept it . I 'm not quite sure how this can be considered a size 40 .
 Seemed well built , but not true to size order bigger than you are . cup size OK but around smaller than regular bras .
 This style/make of bra is not for a full figured woman . There was no support at all for a 44D/DD size . Needs more padding/support .
 Two years ago I bought this bra for my grand daughter who plays volleyball and she loved it because it gave her good support and no bounce -LRB- 38DD -RRB- . The new lining is n't as good as it once was and therefore she wanted me to return it and look for a bra with more support . I am disappointed with the changes to a once great sports bra .
 There is nothing good about this bra . It does n't move , true . It flattens , true . Does it do that well?NO !!! To use a common metaphor , the headlights are still on and visible . If it worked for others , I 'm glad . Me ? No ! Wished I had returned it .
 I would not recommend this sports bra . After trying the Maia and Juno , I was very disappointed in this sports bra . The straps are kind of bulky and did n't line up very well . I did not find this sports bra to be very supportive and it seemed awkward to adjust .
 I read the reviews and ended up ordering this bra . I 'm a 40D - this thing was not comfortable at all . Sure it had support but I ended up returning it .
 Mia bra has so much more support . Did n't realize this one did not have underwire . Gives you a uni-boob . Thought I 'd try it to see if this was any cooler but it is n't . Would not recommend this for any high impact aerobics . Mia does not let you move an inch & keeps you from having uni-boob . Wish they would come up with a seamless version , though . But , this is better than a regular bra for sports & it does hook in the back . One thing to be careful , though , is the velcro strap adjustments . Get them precise or the velcro will rub your arm pit area .
 I figured this HAD to be a great bra with all of the glowing reviews from other busty ladies , but it failed to deliver . Not comfortable , does not support well and just creates a big `` uniboob '' look like all other sports bras . Go with the Champion Powerback if you are looking for support , lift and separation in a sports bra and you have large breasts .
 Bra fit well , but it did n't provide enough support . When I tried it on , there was as much bounce as if I were wearing a regular bra -- not a sports bra . I would not recommend this bra for high or even medium impact sports .
 I own two Maia 's by Moving Comfort so I tried this one out when I found it on sale . It does n't have underwire , I had total uniboob . The band at the bottom would n't stay put , it kept rolling up a bit . I bought a 38C , the same as I wear in the Maia , but the weird uniboob look is just too unflattering . I may try wearing a regular bra underneath , but I never do that with the Maia . I would n't wear it unless my other two are n't clean .
 At first I really liked the bra , it definitely holds my DDs in place , but it puts SO much pain and pressure on my shoulders . I only wear it in moments of desperation now : -LRB-
 I found immediately after putting it on that the adjustment velcro on each strap was very uncomfortable . They are located in the front of the bra , and felt like two big bulges pushing in underneath each side of my collarbone . I have heard great things about MovingComfort , so I do n't think it means their other bras are unpleasant . I just found out that this one would n't work for me .
 I bought this in my normal size 38D but it is too big . I will keep it anyway because I do n't want to hassle with an online return/exchange when I am not sure what my correct size should be in this bra . I have to wear this on the last set of hooks and put the straps up as high as they will go , then it is okay for strength training and low impact cardio , but the fit is still too loose to support high impact activities . The other thing I do n't like is that the material is very slippery , so it is hard to fasten the hooks . On a positive note , the colors are beautiful . I got the mojito , which is a nice bright green . A lot of sites only offer basic black or white , so you may need to shop around to find the pretty colors .
 I usually do n't take the time to write reviews , but I do n't want anyone else who is looking for a supportive sports bra to waste there money . This bra offers no support at all ! I bought this bra for my daily walks hoping it would offer me average support . All I can say is that It offers NO support at all . I can say that It is comfortable , that is if your looking for a bra to wear while sitting on the couch . However if you actually need support because your active , KEEP on looking this is NOT the bra you want . People who gave this bra positive reviews must have implants or have never had children .
 To start off , I returned the Moving Comfort Fiona Bra . The material is very thin -LRB- 2 layers thin -RRB- . Fiona has absolutely NO nipple coverage . There are no ` cups ' in this sports bra . Secondly , yes it does have adjustable straps , but they are velcro and fasten under the straps . I like to do a mix of excercises , but mostly cardio . I tried doing jumping jacks with this sports bra on . It offerd moderate support , the ladies did some bouncing . I did n't feel like there was enough lift or support for high impact activity . I am a 36-38C and ordered a 38C . It had an ok fit . Not too tight , but not too loose either . -LRB- That is with it fastened as tight as it would go . -RRB- If I were going to keep it , I think a 36C would fit better . Overall , it is fine if you do n't mind nipple show , a few bounces , and the velcro straps . If you want compression and minimal bounce , take a pass .
 I bought this based on past reviews but am disappointed . It is extremely difficult to get on and off . I read earlier reviews commenting on this but thought how hard could a bra be ? Well , it is difficult to fasten once on and even harder when you are sweaty . It also cuts into my arm pit on my left side . I have never spent this much money on a sports bra and regret doing so .
 If you 're a petite woman , I do not recommend this bra . To achieve any control of the bouncing at all , I had to pull the straps so tight , that the bra almost cuts into my armpits , because it 's sides are too wide .
 My Moving Comfort Cara works beautifully for yoga , running , and backpacking . When I tried to order another Cara , the seller sent a Fiona instead . I tried it out to be fair . Unfortunately , it felt like a grudge against my breasts
 I ca n't see how this bra is any better than much less expensive ones that pull on over your head , in fact , not as good . I stiil had the same old uni-boob problem and they 're still bouncy , only more in tandem . It did n't seem as secure as the pull-on types . I ordered a Glamorise Sports bra at the same time which is bulit more like a regular bra , only with enhanced structural details . It was much more secure , very minimal bouncing , and without uni-boob .
 I have read such positive reviews on this style of bra , that I had to give it a try . I have the Moving Comfort Maia , and absolutely love it . It is an under-wire style and does the job so much better . I am returning this bra , and plan to stick to under-wire styles from now on .
 I returned this . Even though I ordered the same size I ordinarily would for a sports bra , it was a very strange fit . The band was fine , but the cups were too big . I 've had trouble with this brand before & will not bother trying any of their other styles .

 Just purchased this bra and was very disappointed . I am a runner and DD cup . There was no support . The bra was also very stretchy , so it felt loose . I do not recommend this for any big-busted girl doing high-impact activities .
 It 's not like the picture at all . I expected firm cups and more contouring and shaping and it is not . It is just like a soft cup , wireless bra . I wanted something that supports my breasts so that I can move , like run , or jump rope , but it does not do that . I am returning it : - -LRB-
 After hearing all the great things about this bra , I bought it for running and was excited to give it a try . Boy was I greatly diappointed . This bra is flimsy and did not provide any support . I 'm only a 36B , I do n't know how anyone larger could like this bra . My old Champion bras give much better support . I returned this bra , the material was thin , provided no modesty coverage and had no support . I ca n't see how it 's rated to be a high support bra for running .
 I was a bit disappointed with this bra , as a 38D I did n't find it supportive enough for my sports needs . I found the Juno much better .
 This bra did n't offer enough support for larger cup sizes . I 'm a 36C , and I run and play soccer .

Hind made some excellent ones but Saucony has gone back to black and white.I rated this low because of 1 -RRB- insufficent fabric for good nipple coverage and comfort up front ; 2 -RRB- difficult to hook when compared to other bras with back hooks .
 I have another sports bra like this but this one is not very good - the way the straps are built rub against my inside shoulder . Also the back end adjustable strap is too clunky and also rubs . No way I could wear this for a long run - which is why I bought it as a marathoner .
 I 'm so confused . I thought this was a supportive sports bra for C 's and up ??? I needed another sports bra for my high cardio workouts , and contemplated buying this for the longest time -LRB- I have previously bought a moving comfort racerback bra that I love but is now no where to be found -RRB- and seeing that there was over 300 reviews figured it would be awesome ! Bought my regular bra size , which fits great and I love the non-racerback/velcro straps design , but here 's the thing . When you say a sports bra is supportive , I 'm thinking supportive under the bust and it keeps the ladies from BOUNCING . One of of two ai n't bad right ? It 's definitely supportive under the bust , but the bouncing ? I was simply trying it on and jumped up a down a couple times , and I could n't handle all the bouncing . Oh and it 's barely lined ! So beware ! Because if it 's cold in the room , others will definitely know . This is definitely going back .
 I wanted to love it . . all the glowing reviews gave me immense hope . Seriously , I do n't understand the attraction . Wish I had returned it , instead of giving it the chance it did n't deserve . : -LRB- It 's awful !! 1 . Offers very little support and zero bounce control .2 . Flimsy . No structure whatsoever .3 . A limp , shapeless piece of fabric .4 . Cups are strange and loose .5 . Bottom band shifts out of shape in the front , turning and twisting .6 . It 's very noticeable under tee shirts.I measured carefully , per instructions . The result was my usual bra size . That 's what I ordered and it 's so oversized ! The cups seem huge.Bummer .
 Tried this bra . I am a DD , and this was not nearly supportive enough while running . Also , the straps adjust at the front/shoulders , and that extra bit of fabric really rubbed on my skin , and a week later I still have actual scabs from it . I would highly recommend going with the Enell sports bra , it is so worth the extra money .
 Fits well , does not hold breast in place and the bottom seam rolls.Feels uncomfortable . You have to keep unrolling all day.Straps are nice .
 I bought it because Im large chested and the elastic band keeps twisting and curling . Not happy with the purchase : -LRB-
 If you 're a petite woman , I do not recommend this bra . To achieve any control of the bouncing at all , I had to pull the straps so tight , that the bra almost cuts into my armpits , because it 's sides are too wide .

I plan on returning it , but I 'm debating going down to a B or C cup size -LRB- it 's really that big -RRB- . Chest size fits perfect though . I do love that it functions like a regular bra with the back closure since I do the `` sports bra hop '' to get out of my other MC bras . I just ca n't give it a better rating because I ca n't wear it in the size I got .
 Bra fit well , but it did n't provide enough support . When I tried it on , there was as much bounce as if I were wearing a regular bra -- not a sports bra . I would not recommend this bra for high or even medium impact sports .
 I own two Maia 's by Moving Comfort so I tried this one out when I found it on sale . It does n't have underwire , I had total uniboob . The band at the bottom would n't stay put , it kept rolling up a bit . I bought a 38C , the same as I wear in the Maia , but the weird uniboob look is just too unflattering . I may try wearing a regular bra underneath , but I never do that with the Maia . I would n't wear it unless my other two are n't clean .
 I figured this HAD to be a great bra with all of the glowing reviews from other busty ladies , but it failed to deliver . Not comfortable , does not support well and just creates a big `` uniboob '' look like all other sports bras . Go with the Champion Powerback if you are looking for support , lift and separation in a sports bra and you have large breasts .
 this sports bra has okay support , however there is nothing to cover up how cold you are ... The adjustable sraps are weird , I guess you could get use to it , but the straps are secured with velcro which if I remember correctly from the 80 's does not last very long .
 There is nothing good about this bra . It does n't move , true . It flattens , true . Does it do that well?NO !!! To use a common metaphor , the headlights are still on and visible . If it worked for others , I 'm glad . Me ? No ! Wished I had returned it .
 I would not recommend this sports bra . After trying the Maia and Juno , I was very disappointed in this sports bra . The straps are kind of bulky and did n't line up very well . I did not find this sports bra to be very supportive and it seemed awkward to adjust .
 I read the reviews and ended up ordering this bra . I 'm a 40D - this thing was not comfortable at all . Sure it had support but I ended up returning it .
 Mia bra has so much more support . Did n't realize this one did not have underwire . Gives you a uni-boob . Thought I 'd try it to see if this was any cooler but it is n't . Would not recommend this for any high impact aerobics . Mia does not let you move an inch & keeps you from having uni-boob . Wish they would come up with a seamless version , though . But , this is better than a regular bra for sports & it does hook in the back . One thing to be careful , though , is the velcro strap adjustments . Get them precise or the velcro will rub your arm pit area .
 Two years ago I bought this bra for my grand daughter who plays volleyball and she loved it because it gave her good support and no bounce -LRB- 38DD -RRB- . The new lining is n't as good as it once was and therefore she wanted me to return it and look for a bra with more support . I am disappointed with the changes to a once great sports bra .
 Seemed well built , but not true to size order bigger than you are . cup size OK but around smaller than regular bras .
 This style/make of bra is not for a full figured woman . There was no support at all for a 44D/DD size . Needs more padding/support .
 No molded cups . . so this can not be a high impact support bra . . it 's ugly w / o cups . . color is as shown . .
 I read that this bra fit small but I did n't really expect it to be as small as it was . I wear a 34C on the loosest hook so I ordered a 34C and when I recieved it , I was disappointed to find that it did n't fit well at all . I could do it up but it was n't comfortable . Reading other reviews , I thought it would have more padding then it did . Even though my boobs were pancaked , due to the fact the bra was too small , the bra still showed headlights . The adjustable straps is a great feature but I do n't think I 'll be ordering this bra again in a different size .
 For me , this was way too tight . I 've never had a 40D bra be this tight . I 'm all for support but this was just constricting and uncomfortable and so I 'll send it back . I 'm really disappointed because if it were just a tad bigger in the band I would have kept it . I 'm not quite sure how this can be considered a size 40 .
 I loved this sports bra . However , the last time I washed it the clasp end of the back had completely melted ! The bra is now completely useless .
 I bought this bra after reading all the great reviews and have to say I am very disappointed . The bra is very well made and fits comfortably , although you have to take care to get the velcro on the straps lined up perfectly to prevent it digging into your shoulders . If I was just wearing it for walking it would be fine , but I wore it to a Zumba class and it was anything but okay . First of all , I was bouncing all over the place . The worst part though was that when I took it off after the class , I had never seen such a wet bra . So much for the wicking material . Even my old compression bras keep me drier . In short , not for high impact and not for women who sweat when they work out .
 Found out after I was sent an email that the product had been shipped that it was on backorder and was refunded my money . I should have never been able to order it if it was on backorder .
 I love this bra , it 's made extremely well and i was excited to find it in my small band but semi-large cup size . But I returned it , bcuz the only reason I chose this bra was because the description said it had molded cups . It does n't . I tried it on and had MAJOR `` poke thru '' and that 's just not cute . I 'd never leave the house like that so Unfortunately I returned it . had it had molded cups -LRB- like the description said it did -RRB- , I would hve kept it and it would hve been easily a 4 star , maybe 5 .
 If you are larger in the bust area and do high impact aerobics , this bra is not for you ! It does n't look good either . It does not create a separation between your bust . I thought I had finally found a good sports bra , and once I received it in the mail and tried it one , I was so disappointed .
 I wear a 34D bra , and ordered this in the same size . The bra was ok in the band measurement , but the cup size was a B , at most . It was ridiculously tiny and also weirdly centered . If your breasts grow out of your sternum , I suppose this will work . This was definitely not a size D or C bra . It was labeled 34D but in actuality must have been a B to be this tiny . Returning . Disappointed . All 3 bras I bought from this brand are going right back and I am never buying from them again . Stick to Nike , Under Armour , Adidas .
 It was small in & tight u would need almost 2 sizes bigger , I 'm a 38c but this was no way close ,
 i 'm actually not a 32B but am a 30B/C , and got this thinking , sports bras are usually too tight so why not try the next size up ? well , this was so tight i had to return it . i could barely breathe with it on , and it squashed my chest without supporting it . felt like one of those chest-binder things . the good
 Despite the Moving Comfort &#34; bra finder &#34; on their website giving this bra as an option for a 40DD doing high impact activities such as running , I found this bra to be almost completely lacking in support . By the end of my run , I was clutching my boobs in my hands to keep them from knocking me unconscious.Additionally , the lining is only stitched to the body of the bra at the edges , so after wear , the bottom band has rolled up so much that the lining is all but hiding the main fabric.It looks like Enell is going to be my next stop .
 not the same fit as others of the same brand , model purchased the same size . Factory defect ? You tell me . ran larger than normal
 I found immediately after putting it on that the adjustment velcro on each strap was very uncomfortable . They are located in the front of the bra , and felt like two big bulges pushing in underneath each side of my collarbone . I have heard great things about MovingComfort , so I do n't think it means their other bras are unpleasant . I just found out that this one would n't work for me .
 I bought this in my normal size 38D but it is too big . I will keep it anyway because I do n't want to hassle with an online return/exchange when I am not sure what my correct size should be in this bra . I have to wear this on the last set of hooks and put the straps up as high as they will go , then it is okay for strength training and low impact cardio , but the fit is still too loose to support high impact activities . The other thing I do n't like is that the material is very slippery , so it is hard to fasten the hooks . On a positive note , the colors are beautiful . I got the mojito , which is a nice bright green . A lot of sites only offer basic black or white , so you may need to shop around to find the pretty colors .
 I usually do n't take the time to write reviews , but I do n't want anyone else who is looking for a supportive sports bra to waste there money . This bra offers no support at all ! I bought this bra for my daily walks hoping it would offer me average support . All I can say is that It offers NO support at all . I can say that It is comfortable , that is if your looking for a bra to wear while sitting on the couch . However if you actually need support because your active , KEEP on looking this is NOT the bra you want . People who gave this bra positive reviews must have implants or have never had children .
 To start off , I returned the Moving Comfort Fiona Bra . The material is very thin -LRB- 2 layers thin -RRB- . Fiona has absolutely NO nipple coverage . There are no ` cups ' in this sports bra . Secondly , yes it does have adjustable straps , but they are velcro and fasten under the straps . I like to do a mix of excercises , but mostly cardio . I tried doing jumping jacks with this sports bra on . It offerd moderate support , the ladies did some bouncing . I did n't feel like there was enough lift or support for high impact activity . I am a 36-38C and ordered a 38C . It had an ok fit . Not too tight , but not too loose either . -LRB- That is with it fastened as tight as it would go . -RRB- If I were going to keep it , I think a 36C would fit better . Overall , it is fine if you do n't mind nipple show , a few bounces , and the velcro straps . If you want compression and minimal bounce , take a pass .
 I was fairly disappointed with this bra . The materials are good quality and construction is clean -LRB- no weak seams , loose threads -RRB- , but bounce control was n't optimal and some of its `` features '' actually hurt a bit . I usually use two fairly cheap compression sports bras and can achieve minimal movement with them . This bra felt like 1.5 of those bras and cost about 2x more . The straps are looped through a slit at the top edge of the front of the bra and are secured by Velcro . You adjust them by unlatching them , pulling them tighter , and reattaching to the Velcro strip . This system is far inferior to the normal sliding adjustment most bras have . The straps dig into my skin at the point of attachment , and by the end of a workout those two spots on my chest are really sore.Pros : Good materialsGood constructionCons : Straps hurtStrap adjustment system is badBounce control is just so-so given the price
 This was much bigger and heavier than expected ; virtually no different than the regular `` NON-Flat '' folding umbrellas . I was expecting the small , light ones that were in the stores.I 'm sure as an umbrella it 's fine .
 This sports bra offers minimal support . I bought it based on reviews and that it called itself a high motion control / high impact sports bra . I went jogging in it once and hated it .
 For starters , I am a 34DD in my mid twenties and to me this bra is only useful for yoga at home . I purchased this bra because of all the amazing reviews , which I now totally disagree with . I enjoy running , hiking , yoga , and gym activities.The disapointment started with the look of the bra , as a curvy woman I hope to at least look like one , but in this I felt like a B. I told myself to suck it up , because nobody cares at the gym . On the drive to the gym , I found myself wobbling in this bra , bad sign . The `` molded cups '' they claim to have are nothing more than a very thin layer of tightly shaped fabric , nothing like say , the Juno . Additionally , the only way to avoid a lot of movement is to tighten the straps to the point that your shoulders end up hurting by the end of cardio , before I can even get to strength training . I get that enough in my daily life.The two biggest failings were ones I encountered on a hike . The `` compression '' aspect of the bra does nothing more than mash you together . Beneath the thin fabric the girls are free to wobble about and between them there is no breathing room . To put it lightly , I was uncomfortably sweaty and still wishing for a real sports bra . While walking ! Then , when a cold wind blows , anybody around is free to see exactly how chilly you find it . Embarassing , to say the least.I honestly do n't understand how this is a high impact bra recommended to women my size . I gave the company a second chance and picked up a Juno on sale . After just one gym use I love it so much more in every way . I look good and I feel good . We 'll see how it holds up on a hike . Do not buy this online if you are curvy , try it in a store . Even on sale , now I 'm out that money because I was desperate for a sports bra .
 Although the design is good -LRB- adjustable straps and Three plush-backed hook-and-eye rows on band , as described in Product Features -RRB- , but the material used is something that gets malodorous just in 2-3 hours . I have other brands I can use several times before such a bad smell is felt ! So it 's not my body problem , but the quality.And there 's also no cup as described in product features ! Honestly , I spent this much for getting these cups . Actually this was the distinguishing feature I was craving , and it made me happy when I read here that it has cups . But when I received it , there was no cup!So I feel it has really been a waste of money .
 bra does n't have padding in the front so when it is cold everyone can see know what happens . otherwise it fits ok but does n't provide the support a sports bra should . It fits like a regular bra so it 's not a good buy for a sports bra
 Just purchased this bra and was very disappointed . I am a runner and DD cup . There was no support . The bra was also very stretchy , so it felt loose . I do not recommend this for any big-busted girl doing high-impact activities .
 It 's not like the picture at all . I expected firm cups and more contouring and shaping and it is not . It is just like a soft cup , wireless bra . I wanted something that supports my breasts so that I can move , like run , or jump rope , but it does not do that . I am returning it : - -LRB-
 This bra did n't offer enough support for larger cup sizes . I 'm a 36C , and I run and play soccer . I 've tried many different sports bras and this one did n't come close to supporting my chest while running . I felt the material was way to stretchy to prevent `` bounce '' and keep everything strapped down as a good sports bra should .
 I did n't like this bra as well as the other one I had bought at the same time -LRB- same company , different style -RRB- , it fit different and I did n't like the Velcro straps . I returned it .
 The moving comfort Fiona bra would have been met my needs had it had truly molded cups like Hind -LRB- Saucony motion -RRB- or Under Armour -- it lacks suppression cups and the thin fabric coverage caused nipple show through and rub so it really is not useable for running for me -- fine for yoga but not for other sports . It is supportive but the hooks in the back are difficult to do even when the bra hooks are done up front so this one went back . Instead I purchased the Under Armour Endure zip front in D cup -LRB- comes in S , M , L with D cup -RRB- , which though runs a little small , provides good support , easy removability -LRB- a plus after a good workout -RRB- . I loved it so much that I bought several of these . I wish bra manufacturers would add some color and ease of removability to the sports bra selection . I am sick of the black or white options . The colored sports bras usually are less supportive and pull off variety . Hind made some excellent ones but Saucony has gone back to black and white.I rated this low because of 1 -RRB- insufficent fabric for good nipple coverage and comfort up front ; 2 -RRB- difficult to hook when compared to other bras with back hooks .
 I was a bit disappointed with this bra , as a 38D I did n't find it supportive enough for my sports needs . I found the Juno much better .
 So I rarely review anything online , but I really just wanted to say few things about this bra.so someone else does n't get caught out.im a 38d with a 27 waist so im just big on top . . and I can not get over d reviews by people with bigger bust than me , dunno how they were supported by this bra.it is honestly for me anyway , was a glorified shelf tank top , absolutely no support total bounce and just very light.sports bras arent supposed to be VERY comfortable so I knew once I put it on that it was n't gona be much use for running.i log 35 + miles a wk , its prob good for yoga etc low impact sports.i would highly recommend the Juno great great bra for running or the enell 100 , this is only my experience but I have it now and ca n't return it so tis a bit of a waste.good luck gals .
 I have another sports bra like this but this one is not very good - the way the straps are built rub against my inside shoulder . Also the back end adjustable strap is too clunky and also rubs . No way I could wear this for a long run - which is why I bought it as a marathoner .
 I 've been looking for a new sports bra and when I researched this one , it sounded like just the ticket . I 'm a little over 50 and wear a 34DD . The bra is well made and comfortable , but there really is n't much support . It may be enough for a younger woman or someone with small breasts , but it did n't work for me at all . Darn it , I loved the green !
 Fits well , does not hold breast in place and the bottom seam rolls.Feels uncomfortable . You have to keep unrolling all day.Straps are nice .
 I wear a 34D bra , and ordered this in the same size . The bra was ok in the band measurement , but the cup size was a B , at most . It was ridiculously tiny and also weirdly centered . If your breasts grow out of your sternum , I suppose this will work . This was definitely not a size D or C bra . It was labeled 34D but in actuality must have been a B to be this tiny . Returning . Disappointed . All 3 bras I bought from this brand are going right back and I am never buying from them again . Stick to Nike , Under Armour , Adidas .
 I bought it because Im large chested and the elastic band keeps twisting and curling . Not happy with the purchase : -LRB-
 After hearing all the great things about this bra , I bought it for running and was excited to give it a try . Boy was I greatly diappointed . This bra is flimsy and did not provide any support . I 'm only a 36B , I do n't know how anyone larger could like this bra . My old Champion bras give much better support . I returned this bra , the material was thin , provided no modesty coverage and had no support . I ca n't see how it 's rated to be a high support bra for running .
 I 'm so confused . I thought this was a supportive sports bra for C 's and up ??? I needed another sports bra for my high cardio workouts , and contemplated buying this for the longest time -LRB- I have previously bought a moving comfort racerback bra that I love but is now no where to be found -RRB- and seeing that there was over 300 reviews figured it would be awesome ! Bought my regular bra size , which fits great and I love the non-racerback/velcro straps design , but here 's the thing . When you say a sports bra is supportive , I 'm thinking supportive under the bust and it keeps the ladies from BOUNCING . One of of two ai n't bad right ? It 's definitely supportive under the bust , but the bouncing ? I was simply trying it on and jumped up a down a couple times , and I could n't handle all the bouncing . Oh and it 's barely lined ! So beware ! Because if it 's cold in the room , others will definitely know . This is definitely going back .
 I wanted to love it . . all the glowing reviews gave me immense hope . Seriously , I do n't understand the attraction . Wish I had returned it , instead of giving it the chance it did n't deserve . : -LRB- It 's awful !! 1 . Offers very little support and zero bounce control .2 . Flimsy . No structure whatsoever .3 . A limp , shapeless piece of fabric .4 . Cups are strange and loose .5 . Bottom band shifts out of shape in the front , turning and twisting .6 . It 's very noticeable under tee shirts.I measured carefully , per instructions . The result was my usual bra size . That 's what I ordered and it 's so oversized ! The cups seem huge.Bummer .
 Tried this bra . I am a DD , and this was not nearly supportive enough while running . Also , the straps adjust at the front/shoulders , and that extra bit of fabric really rubbed on my skin , and a week later I still have actual scabs from it . I would highly recommend going with the Enell sports bra , it is so worth the extra money .
 To start off , I returned the Moving Comfort Fiona Bra . The material is very thin -LRB- 2 layers thin -RRB- . Fiona has absolutely NO nipple coverage . There are no ` cups ' in this sports bra . Secondly , yes it does have adjustable straps , but they are velcro and fasten under the straps . I like to do a mix of excercises , but mostly cardio . I tried doing jumping jacks with this sports bra on . It offerd moderate support , the ladies did some bouncing . I did n't feel like there was enough lift or support for high impact activity .

Not too tight , but not too loose either . -LRB- That is with it fastened as tight as it would go . -RRB- If I were going to keep it , I think a 36C would fit better . Overall , it is fine if you do n't mind nipple show , a few bounces , and the velcro straps . If you want compression and minimal bounce , take a pass .
 I found immediately after putting it on that the adjustment velcro on each strap was very uncomfortable . They are located in the front of the bra , and felt like two big bulges pushing in underneath each side of my collarbone . I have heard great things about MovingComfort , so I do n't think it means their other bras are unpleasant . I just found out that this one would n't work for me .

However if you actually need support because your active , KEEP on looking this is NOT the bra you want . People who gave this bra positive reviews must have implants or have never had children .
 At first I really liked the bra , it definitely holds my DDs in place , but it puts SO much pain and pressure on my shoulders . I only wear it in moments of desperation now : -LRB-
 I figured this HAD to be a great bra with all of the glowing reviews from other busty ladies , but it failed to deliver . Not comfortable , does not support well and just creates a big `` uniboob '' look like all other sports bras . Go with the Champion Powerback if you are looking for support , lift and separation in a sports bra and you have large breasts .
 Bra fit well , but it did n't provide enough support . When I tried it on , there was as much bounce as if I were wearing a regular bra -- not a sports bra . I would not recommend this bra for high or even medium impact sports .
 I own two Maia 's by Moving Comfort so I tried this one out when I found it on sale . It does n't have underwire , I had total uniboob . The band at the bottom would n't stay put , it kept rolling up a bit . I bought a 38C , the same as I wear in the Maia , but the weird uniboob look is just too unflattering . I may try wearing a regular bra underneath , but I never do that with the Maia . I would n't wear it unless my other two are n't clean .
 I bought this based on past reviews but am disappointed . It is extremely difficult to get on and off . I read earlier reviews commenting on this but thought how hard could a bra be ? Well , it is difficult to fasten once on and even harder when you are sweaty . It also cuts into my arm pit on my left side . I have never spent this much money on a sports bra and regret doing so .
 If you 're a petite woman , I do not recommend this bra . To achieve any control of the bouncing at all , I had to pull the straps so tight , that the bra almost cuts into my armpits , because it 's sides are too wide .
 My Moving Comfort Cara works beautifully for yoga , running , and backpacking . When I tried to order another Cara , the seller sent a Fiona instead . I tried it out to be fair . Unfortunately , it felt like a grudge against my breasts
 I ca n't see how this bra is any better than much less expensive ones that pull on over your head , in fact , not as good . I stiil had the same old uni-boob problem and they 're still bouncy , only more in tandem . It did n't seem as secure as the pull-on types . I ordered a Glamorise Sports bra at the same time which is bulit more like a regular bra , only with enhanced structural details . It was much more secure , very minimal bouncing , and without uni-boob .
 I have read such positive reviews on this style of bra , that I had to give it a try . I have the Moving Comfort Maia , and absolutely love it . It is an under-wire style and does the job so much better . I am returning this bra , and plan to stick to under-wire styles from now on .
 I returned this . Even though I ordered the same size I ordinarily would for a sports bra , it was a very strange fit . The band was fine , but the cups were too big . I 've had trouble with this brand before & will not bother trying any of their other styles .
 No molded cups . . so this can not be a high impact support bra . . it 's ugly w / o cups . . color is as shown . .
 I read that this bra fit small but I did n't really expect it to be as small as it was . I wear a 34C on the loosest hook so I ordered a 34C and when I recieved it , I was disappointed to find that it did n't fit well at all . I could do it up but it was n't comfortable . Reading other reviews , I thought it would have more padding then it did . Even though my boobs were pancaked , due to the fact the bra was too small , the bra still showed headlights . The adjustable straps is a great feature but I do n't think I 'll be ordering this bra again in a different size .
 For me , this was way too tight . I 've never had a 40D bra be this tight . I 'm all for support but this was just constricting and uncomfortable and so I 'll send it back . I 'm really disappointed because if it were just a tad bigger in the band I would have kept it . I 'm not quite sure how this can be considered a size 40 .
 Seemed well built , but not true to size order bigger than you are . cup size OK but around smaller than regular bras .
 This style/make of bra is not for a full figured woman . There was no support at all for a 44D/DD size . Needs more padding/support .
 I loved this sports bra . However , the last time I washed it the clasp end of the back had completely melted ! The bra is now completely useless .
 I bought this bra after reading all the great reviews and have to say I am very disappointed . The bra is very well made and fits comfortably , although you have to take care to get the velcro on the straps lined up perfectly to prevent it digging into your shoulders . If I was just wearing it for walking it would be fine , but I wore it to a Zumba class and it was anything but okay . First of all , I was bouncing all over the place . The worst part though was that when I took it off after the class , I had never seen such a wet bra . So much for the wicking material . Even my old compression bras keep me drier . In short , not for high impact and not for women who sweat when they work out .
 There is nothing good about this bra . It does n't move , true . It flattens , true . Does it do that well?NO !!! To use a common metaphor , the headlights are still on and visible . If it worked for others , I 'm glad . Me ? No ! Wished I had returned it .
 I would not recommend this sports bra . After trying the Maia and Juno , I was very disappointed in this sports bra . The straps are kind of bulky and did n't line up very well . I did not find this sports bra to be very supportive and it seemed awkward to adjust .
 I read the reviews and ended up ordering this bra . I 'm a 40D - this thing was not comfortable at all . Sure it had support but I ended up returning it .
 Mia bra has so much more support . Did n't realize this one did not have underwire . Gives you a uni-boob . Thought I 'd try it to see if this was any cooler but it is n't . Would not recommend this for any high impact aerobics . Mia does not let you move an inch & keeps you from having uni-boob . Wish they would come up with a seamless version , though . But , this is better than a regular bra for sports & it does hook in the back . One thing to be careful , though , is the velcro strap adjustments . Get them precise or the velcro will rub your arm pit area .
 Two years ago I bought this bra for my grand daughter who plays volleyball and she loved it because it gave her good support and no bounce -LRB- 38DD -RRB- . The new lining is n't as good as it once was and therefore she wanted me to return it and look for a bra with more support . I am disappointed with the changes to a once great sports bra .
 It was small in & tight u would need almost 2 sizes bigger , I 'm a 38c but this was no way close ,
 Found out after I was sent an email that the product had been shipped that it was on backorder and was refunded my money . I should have never been able to order it if it was on backorder .
 I love this bra , it 's made extremely well and i was excited to find it in my small band but semi-large cup size . But I returned it , bcuz the only reason I chose this bra was because the description said it had molded cups . It does n't . I tried it on and had MAJOR `` poke thru '' and that 's just not cute . I 'd never leave the house like that so Unfortunately I returned it . had it had molded cups -LRB- like the description said it did -RRB- , I would hve kept it and it would hve been easily a 4 star , maybe 5 .
 If you are larger in the bust area and do high impact aerobics , this bra is not for you ! It does n't look good either . It does not create a separation between your bust . I thought I had finally found a good sports bra , and once I received it in the mail and tried it one , I was so disappointed .
 this sports bra has okay support , however there is nothing to cover up how cold you are ... The adjustable sraps are weird , I guess you could get use to it , but the straps are secured with velcro which if I remember correctly from the 80 's does not last very long .
 I was fairly disappointed with this bra . The materials are good quality and construction is clean -LRB- no weak seams , loose threads -RRB- , but bounce control was n't optimal and some of its `` features '' actually hurt a bit . I usually use two fairly cheap compression sports bras and can achieve minimal movement with them . This bra felt like 1.5 of those bras and cost about 2x more . The straps are looped through a slit at the top edge of the front of the bra and are secured by Velcro . You adjust them by unlatching them , pulling them tighter , and reattaching to the Velcro strip . This system is far inferior to the normal sliding adjustment most bras have . The straps dig into my skin at the point of attachment , and by the end of a workout those two spots on my chest are really sore.Pros : Good materialsGood constructionCons : Straps hurtStrap adjustment system is badBounce control is just so-so given the price
 Bought this sports bra in a 32D based on reviews that said it is `` true to VS sizes '' , but I did not find this to be true . My VS size is 32D , but the cup size on this bra is huge . I plan on returning it , but I 'm debating going down to a B or C cup size -LRB- it 's really that big -RRB- . Chest size fits perfect though . I do love that it functions like a regular bra with the back closure since I do the `` sports bra hop '' to get out of my other MC bras . I just ca n't give it a better rating because I ca n't wear it in the size I got .
 not the same fit as others of the same brand , model purchased the same size . Factory defect ? You tell me . ran larger than normal
 i 'm actually not a 32B but am a 30B/C , and got this thinking , sports bras are usually too tight so why not try the next size up ? well , this was so tight i had to return it . i could barely breathe with it on , and it squashed my chest without supporting it . felt like one of those chest-binder things . the good
 Despite the Moving Comfort &#34; bra finder &#34; on their website giving this bra as an option for a 40DD doing high impact activities such as running , I found this bra to be almost completely lacking in support . By the end of my run , I was clutching my boobs in my hands to keep them from knocking me unconscious.Additionally , the lining is only stitched to the body of the bra at the edges , so after wear , the bottom band has rolled up so much that the lining is all but hiding the main fabric.It looks like Enell is going to be my next stop .
 The moving comfort Fiona bra would have been met my needs had it had truly molded cups like Hind -LRB- Saucony motion -RRB- or Under Armour -- it lacks suppression cups and the thin fabric coverage caused nipple show through and rub so it really is not useable for running for me -- fine for yoga but not for other sports . It is supportive but the hooks in the back are difficult to do even when the bra hooks are done up front so this one went back . Instead I purchased the Under Armour Endure zip front in D cup -LRB- comes in S , M , L with D cup -RRB- , which though runs a little small , provides good support , easy removability -LRB- a plus after a good workout -RRB- . I loved it so much that I bought several of these . I wish bra manufacturers would add some color and ease of removability to the sports bra selection . I am sick of the black or white options . The colored sports bras usually are less supportive and pull off variety . Hind made some excellent ones but Saucony has gone back to black and white.I rated this low because of 1 -RRB- insufficent fabric for good nipple coverage and comfort up front ; 2 -RRB- difficult to hook when compared to other bras with back hooks .
 It was small in & tight u would need almost 2 sizes bigger , I 'm a 38c but this was no way close ,
 Found out after I was sent an email that the product had been shipped that it was on backorder and was refunded my money . I should have never been able to order it if it was on backorder .
 I love this bra , it 's made extremely well and i was excited to find it in my small band but semi-large cup size . But I returned it , bcuz the only reason I chose this bra was because the description said it had molded cups . It does n't . I tried it on and had MAJOR `` poke thru '' and that 's just not cute . I 'd never leave the house like that so Unfortunately I returned it . had it had molded cups -LRB- like the description said it did -RRB- , I would hve kept it and it would hve been easily a 4 star , maybe 5 .
 If you are larger in the bust area and do high impact aerobics , this bra is not for you ! It does n't look good either . It does not create a separation between your bust . I thought I had finally found a good sports bra , and once I received it in the mail and tried it one , I was so disappointed .
 this sports bra has okay support , however there is nothing to cover up how cold you are ... The adjustable sraps are weird , I guess you could get use to it , but the straps are secured with velcro which if I remember correctly from the 80 's does not last very long .

 At first I really liked the bra , it definitely holds my DDs in place , but it puts SO much pain and pressure on my shoulders . I only wear it in moments of desperation now : -LRB-
 Bra fit well , but it did n't provide enough support . When I tried it on , there was as much bounce as if I were wearing a regular bra -- not a sports bra . I would not recommend this bra for high or even medium impact sports .
 I own two Maia 's by Moving Comfort so I tried this one out when I found it on sale . It does n't have underwire , I had total uniboob . The band at the bottom would n't stay put , it kept rolling up a bit . I bought a 38C , the same as I wear in the Maia , but the weird uniboob look is just too unflattering . I may try wearing a regular bra underneath , but I never do that with the Maia . I would n't wear it unless my other two are n't clean .
 I figured this HAD to be a great bra with all of the glowing reviews from other busty ladies , but it failed to deliver . Not comfortable , does not support well and just creates a big `` uniboob '' look like all other sports bras . Go with the Champion Powerback if you are looking for support , lift and separation in a sports bra and you have large breasts .
 If you 're a petite woman , I do not recommend this bra . To achieve any control of the bouncing at all , I had to pull the straps so tight , that the bra almost cuts into my armpits , because it 's sides are too wide .
 My Moving Comfort Cara works beautifully for yoga , running , and backpacking . When I tried to order another Cara , the seller sent a Fiona instead . I tried it out to be fair . Unfortunately , it felt like a grudge against my breasts
 I ca n't see how this bra is any better than much less expensive ones that pull on over your head , in fact , not as good . I stiil had the same old uni-boob problem and they 're still bouncy , only more in tandem . It did n't seem as secure as the pull-on types . I ordered a Glamorise Sports bra at the same time which is bulit more like a regular bra , only with enhanced structural details . It was much more secure , very minimal bouncing , and without uni-boob .
 I have read such positive reviews on this style of bra , that I had to give it a try . I have the Moving Comfort Maia , and absolutely love it . It is an under-wire style and does the job so much better . I am returning this bra , and plan to stick to under-wire styles from now on .
 I returned this . Even though I ordered the same size I ordinarily would for a sports bra , it was a very strange fit . The band was fine , but the cups were too big . I 've had trouble with this brand before & will not bother trying any of their other styles .
 I bought this based on past reviews but am disappointed . It is extremely difficult to get on and off . I read earlier reviews commenting on this but thought how hard could a bra be ? Well , it is difficult to fasten once on and even harder when you are sweaty . It also cuts into my arm pit on my left side . I have never spent this much money on a sports bra and regret doing so .
 Seemed well built , but not true to size order bigger than you are . cup size OK but around smaller than regular bras .
 This style/make of bra is not for a full figured woman . There was no support at all for a 44D/DD size . Needs more padding/support .
 I 've been looking for a new sports bra and when I researched this one , it sounded like just the ticket . I 'm a little over 50 and wear a 34DD . The bra is well made and comfortable , but there really is n't much support . It may be enough for a younger woman or someone with small breasts , but it did n't work for me at all . Darn it , I loved the green !
 No molded cups . . so this can not be a high impact support bra . . it 's ugly w / o cups . . color is as shown . .
 I read that this bra fit small but I did n't really expect it to be as small as it was . I wear a 34C on the loosest hook so I ordered a 34C and when I recieved it , I was disappointed to find that it did n't fit well at all . I could do it up but it was n't comfortable . Reading other reviews , I thought it would have more padding then it did . Even though my boobs were pancaked , due to the fact the bra was too small , the bra still showed headlights . The adjustable straps is a great feature but I do n't think I 'll be ordering this bra again in a different size .
 For me , this was way too tight . I 've never had a 40D bra be this tight . I 'm all for support but this was just constricting and uncomfortable and so I 'll send it back . I 'm really disappointed because if it were just a tad bigger in the band I would have kept it . I 'm not quite sure how this can be considered a size 40 .
 I loved this sports bra . However , the last time I washed it the clasp end of the back had completely melted ! The bra is now completely useless .
 I bought this bra after reading all the great reviews and have to say I am very disappointed . The bra is very well made and fits comfortably , although you have to take care to get the velcro on the straps lined up perfectly to prevent it digging into your shoulders . If I was just wearing it for walking it would be fine , but I wore it to a Zumba class and it was anything but okay . First of all , I was bouncing all over the place . The worst part though was that when I took it off after the class , I had never seen such a wet bra . So much for the wicking material . Even my old compression bras keep me drier . In short , not for high impact and not for women who sweat when they work out .
 There is nothing good about this bra . It does n't move , true . It flattens , true . Does it do that well?NO !!! To use a common metaphor , the headlights are still on and visible . If it worked for others , I 'm glad . Me ? No ! Wished I had returned it .
 I would not recommend this sports bra . After trying the Maia and Juno , I was very disappointed in this sports bra . The straps are kind of bulky and did n't line up very well . I did not find this sports bra to be very supportive and it seemed awkward to adjust .
 I read the reviews and ended up ordering this bra . I 'm a 40D - this thing was not comfortable at all . Sure it had support but I ended up returning it .
 Mia bra has so much more support . Did n't realize this one did not have underwire . Gives you a uni-boob . Thought I 'd try it to see if this was any cooler but it is n't . Would not recommend this for any high impact aerobics . Mia does not let you move an inch & keeps you from having uni-boob . Wish they would come up with a seamless version , though . But , this is better than a regular bra for sports & it does hook in the back . One thing to be careful , though , is the velcro strap adjustments . Get them precise or the velcro will rub your arm pit area .
 Two years ago I bought this bra for my grand daughter who plays volleyball and she loved it because it gave her good support and no bounce -LRB- 38DD -RRB- . The new lining is n't as good as it once was and therefore she wanted me to return it and look for a bra with more support . I am disappointed with the changes to a once great sports bra .
 I have another sports bra like this but this one is not very good - the way the straps are built rub against my inside shoulder . Also the back end adjustable strap is too clunky and also rubs . No way I could wear this for a long run - which is why I bought it as a marathoner .
 Fits well , does not hold breast in place and the bottom seam rolls.Feels uncomfortable . You have to keep unrolling all day.Straps are nice .
 I wear a 34D bra , and ordered this in the same size . The bra was ok in the band measurement , but the cup size was a B , at most . It was ridiculously tiny and also weirdly centered . If your breasts grow out of your sternum , I suppose this will work . This was definitely not a size D or C bra . It was labeled 34D but in actuality must have been a B to be this tiny . Returning . Disappointed . All 3 bras I bought from this brand are going right back and I am never buying from them again . Stick to Nike , Under Armour , Adidas .
 To start off , I returned the Moving Comfort Fiona Bra . The material is very thin -LRB- 2 layers thin -RRB- . Fiona has absolutely NO nipple coverage . There are no ` cups ' in this sports bra . Secondly , yes it does have adjustable straps , but they are velcro and fasten under the straps . I like to do a mix of excercises , but mostly cardio . I tried doing jumping jacks with this sports bra on . It offerd moderate support , the ladies did some bouncing . I did n't feel like there was enough lift or support for high impact activity . I am a 36-38C and ordered a 38C . It had an ok fit . Not too tight , but not too loose either . -LRB- That is with it fastened as tight as it would go . -RRB- If I were going to keep it , I think a 36C would fit better . Overall , it is fine if you do n't mind nipple show , a few bounces , and the velcro straps . If you want compression and minimal bounce , take a pass .
 I found immediately after putting it on that the adjustment velcro on each strap was very uncomfortable . They are located in the front of the bra , and felt like two big bulges pushing in underneath each side of my collarbone . I have heard great things about MovingComfort , so I do n't think it means their other bras are unpleasant . I just found out that this one would n't work for me .
 I bought this in my normal size 38D but it is too big . I will keep it anyway because I do n't want to hassle with an online return/exchange when I am not sure what my correct size should be in this bra . I have to wear this on the last set of hooks and put the straps up as high as they will go , then it is okay for strength training and low impact cardio , but the fit is still too loose to support high impact activities . The other thing I do n't like is that the material is very slippery , so it is hard to fasten the hooks . On a positive note , the colors are beautiful . I got the mojito , which is a nice bright green . A lot of sites only offer basic black or white , so you may need to shop around to find the pretty colors .
 I usually do n't take the time to write reviews , but I do n't want anyone else who is looking for a supportive sports bra to waste there money . This bra offers no support at all ! I bought this bra for my daily walks hoping it would offer me average support . All I can say is that It offers NO support at all . I can say that It is comfortable , that is if your looking for a bra to wear while sitting on the couch . However if you actually need support because your active , KEEP on looking this is NOT the bra you want . People who gave this bra positive reviews must have implants or have never had children .
 I bought it because Im large chested and the elastic band keeps twisting and curling . Not happy with the purchase : -LRB-
 After hearing all the great things about this bra , I bought it for running and was excited to give it a try . Boy was I greatly diappointed . This bra is flimsy and did not provide any support . I 'm only a 36B , I do n't know how anyone larger could like this bra . My old Champion bras give much better support . I returned this bra , the material was thin , provided no modesty coverage and had no support . I ca n't see how it 's rated to be a high support bra for running .
 I 'm so confused . I thought this was a supportive sports bra for C 's and up ??? I needed another sports bra for my high cardio workouts , and contemplated buying this for the longest time -LRB- I have previously bought a moving comfort racerback bra that I love but is now no where to be found -RRB- and seeing that there was over 300 reviews figured it would be awesome ! Bought my regular bra size , which fits great and I love the non-racerback/velcro straps design , but here 's the thing . When you say a sports bra is supportive , I 'm thinking supportive under the bust and it keeps the ladies from BOUNCING . One of of two ai n't bad right ? It 's definitely supportive under the bust , but the bouncing ? I was simply trying it on and jumped up a down a couple times , and I could n't handle all the bouncing . Oh and it 's barely lined ! So beware ! Because if it 's cold in the room , others will definitely know . This is definitely going back .
 I wanted to love it . . all the glowing reviews gave me immense hope . Seriously , I do n't understand the attraction . Wish I had returned it , instead of giving it the chance it did n't deserve . : -LRB- It 's awful !! 1 . Offers very little support and zero bounce control .2 . Flimsy . No structure whatsoever .3 . A limp , shapeless piece of fabric .4 . Cups are strange and loose .5 . Bottom band shifts out of shape in the front , turning and twisting .6 . It 's very noticeable under tee shirts.I measured carefully , per instructions . The result was my usual bra size . That 's what I ordered and it 's so oversized ! The cups seem huge.Bummer .
 Tried this bra . I am a DD , and this was not nearly supportive enough while running . Also , the straps adjust at the front/shoulders , and that extra bit of fabric really rubbed on my skin , and a week later I still have actual scabs from it . I would highly recommend going with the Enell sports bra , it is so worth the extra money .
 This sports bra offers minimal support . I bought it based on reviews and that it called itself a high motion control / high impact sports bra . I went jogging in it once and hated it .
 For starters , I am a 34DD in my mid twenties and to me this bra is only useful for yoga at home . I purchased this bra because of all the amazing reviews , which I now totally disagree with . I enjoy running , hiking , yoga , and gym activities.The disapointment started with the look of the bra , as a curvy woman I hope to at least look like one , but in this I felt like a B. I told myself to suck it up , because nobody cares at the gym . On the drive to the gym , I found myself wobbling in this bra , bad sign . The `` molded cups '' they claim to have are nothing more than a very thin layer of tightly shaped fabric , nothing like say , the Juno . Additionally , the only way to avoid a lot of movement is to tighten the straps to the point that your shoulders end up hurting by the end of cardio , before I can even get to strength training . I get that enough in my daily life.The two biggest failings were ones I encountered on a hike . The `` compression '' aspect of the bra does nothing more than mash you together . Beneath the thin fabric the girls are free to wobble about and between them there is no breathing room . To put it lightly , I was uncomfortably sweaty and still wishing for a real sports bra . While walking ! Then , when a cold wind blows , anybody around is free to see exactly how chilly you find it . Embarassing , to say the least.I honestly do n't understand how this is a high impact bra recommended to women my size . I gave the company a second chance and picked up a Juno on sale . After just one gym use I love it so much more in every way . I look good and I feel good . We 'll see how it holds up on a hike . Do not buy this online if you are curvy , try it in a store . Even on sale , now I 'm out that money because I was desperate for a sports bra .
 Although the design is good -LRB- adjustable straps and Three plush-backed hook-and-eye rows on band , as described in Product Features -RRB- , but the material used is something that gets malodorous just in 2-3 hours . I have other brands I can use several times before such a bad smell is felt ! So it 's not my body problem , but the quality.And there 's also no cup as described in product features ! Honestly , I spent this much for getting these cups . Actually this was the distinguishing feature I was craving , and it made me happy when I read here that it has cups . But when I received it , there was no cup!So I feel it has really been a waste of money .
 bra does n't have padding in the front so when it is cold everyone can see know what happens . otherwise it fits ok but does n't provide the support a sports bra should . It fits like a regular bra so it 's not a good buy for a sports bra
 Just purchased this bra and was very disappointed . I am a runner and DD cup . There was no support . The bra was also very stretchy , so it felt loose . I do not recommend this for any big-busted girl doing high-impact activities .
 It 's not like the picture at all . I expected firm cups and more contouring and shaping and it is not . It is just like a soft cup , wireless bra . I wanted something that supports my breasts so that I can move , like run , or jump rope , but it does not do that . I am returning it : - -LRB-
 I was a bit disappointed with this bra , as a 38D I did n't find it supportive enough for my sports needs . I found the Juno much better .
 This bra did n't offer enough support for larger cup sizes . I 'm a 36C , and I run and play soccer . I 've tried many different sports bras and this one did n't come close to supporting my chest while running . I felt the material was way to stretchy to prevent `` bounce '' and keep everything strapped down as a good sports bra should .
 I did n't like this bra as well as the other one I had bought at the same time -LRB- same company , different style -RRB- , it fit different and I did n't like the Velcro straps . I returned it .
 So I rarely review anything online , but I really just wanted to say few things about this bra.so someone else does n't get caught out.im a 38d with a 27 waist so im just big on top . . and I can not get over d reviews by people with bigger bust than me , dunno how they were supported by this bra.it is honestly for me anyway , was a glorified shelf tank top , absolutely no support total bounce and just very light.sports bras arent supposed to be VERY comfortable so I knew once I put it on that it was n't gona be much use for running.i log 35 + miles a wk , its prob good for yoga etc low impact sports.i would highly recommend the Juno great great bra for running or the enell 100 , this is only my experience but I have it now and ca n't return it so tis a bit of a waste.good luck gals .

 Just purchased this bra and was very disappointed . I am a runner and DD cup . There was no support . The bra was also very stretchy , so it felt loose . I do not recommend this for any big-busted girl doing high-impact activities .
 This bra did n't offer enough support for larger cup sizes . I 'm a 36C , and I run and play soccer . I 've tried many different sports bras and this one did n't come close to supporting my chest while running . I felt the material was way to stretchy to prevent `` bounce '' and keep everything strapped down as a good sports bra should .
 I did n't like this bra as well as the other one I had bought at the same time -LRB- same company , different style -RRB- , it fit different and I did n't like the Velcro straps . I returned it .
 I was a bit disappointed with this bra , as a 38D I did n't find it supportive enough for my sports needs . I found the Juno much better .
 I 've been looking for a new sports bra and when I researched this one , it sounded like just the ticket . I 'm a little over 50 and wear a 34DD . The bra is well made and comfortable , but there really is n't much support . It may be enough for a younger woman or someone with small breasts , but it did n't work for me at all . Darn it , I loved the green !
 So I rarely review anything online , but I really just wanted to say few things about this bra.so someone else does n't get caught out.im a 38d with a 27 waist so im just big on top . . and I can not get over d reviews by people with bigger bust than me , dunno how they were supported by this bra.it is honestly for me anyway , was a glorified shelf tank top , absolutely no support total bounce and just very light.sports bras arent supposed to be VERY comfortable so I knew once I put it on that it was n't gona be much use for running.i log 35 + miles a wk , its prob good for yoga etc low impact sports.i would highly recommend the Juno great great bra for running or the enell 100 , this is only my experience but I have it now and ca n't return it so tis a bit of a waste.good luck gals .
 It was small in & tight u would need almost 2 sizes bigger , I 'm a 38c but this was no way close ,
 I wear a 34D bra , and ordered this in the same size . The bra was ok in the band measurement , but the cup size was a B , at most . It was ridiculously tiny and also weirdly centered . If your breasts grow out of your sternum , I suppose this will work . This was definitely not a size D or C bra . It was labeled 34D but in actuality must have been a B to be this tiny . Returning . Disappointed . All 3 bras I bought from this brand are going right back and I am never buying from them again . Stick to Nike , Under Armour , Adidas .
 I love this bra , it 's made extremely well and i was excited to find it in my small band but semi-large cup size . But I returned it , bcuz the only reason I chose this bra was because the description said it had molded cups . It does n't . I tried it on and had MAJOR `` poke thru '' and that 's just not cute . I 'd never leave the house like that so Unfortunately I returned it . had it had molded cups -LRB- like the description said it did -RRB- , I would hve kept it and it would hve been easily a 4 star , maybe 5 .
 If you are larger in the bust area and do high impact aerobics , this bra is not for you ! It does n't look good either . It does not create a separation between your bust . I thought I had finally found a good sports bra , and once I received it in the mail and tried it one , I was so disappointed .
 Found out after I was sent an email that the product had been shipped that it was on backorder and was refunded my money . I should have never been able to order it if it was on backorder .
 I was fairly disappointed with this bra . The materials are good quality and construction is clean -LRB- no weak seams , loose threads -RRB- , but bounce control was n't optimal and some of its `` features '' actually hurt a bit . I usually use two fairly cheap compression sports bras and can achieve minimal movement with them . This bra felt like 1.5 of those bras and cost about 2x more . The straps are looped through a slit at the top edge of the front of the bra and are secured by Velcro . You adjust them by unlatching them , pulling them tighter , and reattaching to the Velcro strip . This system is far inferior to the normal sliding adjustment most bras have . The straps dig into my skin at the point of attachment , and by the end of a workout those two spots on my chest are really sore.Pros : Good materialsGood constructionCons : Straps hurtStrap adjustment system is badBounce control is just so-so given the price
 not the same fit as others of the same brand , model purchased the same size . Factory defect ? You tell me . ran larger than normal
 i 'm actually not a 32B but am a 30B/C , and got this thinking , sports bras are usually too tight so why not try the next size up ? well , this was so tight i had to return it . i could barely breathe with it on , and it squashed my chest without supporting it . felt like one of those chest-binder things . the good
 Despite the Moving Comfort &#34; bra finder &#34; on their website giving this bra as an option for a 40DD doing high impact activities such as running , I found this bra to be almost completely lacking in support . By the end of my run , I was clutching my boobs in my hands to keep them from knocking me unconscious.Additionally , the lining is only stitched to the body of the bra at the edges , so after wear , the bottom band has rolled up so much that the lining is all but hiding the main fabric.It looks like Enell is going to be my next stop .
 To start off , I returned the Moving Comfort Fiona Bra . The material is very thin -LRB- 2 layers thin -RRB- . Fiona has absolutely NO nipple coverage . There are no ` cups ' in this sports bra . Secondly , yes it does have adjustable straps , but they are velcro and fasten under the straps . I like to do a mix of excercises , but mostly cardio . I tried doing jumping jacks with this sports bra on . It offerd moderate support , the ladies did some bouncing . I did n't feel like there was enough lift or support for high impact activity . I am a 36-38C and ordered a 38C . It had an ok fit . Not too tight , but not too loose either . -LRB- That is with it fastened as tight as it would go . -RRB- If I were going to keep it , I think a 36C would fit better . Overall , it is fine if you do n't mind nipple show , a few bounces , and the velcro straps . If you want compression and minimal bounce , take a pass .
 I found immediately after putting it on that the adjustment velcro on each strap was very uncomfortable . They are located in the front of the bra , and felt like two big bulges pushing in underneath each side of my collarbone . I have heard great things about MovingComfort , so I do n't think it means their other bras are unpleasant . I just found out that this one would n't work for me .
 I bought this in my normal size 38D but it is too big . I will keep it anyway because I do n't want to hassle with an online return/exchange when I am not sure what my correct size should be in this bra . I have to wear this on the last set of hooks and put the straps up as high as they will go , then it is okay for strength training and low impact cardio , but the fit is still too loose to support high impact activities . The other thing I do n't like is that the material is very slippery , so it is hard to fasten the hooks . On a positive note , the colors are beautiful . I got the mojito , which is a nice bright green . A lot of sites only offer basic black or white , so you may need to shop around to find the pretty colors .
 I usually do n't take the time to write reviews , but I do n't want anyone else who is looking for a supportive sports bra to waste there money . This bra offers no support at all ! I bought this bra for my daily walks hoping it would offer me average support . All I can say is that It offers NO support at all . I can say that It is comfortable , that is if your looking for a bra to wear while sitting on the couch . However if you actually need support because your active , KEEP on looking this is NOT the bra you want . People who gave this bra positive reviews must have implants or have never had children .
 At first I really liked the bra , it definitely holds my DDs in place , but it puts SO much pain and pressure on my shoulders . I only wear it in moments of desperation now : -LRB-
 I figured this HAD to be a great bra with all of the glowing reviews from other busty ladies , but it failed to deliver . Not comfortable , does not support well and just creates a big `` uniboob '' look like all other sports bras . Go with the Champion Powerback if you are looking for support , lift and separation in a sports bra and you have large breasts .
 Bought this sports bra in a 32D based on reviews that said it is `` true to VS sizes '' , but I did not find this to be true . My VS size is 32D , but the cup size on this bra is huge . I plan on returning it , but I 'm debating going down to a B or C cup size -LRB- it 's really that big -RRB- . Chest size fits perfect though . I do love that it functions like a regular bra with the back closure since I do the `` sports bra hop '' to get out of my other MC bras . I just ca n't give it a better rating because I ca n't wear it in the size I got .
 Bra fit well , but it did n't provide enough support . When I tried it on , there was as much bounce as if I were wearing a regular bra -- not a sports bra . I would not recommend this bra for high or even medium impact sports .
 I own two Maia 's by Moving Comfort so I tried this one out when I found it on sale . It does n't have underwire , I had total uniboob . The band at the bottom would n't stay put , it kept rolling up a bit . I bought a 38C , the same as I wear in the Maia , but the weird uniboob look is just too unflattering . I may try wearing a regular bra underneath , but I never do that with the Maia . I would n't wear it unless my other two are n't clean .
 I bought this based on past reviews but am disappointed . It is extremely difficult to get on and off . I read earlier reviews commenting on this but thought how hard could a bra be ? Well , it is difficult to fasten once on and even harder when you are sweaty . It also cuts into my arm pit on my left side . I have never spent this much money on a sports bra and regret doing so .
 If you 're a petite woman , I do not recommend this bra . To achieve any control of the bouncing at all , I had to pull the straps so tight , that the bra almost cuts into my armpits , because it 's sides are too wide .
 My Moving Comfort Cara works beautifully for yoga , running , and backpacking . When I tried to order another Cara , the seller sent a Fiona instead . I tried it out to be fair . Unfortunately , it felt like a grudge against my breasts
 I ca n't see how this bra is any better than much less expensive ones that pull on over your head , in fact , not as good . I stiil had the same old uni-boob problem and they 're still bouncy , only more in tandem . It did n't seem as secure as the pull-on types . I ordered a Glamorise Sports bra at the same time which is bulit more like a regular bra , only with enhanced structural details . It was much more secure , very minimal bouncing , and without uni-boob .
 I have read such positive reviews on this style of bra , that I had to give it a try . I have the Moving Comfort Maia , and absolutely love it . It is an under-wire style and does the job so much better . I am returning this bra , and plan to stick to under-wire styles from now on .
 I returned this . Even though I ordered the same size I ordinarily would for a sports bra , it was a very strange fit . The band was fine , but the cups were too big . I 've had trouble with this brand before & will not bother trying any of their other styles .
 No molded cups . . so this can not be a high impact support bra . . it 's ugly w / o cups . . color is as shown . .
 I read that this bra fit small but I did n't really expect it to be as small as it was . I wear a 34C on the loosest hook so I ordered a 34C and when I recieved it , I was disappointed to find that it did n't fit well at all . I could do it up but it was n't comfortable . Reading other reviews , I thought it would have more padding then it did . Even though my boobs were pancaked , due to the fact the bra was too small , the bra still showed headlights . The adjustable straps is a great feature but I do n't think I 'll be ordering this bra again in a different size .
 For me , this was way too tight . I 've never had a 40D bra be this tight . I 'm all for support but this was just constricting and uncomfortable and so I 'll send it back . I 'm really disappointed because if it were just a tad bigger in the band I would have kept it . I 'm not quite sure how this can be considered a size 40 .
 Seemed well built , but not true to size order bigger than you are . cup size OK but around smaller than regular bras .
 This style/make of bra is not for a full figured woman . There was no support at all for a 44D/DD size . Needs more padding/support .
 I bought this bra after reading all the great reviews and have to say I am very disappointed . The bra is very well made and fits comfortably , although you have to take care to get the velcro on the straps lined up perfectly to prevent it digging into your shoulders . If I was just wearing it for walking it would be fine , but I wore it to a Zumba class and it was anything but okay . First of all , I was bouncing all over the place . The worst part though was that when I took it off after the class , I had never seen such a wet bra . So much for the wicking material . Even my old compression bras keep me drier . In short , not for high impact and not for women who sweat when they work out .
 I loved this sports bra . However , the last time I washed it the clasp end of the back had completely melted ! The bra is now completely useless .
 Two years ago I bought this bra for my grand daughter who plays volleyball and she loved it because it gave her good support and no bounce -LRB- 38DD -RRB- . The new lining is n't as good as it once was and therefore she wanted me to return it and look for a bra with more support . I am disappointed with the changes to a once great sports bra .
 this sports bra has okay support , however there is nothing to cover up how cold you are ... The adjustable sraps are weird , I guess you could get use to it , but the straps are secured with velcro which if I remember correctly from the 80 's does not last very long .
 There is nothing good about this bra . It does n't move , true . It flattens , true . Does it do that well?NO !!! To use a common metaphor , the headlights are still on and visible . If it worked for others , I 'm glad . Me ? No ! Wished I had returned it .
 I would not recommend this sports bra . After trying the Maia and Juno , I was very disappointed in this sports bra . The straps are kind of bulky and did n't line up very well . I did not find this sports bra to be very supportive and it seemed awkward to adjust .
 I read the reviews and ended up ordering this bra . I 'm a 40D - this thing was not comfortable at all . Sure it had support but I ended up returning it .
 Mia bra has so much more support . Did n't realize this one did not have underwire . Gives you a uni-boob . Thought I 'd try it to see if this was any cooler but it is n't . Would not recommend this for any high impact aerobics . Mia does not let you move an inch & keeps you from having uni-boob . Wish they would come up with a seamless version , though . But , this is better than a regular bra for sports & it does hook in the back . One thing to be careful , though , is the velcro strap adjustments . Get them precise or the velcro will rub your arm pit area .
 I was a bit disappointed with this bra , as a 38D I did n't find it supportive enough for my sports needs . I found the Juno much better .
 This bra did n't offer enough support for larger cup sizes . I 'm a 36C , and I run and play soccer . I 've tried many different sports bras and this one did n't come close to supporting my chest while running .

 I did n't like this bra as well as the other one I had bought at the same time -LRB- same company , different style -RRB- , it fit different and I did n't like the Velcro straps . I returned it .
 Although the design is good -LRB- adjustable straps and Three plush-backed hook-and-eye rows on band , as described in Product Features -RRB- , but the material used is something that gets malodorous just in 2-3 hours . I have other brands I can use several times before such a bad smell is felt ! So it 's not my body problem , but the quality.And there 's also no cup as described in product features ! Honestly , I spent this much for getting these cups . Actually this was the distinguishing feature I was craving , and it made me happy when I read here that it has cups . But when I received it , there was no cup!So I feel it has really been a waste of money .
 bra does n't have padding in the front so when it is cold everyone can see know what happens . otherwise it fits ok but does n't provide the support a sports bra should . It fits like a regular bra so it 's not a good buy for a sports bra
 Just purchased this bra and was very disappointed . I am a runner and DD cup . There was no support . The bra was also very stretchy , so it felt loose . I do not recommend this for any big-busted girl doing high-impact activities .
 It 's not like the picture at all . I expected firm cups and more contouring and shaping and it is not . It is just like a soft cup , wireless bra . I wanted something that supports my breasts so that I can move , like run , or jump rope , but it does not do that . I am returning it : - -LRB-
 After hearing all the great things about this bra , I bought it for running and was excited to give it a try . Boy was I greatly diappointed . This bra is flimsy and did not provide any support . I 'm only a 36B , I do n't know how anyone larger could like this bra . My old Champion bras give much better support . I returned this bra , the material was thin , provided no modesty coverage and had no support . I ca n't see how it 's rated to be a high support bra for running .
 So I rarely review anything online , but I really just wanted to say few things about this bra.so someone else does n't get caught out.im a 38d with a 27 waist so im just big on top . . and I can not get over d reviews by people with bigger bust than me , dunno how they were supported by this bra.it is honestly for me anyway , was a glorified shelf tank top , absolutely no support total bounce and just very light.sports bras arent supposed to be VERY comfortable so I knew once I put it on that it was n't gona be much use for running.i log 35 + miles a wk , its prob good for yoga etc low impact sports.i would highly recommend the Juno great great bra for running or the enell 100 , this is only my experience but I have it now and ca n't return it so tis a bit of a waste.good luck gals .
 This sports bra offers minimal support . I bought it based on reviews and that it called itself a high motion control / high impact sports bra . I went jogging in it once and hated it .
 For starters , I am a 34DD in my mid twenties and to me this bra is only useful for yoga at home . I purchased this bra because of all the amazing reviews , which I now totally disagree with . I enjoy running , hiking , yoga , and gym activities.The disapointment started with the look of the bra , as a curvy woman I hope to at least look like one , but in this I felt like a B. I told myself to suck it up , because nobody cares at the gym . On the drive to the gym , I found myself wobbling in this bra , bad sign . The `` molded cups '' they claim to have are nothing more than a very thin layer of tightly shaped fabric , nothing like say , the Juno . Additionally , the only way to avoid a lot of movement is to tighten the straps to the point that your shoulders end up hurting by the end of cardio , before I can even get to strength training . I get that enough in my daily life.The two biggest failings were ones I encountered on a hike . The `` compression '' aspect of the bra does nothing more than mash you together . Beneath the thin fabric the girls are free to wobble about and between them there is no breathing room . To put it lightly , I was uncomfortably sweaty and still wishing for a real sports bra . While walking ! Then , when a cold wind blows , anybody around is free to see exactly how chilly you find it . Embarassing , to say the least.I honestly do n't understand how this is a high impact bra recommended to women my size . I gave the company a second chance and picked up a Juno on sale . After just one gym use I love it so much more in every way . I look good and I feel good . We 'll see how it holds up on a hike . Do not buy this online if you are curvy , try it in a store . Even on sale , now I 'm out that money because I was desperate for a sports bra .
 I 've been looking for a new sports bra and when I researched this one , it sounded like just the ticket . I 'm a little over 50 and wear a 34DD . The bra is well made and comfortable , but there really is n't much support . It may be enough for a younger woman or someone with small breasts , but it did n't work for me at all . Darn it , I loved the green !
 I bought it because Im large chested and the elastic band keeps twisting and curling . Not happy with the purchase : -LRB-
 Fits well , does not hold breast in place and the bottom seam rolls.Feels uncomfortable . You have to keep unrolling all day.Straps are nice .
 The moving comfort Fiona bra would have been met my needs had it had truly molded cups like Hind -LRB- Saucony motion -RRB- or Under Armour -- it lacks suppression cups and the thin fabric coverage caused nipple show through and rub so it really is not useable for running for me -- fine for yoga but not for other sports . It is supportive but the hooks in the back are difficult to do even when the bra hooks are done up front so this one went back . Instead I purchased the Under Armour Endure zip front in D cup -LRB- comes in S , M , L with D cup -RRB- , which though runs a little small , provides good support , easy removability -LRB- a plus after a good workout -RRB- . I loved it so much that I bought several of these . I wish bra manufacturers would add some color and ease of removability to the sports bra selection . I am sick of the black or white options . The colored sports bras usually are less supportive and pull off variety . Hind made some excellent ones but Saucony has gone back to black and white.I rated this low because of 1 -RRB- insufficent fabric for good nipple coverage and comfort up front ; 2 -RRB- difficult to hook when compared to other bras with back hooks .
 I wanted to love it . . all the glowing reviews gave me immense hope . Seriously , I do n't understand the attraction . Wish I had returned it , instead of giving it the chance it did n't deserve . : -LRB- It 's awful !! 1 . Offers very little support and zero bounce control .2 . Flimsy . No structure whatsoever .3 . A limp , shapeless piece of fabric .4 . Cups are strange and loose .5 . Bottom band shifts out of shape in the front , turning and twisting .6 . It 's very noticeable under tee shirts.I measured carefully , per instructions . The result was my usual bra size . That 's what I ordered and it 's so oversized ! The cups seem huge.Bummer .
 Tried this bra . I am a DD , and this was not nearly supportive enough while running . Also , the straps adjust at the front/shoulders , and that extra bit of fabric really rubbed on my skin , and a week later I still have actual scabs from it . I would highly recommend going with the Enell sports bra , it is so worth the extra money .
 I 'm so confused . I thought this was a supportive sports bra for C 's and up ??? I needed another sports bra for my high cardio workouts , and contemplated buying this for the longest time -LRB- I have previously bought a moving comfort racerback bra that I love but is now no where to be found -RRB- and seeing that there was over 300 reviews figured it would be awesome ! Bought my regular bra size , which fits great and I love the non-racerback/velcro straps design , but here 's the thing . When you say a sports bra is supportive , I 'm thinking supportive under the bust and it keeps the ladies from BOUNCING . One of of two ai n't bad right ? It 's definitely supportive under the bust , but the bouncing ? I was simply trying it on and jumped up a down a couple times , and I could n't handle all the bouncing . Oh and it 's barely lined ! So beware ! Because if it 's cold in the room , others will definitely know . This is definitely going back .
 I have another sports bra like this but this one is not very good - the way the straps are built rub against my inside shoulder . Also the back end adjustable strap is too clunky and also rubs . No way I could wear this for a long run - which is why I bought it as a marathoner .
 I loved this sports bra . However , the last time I washed it the clasp end of the back had completely melted ! The bra is now completely useless .

 Bought this sports bra in a 32D based on reviews that said it is `` true to VS sizes '' , but I did not find this to be true . My VS size is 32D , but the cup size on this bra is huge . I plan on returning it , but I 'm debating going down to a B or C cup size -LRB- it 's really that big -RRB- . Chest size fits perfect though . I do love that it functions like a regular bra with the back closure since I do the `` sports bra hop '' to get out of my other MC bras . I just ca n't give it a better rating because I ca n't wear it in the size I got .

I may try wearing a regular bra underneath , but I never do that with the Maia . I would n't wear it unless my other two are n't clean .
 I figured this HAD to be a great bra with all of the glowing reviews from other busty ladies , but it failed to deliver . Not comfortable , does not support well and just creates a big `` uniboob '' look like all other sports bras . Go with the Champion Powerback if you are looking for support , lift and separation in a sports bra and you have large breasts .
 At first I really liked the bra , it definitely holds my DDs in place , but it puts SO much pain and pressure on my shoulders . I only wear it in moments of desperation now : -LRB-
 If you 're a petite woman , I do not recommend this bra . To achieve any control of the bouncing at all , I had to pull the straps so tight , that the bra almost cuts into my armpits , because it 's sides are too wide .

 I have read such positive reviews on this style of bra , that I had to give it a try . I have the Moving Comfort Maia , and absolutely love it . It is an under-wire style and does the job so much better . I am returning this bra , and plan to stick to under-wire styles from now on .
 I returned this . Even though I ordered the same size I ordinarily would for a sports bra , it was a very strange fit . The band was fine , but the cups were too big . I 've had trouble with this brand before & will not bother trying any of their other styles .
 I bought this based on past reviews but am disappointed . It is extremely difficult to get on and off . I read earlier reviews commenting on this but thought how hard could a bra be ? Well , it is difficult to fasten once on and even harder when you are sweaty . It also cuts into my arm pit on my left side . I have never spent this much money on a sports bra and regret doing so .
 I was fairly disappointed with this bra . The materials are good quality and construction is clean -LRB- no weak seams , loose threads -RRB- , but bounce control was n't optimal and some of its `` features '' actually hurt a bit . I usually use two fairly cheap compression sports bras and can achieve minimal movement with them . This bra felt like 1.5 of those bras and cost about 2x more . The straps are looped through a slit at the top edge of the front of the bra and are secured by Velcro . You adjust them by unlatching them , pulling them tighter , and reattaching to the Velcro strip . This system is far inferior to the normal sliding adjustment most bras have . The straps dig into my skin at the point of attachment , and by the end of a workout those two spots on my chest are really sore.Pros : Good materialsGood constructionCons : Straps hurtStrap adjustment system is badBounce control is just so-so given the price
 i 'm actually not a 32B but am a 30B/C , and got this thinking , sports bras are usually too tight so why not try the next size up ? well , this was so tight i had to return it . i could barely breathe with it on , and it squashed my chest without supporting it . felt like one of those chest-binder things . the good
 Despite the Moving Comfort &#34; bra finder &#34; on their website giving this bra as an option for a 40DD doing high impact activities such as running , I found this bra to be almost completely lacking in support . By the end of my run , I was clutching my boobs in my hands to keep them from knocking me unconscious.Additionally , the lining is only stitched to the body of the bra at the edges , so after wear , the bottom band has rolled up so much that the lining is all but hiding the main fabric.It looks like Enell is going to be my next stop .
 not the same fit as others of the same brand , model purchased the same size . Factory defect ? You tell me . ran larger than normal
 I found immediately after putting it on that the adjustment velcro on each strap was very uncomfortable . They are located in the front of the bra , and felt like two big bulges pushing in underneath each side of my collarbone . I have heard great things about MovingComfort , so I do n't think it means their other bras are unpleasant . I just found out that this one would n't work for me .
 I bought this in my normal size 38D but it is too big . I will keep it anyway because I do n't want to hassle with an online return/exchange when I am not sure what my correct size should be in this bra . I have to wear this on the last set of hooks and put the straps up as high as they will go , then it is okay for strength training and low impact cardio , but the fit is still too loose to support high impact activities . The other thing I do n't like is that the material is very slippery , so it is hard to fasten the hooks . On a positive note , the colors are beautiful . I got the mojito , which is a nice bright green . A lot of sites only offer basic black or white , so you may need to shop around to find the pretty colors .
 I usually do n't take the time to write reviews , but I do n't want anyone else who is looking for a supportive sports bra to waste there money . This bra offers no support at all ! I bought this bra for my daily walks hoping it would offer me average support . All I can say is that It offers NO support at all . I can say that It is comfortable , that is if your looking for a bra to wear while sitting on the couch . However if you actually need support because your active , KEEP on looking this is NOT the bra you want . People who gave this bra positive reviews must have implants or have never had children .
 To start off , I returned the Moving Comfort Fiona Bra . The material is very thin -LRB- 2 layers thin -RRB- . Fiona has absolutely NO nipple coverage . There are no ` cups ' in this sports bra . Secondly , yes it does have adjustable straps , but they are velcro and fasten under the straps . I like to do a mix of excercises , but mostly cardio . I tried doing jumping jacks with this sports bra on . It offerd moderate support , the ladies did some bouncing . I did n't feel like there was enough lift or support for high impact activity . I am a 36-38C and ordered a 38C . It had an ok fit . Not too tight , but not too loose either . -LRB- That is with it fastened as tight as it would go . -RRB- If I were going to keep it , I think a 36C would fit better . Overall , it is fine if you do n't mind nipple show , a few bounces , and the velcro straps . If you want compression and minimal bounce , take a pass .
 I wear a 34D bra , and ordered this in the same size . The bra was ok in the band measurement , but the cup size was a B , at most . It was ridiculously tiny and also weirdly centered . If your breasts grow out of your sternum , I suppose this will work . This was definitely not a size D or C bra . It was labeled 34D but in actuality must have been a B to be this tiny . Returning . Disappointed . All 3 bras I bought from this brand are going right back and I am never buying from them again . Stick to Nike , Under Armour , Adidas .
 It was small in & tight u would need almost 2 sizes bigger , I 'm a 38c but this was no way close ,
 Found out after I was sent an email that the product had been shipped that it was on backorder and was refunded my money . I should have never been able to order it if it was on backorder .
 I love this bra , it 's made extremely well and i was excited to find it in my small band but semi-large cup size . But I returned it , bcuz the only reason I chose this bra was because the description said it had molded cups . It does n't . I tried it on and had MAJOR `` poke thru '' and that 's just not cute . I 'd never leave the house like that so Unfortunately I returned it . had it had molded cups -LRB- like the description said it did -RRB- , I would hve kept it and it would hve been easily a 4 star , maybe 5 .
 If you are larger in the bust area and do high impact aerobics , this bra is not for you ! It does n't look good either . It does not create a separation between your bust . I thought I had finally found a good sports bra , and once I received it in the mail and tried it one , I was so disappointed .
 I have another sports bra like this but this one is not very good - the way the straps are built rub against my inside shoulder . Also the back end adjustable strap is too clunky and also rubs . No way I could wear this for a long run - which is why I bought it as a marathoner .
 I 'm so confused . I thought this was a supportive sports bra for C 's and up ??? I needed another sports bra for my high cardio workouts , and contemplated buying this for the longest time -LRB- I have previously bought a moving comfort racerback bra that I love but is now no where to be found -RRB- and seeing that there was over 300 reviews figured it would be awesome ! Bought my regular bra size , which fits great and I love the non-racerback/velcro straps design , but here 's the thing . When you say a sports bra is supportive , I 'm thinking supportive under the bust and it keeps the ladies from BOUNCING . One of of two ai n't bad right ? It 's definitely supportive under the bust , but the bouncing ? I was simply trying it on and jumped up a down a couple times , and I could n't handle all the bouncing . Oh and it 's barely lined ! So beware ! Because if it 's cold in the room , others will definitely know . This is definitely going back .
 I wanted to love it . . all the glowing reviews gave me immense hope . Seriously , I do n't understand the attraction . Wish I had returned it , instead of giving it the chance it did n't deserve . : -LRB- It 's awful !! 1 . Offers very little support and zero bounce control .2 . Flimsy . No structure whatsoever .3 . A limp , shapeless piece of fabric .4 . Cups are strange and loose .5 . Bottom band shifts out of shape in the front , turning and twisting .6 . It 's very noticeable under tee shirts.I measured carefully , per instructions . The result was my usual bra size . That 's what I ordered and it 's so oversized ! The cups seem huge.Bummer .
 Tried this bra . I am a DD , and this was not nearly supportive enough while running . Also , the straps adjust at the front/shoulders , and that extra bit of fabric really rubbed on my skin , and a week later I still have actual scabs from it . I would highly recommend going with the Enell sports bra , it is so worth the extra money .
 Fits well , does not hold breast in place and the bottom seam rolls.Feels uncomfortable . You have to keep unrolling all day.Straps are nice .
 I bought it because Im large chested and the elastic band keeps twisting and curling . Not happy with the purchase : -LRB-
 This sports bra offers minimal support . I bought it based on reviews and that it called itself a high motion control / high impact sports bra . I went jogging in it once and hated it .
 For starters , I am a 34DD in my mid twenties and to me this bra is only useful for yoga at home . I purchased this bra because of all the amazing reviews , which I now totally disagree with . I enjoy running , hiking , yoga , and gym activities.The disapointment started with the look of the bra , as a curvy woman I hope to at least look like one , but in this I felt like a B. I told myself to suck it up , because nobody cares at the gym . On the drive to the gym , I found myself wobbling in this bra , bad sign . The `` molded cups '' they claim to have are nothing more than a very thin layer of tightly shaped fabric , nothing like say , the Juno . Additionally , the only way to avoid a lot of movement is to tighten the straps to the point that your shoulders end up hurting by the end of cardio , before I can even get to strength training . I get that enough in my daily life.The two biggest failings were ones I encountered on a hike . The `` compression '' aspect of the bra does nothing more than mash you together . Beneath the thin fabric the girls are free to wobble about and between them there is no breathing room . To put it lightly , I was uncomfortably sweaty and still wishing for a real sports bra . While walking ! Then , when a cold wind blows , anybody around is free to see exactly how chilly you find it . Embarassing , to say the least.I honestly do n't understand how this is a high impact bra recommended to women my size . I gave the company a second chance and picked up a Juno on sale . After just one gym use I love it so much more in every way . I look good and I feel good . We 'll see how it holds up on a hike . Do not buy this online if you are curvy , try it in a store . Even on sale , now I 'm out that money because I was desperate for a sports bra .

 So I rarely review anything online , but I really just wanted to say few things about this bra.so someone else does n't get caught out.im a 38d with a 27 waist so im just big on top . . and I can not get over d reviews by people with bigger bust than me , dunno how they were supported by this bra.it is honestly for me anyway , was a glorified shelf tank top , absolutely no support total bounce and just very light.sports bras arent supposed to be VERY comfortable so I knew once I put it on that it was n't gona be much use for running.i log 35 + miles a wk , its prob good for yoga etc low impact sports.i would highly recommend the Juno great great bra for running or the enell 100 , this is only my experience but I have it now and ca n't return it so tis a bit of a waste.good luck gals .
 It 's not like the picture at all . I expected firm cups and more contouring and shaping and it is not . It is just like a soft cup , wireless bra . I wanted something that supports my breasts so that I can move , like run , or jump rope , but it does not do that . I am returning it : - -LRB-
 After hearing all the great things about this bra , I bought it for running and was excited to give it a try . Boy was I greatly diappointed . This bra is flimsy and did not provide any support . I 'm only a 36B , I do n't know how anyone larger could like this bra . My old Champion bras give much better support . I returned this bra , the material was thin , provided no modesty coverage and had no support . I ca n't see how it 's rated to be a high support bra for running .
 Although the design is good -LRB- adjustable straps and Three plush-backed hook-and-eye rows on band , as described in Product Features -RRB- , but the material used is something that gets malodorous just in 2-3 hours . I have other brands I can use several times before such a bad smell is felt ! So it 's not my body problem , but the quality.And there 's also no cup as described in product features ! Honestly , I spent this much for getting these cups . Actually this was the distinguishing feature I was craving , and it made me happy when I read here that it has cups . But when I received it , there was no cup!So I feel it has really been a waste of money .
 bra does n't have padding in the front so when it is cold everyone can see know what happens . otherwise it fits ok but does n't provide the support a sports bra should . It fits like a regular bra so it 's not a good buy for a sports bra
 Just purchased this bra and was very disappointed . I am a runner and DD cup . There was no support . The bra was also very stretchy , so it felt loose . I do not recommend this for any big-busted girl doing high-impact activities .
 I was a bit disappointed with this bra , as a 38D I did n't find it supportive enough for my sports needs . I found the Juno much better .
 This bra did n't offer enough support for larger cup sizes . I 'm a 36C , and I run and play soccer . I 've tried many different sports bras and this one did n't come close to supporting my chest while running . I felt the material was way to stretchy to prevent `` bounce '' and keep everything strapped down as a good sports bra should .
 I did n't like this bra as well as the other one I had bought at the same time -LRB- same company , different style -RRB- , it fit different and I did n't like the Velcro straps . I returned it .
 I love this bra , it 's made extremely well and i was excited to find it in my small band but semi-large cup size .

 It was small in & tight u would need almost 2 sizes bigger , I 'm a 38c but this was no way close ,
 I 've been looking for a new sports bra and when I researched this one , it sounded like just the ticket . I 'm a little over 50 and wear a 34DD . The bra is well made and comfortable , but there really is n't much support . It may be enough for a younger woman or someone with small breasts , but it did n't work for me at all . Darn it , I loved the green !
 i 'm actually not a 32B but am a 30B/C , and got this thinking , sports bras are usually too tight so why not try the next size up ? well , this was so tight i had to return it . i could barely breathe with it on , and it squashed my chest without supporting it . felt like one of those chest-binder things . the good

 If you 're a petite woman , I do not recommend this bra . To achieve any control of the bouncing at all , I had to pull the straps so tight , that the bra almost cuts into my armpits , because it 's sides are too wide .
 My Moving Comfort Cara works beautifully for yoga , running , and backpacking . When I tried to order another Cara , the seller sent a Fiona instead . I tried it out to be fair . Unfortunately , it felt like a grudge against my breasts
 I ca n't see how this bra is any better than much less expensive ones that pull on over your head , in fact , not as good . I stiil had the same old uni-boob problem and they 're still bouncy , only more in tandem . It did n't seem as secure as the pull-on types . I ordered a Glamorise Sports bra at the same time which is bulit more like a regular bra , only with enhanced structural details . It was much more secure , very minimal bouncing , and without uni-boob .
 I have read such positive reviews on this style of bra , that I had to give it a try . I have the Moving Comfort Maia , and absolutely love it . It is an under-wire style and does the job so much better . I am returning this bra , and plan to stick to under-wire styles from now on .
 I returned this . Even though I ordered the same size I ordinarily would for a sports bra , it was a very strange fit . The band was fine , but the cups were too big . I 've had trouble with this brand before & will not bother trying any of their other styles .

 At first I really liked the bra , it definitely holds my DDs in place , but it puts SO much pain and pressure on my shoulders . I only wear it in moments of desperation now : -LRB-
 Bought this sports bra in a 32D based on reviews that said it is `` true to VS sizes '' , but I did not find this to be true . My VS size is 32D , but the cup size on this bra is huge . I plan on returning it , but I 'm debating going down to a B or C cup size -LRB- it 's really that big -RRB- . Chest size fits perfect though . I do love that it functions like a regular bra with the back closure since I do the `` sports bra hop '' to get out of my other MC bras . I just ca n't give it a better rating because I ca n't wear it in the size I got .
 Bra fit well , but it did n't provide enough support . When I tried it on , there was as much bounce as if I were wearing a regular bra -- not a sports bra . I would not recommend this bra for high or even medium impact sports .
 I own two Maia 's by Moving Comfort so I tried this one out when I found it on sale . It does n't have underwire , I had total uniboob . The band at the bottom would n't stay put , it kept rolling up a bit . I bought a 38C , the same as I wear in the Maia , but the weird uniboob look is just too unflattering . I may try wearing a regular bra underneath , but I never do that with the Maia . I would n't wear it unless my other two are n't clean .
 I figured this HAD to be a great bra with all of the glowing reviews from other busty ladies , but it failed to deliver . Not comfortable , does not support well and just creates a big `` uniboob '' look like all other sports bras . Go with the Champion Powerback if you are looking for support , lift and separation in a sports bra and you have large breasts .
 Two years ago I bought this bra for my grand daughter who plays volleyball and she loved it because it gave her good support and no bounce -LRB- 38DD -RRB- . The new lining is n't as good as it once was and therefore she wanted me to return it and look for a bra with more support . I am disappointed with the changes to a once great sports bra .
 this sports bra has okay support , however there is nothing to cover up how cold you are ... The adjustable sraps are weird , I guess you could get use to it , but the straps are secured with velcro which if I remember correctly from the 80 's does not last very long .
 There is nothing good about this bra . It does n't move , true . It flattens , true . Does it do that well?NO !!! To use a common metaphor , the headlights are still on and visible . If it worked for others , I 'm glad . Me ? No ! Wished I had returned it .
 I would not recommend this sports bra . After trying the Maia and Juno , I was very disappointed in this sports bra . The straps are kind of bulky and did n't line up very well . I did not find this sports bra to be very supportive and it seemed awkward to adjust .
 I read the reviews and ended up ordering this bra . I 'm a 40D - this thing was not comfortable at all . Sure it had support but I ended up returning it .
 Mia bra has so much more support . Did n't realize this one did not have underwire . Gives you a uni-boob . Thought I 'd try it to see if this was any cooler but it is n't . Would not recommend this for any high impact aerobics . Mia does not let you move an inch & keeps you from having uni-boob . Wish they would come up with a seamless version , though . But , this is better than a regular bra for sports & it does hook in the back . One thing to be careful , though , is the velcro strap adjustments . Get them precise or the velcro will rub your arm pit area .
 The moving comfort Fiona bra would have been met my needs had it had truly molded cups like Hind -LRB- Saucony motion -RRB- or Under Armour -- it lacks suppression cups and the thin fabric coverage caused nipple show through and rub so it really is not useable for running for me -- fine for yoga but not for other sports . It is supportive but the hooks in the back are difficult to do even when the bra hooks are done up front so this one went back . Instead I purchased the Under Armour Endure zip front in D cup -LRB- comes in S , M , L with D cup -RRB- , which though runs a little small , provides good support , easy removability -LRB- a plus after a good workout -RRB- . I loved it so much that I bought several of these . I wish bra manufacturers would add some color and ease of removability to the sports bra selection . I am sick of the black or white options . The colored sports bras usually are less supportive and pull off variety . Hind made some excellent ones but Saucony has gone back to black and white.I rated this low because of 1 -RRB- insufficent fabric for good nipple coverage and comfort up front ; 2 -RRB- difficult to hook when compared to other bras with back hooks .
 Seemed well built , but not true to size order bigger than you are . cup size OK but around smaller than regular bras .
 This style/make of bra is not for a full figured woman . There was no support at all for a 44D/DD size . Needs more padding/support .
 No molded cups . . so this can not be a high impact support bra . . it 's ugly w / o cups . . color is as shown . .
 I read that this bra fit small but I did n't really expect it to be as small as it was . I wear a 34C on the loosest hook so I ordered a 34C and when I recieved it , I was disappointed to find that it did n't fit well at all . I could do it up but it was n't comfortable . Reading other reviews , I thought it would have more padding then it did . Even though my boobs were pancaked , due to the fact the bra was too small , the bra still showed headlights . The adjustable straps is a great feature but I do n't think I 'll be ordering this bra again in a different size .
 For me , this was way too tight . I 've never had a 40D bra be this tight . I 'm all for support but this was just constricting and uncomfortable and so I 'll send it back . I 'm really disappointed because if it were just a tad bigger in the band I would have kept it . I 'm not quite sure how this can be considered a size 40 .
 I bought this bra after reading all the great reviews and have to say I am very disappointed . The bra is very well made and fits comfortably , although you have to take care to get the velcro on the straps lined up perfectly to prevent it digging into your shoulders . If I was just wearing it for walking it would be fine , but I wore it to a Zumba class and it was anything but okay . First of all , I was bouncing all over the place . The worst part though was that when I took it off after the class , I had never seen such a wet bra . So much for the wicking material . Even my old compression bras keep me drier . In short , not for high impact and not for women who sweat when they work out .
 I loved this sports bra . However , the last time I washed it the clasp end of the back had completely melted ! The bra is now completely useless .
 I was fairly disappointed with this bra . The materials are good quality and construction is clean -LRB- no weak seams , loose threads -RRB- , but bounce control was n't optimal and some of its `` features '' actually hurt a bit .

 I 've been looking for a new sports bra and when I researched this one , it sounded like just the ticket . I 'm a little over 50 and wear a 34DD . The bra is well made and comfortable , but there really is n't much support . It may be enough for a younger woman or someone with small breasts , but it did n't work for me at all . Darn it , I loved the green !
 It was small in & tight u would need almost 2 sizes bigger , I 'm a 38c but this was no way close ,
 I love this bra , it 's made extremely well and i was excited to find it in my small band but semi-large cup size . But I returned it , bcuz the only reason I chose this bra was because the description said it had molded cups . It does n't . I tried it on and had MAJOR `` poke thru '' and that 's just not cute . I 'd never leave the house like that so Unfortunately I returned it . had it had molded cups -LRB- like the description said it did -RRB- , I would hve kept it and it would hve been easily a 4 star , maybe 5 .
 If you are larger in the bust area and do high impact aerobics , this bra is not for you ! It does n't look good either . It does not create a separation between your bust . I thought I had finally found a good sports bra , and once I received it in the mail and tried it one , I was so disappointed .
 this sports bra has okay support , however there is nothing to cover up how cold you are ... The adjustable sraps are weird , I guess you could get use to it , but the straps are secured with velcro which if I remember correctly from the 80 's does not last very long .
 Found out after I was sent an email that the product had been shipped that it was on backorder and was refunded my money . I should have never been able to order it if it was on backorder .
 Seemed well built , but not true to size order bigger than you are . cup size OK but around smaller than regular bras .
 This style/make of bra is not for a full figured woman . There was no support at all for a 44D/DD size . Needs more padding/support .
 No molded cups . . so this can not be a high impact support bra . . it 's ugly w / o cups . . color is as shown . .
 I read that this bra fit small but I did n't really expect it to be as small as it was . I wear a 34C on the loosest hook so I ordered a 34C and when I recieved it , I was disappointed to find that it did n't fit well at all . I could do it up but it was n't comfortable . Reading other reviews , I thought it would have more padding then it did . Even though my boobs were pancaked , due to the fact the bra was too small , the bra still showed headlights . The adjustable straps is a great feature but I do n't think I 'll be ordering this bra again in a different size .
 For me , this was way too tight . I 've never had a 40D bra be this tight . I 'm all for support but this was just constricting and uncomfortable and so I 'll send it back . I 'm really disappointed because if it were just a tad bigger in the band I would have kept it . I 'm not quite sure how this can be considered a size 40 .
 I bought this bra after reading all the great reviews and have to say I am very disappointed . The bra is very well made and fits comfortably , although you have to take care to get the velcro on the straps lined up perfectly to prevent it digging into your shoulders . If I was just wearing it for walking it would be fine , but I wore it to a Zumba class and it was anything but okay . First of all , I was bouncing all over the place . The worst part though was that when I took it off after the class , I had never seen such a wet bra . So much for the wicking material . Even my old compression bras keep me drier . In short , not for high impact and not for women who sweat when they work out .
 I loved this sports bra . However , the last time I washed it the clasp end of the back had completely melted ! The bra is now completely useless .
 Two years ago I bought this bra for my grand daughter who plays volleyball and she loved it because it gave her good support and no bounce -LRB- 38DD -RRB- . The new lining is n't as good as it once was and therefore she wanted me to return it and look for a bra with more support . I am disappointed with the changes to a once great sports bra .
 There is nothing good about this bra . It does n't move , true . It flattens , true . Does it do that well?NO !!! To use a common metaphor , the headlights are still on and visible . If it worked for others , I 'm glad . Me ? No ! Wished I had returned it .
 I would not recommend this sports bra . After trying the Maia and Juno , I was very disappointed in this sports bra . The straps are kind of bulky and did n't line up very well . I did not find this sports bra to be very supportive and it seemed awkward to adjust .
 I read the reviews and ended up ordering this bra . I 'm a 40D - this thing was not comfortable at all . Sure it had support but I ended up returning it .
 Mia bra has so much more support . Did n't realize this one did not have underwire . Gives you a uni-boob . Thought I 'd try it to see if this was any cooler but it is n't . Would not recommend this for any high impact aerobics . Mia does not let you move an inch & keeps you from having uni-boob . Wish they would come up with a seamless version , though . But , this is better than a regular bra for sports & it does hook in the back . One thing to be careful , though , is the velcro strap adjustments . Get them precise or the velcro will rub your arm pit area .
 At first I really liked the bra , it definitely holds my DDs in place , but it puts SO much pain and pressure on my shoulders . I only wear it in moments of desperation now : -LRB-
 Bra fit well , but it did n't provide enough support . When I tried it on , there was as much bounce as if I were wearing a regular bra -- not a sports bra . I would not recommend this bra for high or even medium impact sports .
 I own two Maia 's by Moving Comfort so I tried this one out when I found it on sale . It does n't have underwire , I had total uniboob . The band at the bottom would n't stay put , it kept rolling up a bit . I bought a 38C , the same as I wear in the Maia , but the weird uniboob look is just too unflattering . I may try wearing a regular bra underneath , but I never do that with the Maia . I would n't wear it unless my other two are n't clean .
 I figured this HAD to be a great bra with all of the glowing reviews from other busty ladies , but it failed to deliver . Not comfortable , does not support well and just creates a big `` uniboob '' look like all other sports bras . Go with the Champion Powerback if you are looking for support , lift and separation in a sports bra and you have large breasts .
 If you 're a petite woman , I do not recommend this bra . To achieve any control of the bouncing at all , I had to pull the straps so tight , that the bra almost cuts into my armpits , because it 's sides are too wide .
 My Moving Comfort Cara works beautifully for yoga , running , and backpacking . When I tried to order another Cara , the seller sent a Fiona instead . I tried it out to be fair . Unfortunately , it felt like a grudge against my breasts
 I ca n't see how this bra is any better than much less expensive ones that pull on over your head , in fact , not as good . I stiil had the same old uni-boob problem and they 're still bouncy , only more in tandem . It did n't seem as secure as the pull-on types . I ordered a Glamorise Sports bra at the same time which is bulit more like a regular bra , only with enhanced structural details . It was much more secure , very minimal bouncing , and without uni-boob .
 I have read such positive reviews on this style of bra , that I had to give it a try . I have the Moving Comfort Maia , and absolutely love it . It is an under-wire style and does the job so much better . I am returning this bra , and plan to stick to under-wire styles from now on .
 I returned this . Even though I ordered the same size I ordinarily would for a sports bra , it was a very strange fit . The band was fine , but the cups were too big . I 've had trouble with this brand before & will not bother trying any of their other styles .
 I bought this based on past reviews but am disappointed . It is extremely difficult to get on and off . I read earlier reviews commenting on this but thought how hard could a bra be ? Well , it is difficult to fasten once on and even harder when you are sweaty . It also cuts into my arm pit on my left side . I have never spent this much money on a sports bra and regret doing so .
 The moving comfort Fiona bra would have been met my needs had it had truly molded cups like Hind -LRB- Saucony motion -RRB- or Under Armour -- it lacks suppression cups and the thin fabric coverage caused nipple show through and rub so it really is not useable for running for me -- fine for yoga but not for other sports . It is supportive but the hooks in the back are difficult to do even when the bra hooks are done up front so this one went back . Instead I purchased the Under Armour Endure zip front in D cup -LRB- comes in S , M , L with D cup -RRB- , which though runs a little small , provides good support , easy removability -LRB- a plus after a good workout -RRB- . I loved it so much that I bought several of these . I wish bra manufacturers would add some color and ease of removability to the sports bra selection . I am sick of the black or white options . The colored sports bras usually are less supportive and pull off variety . Hind made some excellent ones but Saucony has gone back to black and white.I rated this low because of 1 -RRB- insufficent fabric for good nipple coverage and comfort up front ; 2 -RRB- difficult to hook when compared to other bras with back hooks .
 Fits well , does not hold breast in place and the bottom seam rolls.Feels uncomfortable . You have to keep unrolling all day.Straps are nice .
 I bought it because Im large chested and the elastic band keeps twisting and curling . Not happy with the purchase : -LRB-
 After hearing all the great things about this bra , I bought it for running and was excited to give it a try . Boy was I greatly diappointed . This bra is flimsy and did not provide any support . I 'm only a 36B , I do n't know how anyone larger could like this bra . My old Champion bras give much better support . I returned this bra , the material was thin , provided no modesty coverage and had no support . I ca n't see how it 's rated to be a high support bra for running .
 I wear a 34D bra , and ordered this in the same size . The bra was ok in the band measurement , but the cup size was a B , at most . It was ridiculously tiny and also weirdly centered . If your breasts grow out of your sternum , I suppose this will work . This was definitely not a size D or C bra . It was labeled 34D but in actuality must have been a B to be this tiny . Returning . Disappointed . All 3 bras I bought from this brand are going right back and I am never buying from them again . Stick to Nike , Under Armour , Adidas .
 I 'm so confused . I thought this was a supportive sports bra for C 's and up ??? I needed another sports bra for my high cardio workouts , and contemplated buying this for the longest time -LRB- I have previously bought a moving comfort racerback bra that I love but is now no where to be found -RRB- and seeing that there was over 300 reviews figured it would be awesome ! Bought my regular bra size , which fits great and I love the non-racerback/velcro straps design , but here 's the thing . When you say a sports bra is supportive , I 'm thinking supportive under the bust and it keeps the ladies from BOUNCING . One of of two ai n't bad right ? It 's definitely supportive under the bust , but the bouncing ? I was simply trying it on and jumped up a down a couple times , and I could n't handle all the bouncing . Oh and it 's barely lined ! So beware ! Because if it 's cold in the room , others will definitely know . This is definitely going back .
 I wanted to love it . . all the glowing reviews gave me immense hope . Seriously , I do n't understand the attraction . Wish I had returned it , instead of giving it the chance it did n't deserve . : -LRB- It 's awful !! 1 . Offers very little support and zero bounce control .2 . Flimsy . No structure whatsoever .3 . A limp , shapeless piece of fabric .4 . Cups are strange and loose .5 . Bottom band shifts out of shape in the front , turning and twisting .6 . It 's very noticeable under tee shirts.I measured carefully , per instructions . The result was my usual bra size . That 's what I ordered and it 's so oversized ! The cups seem huge.Bummer .
 Tried this bra . I am a DD , and this was not nearly supportive enough while running . Also , the straps adjust at the front/shoulders , and that extra bit of fabric really rubbed on my skin , and a week later I still have actual scabs from it . I would highly recommend going with the Enell sports bra , it is so worth the extra money .
 I have another sports bra like this but this one is not very good - the way the straps are built rub against my inside shoulder . Also the back end adjustable strap is too clunky and also rubs . No way I could wear this for a long run - which is why I bought it as a marathoner .
 It 's not like the picture at all . I expected firm cups and more contouring and shaping and it is not . It is just like a soft cup , wireless bra . I wanted something that supports my breasts so that I can move , like run , or jump rope , but it does not do that . I am returning it : - -LRB-
 Although the design is good -LRB- adjustable straps and Three plush-backed hook-and-eye rows on band , as described in Product Features -RRB- , but the material used is something that gets malodorous just in 2-3 hours . I have other brands I can use several times before such a bad smell is felt ! So it 's not my body problem , but the quality.And there 's also no cup as described in product features ! Honestly , I spent this much for getting these cups . Actually this was the distinguishing feature I was craving , and it made me happy when I read here that it has cups . But when I received it , there was no cup!So I feel it has really been a waste of money .
 bra does n't have padding in the front so when it is cold everyone can see know what happens . otherwise it fits ok but does n't provide the support a sports bra should . It fits like a regular bra so it 's not a good buy for a sports bra
 Just purchased this bra and was very disappointed . I am a runner and DD cup . There was no support . The bra was also very stretchy , so it felt loose . I do not recommend this for any big-busted girl doing high-impact activities .
 I was a bit disappointed with this bra , as a 38D I did n't find it supportive enough for my sports needs . I found the Juno much better .
 This bra did n't offer enough support for larger cup sizes . I 'm a 36C , and I run and play soccer . I 've tried many different sports bras and this one did n't come close to supporting my chest while running . I felt the material was way to stretchy to prevent `` bounce '' and keep everything strapped down as a good sports bra should .
 I did n't like this bra as well as the other one I had bought at the same time -LRB- same company , different style -RRB- , it fit different and I did n't like the Velcro straps . I returned it .
 I found immediately after putting it on that the adjustment velcro on each strap was very uncomfortable . They are located in the front of the bra , and felt like two big bulges pushing in underneath each side of my collarbone . I have heard great things about MovingComfort , so I do n't think it means their other bras are unpleasant . I just found out that this one would n't work for me .
 I bought this in my normal size 38D but it is too big . I will keep it anyway because I do n't want to hassle with an online return/exchange when I am not sure what my correct size should be in this bra . I have to wear this on the last set of hooks and put the straps up as high as they will go , then it is okay for strength training and low impact cardio , but the fit is still too loose to support high impact activities . The other thing I do n't like is that the material is very slippery , so it is hard to fasten the hooks . On a positive note , the colors are beautiful . I got the mojito , which is a nice bright green . A lot of sites only offer basic black or white , so you may need to shop around to find the pretty colors .
 I usually do n't take the time to write reviews , but I do n't want anyone else who is looking for a supportive sports bra to waste there money . This bra offers no support at all ! I bought this bra for my daily walks hoping it would offer me average support . All I can say is that It offers NO support at all . I can say that It is comfortable , that is if your looking for a bra to wear while sitting on the couch . However if you actually need support because your active , KEEP on looking this is NOT the bra you want . People who gave this bra positive reviews must have implants or have never had children .
 To start off , I returned the Moving Comfort Fiona Bra . The material is very thin -LRB- 2 layers thin -RRB- . Fiona has absolutely NO nipple coverage . There are no ` cups ' in this sports bra . Secondly , yes it does have adjustable straps , but they are velcro and fasten under the straps . I like to do a mix of excercises , but mostly cardio . I tried doing jumping jacks with this sports bra on . It offerd moderate support , the ladies did some bouncing . I did n't feel like there was enough lift or support for high impact activity . I am a 36-38C and ordered a 38C . It had an ok fit . Not too tight , but not too loose either . -LRB- That is with it fastened as tight as it would go . -RRB- If I were going to keep it , I think a 36C would fit better . Overall , it is fine if you do n't mind nipple show , a few bounces , and the velcro straps . If you want compression and minimal bounce , take a pass .
 So I rarely review anything online , but I really just wanted to say few things about this bra.so someone else does n't get caught out.im a 38d with a 27 waist so im just big on top . . and I can not get over d reviews by people with bigger bust than me , dunno how they were supported by this bra.it is honestly for me anyway , was a glorified shelf tank top , absolutely no support total bounce and just very light.sports bras arent supposed to be VERY comfortable so I knew once I put it on that it was n't gona be much use for running.i log 35 + miles a wk , its prob good for yoga etc low impact sports.i would highly recommend the Juno great great bra for running or the enell 100 , this is only my experience but I have it now and ca n't return it so tis a bit of a waste.good luck gals .
 This sports bra offers minimal support . I bought it based on reviews and that it called itself a high motion control / high impact sports bra . I went jogging in it once and hated it .
 For starters , I am a 34DD in my mid twenties and to me this bra is only useful for yoga at home . I purchased this bra because of all the amazing reviews , which I now totally disagree with . I enjoy running , hiking , yoga , and gym activities.The disapointment started with the look of the bra , as a curvy woman I hope to at least look like one , but in this I felt like a B. I told myself to suck it up , because nobody cares at the gym . On the drive to the gym , I found myself wobbling in this bra , bad sign . The `` molded cups '' they claim to have are nothing more than a very thin layer of tightly shaped fabric , nothing like say , the Juno . Additionally , the only way to avoid a lot of movement is to tighten the straps to the point that your shoulders end up hurting by the end of cardio , before I can even get to strength training . I get that enough in my daily life.The two biggest failings were ones I encountered on a hike . The `` compression '' aspect of the bra does nothing more than mash you together . Beneath the thin fabric the girls are free to wobble about and between them there is no breathing room . To put it lightly , I was uncomfortably sweaty and still wishing for a real sports bra . While walking ! Then , when a cold wind blows , anybody around is free to see exactly how chilly you find it . Embarassing , to say the least.I honestly do n't understand how this is a high impact bra recommended to women my size . I gave the company a second chance and picked up a Juno on sale . After just one gym use I love it so much more in every way . I look good and I feel good . We 'll see how it holds up on a hike . Do not buy this online if you are curvy , try it in a store . Even on sale , now I 'm out that money because I was desperate for a sports bra .
 I 've been buying these socks for about 10 years . They fit great and are comfortable walking socks . Unfortunately , the quality is not what it used to be . The tops of these socks now unravel after only a few washings . Once that happens , the sock starts degrading rather quickly . They just started making them cheaper . I doubt that I 'll buy any more .
 I was very dissapointed . I have been buying Thorlo brand socks since 1997 . I purchased size 13 thinking it would fit for a man with 10.5 size feet . They were too small and fit me , I wear women 's size 8 .
 I think I might have gotten the wrong size , but the seller refused to answer my emails . I 'm a sock connoisseur , and do n't mind paying a lot for a really good long lasting soak , but these were way over priced . I 'm not sure if it was the Walking Crew or the Fitness Crew 's that I also ordered but one of them was too thick making them uncomfortable to wear , ie . I wasted $ 25 + on two pairs of socks ! I wanted to return the un-opened pair but again , the seller refused to answer my emails . btw . I have other pairs of store bought Thorlo 's that I love ... I must have six pairs of them . VERY long lasting ... but I did n't find them with this dealer .
 I ordered a mens size 11 but received a womens size 5-8 . very disappionted
 For the second time I have ordered these socks from FootSmart . And for the second time Footsmart sent my socks the WRONG HOUSE . I will never order from them again . I will have to find another seller of these socks . I called Footsmart and they told me it was Amazons fault for sendthing them the wrong address . Then I call amazon who has the correct address.Im so sick of this run around . I was to go on vacation and take the socks with me . Not now .
 I bought these recently after loving the `` real thing '' for a few years.When I say the `` real thing '' - I mean my original Hanes Tagless boxers that are 100 % cotton and are marked `` Made is Thailand . '' These are 75 % cotton and 25 % polyester and they just do n't feel the same . -LRB- These say `` Made in Laos '' -RRB- Also , the `` Tagless '' tag is SCRATCHY !!!! My old ones were not scratchy . It 's the worst ever - a tag that is supposed to be comfortable , but it scratches you , and you ca n't cut it off because it 's printed on the boxers ! yikes!I 'm looking now for the old style 100 % cotton made in Thailand and when I find them I will stock up ! -LRB- I guess they know how to print the non-scratchy tags in Thailand . -RRB-
 The waistband in these was very narrow and rolled over making them uncomfortable after only a few hours wear - they went back .
 Once again Hanes has messed with a winner - this new batch is much thinner material and feels cheap - but worse than that , they changed the cut - now the crotch hangs down super low and is uncomfortable - after trying them for a few days , I threw them all away -
 In my size , 40 '' waist , the waistband rolls down while wearing these boxers . If you are super thin , this may work for you , but if you 're overwight forget it .
 Do n't get me wrong - these things are COMFY . However , when I wear them they feel like I 'm wearing a pair of shorts . They 're very big and the elastic is weak , so they do not like to stay up .
 I know this product is boxer , but we 've had a horrible experience with the boxer briefs , same material & same manufacturer . This is what happened.Do not buy these , I wish I had not thrown the money away on these . Originally when I bought these for my husband he really enjoyed them . I even went so far as to order a second package of 4 , especially when I saw the price decrease . SO SORRY I DID . Original purchases early 2012 - it is now August . He absolutely can not -LRB- not to be confused with will not -RRB- wear these any more . The first 2 months were fine - he really liked them a lot ; very comfortable and glad he changed from the regular briefs he had been wearing for years , usually Hanes brand . I followed washing instructions to the letter . He said after a couple months the elastic was no longer holding up . First
 This was much bigger and heavier than expected ; virtually no different than the regular `` NON-Flat '' folding umbrellas . I was expecting the small , light ones that were in the stores.I 'm sure as an umbrella it 's fine .
 So I rarely review anything online , but I really just wanted to say few things about this bra.so someone else does n't get caught out.im a 38d with a 27 waist so im just big on top . . and I can not get over d reviews by people with bigger bust than me , dunno how they were supported by this bra.it is honestly for me anyway , was a glorified shelf tank top , absolutely no support total bounce and just very light.sports bras arent supposed to be VERY comfortable so I knew once I put it on that it was n't gona be much use for running.i log 35 + miles a wk , its prob good for yoga etc low impact sports.i would highly recommend the Juno great great bra for running or the enell 100 , this is only my experience but I have it now and ca n't return it so tis a bit of a waste.good luck gals .

 I 'm so confused . I thought this was a supportive sports bra for C 's and up ??? I needed another sports bra for my high cardio workouts , and contemplated buying this for the longest time -LRB- I have previously bought a moving comfort racerback bra that I love but is now no where to be found -RRB- and seeing that there was over 300 reviews figured it would be awesome ! Bought my regular bra size , which fits great and I love the non-racerback/velcro straps design , but here 's the thing . When you say a sports bra is supportive , I 'm thinking supportive under the bust and it keeps the ladies from BOUNCING . One of of two ai n't bad right ? It 's definitely supportive under the bust , but the bouncing ? I was simply trying it on and jumped up a down a couple times , and I could n't handle all the bouncing . Oh and it 's barely lined ! So beware ! Because if it 's cold in the room , others will definitely know . This is definitely going back .
 I wanted to love it . . all the glowing reviews gave me immense hope . Seriously , I do n't understand the attraction . Wish I had returned it , instead of giving it the chance it did n't deserve . : -LRB- It 's awful !! 1 . Offers very little support and zero bounce control .2 . Flimsy . No structure whatsoever .3 . A limp , shapeless piece of fabric .4 . Cups are strange and loose .5 . Bottom band shifts out of shape in the front , turning and twisting .6 . It 's very noticeable under tee shirts.I measured carefully , per instructions . The result was my usual bra size . That 's what I ordered and it 's so oversized ! The cups seem huge.Bummer .
 Tried this bra . I am a DD , and this was not nearly supportive enough while running . Also , the straps adjust at the front/shoulders , and that extra bit of fabric really rubbed on my skin , and a week later I still have actual scabs from it . I would highly recommend going with the Enell sports bra , it is so worth the extra money .
 Fits well , does not hold breast in place and the bottom seam rolls.Feels uncomfortable . You have to keep unrolling all day.Straps are nice .
 I 've been looking for a new sports bra and when I researched this one , it sounded like just the ticket . I 'm a little over 50 and wear a 34DD . The bra is well made and comfortable , but there really is n't much support . It may be enough for a younger woman or someone with small breasts , but it did n't work for me at all . Darn it , I loved the green !
 I wear a 34D bra , and ordered this in the same size . The bra was ok in the band measurement , but the cup size was a B , at most . It was ridiculously tiny and also weirdly centered . If your breasts grow out of your sternum , I suppose this will work . This was definitely not a size D or C bra . It was labeled 34D but in actuality must have been a B to be this tiny . Returning . Disappointed . All 3 bras I bought from this brand are going right back and I am never buying from them again . Stick to Nike , Under Armour , Adidas .
 I bought it because Im large chested and the elastic band keeps twisting and curling . Not happy with the purchase : -LRB-
 After hearing all the great things about this bra , I bought it for running and was excited to give it a try . Boy was I greatly diappointed . This bra is flimsy and did not provide any support . I 'm only a 36B , I do n't know how anyone larger could like this bra . My old Champion bras give much better support . I returned this bra , the material was thin , provided no modesty coverage and had no support . I ca n't see how it 's rated to be a high support bra for running .
 I have another sports bra like this but this one is not very good - the way the straps are built rub against my inside shoulder . Also the back end adjustable strap is too clunky and also rubs . No way I could wear this for a long run - which is why I bought it as a marathoner .
 There is nothing good about this bra . It does n't move , true . It flattens , true . Does it do that well?NO !!! To use a common metaphor , the headlights are still on and visible . If it worked for others , I 'm glad . Me ? No ! Wished I had returned it .
 I would not recommend this sports bra . After trying the Maia and Juno , I was very disappointed in this sports bra . The straps are kind of bulky and did n't line up very well . I did not find this sports bra to be very supportive and it seemed awkward to adjust .
 I read the reviews and ended up ordering this bra . I 'm a 40D - this thing was not comfortable at all . Sure it had support but I ended up returning it .
 Mia bra has so much more support . Did n't realize this one did not have underwire . Gives you a uni-boob . Thought I 'd try it to see if this was any cooler but it is n't . Would not recommend this for any high impact aerobics . Mia does not let you move an inch & keeps you from having uni-boob . Wish they would come up with a seamless version , though . But , this is better than a regular bra for sports & it does hook in the back . One thing to be careful , though , is the velcro strap adjustments . Get them precise or the velcro will rub your arm pit area .
 Two years ago I bought this bra for my grand daughter who plays volleyball and she loved it because it gave her good support and no bounce -LRB- 38DD -RRB- . The new lining is n't as good as it once was and therefore she wanted me to return it and look for a bra with more support . I am disappointed with the changes to a once great sports bra .
 No molded cups . . so this can not be a high impact support bra . . it 's ugly w / o cups . . color is as shown . .
 I read that this bra fit small but I did n't really expect it to be as small as it was . I wear a 34C on the loosest hook so I ordered a 34C and when I recieved it , I was disappointed to find that it did n't fit well at all . I could do it up but it was n't comfortable . Reading other reviews , I thought it would have more padding then it did . Even though my boobs were pancaked , due to the fact the bra was too small , the bra still showed headlights . The adjustable straps is a great feature but I do n't think I 'll be ordering this bra again in a different size .
 For me , this was way too tight . I 've never had a 40D bra be this tight . I 'm all for support but this was just constricting and uncomfortable and so I 'll send it back . I 'm really disappointed because if it were just a tad bigger in the band I would have kept it . I 'm not quite sure how this can be considered a size 40 .
 Seemed well built , but not true to size order bigger than you are . cup size OK but around smaller than regular bras .
 This style/make of bra is not for a full figured woman . There was no support at all for a 44D/DD size . Needs more padding/support .
 I found immediately after putting it on that the adjustment velcro on each strap was very uncomfortable . They are located in the front of the bra , and felt like two big bulges pushing in underneath each side of my collarbone . I have heard great things about MovingComfort , so I do n't think it means their other bras are unpleasant . I just found out that this one would n't work for me .
 I bought this in my normal size 38D but it is too big . I will keep it anyway because I do n't want to hassle with an online return/exchange when I am not sure what my correct size should be in this bra . I have to wear this on the last set of hooks and put the straps up as high as they will go , then it is okay for strength training and low impact cardio , but the fit is still too loose to support high impact activities . The other thing I do n't like is that the material is very slippery , so it is hard to fasten the hooks . On a positive note , the colors are beautiful . I got the mojito , which is a nice bright green . A lot of sites only offer basic black or white , so you may need to shop around to find the pretty colors .
 I usually do n't take the time to write reviews , but I do n't want anyone else who is looking for a supportive sports bra to waste there money . This bra offers no support at all ! I bought this bra for my daily walks hoping it would offer me average support . All I can say is that It offers NO support at all . I can say that It is comfortable , that is if your looking for a bra to wear while sitting on the couch . However if you actually need support because your active , KEEP on looking this is NOT the bra you want . People who gave this bra positive reviews must have implants or have never had children .
 To start off , I returned the Moving Comfort Fiona Bra . The material is very thin -LRB- 2 layers thin -RRB- . Fiona has absolutely NO nipple coverage . There are no ` cups ' in this sports bra . Secondly , yes it does have adjustable straps , but they are velcro and fasten under the straps . I like to do a mix of excercises , but mostly cardio . I tried doing jumping jacks with this sports bra on . It offerd moderate support , the ladies did some bouncing . I did n't feel like there was enough lift or support for high impact activity . I am a 36-38C and ordered a 38C . It had an ok fit . Not too tight , but not too loose either . -LRB- That is with it fastened as tight as it would go . -RRB- If I were going to keep it , I think a 36C would fit better . Overall , it is fine if you do n't mind nipple show , a few bounces , and the velcro straps . If you want compression and minimal bounce , take a pass .
 I loved this sports bra . However , the last time I washed it the clasp end of the back had completely melted ! The bra is now completely useless .
 I bought this bra after reading all the great reviews and have to say I am very disappointed . The bra is very well made and fits comfortably , although you have to take care to get the velcro on the straps lined up perfectly to prevent it digging into your shoulders . If I was just wearing it for walking it would be fine , but I wore it to a Zumba class and it was anything but okay . First of all , I was bouncing all over the place . The worst part though was that when I took it off after the class , I had never seen such a wet bra . So much for the wicking material . Even my old compression bras keep me drier . In short , not for high impact and not for women who sweat when they work out .
 I bought this based on past reviews but am disappointed . It is extremely difficult to get on and off . I read earlier reviews commenting on this but thought how hard could a bra be ? Well , it is difficult to fasten once on and even harder when you are sweaty . It also cuts into my arm pit on my left side . I have never spent this much money on a sports bra and regret doing so .
 If you 're a petite woman , I do not recommend this bra . To achieve any control of the bouncing at all , I had to pull the straps so tight , that the bra almost cuts into my armpits , because it 's sides are too wide .
 My Moving Comfort Cara works beautifully for yoga , running , and backpacking . When I tried to order another Cara , the seller sent a Fiona instead . I tried it out to be fair . Unfortunately , it felt like a grudge against my breasts
 I ca n't see how this bra is any better than much less expensive ones that pull on over your head , in fact , not as good . I stiil had the same old uni-boob problem and they 're still bouncy , only more in tandem . It did n't seem as secure as the pull-on types . I ordered a Glamorise Sports bra at the same time which is bulit more like a regular bra , only with enhanced structural details . It was much more secure , very minimal bouncing , and without uni-boob .
 I have read such positive reviews on this style of bra , that I had to give it a try . I have the Moving Comfort Maia , and absolutely love it . It is an under-wire style and does the job so much better . I am returning this bra , and plan to stick to under-wire styles from now on .
 I returned this . Even though I ordered the same size I ordinarily would for a sports bra , it was a very strange fit . The band was fine , but the cups were too big . I 've had trouble with this brand before & will not bother trying any of their other styles .
 At first I really liked the bra , it definitely holds my DDs in place , but it puts SO much pain and pressure on my shoulders . I only wear it in moments of desperation now : -LRB-
 I figured this HAD to be a great bra with all of the glowing reviews from other busty ladies , but it failed to deliver . Not comfortable , does not support well and just creates a big `` uniboob '' look like all other sports bras . Go with the Champion Powerback if you are looking for support , lift and separation in a sports bra and you have large breasts .
 Bra fit well , but it did n't provide enough support . When I tried it on , there was as much bounce as if I were wearing a regular bra -- not a sports bra . I would not recommend this bra for high or even medium impact sports .
 I own two Maia 's by Moving Comfort so I tried this one out when I found it on sale . It does n't have underwire , I had total uniboob . The band at the bottom would n't stay put , it kept rolling up a bit . I bought a 38C , the same as I wear in the Maia , but the weird uniboob look is just too unflattering . I may try wearing a regular bra underneath , but I never do that with the Maia . I would n't wear it unless my other two are n't clean .
 not the same fit as others of the same brand , model purchased the same size . Factory defect ? You tell me . ran larger than normal
 i 'm actually not a 32B but am a 30B/C , and got this thinking , sports bras are usually too tight so why not try the next size up ? well , this was so tight i had to return it . i could barely breathe with it on , and it squashed my chest without supporting it . felt like one of those chest-binder things . the good
 Despite the Moving Comfort &#34; bra finder &#34; on their website giving this bra as an option for a 40DD doing high impact activities such as running , I found this bra to be almost completely lacking in support . By the end of my run , I was clutching my boobs in my hands to keep them from knocking me unconscious.Additionally , the lining is only stitched to the body of the bra at the edges , so after wear , the bottom band has rolled up so much that the lining is all but hiding the main fabric.It looks like Enell is going to be my next stop .
 I was fairly disappointed with this bra . The materials are good quality and construction is clean -LRB- no weak seams , loose threads -RRB- , but bounce control was n't optimal and some of its `` features '' actually hurt a bit . I usually use two fairly cheap compression sports bras and can achieve minimal movement with them . This bra felt like 1.5 of those bras and cost about 2x more . The straps are looped through a slit at the top edge of the front of the bra and are secured by Velcro . You adjust them by unlatching them , pulling them tighter , and reattaching to the Velcro strip . This system is far inferior to the normal sliding adjustment most bras have . The straps dig into my skin at the point of attachment , and by the end of a workout those two spots on my chest are really sore.Pros : Good materialsGood constructionCons : Straps hurtStrap adjustment system is badBounce control is just so-so given the price
 Bought this sports bra in a 32D based on reviews that said it is `` true to VS sizes '' , but I did not find this to be true . My VS size is 32D , but the cup size on this bra is huge . I plan on returning it , but I 'm debating going down to a B or C cup size -LRB- it 's really that big -RRB- . Chest size fits perfect though . I do love that it functions like a regular bra with the back closure since I do the `` sports bra hop '' to get out of my other MC bras . I just ca n't give it a better rating because I ca n't wear it in the size I got .
 Found out after I was sent an email that the product had been shipped that it was on backorder and was refunded my money . I should have never been able to order it if it was on backorder .
 I love this bra , it 's made extremely well and i was excited to find it in my small band but semi-large cup size . But I returned it , bcuz the only reason I chose this bra was because the description said it had molded cups . It does n't . I tried it on and had MAJOR `` poke thru '' and that 's just not cute . I 'd never leave the house like that so Unfortunately I returned it . had it had molded cups -LRB- like the description said it did -RRB- , I would hve kept it and it would hve been easily a 4 star , maybe 5 .
 If you are larger in the bust area and do high impact aerobics , this bra is not for you ! It does n't look good either . It does not create a separation between your bust . I thought I had finally found a good sports bra , and once I received it in the mail and tried it one , I was so disappointed .
 this sports bra has okay support , however there is nothing to cover up how cold you are ... The adjustable sraps are weird , I guess you could get use to it , but the straps are secured with velcro which if I remember correctly from the 80 's does not last very long .
 It was small in & tight u would need almost 2 sizes bigger , I 'm a 38c but this was no way close ,
 This item is not like what being sold years ago . Only one key is shipped instead of the normal 2 keys that are provided for door locks , padlocks , motor vehicles , etc. . A cheap plastic lock is used instead of the older metal-style locks ; so , why need a key at this point . It has 2 wheels built in to the bottom . Wheels may work for some suitcases but will they hold up well for the heavier load that a footlocker would normally hold for going to college . The item is made of a material that is not as strong as the older styles . There should really be a good handle on each side of the footlocker for carrying purposes instead of just one on the non-wheel side . I know after one year of use , I 'll either have repairs to do or replace it with another one . This is one of the things where older ideas beat out newer ideas .
 I 've had this for over a year now . I bought it looking for wind protection and am very disappointed with the breathability of this product . It traps moisture inside and I end up with a visibly damp shirt and have to turn the jacket inside out to dry . That 's what happens in dry weather . The fit is comfortable and it 's otherwise conveniently designed . The fabric in white is quite see-through . Later I purchased Turfer 's `` Womens 's Light Weight Endurance Jacket '' for $ 14.95 and that 's been the perfect windbreaker . It 's now up to $ 19.95 and I 'm ordering another color .
 Have worn these bras for years . Quality was wonderful . Recent purchase however was really disappointing . Fabric no longer soft . Workmanship poor . Huge label sewn in side where it would have to be removed in order to wear this bra . Checked label . Now made in china . So this is why the quality has disintegrated . So , I will look for a new line of bras to try . Price the same , quality is all that has changed . Really uncomfortable like the cheap cheap bras .
 This bra was nothing like the shine on bras I 've purchased in stores . It was very tight , and the material was very scratchy . I do n't even know if I can wear it ! It 's too uncomfortable .
 This is the cheapest umbrella I 've ever owned . I ordered thinking that it might withstand the wind . When I received it in the mail , it has a powder all over the inside of it that I had to try to scrub off . Most of it would not come off and the first time I used it , it broke . If I could rate it with 0 stars I would . I would tell anyone out there thinking of ordering this umbrella to look elsewhere .
 I loved the idea of this umbrella - clear , so you can pull it down and still be able to see where you 're going . I commute by bus every day in Chicago , so good gear is essential . But on my second day of use on a semi-windy , rainy day , the metal pieces that flare open the umbrella bent beyond repair and now the umbrella is useless ! And it was n't even a true windy day in Chicago . Maybe it 's fine if you live in a place with no wind ...
 Should have listened to the other reviews . Umbrella broke 5 minutes after my son opened it . The wires holding umbrella open are very soft and bent out of shape in 5 minutes . Now the umbrella will not stay open.Total waste of money
 It broke the first time my wife used it -- after two blocks in a drizzle . What a disappointment ! It looks nice , but that 's about it . Do n't waste your money !
 the color of the shirt was totally different from the swatch . . I did n't like it all
 Spanx super footless bodyshaping pantyhose looks great , they can make an average outfit become cute and sexy But the quality is mediocre after been gently worn for 3 times they ripped . I 'm am still a spanx customer but not for this particular item . Save your money the spanx super footless bodyshaping pantyhose are expensive and mediocre all that is has going for it shelf is the sheer in the bottom .
 One of them was much shorter and had a hole ripped at the bottom , and the material was flimsy compared to the heavy duty zipper , it made them very VERY uncomfortable , and not to mention tacky because of the different lengths on them . I do not recommend it .
 Although inexpensive , I was not impressed with the quality of this hat . There was glue hanging from the plastic star attached to the front of the hat .
 Very disappointed . Did not fit grandson 's head at all . But -- you get what you pay for and this was cheap . Recommend getting a better one and spend a little more money .
 I bought this for my husband as a gift . I washed it before giving it to him . He found 2 holes in it . I would not buy this item again . It was over priced for the quality . P. Johnson
 This is a scratchy robe that looks cheap . I tried to return the item but the company does not pay shipping returns . I paid $ 30 in shipping and still do not have what I needed for a gift .
 As a one-click shopper on Amazon I was shocked to see that Triathlete store.com charged me $ 7.95 for shipping . The belt was $ 7.95 and arrived in a shipping bag by Firtst-Calss Parcel Mail . Now to top off the outrageous price of $ 15.90 the belt arrived missing one snap . To return it means my time and additional shipping cost for a piece of elastic . No thanks I 'll eat the $ 15.90 and never purchase from Triathlete Store.com again . I suggest you do the same .
 These burp cloths are attractive which was why I chose them , but they are impractical for their purpose . They are too small and fall off my shoulder when I drape them to burp my daughter . I would opt for something larger .
 I bought this as a gift and it was too big . so order a size smaller . I also was disapointed that they didnt refund me all my money . I paid to send it back and all they credited me was 28.00 . I would not order from them again .
 I have now ordered three Kangol caps -LRB- and returned two -RRB- because it 's impossible to tell what color these items are online . What color -- pray tell , is `` Storm '' -LRB- actually blue -RRB- ? Online , it looks gray . What color is `` Amazon '' -LRB- actually green -RRB- ? Online , it looks gray . There is no cap marked `` gray , '' which is the color most people wear .
 In Chicago the winters are cold . This hat is wool but has no lining . The cap I did buy does have one .
 This must be a knock off , the printing inside the hat is coming off on my head ! do n't buy it .
 This was a very disappointing purchase . I bought this for my husband for Christmas and when we opened the box , we were surprised to see a bright yellow hat . The picture was very deceiving.The picture is more mellow in color . So proceed with caution when ordering .
 I like my summer kangol cap , thought i would try one of they 're wool caps . Well , I could n't be more let down . First , it 's not wool-it 's a funky-itchy heavy fleece material w / elastic headband . This is not a $ 40 cap , not worth a penny over $ 10 , if i had seen it - i would not even considered it , it 's a joke . It 's a rip-off , I 'm done with Kangol - they 're not the same since 2011 .
 Not woven wool like Kangol hats I 've owned in the past . Quite frankly it just looks like it was cut from a cheap surplus wool blanket . Guess I 'll just use my old worn out woven Kangol hat .
 Color seems wrong , does not quite resemble the young people with the work in general , the general shape ... Some thin

 The outside of the Buxton wallet is nice leather , like others I have owned . Inside -LRB- change pocket and flap covering area where pictures or credit cards are stored feels and looks like plastic . Disappointed in Buxton .
 Purchased this to replace my 20 year old ALL LEATHER buxton wallet . Disappointed because the inside of this wallet is vinyl , only the outside is leather . I ca n't imagine the vinyl change purse area lasting very long compared to an all leather wallet .

 I 've read reviews about the red not being color-fast ; I would n't have bought it but I have n't been able to use it because its way too big and its ridiculously floppy .
 We tried this and the Flap Happy Sun Hat and ended up returning this one . The brim is too floppy , so my baby hated it.The Flap Happy hat was all around better for only about 3 bucks more
 I really wanted this hat to work . It fit my 14 month old boy just fine and offers good sun protection , but it looks like a cute ruffled girls hat and the brim flips backward in any sort of wind and offers no sun protection once that happens . It 's going back .
 Pros
 This hat was disappointing . After another 6-12 month hat was too small for my 8 mo old , I ordered this one , but it is too big and constantly covers my daughter 's face . The brim is so floppy , it does n't stay folded up . It 's funny on her , but pretty useless as a hat .
 Buyer beware - this hat is not color fast ! I 'm not sure how this company can justify manufacturing a sun hat with non-colorfast dye that will be used by children around sweat and water . The very first time my daughter wore this hat it bled all over her shirt where the brim touched it . It took me a while to realize that it was the hat that had caused it . I could n't really believe that it would have been made so poorly but rinsed it in the sink anyway just to see . The first time I rinsed it , red colored water just flowed from it . Ridiculous that something made for children would n't be made color fast , especially a sun hat!Positives are that the chin tie allows it be fairly adjustable and that the brim is wide.However , the negative of the fact that I can never trust that the color wo n't bleed all over my daughter 's clothes makes it unlikely that I will ever actually use this hat .
 I like that this hat blocks the sun . However , if you are using it for the purpose of blocking the sun , it is probably hot . My daughter screamed after wearing it for a few minutes . when I took the hat off - her whole head was sweaty . it does n't allow air to breathe . I recommend not wasting your money and purchasing a cotton breathable hat instead .
 I bought this in summer 2010 for my baby , born in August . I purchased the 0-6 month size but it was way too huge for her . Although the toggle in the headband makes it appear that it would be adjustable , in fact the headband is stitched in place where the toggle is attached , so it 's impossible to adjust the size . Total waste of money .

There is no cap marked `` gray , '' which is the color most people wear .
 In Chicago the winters are cold . This hat is wool but has no lining . The cap I did buy does have one .
 This must be a knock off , the printing inside the hat is coming off on my head ! do n't buy it .
 This was a very disappointing purchase . I bought this for my husband for Christmas and when we opened the box , we were surprised to see a bright yellow hat . The picture was very deceiving.The picture is more mellow in color . So proceed with caution when ordering .
 I like my summer kangol cap , thought i would try one of they 're wool caps . Well , I could n't be more let down . First , it 's not wool-it 's a funky-itchy heavy fleece material w / elastic headband . This is not a $ 40 cap , not worth a penny over $ 10 , if i had seen it - i would not even considered it , it 's a joke . It 's a rip-off , I 'm done with Kangol - they 're not the same since 2011 .
 I bought this as a gift and it was too big . so order a size smaller . I also was disapointed that they didnt refund me all my money . I paid to send it back and all they credited me was 28.00 . I would not order from them again .
 The item pictured looks NOTHING like the item I actually received ! The item I received has a large Vaio logo on the front , there is no brown to be found and is in every way completely different from the picture . Make sure you trust the vendor prior to ordering !

 Not woven wool like Kangol hats I 've owned in the past . Quite frankly it just looks like it was cut from a cheap surplus wool blanket . Guess I 'll just use my old worn out woven Kangol hat .
 Color seems wrong , does not quite resemble the young people with the work in general , the general shape ... Some thin
 I had these sent to my son who works in a warehouse with no air . He said they really did not work ... at all . Then a week later I find the exact product at Dollar Tree.Boy do I feel bamboozled ! Save your money on these . Go to your nearest sporting good store and get Frog Togs !! They are awesome ! They get freezing cold and do not leave your skin or clothes wet . P.S. I bought the Dollar Tree product myself to see if maybe my son did not activate the cooling beads or work them into the path along the headband properly.I did and it still only cooled -LRB- barely -RRB- for about 5 mins plus left my forehead damp . YUCK
 The bag itself is well made with easy opening/closing pockets . I liked the three smaller pockets in addition to the large main compartment . But the straps are very short . I 'm only 5 ' 7 '' and 160 # , but I can not get this on with both shoulder straps . It could work ok hung over one shoulder if load is lighter and shorter trip . It 's getting convert to a tool bag .
 I have on pair of Khaki Wrangler Rugged Wear that I bought in 2008 , and I 'm amaze by the quality of the pants.Because of that , I decided to buy two more pairs of Wrangler Rugged Wear , one black and one navy blue , and they ripped badly in less than 5 wears.The second time I wore the black ones , I sat at my desk as I normally do every day , suddenly I felt the pants ripping off from the back.The blue ones did the same thing one month later.I can say that the Khaki ones that I bought around 4 YEARS AGO , are still amazing ; the three pair of pants are the exact very same size , but not the very same quality.STAY AWAY FROM THIS BRAND .
 The pants were comfortable , plenty of room in the seat but suddenly after wearing them a few times the seat just rips horizontally . I could understand if the seam popped but no , just a straight line across your rear explodes open when you sit down .
 These pants have a tendency to split horizontally for almost no reason at all . If they split alont the seam that would be one thing but to ctross a seam and just practically explode even when they fit loosely can only mean rotten fabric and that is what you will get when you buy these . I have lost the 3 pairs I biught to the self same calamity and always in public . Please save yourself the trouble . By the way the Lee version of these pants also do the same thing . Be afraid be very afraid .
 Very disappointed with this pair of Apple Bottoms ! I have several pairs and this one is not worth it . Neither the product description nor the pictures on the website give you a very close look at the jeans . Some of the `` special details '' make it seem as if the item were damaged . It does n't look cool !
 These snapped pretty easily , but they did as they advertise . They are just basic clear straps . After they snapped I gave them to my cat as a toy .
 My wife ordered TWO sets of these and only received one and can find nobody to report this to .
 First of all , there was nothing wrong with the quality of the product . However , the sizing is anyone 's guess ! I will say that I ordered a small because that 's what I am and have been for years . There was NO POSSIBLE hope of squeezing into this VERY TIGHT slip without a trip to the emergency room . I returned it . I 'm a size 2 dress/pant , XS/Small blouse type girl and I 'm worried even the medium might be too small ! ORDER AT LEAST A SIZE UP .
 I looked at the other reviews for this product and decided it would be worth a try . I was wrong . I can fit into size small usually with no problem , I ordered a medium just to be safe and I could barely get it on ! I tried pulling it over my head and it got stuck at my shoulders , pulling it up over my hips was a horrible experience as well . Taking it OFF however was the worst part.I was n't disappointed with just the sizing . I expected the bra part to be flattering not FLATTENING . I wish I had known this before I purchased it . I returned the item and decided it would be better to order somewhere else .
 I understand this is shapewear , but does it have to be so uncomfortable ? This is the first time I tried shapewear so I am not sure if they are all like this , or if it is just this particular brand . And I did buy the right size .
 I bought the Alexander sweatshirt . The quality is substandard . The shoulders are off and the product is basically irregular ! Although the company 's statement shows that they accept returns and exchanges , after I received the item , I discovered that they do not either exchange or return because the item is considered a personal item -LRB- despite the fact that they have these items in stock -RRB- .

 Just going to list the issues
 Be aware that these run small - At least by a size or more . And they 're straight leg , not boot cut , so there 's a bit of a taper at the ankle .
 I 've been buying Dickies , particularly the 874 's for over 20 years and I was n't impressed with these ones at all . . While the item was clearly marked as a Dickies product , it did n't look or feel like any pair of Dickies I 've ever bought before.The material seemed very thin , and the pants had no factory crease . . Live and learn . .
 i ordered gray and they sent green . GREEN , come on guys really ? at least they were the right size . well done
 I remember when I was a teenager Dickies would last forever ; nowadays they fall apart pretty quickly . I think they must be cutting costs on quality control ...
 I had a pair of Dickies fall apart after a month . Then they would n't honor the warranty . Shady company and now making crap products .
 The pants have so much wrong with them , plus they look awful . It is my guess that dickies enjoys making money at the expense of the customer , both by making them pay too much for them and making them look stupid wearing them .1 . -RRB- CARDBOARD PANTS . They are STIFF . Wash them 100 times and I guarantee you they will still feel like cardboard .2 . -RRB- They are so tapered they barely fit over any boots you wear . Your feet look enormous next to these skinny pants . NO ROOM !! 3 . -RRB- They ride so high on your waist it is uncomfortable4 . -RRB- They are n't sized properly , a 36 is a 34 , 34 is 32 etc. ... STAY AWAY .
 Waist is not true to size just like many dickies products , its better if you just go to a store and try them on first
 These pants , for me , where a bit tighter than I thought it would be , also stiffer and smaller than I had hoped .
 My husband always wears 36 30 . He has several Dickie pants ... I got 874 which were the wrong ones . They were stiff and small . I had to return and now pay postage beause they were part of another order making over $ 25 . Also had to go to UPS and post and will have return postage taken out of refund ... My mistake and I paid for it
 for no apparent reason these are humongous . my bf currently wears 32x32 which are a bit short and a bit tight on him so we tried to go a size up - but for some reason these were ginormous !
 my boyfriend currently wears 32x32s that were getting a bit tight and a bit long on him . for some reason these in 34x34 were ridiculously huge ! Returned
 These pants are fake no tags fake packaging.the zipper was broke.I work in 874s for over 25 years an I know how they look an feel an these look an feel &#34; FAKE &#34;
 I generally wear a 38x30 , and that 's what I bought in these , they are sized quite a bit smaller in the waste . I 'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in , but you may want to get a waste size up . I 'll be wearing them in a dress office setting , and I 'm surprised how good these look , hopefully they last a long time too .

 My handle has broken in 2 ways - The screws came completely out and i had to replace them with longer ones and glue . AND my handle wo n't fully retract out of its frame and so the handle is not long enough to pull behind you.Otherwise I like the bag - its size and the quietness of the wheels but i wish it was more durable .
 This bag has two -LRB- 2 -RRB- major flaws . -LRB- 1 -RRB- The wheel base is made of molded plastic which is riveted on the the sides . When I received my bag the plastic casing around the left and right side rivet holes were clearly cracked . This appears to be a design flaw and the actual cracking most likely occurred during manufacture when the rivets were punched . Because this is a definite weak point in the bag , even if it had not been damaged during manufacture it would most likely crack during normal use . -LRB- 2 -RRB- There is not enough padding for the computer compartment ... especially between the handle and computer compartment . Therefore , if the bag is dropped or subjected to a moderate jolt your computer could suffer damage that would not occur in a better manufactured bag . Bottom line ... spend a few extra bucks and get a bag that will protect your computer and last more than a few trips .
 The product runs very small . It 's also very cheaply and badly made . The elastic that holds up the shoe around the ankles is barely sewn in . There is no return label . You have to call them or contact them to find out how to return the item . When I called to return it because it was too small , the rep told me that not only I have to pay for the return but they will charge me a 25 % restocking fee . Spare yourself , and do n't do business with them .

 Just going to list the issues
 My son received this costume for his 4th birthday . It 's absolutely not worth -LSB- ... -RSB- . Very cheaply constructed and the mask does n't fit properly . It also runs very small . My son wears a 3T and this costume sized 4-6 fit him perfectly . Look elswhere for a spiderman costume ; it ca n't be worse than this one .
 My 4 1/2 year old boy was so delighted when we ordered this Spiderman costume . I ordered it large as I thought they might run a bit small and I want him to wear it for a while . He is a 4T and I got the size 7-10 . The 7-10 outfit barely fits him although it is extremely long in the arms and legs . The mask does not fit his head and barely fits his 2 year old brother . The crotch seam ripped out after 2 days of playing - only about 2 hours of wear each day and the cuffs are `` running '' . I have not sent it back since he is upset that he would be without it . Purchase a costume from another company - you will be glad that you did .
 I wish I would 've read the reviews before buying this costume . It is made of extremely cheap material and I have had to sew it already in the 1st week . It is made for a child to only wear once . Definitely not worth the price I paid for it . I wish I would have just bought material and made my own .
 First off you can buy this cheaper at Walmart ! Save yourself some money , because the costume is cheap . The mask is too small . The costume really is not something that is going to last , so if you want it to be more then just Halloween night you might not want to consider this costume . We bought it this morning and the costume already has runs in it .
 He wore the costume twice and it has a hole under the arm and a hole in the crotch . Very cheaply made
 My grandson wore it the first night of Halloween & by the time we got home it had started coming apart .
 This item show a full face mask along with the muscle shirt , I too did not read the reviews before I purchased ... Wish I did ... Kid hates it , wont wear . .
 My son LOVES Spiderman . I purchased this costume last week . It is nine days later and the costume is falling apart . By the third wear , holes and fraying occurred . I have sewn it back together at least five times . It is horrible . The costume itself is poorly made . It is thin nylon material with a mask that looks nothing like the one in the picture.Do not waste your money , the costume will not last past the first wearing .
 Was very disappointed in this costume . Admittedly , only find a problem with one aspect - so far . But if you show me a picture of what the product looks like ... THEN THAT IS WHAT IT SHOULD BE !!!!! The mask on the toddler size of this costume is only half a mask . It is a cap of sorts with pieces that hang down over the eyes . It does not cover the face or ears !! Would never have chosen this costume if the correct picture had been shown !
 Although my son LOVES this costume and plays with it all the time , I am not happy with it at all . It is VERY cheaply made . Within one day of use , the seams started to rip and fray . The material it is made out of runs easily -LRB- like nylons do -RRB- . I suppose it 's my fault for not reading the reviews more carefully . If your child will only wear this once , then it is a perfect costume , but if he wants to `` live '' in it then I would recommend investing in something a little more durable .
 Very bad version of Spiderman Costume for kids . Unfinished . I did not like it . It is like used it . I did not like it . I will not buy any products like this again .
 I just want to recommend them . They are very serious , responsible , and punctual . I bought a wrong product , and they apologize with me and return all my money.In the future , I will use them .
 Yelp , I guarantee this costume will rip on the 1st day of play . It is really cheaply made . It 's the same cheap costumes that you find in walmart for 7-10 bucks . And I had to cut out a nose and mouth it does n't give them a place to breath out of . YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR so do n't pay over 10 bucks for this temporary costume
 Product is nice but if you buy it make sure to run to the store and get some safety pins as the tiny patch of Velcro does not stay secure and the whole costume comes forward causing children to trip
 I purchased this costume for my little boy who absolutely loves trains and Thomas . The costume came and arrived fast however there was no hat included and it was very bulky and only sat on the shoulders there were no ties or anything to keep the costume from coming off . Not a completely bad product just was n't what we were expecting .
 This might work for many kids , but my 21-month old son did n't like the apron-like style of the costume . Having it hanging down in front of his knees just slowed him down when we tried it on . The hat is cute , but he did n't want to keep it on . We 're returning it and getting something that allows for more movement .
 I expected the costume to be made of fabric , but it is made of thin material , almost like foam/paper , and does not look durable . The hat is even thinner -LRB- like surgery cap -RRB- . It 's fine for an evening of trick or treat and for pictures . My son seems to like it .
 I read a few of the reviews describing this thing as cheap but thought `` What the heck - it 's just a Halloween costume '' . My oh my . This thing is CHEAP . And the hat looks NOTHING like the one in the photo . Probably not worth the money .
 I bought this because my son likes Thomas & Friends , but I could n't believe what a flimsy `` costume '' it was when I opened the package and took it out . The costume and that hat probably cost the distributor -LSB- ... -RSB- cents to make in China , and they sell it for close to $ -LSB- ... -RSB- retail . This is just capitalism at its worst , even after taking the necessity of licensing into account . I 'm taking it back to the local store .
 We bought this for our 3 year old son because he refused to be anything else for Halloween . After getting this product in the mail -LRB- 5 stars for shipping ! We received the item very quickly . -RRB- I 'm extremely disappointed in the quality , and the price . I 've seen this advertised for as little as $ 19.99 and as high as $ 32.99 when it should n't be priced any higher than maybe $ 9.99 . The material is hardly any stronger than that thin foam wrapping that is on new electronics when you take them out of their original boxes . Last year my son wore his costume several times because he loved it so much ... it was a $ 10 chicken costume . This year I 'll be surprised if we make it out of the house to go trick or treating before he rips this costume . Oh and the hat ... NOTHING like the one in the picture.About my ratings : I gave it a 5 for fun because my kid wants nothing other than to be Thomas for halloween and he 'll be SO excited to see his costume when we give it to him.I gave it a 1 for educational value for obvious reasons.I gave it a 1 for durability for the reasons I stated above.Overall I 'd give this costume a 2 .
 This costume was worn by my 7 year old grandson . It looks cool , but all the pads fell off . The strings broke and it was very frustrating to him . In fact he said he hated it because it was so clumsy . It 's a neat constume but the pads need to be better made for attaching . Also , the sword pictured would have been nice to go along with the costume .
 Looks cool but the plastic is very thin on the chest shield , leg and arm guards . The face plate velcroes on as does the shoulder pads which pop off too easily ! Every move my son made they were coming apart ! Too many pieces for an active boy to keep in place for any length of time ! This costume is cheaply made for the price!We were very disappointed in it !!!
 I wanted to love this shirt . I truly did . I was even excited for it to arrive . Then I washed it . The shirt shrunk but I decided I did n't care and wore it regardless of the new smaller size . Then the threads started to unravel . The right sleeve decided it wanted to detach itself from the shirt . Now it sits in a drawer , forgotten , all because I can not make myself throw a new shirt I wore three times in the trash . Did I mention I really wanted to like this shirt ? Find a new vendor guys !
 loved the series , movie ... started wearing a brown duster again ... no shirt , though . nope . no shirt at all . maybe the blue sun company intercepted the shipment .
 The mask shown in the picture is misleading and nothing like the mask received which is basically a very cheap plastic mask that only covers the face .
 Because of the packing the &#34; collar &#34; was folded in two spots , and it would n't hold a proper shape and would droop automatically . The fabric was okay , but still not very impressed .
 `` pleather `` quality not the greatest . price tag on product was less than the sale price through Amazon .
 the quality was great and it was neat to have all the pockets ; however , when I actually tried to close it , I was unsuccessful because it was just too small to accommodate the multi-pockets/slots . returned for full refund .
 I had this less than 2 weeks -LRB- recieved it as a birthday present from my husband -RRB- and one of the metal prongs that clasps the change purse broke off .
 I carry a medium sized handbag and this wallet was large and bulky . If you love big purses buy it , it 's roomy and the large size makes it easy to find . If you are like me and appreciate a mid-sized bag pass this choice up .
 This is a nice wallet until you put a ` few ' cards in it . The card holder inside is made of leather type material and when you add just 8 cards -LRB- which includes the drivers license , library card , 2 medical cards , AARP and towing cards-no charge cards -RRB- it becomes so bulgy that where it snaps the space is approx 1 1/2 inches apart and will grow if more cards are added . Sorry to say , I have gone back to my old wallet as this one just does not work out for me .
 The card slots in the wallet are too tight . You have to force the cards into the slots and then they are almost impossible to get out . I used the wallet less than a month and the sides were already tearing away . I 've gone back to by old wallet .
 DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!Here 's the email I wrote to Brands On Sale : > Hi , >> I ordered a Peter Pan costume from your company and did in fact receive a costume , but it is not what was described . >> - The tunic 's color does not match the image . > - The hat does n't fit . > - The tights are see-through , which does not match the image . > - The feather is green and not red . > - The rope belt is way shorter that what 's pictured . >> I just spoke to a customer service manager , about a the return . All she would offer was a 15 % discount for me to keep it . She refused a full refund because I tried it on . I tried to reason with her that there was no way for me to know if it fit or that the tights were appropriately opaque without trying it on . She still refused the refund and suggested that I file a claim with Amazon ! >> I completely understand the inability to resell the costume due to hygienic concerns . However , in order to avoid losing a new customer and possibly several more due to negative feedback , your company should just eat the cost and chalk it up a lack of due diligence in keeping product images up to date . >> I have already submitted a claim to Amazon , but will be happy to renege on it and will not leave negative feedback if you will please oblige my request . In fact , I would go as far as to leave positive feedback for the amicable resolution . >> I sincerely hope you understand where I 'm coming from as your potential customer and would very much appreciate your help in obtaining a full refund of $ 50 for order # *********** , which includes the return shipping . >> > I look forward to your response . >> Sincerely , > Jason HeathI did receive a response from the manager over Amazon sales and he said that '' ... it is in the best of interest of both of us to rely on the arbitration services provided by Amazon through their A-Z Guarantee Program ... `` We 'll guess what - Amazon agreed with me and refunded the entire amount plus shipping!I gave this company MORE than enough opportunity to do the right thing , but they simply refused . I rarely write reviews on anything , but after this experience , it would be an injustice to everyone considering patronage with this company to not let you know how they do business .
 The problem is the leather is so stiff that its hard to reach inside without the zipper ripping your hand . The leather feels more like hard plastic . Tried to like it but after a few months I dislike it more and more .
 I was excited about receiving this item because it was unlike any other FBI hat I have seen . There were minor details about the hat that made it appealing to me . So , like any person looking for an FBI hat , I bought one . When I got the hat it was not unlike any other hat I had seen . It was the same as all the other FBI hats on Amazon and Ebay . The picture of the item was different than the one I actually received . Subtle differences , but the subtle differences were the reason I wanted the hat in the first place ... it was a little different . The seller has since changed the picture in the item description to match the one I received . I ended up returning it because it was n't like the one in the picture and the embroidery on the front was unraveling . Premium Quality ? Not quite . Overall the seller was cooperative and I got my refund .

 We ordered a red crumpler salary sacrifice , instead we got a black one , which is considered cheaper.When you buy this item , pay attention , although the page contains other colors , like red and blue , they probably have only the black color , which is available at a lower price in other e-shops .

Your feet look enormous next to these skinny pants . NO ROOM !! 3 . -RRB- They ride so high on your waist it is uncomfortable4 . -RRB- They are n't sized properly , a 36 is a 34 , 34 is 32 etc. ... STAY AWAY .
 Waist is not true to size just like many dickies products , its better if you just go to a store and try them on first
 These pants , for me , where a bit tighter than I thought it would be , also stiffer and smaller than I had hoped .
 My husband always wears 36 30 . He has several Dickie pants ... I got 874 which were the wrong ones . They were stiff and small . I had to return and now pay postage beause they were part of another order making over $ 25 . Also had to go to UPS and post and will have return postage taken out of refund ... My mistake and I paid for it
 i ordered gray and they sent green . GREEN , come on guys really ? at least they were the right size . well done
 I remember when I was a teenager Dickies would last forever ; nowadays they fall apart pretty quickly . I think they must be cutting costs on quality control ...
 I had a pair of Dickies fall apart after a month . Then they would n't honor the warranty . Shady company and now making crap products .
 Just going to list the issues
 I generally wear a 38x30 , and that 's what I bought in these , they are sized quite a bit smaller in the waste . I 'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in , but you may want to get a waste size up . I 'll be wearing them in a dress office setting , and I 'm surprised how good these look , hopefully they last a long time too .
 for no apparent reason these are humongous . my bf currently wears 32x32 which are a bit short and a bit tight on him so we tried to go a size up - but for some reason these were ginormous !
 my boyfriend currently wears 32x32s that were getting a bit tight and a bit long on him . for some reason these in 34x34 were ridiculously huge ! Returned
 These pants are fake no tags fake packaging.the zipper was broke.I work in 874s for over 25 years an I know how they look an feel an these look an feel &#34; FAKE &#34;
 My 4-year-old daughter is really into the Fairytopia movie series , so I was excited to purchase this costume for her . We were both very unhappy with it , though ... both side seams ripped and frayed within 20 minutes of the first wear . A family member sewed up the seams , which then ripped again within minutes of the second wearing . The problem is the fabric , which is very cheap . In fact , the whole costume -LRB- top and bottom -RRB- is cheaply made .
 Product was not as it appeared on the website . It is very thin and cheaply made . I doubt it will last very long .
 so thin , when it rains it may be a good choice if u do n't have a raincoat .
 Technically I could get this on and zip it up but it hit the trash can shortly thereafter . Trying for a good Dr. Girlfriend costume and because this purchase did not work out abandoned the whole concept . I 'm guessing the model is about 5 ' tall because on my 5 ' 10 '' self the skirt was WAY too short for public -LRB- even on Halloween -RRB- . The quality was really cheap and I can not imagine trying for a `` Jackie O '' look in this mess .
 I am so disappointed . The outfit looks so cute on the model . The hat is not like a regular pillbox hat . It does n't have any cardboard to keep its shape . It 's pretty much like a sailor hat . The dress was just a mess . It was see-through , short , and absolutely huge ! I know it 's a one-size-fits-all , but holy smokes it was like a tent on me ! I have a 24 in waist for reference . The only good thing about this was the sunglasses . I 'm sending this back for sure .
 Luckily I sew decently and i was able to make alterations to this dress . I 'm a size 2 , 5 ' 3 '' , and this dress fits me fits me fir the height but definitely not the rest . It 's at least size 6 , i needed to shrinken it of 4 inches!It is ok , good price , but keep in mind that is not for petite women .

 I 've been buying Dickies , particularly the 874 's for over 20 years and I was n't impressed with these ones at all . .

 Be aware that these run small - At least by a size or more . And they 're straight leg , not boot cut , so there 's a bit of a taper at the ankle .

 The mask works great ! Loved it . However , replacement cartridges are unavailable . Do a quick search before you purchase . When it came time to buy my first set of new filters they were unavailable from top sellers like amazon.com and grainger . Ca n't find them anywhere rendering this mask as a waste of money
 Do not buy this respirator unles you only plan to use it one time . AO Safety company has been bought by 3M and they have discontiued all AO safety products . You will not find the replacement cartridges . While the mask itself is a fine product and I am sad to see it go you will not find the cartridges for this unit . As another reviewer suggested , go try to find the replacement cartridges . They are unavailable almost everywhere . You will not find them at Home Depot or Lowes .

 I have ordered a fair amount of stuff from Amazon over the past week , and have noticed some major changes in the MO of how Amazon seems to be treating customers , prompting me to do these reviews , the first I have ever done . At the time of doing these reviews , I have n't even received some these products , but I feel I must share my experience and opinions with other all of you who spend money with Amazon and make its executives very rich ! Please check out some of my other reviews relating to Amazon changing the vendor , price and shipping rates on the same web page/product several times within a 24hrs period . What I now call Amazon roulette shopping.This review is related to choosing I `` FREE Super Saver Shipping '' . It seems to me that if one opts for `` FREE Super Saver Shipping '' , Amazon will intentionally hold up some of your orders at their distribution warehouses . The evidence for this with this product is that at the time of writing this review , on the product page they make the following statement . `` Want it delivered Monday , October 27 ? Order it in the next 13 hours and 49 minutes , and choose One-Day Shipping at checkout '' I ordered this and other products ` Order Date

 I order 2 extra long shirts to try . I ordered 1 red 1 grey . When the package came the first thing noticed was the red shirt was in a smaller bag size than the grey shirt . Upon opening , the grey shirt had cardboard that the sirt was wrapped around . The red shirt had no cardboard that the shirt was wrapped around . The grey shirt had no size tag on the back of the neck for the size just a stamp and made in Pakistan . The red shirt had tag with the size Russel brand and made in Pakistan . I put the grey shirt on , it on and it was very good in size and length . Loose fitting all around and nice and log . I then tried the red shirt , it was tight fitting , almost choking me around the neck and clearly shorter in length than the grey shirt that came in the same package . I placed both out on the bed and the red shirt was around 2 inches shorter in width 3 inches shorter in length and the neckline was an inch shorter and the sleeves were not as wide.Maybe they shipped me a returned shirt that was washed and shrunk ? Who knows but a 2XT with 2 different packaging , tags and sizes is not acceptable quality imho . I will be returning both shirts .
 Quality not very good . My expectations for a Russell Athletic product were not met . To me , the material was of a very low grade .
 this shirt started out at 34 '' length after wash and dried on low heat it was 32 '' inches long so cant where it which is bad new because it cost a lot more than the others i bought of other brands , i would recommend no one over 6.0 to 6.2 buy this i am 6.7 and it is way to short unless you like showing you back off and if that 's the case save the money and do n't wear a shirt
 For years I have loved Russell Athletic products -LRB- I have one shirt that I have worn at least 500 times and it still looks new -RRB- , but then my local Academy stopped carrying them . Although I prefer to buy locally , I had no choice and so ordered from Amazon . One of the shirts I bought came out of its third laundry cycle with the sleeve seams split in several places . Not what I had expected !
 The first time my son wore this shirt the length was great , as soon as I washed and dried -LRB- on low -RRB- the shirt shrunk . Do not wash , this shirt will shrink drastically . At least 3 inches .
 The packaging had dead insects in it , and in one of the 3 shirts there was a hole in it , near the collar . Whether it was a sewing mistake or insect munching , I do n't know .
 At first I was thrilled that I finally found a 2XT Tee Shirt that was actually cut for a tall person and not a fatty.The material also had a nice thickness to it , which has become a problem with many garments of late.After some inspection , I realized that the construction of one of the shirts was so far off that I had to go back to see if I ordered a blemish or factory second.If you pay $ 30.00 -LRB- with shipping -RRB- for a Tee Shirt , you should n't expect such an awful job . One of the side seams is fine , but the other starts at the armpit and then takes a sharp turn , ending close to the middle of the back . Not only does this look ridiculous , but I feel the pulling from this terribly made shirt.The packaging said that this shirt was made in Pakistan , which might be the reason for this reject of a shirt.Shirt companies were having shirts made in Mexico and Honduras , which was a slight decline from what is made in the US , but this is just unacceptable.What is next , $ 40.00 for a Tee Shirt made in Madagascar ?????
 I ordered 3 of these and they were not only on the small side , they also had significant size differences between supposedly equal sized shirts ... Someone slip some irregulars into this batch ?
 I am very disappointed in the T-Shirt that I received . Not only does it have small flaws but it is NOT the T-Shirt that is pictured on the web site . I will NOT be ordering anything else from this vendor .
 We have purchased Russell Athletic tshirts in the past and they were very true to size . My husband is 6 ' 6 '' and this `` tall '' size is at least 4 '' -6 '' short in the length compared to Reebok , Nautica and Cutter & Buck . Such a disappointment . I even washed them in cold water . I will say that the quality of the material of the shirt is good but does me no good if he wo n't wear them . Will NEVER buy these again !
 I bought these shirts because i have a hard time finding good shirts for tall people -LRB- 6 ' 3 '' 270lbs -RRB- . These shirts all shrank up in just a couple of washed the carhartt tall shirts have been far superior to these and so I will not be buying any more of these shirts .
 Disappointing ! This t-shirt shrank about five -LRB- ! -RRB- inches in the length even though I followed laundering directions on the label .

 Beware of this seller . They send merchandise , no return info or packing slip . Once they get your money they run !
 95601 replacement cartridge does not fit the quicklatch respirator I purchased from you.The picture you show is the right picture for my respirator but the 95601 has a mettle base with threads on its outside not the hole in the back with the 3 prong slots.I 'd send you a picture of the mask it fits but ca n't see how.The cartridge I needed has the # 8053-p100stamped on it . The 95601 has the #R 53-p100 stamped on it.Needless to say I went to the hardware store where I could see the cartridge I 'm getting .
 so thin , when it rains it may be a good choice if u do n't have a raincoat .
 Men here is a tip . If you want to please your lady , use a sexy thong instead . We love how a man looks in a thong .
 The waistbands on some of the pairs I own have rolled down , and no amount of ironing seems to be able to straighten them out . Oddly , this seems to affect the blue and gray pairs . Of the four black pairs I bought , only one has this problem . I also had a seam fail on one of the eight pairs I bought.I have since bought some boxer briefs from Nordstrom that have held up much better , with no rolling in the waistband . I 'm going to start replacing these Calvin Kleins with Nordstroms . Maybe not as chic , but it 's better than having a rolled waistband digging into your hip .
 Comfortable only for the first wearing . The waist band on these rolls very easily and then even repeated washing , and ironing ca n't take the roll out . Otherwise , well made and they tend to wear well .
 THE GOOD THING IS THAT IT FITS , OTHER THEN THAT T IS STIFF AND UNCOMFORTABLE . NOT HOW THEY USED TO MAKE EM .

 The wallet is too large to extricate from my rear pocket when in a sitting position . The wallet is functionally too big , and not usable as a daily wallet .
 I thought I would love this wallet ; it has so much room for a small/mid size wallet . the two flap will hold credit cards but if you open it up the flap are now upside down and stuff will fall out . It will hold a iphone 4 . It will hold a lot of stuff . another problem I had was trying to find my stuff . do n't like it . brought me another wallet instead .
 The wallet has 2 flaps and after about 1 week of use the fastener under the upper flap is pulling away from the leather . I noticed it was a little tight to fasten and unfasten and then it began to tear loose . Very disapointed
 I hated this because the credit cards fall out of the wallet organizer . Unfortunately , I removed the double-flap because I did n't want that and now I ca n't return it .
 I 'm disappointed in this item , expected better of Buxton . For the price I did n't expect leather but did think it would be a quality substitute . This feels nasty . The only reason it gets two stars is the design . It is exactly what I need to pop in and out of the large -LRB- nice leather -RRB- bag I need for work . I 'll use it til I find a better substitute , if it does n't fall apart first .
 The bag is pretty , but was advertised as purple , but it is pink , and will be returned to the company .
 I never recieved this item ! Nonexistant customer service ! Do not do business with these people .
 This product was an ok purchase . The top did n't fit as well as hoped . But still was ok .
 I smoke 100 's and these are NOT made for them . I can get my cigarettes in it but it wont close . I was very disappointed .
 cheap and cheesy , but i guess i could have expected that for the price , wont purchase another without seeing first
 I ordered a ladies cigarette case for my wife , and a pack of Marlboro 100 's would not fit in the case !!!! I was ripped off !!! A cigarette case should be able to hold any cigarette pack !!!! I will not do business with Silverhooks again !!!! It 's not even worth the postage to send it back !!!! Dissatisfied big time !!!!

 was not happy w this bra . the inside of the cup did have a seam and it was not comfotable .
 I wore it once and never wore it again . It makes my `` girls '' look pokey and weird . And it was a bit small .
 How many of us DO NOT carry a cell phone ? Butt cut way too large & NO CELL PHONE POCKET !
 March 25th , 2010 I ordered these items from Amazon . As of April 26th , I have yet to receive them . So , I guess this site is not backing up their shipping assurances . I am not happy nor satisfied .
 This jeans came as ordered and were exactly what I thought they were suppose to be . The only problem that I saw with these jeans is after wearing them for the day , the material `` strechted '' out and were a LOT bigger than when I put them on that morning . I would probably not purchase these pants again . I live an active life and do not need or desire to have pants that end up something that I am pulling up to keep on at the end of the day .
 These pants did not fit my husband , even though the measurements we ordered are his usual measurements . His biggest complaint was how low the crotch of the jeans sag ! We have ordered these exact jeans before -LRB- although probably 5 years ago -RRB- and they fit . I do n't know what happened this time . : -LRB-
 I am a professional carpenter and a co-worker of mine had a pair of these pants and I was very impressed by them . I ordered a pair of them.I wear a size 34 waist from many different major brands of jeans -LRB- Carhartts , Levi 's , etc -RRB- and all of fit well , if not maybe a little tight . That said , I ordered a pair in size 36 waist intentionally wanting a slightly looser fit . When they arrived they were incredibly tight ! Be warned ... if you order these pants , you may likely pay a guessing game to get the size right.Very disappointed .
 These jeans have too much room in the crotch seat area , it does not align or conform with the waist size . Other than that the jeans are nice , but too much room in the crotch and seat area ruin it .
 No matter if is raining or the sun is `` hot '' this is the shade you 'll need !! Saludos , Allan.2012-10-08 : Now , with the use , is too floopy for me . Trash it .
 For the price I would expect this to be a really comfortable hat that I would enjoy wearing . But whilst there was nothing wrong with it , I did not find it that brilliant . I have owned similar and very much cheaper hats before or since and have noticed no difference . In fact the cheaper and lighter the hat , the better . My other gripe was that I was persuaded to buy this with a lifetime guarantee of replacement if it got lost . Turns out this is not so . Although the label attached mentions this , there is small print inside the instruction manual saying that loss is only covered for two years and they will charge you half price for a replacement plus postage . I wo n't be buying any more of these .
 I ordered this beautiful fuchsia pink tie because my child was going to a semi-formal at her high school , and she wanted her boyfriend to match her dress . I received the tie in time but I received a white tie NOT a pink one.I understand mix-ups happen , however when you order 1 item there should not be any mix-up . I know when I worked in a factory in the shipping area , we had to check the order twice to make sure everything is right . We dealt with very large orders and for the time I worked there we never had a wrong order . I would not order from this company again because it is more of a hassle to get the order and try to get it fix then just order from a company I have never had a problem with . No where in my mind can I put together how someone can mix up the color white with the color fuchsia pink.Now when I brought this up to the tie guy they were very nice , and was willing to send me a new tie , however it was a moot point seeing how they would not get it to me in time for the dance in which I bought it for .
 I like the style of this wallet but the material that it 's made of feels very cheap . So far I have n't even changed it out with my old worn out broken wallet .
 It is not enough space for credit cards . Also getting the cards in and out it is too tight.If you get too much paper money in your wallet the hook keeps popping open and youhave to keep fastening it back constantly . Not real pleased but nce quality for the price .
 I was looking for a leather wallet with a lot of storage . This one does have plenty of storage and I like the idea of it but the inside fabric is child 's play toy , dollar store cheap plastic . If they could make this wallet with good quality leather inside and out it would be perfect .
 I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE I PAID FOR THE PINK ONE , BUT THE SELLER SEND ME ANOTHER , DIFFERENTE , MODEL , COLOR , STYLE AND I DO N'T KNOW IF THE PRICE IS OTHER .
 There 's a apparent breakage found when I open the plastic pack -LRB- no box -RRB- , and only cover leathern!Will not buy this brand , absolutely .
 I ordered this for my mom to replace her current one that she loves , which is what 's in the pictures , but when I got the new one it 's a different design and does n't have the horizontal credit card slots -LRB- my mom 's favorite part ! -RRB- . Very disappointed .

 pretty much sums it up . Gave it as a gift after the 30 day return window . Upon opening the package fully , it was obvious they had sent the plus size . Receiving plus size lingerie when you 're not that big pretty much destroys the joy .

 These sunglasses may list materials : Titanium and Poly Carbonate and as a consumer beleive that they will hold up to an active lifestyle . FAR from the truth
 this jacket admittedly is made of some of the finest leather you could imagine . it is unbelievable soft and just looks nice . HOWEVER , it is truly unlikely to fit you . I normally wear a small or a medium , and i ordered the small jacket -- the sizing chart at Jos Banks says their smalls are made for a 34-36 chest . i am normally a 38 so if anything the jacket should be snug . unfortunately , I could fit two of me in the jacket . Unless you are going for an extremely baggy look , you must order a size down , leaving us smaller folk out of luck .
 My husband always wears 36 30 . He has several Dickie pants ... I got 874 which were the wrong ones . They were stiff and small . I had to return and now pay postage beause they were part of another order making over $ 25 . Also had to go to UPS and post and will have return postage taken out of refund ... My mistake and I paid for it
 I 've been buying Dickies , particularly the 874 's for over 20 years and I was n't impressed with these ones at all . . While the item was clearly marked as a Dickies product , it did n't look or feel like any pair of Dickies I 've ever bought before.The material seemed very thin , and the pants had no factory crease . . Live and learn . .
 Be aware that these run small - At least by a size or more . And they 're straight leg , not boot cut , so there 's a bit of a taper at the ankle .
 I generally wear a 38x30 , and that 's what I bought in these , they are sized quite a bit smaller in the waste . I 'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in , but you may want to get a waste size up . I 'll be wearing them in a dress office setting , and I 'm surprised how good these look , hopefully they last a long time too .
 for no apparent reason these are humongous . my bf currently wears 32x32 which are a bit short and a bit tight on him so we tried to go a size up - but for some reason these were ginormous !
 my boyfriend currently wears 32x32s that were getting a bit tight and a bit long on him . for some reason these in 34x34 were ridiculously huge ! Returned
 These pants are fake no tags fake packaging.the zipper was broke.I work in 874s for over 25 years an I know how they look an feel an these look an feel &#34; FAKE &#34;
 i ordered gray and they sent green . GREEN , come on guys really ? at least they were the right size . well done
 I remember when I was a teenager Dickies would last forever ; nowadays they fall apart pretty quickly . I think they must be cutting costs on quality control ...
 I had a pair of Dickies fall apart after a month . Then they would n't honor the warranty . Shady company and now making crap products .
 Just going to list the issues
 Waist is not true to size just like many dickies products , its better if you just go to a store and try them on first
 These pants , for me , where a bit tighter than I thought it would be , also stiffer and smaller than I had hoped .
 The pants have so much wrong with them , plus they look awful . It is my guess that dickies enjoys making money at the expense of the customer , both by making them pay too much for them and making them look stupid wearing them .1 . -RRB- CARDBOARD PANTS . They are STIFF . Wash them 100 times and I guarantee you they will still feel like cardboard .2 . -RRB- They are so tapered they barely fit over any boots you wear . Your feet look enormous next to these skinny pants . NO ROOM !! 3 . -RRB- They ride so high on your waist it is uncomfortable4 . -RRB- They are n't sized properly , a 36 is a 34 , 34 is 32 etc. ... STAY AWAY .

 The shirts are almost translucent and rough . I feel one washing will route them to the nearest good will . Original shipment was last , good service in addressing the lost order . I guess you get what you paid for . Never go that cheap again ...
 for ten bucks you get what you pay for the shirt is unwearable right out of the box , the collar is 90 degrees off , if you have dusting to do this will do .

 The previous reviewer is right . Women love to see a man in a thong and not in boxers . Afther I first put a thong on my wife has not stopped telling me how sexy I look.It has converted her in a nifomaniac ! If you want great sex , get a thong . Your woman will love it .
 My opinion as a woman
 Absolute worst Hat ever.I am a hat collector.This hat is totally flat , totally faded -LRB- 10 shades lighter than the photo -RRB- looks like it came from the bottom of the heap of a grab bag at the salvation army store.It was made in china and , appears to be someone 's 10 yr . old pre-owned hat.You will have to line the inside -LRB- all the way around -RRB- with cardboard to fill it out on your head and to get it to stand up straight when not in use .
 These stalkings are ADORABLE , but I am all about cute and efficient . These are not that . I bought them for my wedding and the elastic that held them up was super flaccid . It would not hold them up , I had one that was up because of my guarder and one that was at my ankle . Cute but they FAIL !
 These looked beautiful from the pictures and the price was fantastic ! As soon as I took them out of the package , I could feel that they were poor quality . They are n't silky , so they do n't hold form well . They easily tear and snag . It 's like a one-time-wear item . I 'm throwing them away .
 The stockings are too thin and not even drugstore quality . They almost got a snag just from me gently opening the package . I suspect that these will last for one wearing or less and that 's not worth my $ $ $ . Better to spend a $ 3-5 more and get something that can be worn and washed and so forth . These are simply too poor of quality for all that .
 Seriously ... I was lucky to get one use out of these . It was n't like I was running through thorn bushes , climbing trees , or gardening in them . Like the other reviewer mentioned , these snagged when I opened the package , and continued to snag with each movement I made . I was not going for zombie-chic , though that 's the look I got once they were finally on past my toes.Unfortunately , I bought three pairs in different styles . Each pair suffered as badly as the first , which means I did not just get a bum item in an otherwise decent product line . I definitely will not repurchase . I do n't expect cheap lingerie to last as long as their pricier counterparts , and I do n't have an issue with items that have a relatively quick expiration date . However , I count anything a fail that does not yield at least a handful of uses . And these did not yield even one.Choose something else . And if you 've found something on here that lasts decently well , will you leave a comment so I can get some for myself ? I obviously need new ones .
 i kinda like the jacket , but its way to short ! need something longer for the rain .
 I bought a Marmot rain suit a couple of years ago , not from Amazon . It featured similar technology , some sort of little pores in the material that would let if breathe , but keep rain out.I did some hiking in light rain with good results . A little sweaty if I was really pushing it , but ok . The suit was thoughtfully designed and well-made . Later , I waited for the big rain . After a couple of hours it went right through and I was soaked . I wore it many other times since and the results were the same ; fine for a couple or three hours in light rain , no good for heavy rain.Per the directions , I fluffed it up in the dryer , to re-activate the chemical that makes it water-proof and went out again . Same results . I maybe took it out a dozen times , so there was no reason it should have been worn out in any way . It was never washed , either , so nothing was washed away.I contacted Marmot and they said it should be sent in for re-waterproofing , that my rainsuit was not designed to be totally waterproof , just water resistant.I write this review not knowing if the material and the chemical process is different now . Maybe this review is not fair because this is a different product altogether , but I have my suspicions . The technology is presented the same way , the same sort of advertising . The design of the suit and its features appear to be the same.I suggest that you contact the company and grill them about just what is promised.Note the lofty price of Gore Tex products -LRB- ! -RRB- . It may be that you have to go that route to get perfect performance . If you are going to use your suit a lot , and use it in heavy rain , it might be worth going in that direction . If you need a suit for very occasional or non-exertion use , or just for emergencies , then a PVC suit will probably be ok . They are totally waterproof , and cheap , but do sweat you up big time if you are working hard or hiking .
 I mainly bought this because I wanted something with a roll up hood , packable , cheap and reliable . Main thing was a roll up hood . I wear boonie hats or watch caps so I wont be using the hood unless I lose my hat . Rolling up the hood makes the jacket look like crap , and it feels like crap on your neck . I have water proof jackets without roll up hoods , so this was a waste of money for me . I got it cheap enough so I might as well keep it , but it was very disappointing . This was a feature that I thought would be fairly straight forward , but I will probably stay away from Marmot jackets in the future unless I see it first . The only thing keeping me from giving this a 1 star rating is I have not actually used it in the rain yet , so it may be great in that regard . This is mainly a condemnation of the roll up hood design .
 Having owned and used this jacket for over a year now , mostly in the rain for short -LRB- less than ten miles -RRB- hiking , biking , and running , I can say that while it does look good and fits well , it is ultimately disappointing in that it fails to deliver in the main purpose for which I bought it
 Have you ever ridden a bike in unbreatheable clothing , in inclement weather ? Yep , sucks bad . Do it a number of occasions , and you begin to understand why the cycle commuters wear those expensive-looking rain jackets . I went through a few cheaper ones before I discovered the Precip . Initially -- or rather , for the first 18 months or so -- it was a dependable rain-blocking outer shell.Alas , the waterproof inner lining has started to wear out around the shoulders due to friction from backpack and shoulder bag straps . I do not consider this an acceptable lifespan for the premium price I paid for this jacket when it was a new item and I will be taking the jacket back , either to the retailer or to Marmot -LRB- they have a lifetime warranty . -RRB- This said , one should not dismiss this design as a complete reject , but it can not withstand being regularly used in conjunction with a backpack or shoulder bag . If you doe not have this requirement , then it would be an excellent packable rain jacket suitable for active use .
 I ordered a cowboy hat from this company May 12th , and immediately received an email saying that it was backordered until May 13th . I was ordering the hat for a specfic purpose and needed it by June 9th which I assumed would not be a problem seeing as I ordered it almost a month before that ... BOY WAS I WRONG !!!!!!! Not only did they continue telling me it was backordered until the day after everytime I asked , but they just kept saying it was going to get to us . The customer service did not seem to care at all that I wanted the hat for a specific time and that they would not get it to me by that time . They finally shipped the hat on June 3rd , and the tracking information they sent says the expected ship date is May 21st which would be absolutely impossible seeing as that was three weeks ago ! I am incredibly annoyed by the constant lying to me , and the fact that now I will have to pay to return the hat.I would NOT recommend going through this store for any purchases . I am a Certified Amazon lover and have NEVER had so much difficulty with buying something through Amazon . I can guarantee you that this company is not the same caliber as most Amazon companies are and I would find your purchases somewhere else rather than wasting your time with this company ! 100 % DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS SELLER !!!!!!!
 Initially I was going to order several items from Andrew Christian , until I saw their shipping prices at checkout . $ 2 shipping on EACH $ 4 tee-shirt was more than excessive , they were going to charge me $ 20 shipping on a $ 42 order ! I canceled most of the items , only ordering a belt and a tee . Shipping was still ~ 50 % surcharge.Received my order yesterday and found that the belt is defective . The buckle is on backwards -LRB- no , it 's not reversible ... -RRB- plus the material of the belt itself is damaged by a frayed hole . It is n't worth the shipping cost & hassle to send it back , I 'll probably just throw it away - but I did learn something.I will never deal with Andrew Christian again ! I you choose to , please pay attention to the shipping charges when you check out - you may decide to revise your order !
 The previous reviewer is right . Women love to see a man in a thong and not in boxers . Afther I first put a thong on my wife has not stopped telling me how sexy I look.It has converted her in a nifomaniac ! If you want great sex , get a thong . Your woman will love it .
 My opinion as a woman
 I have worn these briefs for probably 25 years -LRB- obviously I liked them -RRB- but there has been a dramatic decline in the quality of the product recently . I bought them from 2 suppliers and they were made in Costa Rica and El Salvador . At first I though the ones from Costa Rica were a little better as the fabric is slightly heavier but both have started to wear and fray at the waist band elastic . This is after about 3 wearings ! Does not bode well for them lasting several years like the old ones .
 I wore one pair once and gave them away because I did n't like the way they felt . The fabric felt rough and the leg bands too narrow .
 Fits like a sack , styled like something my mother might have worn - very late in life . Not nice at all . I DO N'T wear tiny underwear , but there 's enough fabric in these for two pair , going on three . Yuck .
 I did a search for cotton panties . The first word in the descriptive list is ` cotton . ` These say they are 19 % spandex and 81 % Nylon . 19 % + 81 % = 100 PERCENT non cotton!It is difficult to find things on Amazon with such inaccurate descriptions .
 I bought these in black . According to the reviews I read , they are very comfortable ; however , I did n't anticipate that they would be so thin that one could see through them .

 I ordered a cowboy hat from this company May 12th , and immediately received an email saying that it was backordered until May 13th . I was ordering the hat for a specfic purpose and needed it by June 9th which I assumed would not be a problem seeing as I ordered it almost a month before that ... BOY WAS I WRONG !!!!!!! Not only did they continue telling me it was backordered until the day after everytime I asked , but they just kept saying it was going to get to us . The customer service did not seem to care at all that I wanted the hat for a specific time and that they would not get it to me by that time . They finally shipped the hat on June 3rd , and the tracking information they sent says the expected ship date is May 21st which would be absolutely impossible seeing as that was three weeks ago ! I am incredibly annoyed by the constant lying to me , and the fact that now I will have to pay to return the hat.I would NOT recommend going through this store for any purchases .

 These did nothing special and they started to come apart almost immediately . I certainly hope that these are not supplied to our men in uniform . They deserve much better .
 Bearing in mind that these are supposed to be `` glove liners '' one size fits all is grossly inaccurate . I have large hands -LRB- 9.5 inches around the knuckles -RRB- , and these are big on me . mainly the fingers which are about 1/2 inch too long !!!! Complete waste of 6 bucks . Very fast shipping though . PS I really hate giving bad reviews .
 Hate the pair of gloves I had bought ! They did not even fit properly despite buying a size that usually fits my palm . Above that , these gloves are very uncomfortable too and offer no protection from the cold weather . I do n't recommend you buying this product .
 Initially I was going to order several items from Andrew Christian , until I saw their shipping prices at checkout . $ 2 shipping on EACH $ 4 tee-shirt was more than excessive , they were going to charge me $ 20 shipping on a $ 42 order ! I canceled most of the items , only ordering a belt and a tee . Shipping was still ~ 50 % surcharge.Received my order yesterday and found that the belt is defective . The buckle is on backwards -LRB- no , it 's not reversible ... -RRB- plus the material of the belt itself is damaged by a frayed hole . It is n't worth the shipping cost & hassle to send it back , I 'll probably just throw it away - but I did learn something.I will never deal with Andrew Christian again ! I you choose to , please pay attention to the shipping charges when you check out - you may decide to revise your order !
 The previous reviewer is right . Women love to see a man in a thong and not in boxers . Afther I first put a thong on my wife has not stopped telling me how sexy I look.It has converted her in a nifomaniac ! If you want great sex , get a thong . Your woman will love it .

 I bought these in black . According to the reviews I read , they are very comfortable ; however , I did n't anticipate that they would be so thin that one could see through them .
 I have worn these briefs for probably 25 years -LRB- obviously I liked them -RRB- but there has been a dramatic decline in the quality of the product recently . I bought them from 2 suppliers and they were made in Costa Rica and El Salvador . At first I though the ones from Costa Rica were a little better as the fabric is slightly heavier but both have started to wear and fray at the waist band elastic . This is after about 3 wearings ! Does not bode well for them lasting several years like the old ones .
 I wore one pair once and gave them away because I did n't like the way they felt . The fabric felt rough and the leg bands too narrow .
 Fits like a sack , styled like something my mother might have worn - very late in life . Not nice at all . I DO N'T wear tiny underwear , but there 's enough fabric in these for two pair , going on three . Yuck .
 I did a search for cotton panties . The first word in the descriptive list is ` cotton . ` These say they are 19 % spandex and 81 % Nylon . 19 % + 81 % = 100 PERCENT non cotton!It is difficult to find things on Amazon with such inaccurate descriptions .
 I was about to buy this ... and then I realized it looked EXACTLY like a product I saw on David 's Bridal . On closer inspection , it WAS the exact same thing -LRB- DB # 8949 -RRB- and $ 10 cheaper on DB . Just so everyone knows .

 One of the lenses does not snap . -LRB- I am not the most dexterous guy , but not the klutz either -RRB- . After careful inspection I discovered that left and right lenses are slightly different in size and that the right side of the frame is a little more flexible than the left one.It seems that outsourcing from France to China did not help company 's bottom line in my case . I returned the product .2 stars , because the lenses when they stay in place are actually helping to see the ball better .

 Very loose , very large . Returned it . Got a transport backpack instead-thats a good product .
 My son has worn the socks only one time and one pair already has a hole . We expected better quality from UA .

 Ordered two shirts for friends both xxlarge , received two large for gifts , shrank 1st was & that was it . So I will try again & hope I have a better experience , I know there busy and mistakes happen . Forgive and forget .
 Look closely at your order if you buy this . The title and description clearly said it was a 6-pack when I added it to my cart . When I went to check out , the item in my cart said it was only one pair . I tried deleting the item and adding it again from the product page , which still said 6-pack , and again the item added to my cart , at the same price , was only one pair .

 I bought this camisole to replace the thread bare ones that I 've been clinging to for longer than I 'd care to admit . When I received it , it looked exactly like my thread bare camis because it was so thin it was see through . To top it off , there 's an elastic band around the bottom that causes it to ride up all day long . It 's a waste of money . I 'm better off wearing my old grungy shirts .
 I am very disappointed in the T-Shirt that I received . Not only does it have small flaws but it is NOT the T-Shirt that is pictured on the web site . I will NOT be ordering anything else from this vendor .
 We have purchased Russell Athletic tshirts in the past and they were very true to size . My husband is 6 ' 6 '' and this `` tall '' size is at least 4 '' -6 '' short in the length compared to Reebok , Nautica and Cutter & Buck . Such a disappointment . I even washed them in cold water . I will say that the quality of the material of the shirt is good but does me no good if he wo n't wear them . Will NEVER buy these again !
 I bought these shirts because i have a hard time finding good shirts for tall people -LRB- 6 ' 3 '' 270lbs -RRB- . These shirts all shrank up in just a couple of washed the carhartt tall shirts have been far superior to these and so I will not be buying any more of these shirts .
 Disappointing ! This t-shirt shrank about five -LRB- ! -RRB- inches in the length even though I followed laundering directions on the label .
 I order 2 extra long shirts to try . I ordered 1 red 1 grey . When the package came the first thing noticed was the red shirt was in a smaller bag size than the grey shirt . Upon opening , the grey shirt had cardboard that the sirt was wrapped around . The red shirt had no cardboard that the shirt was wrapped around . The grey shirt had no size tag on the back of the neck for the size just a stamp and made in Pakistan . The red shirt had tag with the size Russel brand and made in Pakistan . I put the grey shirt on , it on and it was very good in size and length . Loose fitting all around and nice and log . I then tried the red shirt , it was tight fitting , almost choking me around the neck and clearly shorter in length than the grey shirt that came in the same package . I placed both out on the bed and the red shirt was around 2 inches shorter in width 3 inches shorter in length and the neckline was an inch shorter and the sleeves were not as wide.Maybe they shipped me a returned shirt that was washed and shrunk ? Who knows but a 2XT with 2 different packaging , tags and sizes is not acceptable quality imho . I will be returning both shirts .
 Quality not very good . My expectations for a Russell Athletic product were not met . To me , the material was of a very low grade .
 this shirt started out at 34 '' length after wash and dried on low heat it was 32 '' inches long so cant where it which is bad new because it cost a lot more than the others i bought of other brands , i would recommend no one over 6.0 to 6.2 buy this i am 6.7 and it is way to short unless you like showing you back off and if that 's the case save the money and do n't wear a shirt
 For years I have loved Russell Athletic products -LRB- I have one shirt that I have worn at least 500 times and it still looks new -RRB- , but then my local Academy stopped carrying them . Although I prefer to buy locally , I had no choice and so ordered from Amazon . One of the shirts I bought came out of its third laundry cycle with the sleeve seams split in several places . Not what I had expected !
 The first time my son wore this shirt the length was great , as soon as I washed and dried -LRB- on low -RRB- the shirt shrunk . Do not wash , this shirt will shrink drastically . At least 3 inches .
 I ordered 3 of these and they were not only on the small side , they also had significant size differences between supposedly equal sized shirts ... Someone slip some irregulars into this batch ?
 The packaging had dead insects in it , and in one of the 3 shirts there was a hole in it , near the collar . Whether it was a sewing mistake or insect munching , I do n't know .
 At first I was thrilled that I finally found a 2XT Tee Shirt that was actually cut for a tall person and not a fatty.The material also had a nice thickness to it , which has become a problem with many garments of late.After some inspection , I realized that the construction of one of the shirts was so far off that I had to go back to see if I ordered a blemish or factory second.If you pay $ 30.00 -LRB- with shipping -RRB- for a Tee Shirt , you should n't expect such an awful job . One of the side seams is fine , but the other starts at the armpit and then takes a sharp turn , ending close to the middle of the back . Not only does this look ridiculous , but I feel the pulling from this terribly made shirt.The packaging said that this shirt was made in Pakistan , which might be the reason for this reject of a shirt.Shirt companies were having shirts made in Mexico and Honduras , which was a slight decline from what is made in the US , but this is just unacceptable.What is next , $ 40.00 for a Tee Shirt made in Madagascar ?????
 I got one day of wear from these , and even then I had to walk around with snags all up my legs .

 The search was done for a child 's cashmere sweater.A picture and description of a lovely blue cashmeresweater and pants was shown.I purchased the set but was sent a pair of floral knit pants . The pants are not what I ordered and they are worth about .35 cents not almost $ 40.00 . This was an expensive disappointment.I will not us amazon again .

 I anticipated getting a shirt that had every animal in the world . I could see from the picture that obviously there were only a small portion of the world 's animlas on the front of the shirt . I assumed all the other animals of the world were printed on the back of the shirt . I was astonished when I got my item and realized there were NO ANIMALS ON THE BACK OF THE SHIRT . Do not be fooled by the image shown , there are only animals on the front of the shirt
 World of animals , scmorld of animals . This t-shirt 's description is incorrect . Yeah , yeah , it 's 100 % cotton . But WORLD of animals ? No way . The entire WORLD of animals is not depicted on this t-shirt !! What a ripoff !! Buyer beware !!
 I bought this shirt last year ... I was hoping to invoke the magic of the 3 Wolves style shirt -LRB- EVERYONE IN MY TRAILER PARK IS WEARING THOSE -RRB- but to give it a little more flair.Let me tell you , the animal spirits this shirt invokes is way too busy . The Elephant Spirit add great girth to my bowel movements . The Giraffe Spirit makes only leafy green veggies taste good . The Rabbit Spirit made me start humping anything that moved ... my poor poodle ;-LRB- . The Ram Spirit caused me to start headbutting the cars driving in and out of our trailer park . The Polar Bear Spirit caused me to buy an above ground pool , fill it with ice water and swim in it naked.After I was release on a $ 2,000 bond I immediately went home and burned this shirt . Please do not buy this shirt . It will ruin your life .
 Whenever someone asks me that age old hypothetical conundrum
 A gift for my girlfriend ... she tried them on and one of the pearl strands broke , she was able to sew it back together ... tried on again , another broken strand ... she had to repair all pearl strands ... very disappointed ... very poor quality
 When I received this item in the mail I opened it and one of the strands was broken . So instead of returning them I stitched it back myself . So after all of that I finally gave them to my wife and when she went to put them on the strands on both sides broke off . Now my wife is not a large woman she is 115 lbs . and I warn everyone that this item is a piece of crap it is poorly made and obviously not worth the price I paid !!!

 My opinion as a woman
 I 've always loved this brand of pantyhose in the past , because of the great feel and fit , but some things have changed and not for the better . I ordered 5 pairs . Four in the `` barely there '' color , which is now a horrible orangish color instead of being `` barely there '' like they used to be , and one pair in a `` barely black '' , which is a nice color . I ordered pairs for both my daughter and myself , using the size chart . We both had problems with the length , being too short for both of us . The `` barely there '' color is really horrible , like a bad tan . I 'm sending back the three pairs that we did n't try on . I definitely wo n't be buying these again .
 Given the positive reviews that folks have left for Hanes Sheer Panty Hose , I was excited when my sheer Jet -LRB- black -RRB- pair came in the mail . Unfortunately , I only was able to wear them one day to work before noticing that they had pulled all over the back of my legs , both left and right . There must 've been hundreds of dark lines that formed over the course of the day , they looked completely ridiculous and I will certainly never be able to wear them again . I have never purchased a pair of sheer hose that I was only able to wear once , and given the quality of this pair , I wo n't bother trying again with Hanes . What a disappointment .
 I was looking for the biggest size possible for a Halloween Costume . The sizing chart was n't there , so I chose the biggest size they offered . They would not fit a truly PLUS woman , let alone a guy . Seller should offer a complete size chart and say what size you would need depending on height/weight .
 Can not purchase product as Merchant Sizing Chart is not available . Sizes listed are A/B , C/D , E/F - when you click the appropriate link their are no sizing charts suitable to allow you to select and purchase item online .
 this style does not say if it is Sandalfoot or reinforced toe ... could n't buy because of that
 Went into the Goodwill bag first thing . Flimsy , obviously too small and I could have gotten something better , a thicker , more substantive and flexible knit , -LRB- and later did -RRB- at a department store . I was seduced by something in the description -LRB- looking to fit someone w / large calves -RRB- but I should have known better .

 My opinion as a woman
 i ordered a motorhead classic T-shirt , which is supposed to have only the motorhead logo on the front , nothing on the back . just like it was described when i ordered it . on or around the same day the shirt arrived , i get an email from `` Jiggy '' the vendor . -LRB- wtf with that name anyway . jiggy ? do they specialize in Will Smith merch or what ? -RRB- the email says that if i have any questions about my order to email them . so i politely inquire why the T-shirt i received has some printing on the back because the shirt i ordered was n't supposed to have anything on the back . a month goes by and no response from the JiggyPeople . why send a customer an email asking if they have any questions about their order and then not respond when they email you with a question about their order ? do you see the irony here , Jiggy ? so anyway , next time i need a t-shirt , i 'll get it from one of the thousand or so other places i could choose from .
 This bra is great for large-busted women - the wider , padded shoulder straps , four-hook band and full coverage . I also really liked the seamless look , great to wear under t-shirts . It does n't come up too high under the armpits and does not have a band under the cups , so there is nothing to roll up . However , I 've had two of these , and the underwire breaks through in the same place - at the breastbone . For as much as it cost , it 'd be nice if they reinforced the wire better .
 While I must admit that this bra was very supportive , it made my boobs look like cones . I ordered it because I was excited about all the great reviews but when it arrived and I tried it on I could only giggle at myself . I showed my husband and he laughed too . I sent it back . I 'm a 42H so maybe that 's why they seemed so silly looking . I bit the bullet and paid for more Le Mystere bras which seem to be the only ones that give me the support AND shape that I like .
 Though this is an accurate fit , it tends to allow slippage under the cups after wearing awhile .
 As a girl that ca n't just go out and buy my bras in the store because most do n't carry it I was supremely unhappy with this bra . The style is okay , but it rides up in the back , and the wire shifts drastically because it is missing like two inches of wire . Not okay manufactuers , not okay . It arrived ahead of schedule which was great , but now I have to send them back because of the defect with the wire the other stuff I could have dealt with but the wire shift makes it hella uncomforatble to wear all day long . As a big girl I expect these kind of malfunctions when looking for a bra it is just the way it is . Sad but true .
 This bra should be called a minimizer bra . I ordered a 40C and when I put this bra on , I swear I could see my feet ! It was extremely uncomfortable . If I was looking for a bra to smash me down to a smaller size , this would have been ideal . But , I was looking for support and lift . I gave it away to someone who wears a small C and I hope it works better for her . I am a full C and do n't want to be a B !
 This bra is constructed exactly the way I like , with double-ply molded , SEAMLESS cups . But the underwire is slightly too long for my C cup size , and it digs uncomfortably into my underarm , making this maybe the most uncomfortable bra I 've ever tried to wear . I was very disappointed .
 I 've purchased Goddess foundation garments before and experienced great satisfaction ... until now . The bra cups have no elasticity and as a result , do not hold `` the girls '' up and in place . In fact , I 'm sad to report this bra requires constant re-adjustment throughout the day . Yes , I 've been endowed with more than the average gal , but I 've never experienced anything like this . Save your money , and DO N'T buy this bra !

 I weigh just about 100 lb. , and am 5 ' 1 &#34; . These hose are much too big for me . Since there are no smaller sizes , I ca n't get the help from them that I get from Legs Everyday support hose , three pair for around $ 6.00 . I checked them side by side and the stretch is just as strong on the cheapies , and they are half as big before you put them on , length and inches across . Very disappointed . If you are heavier or have more leg , they are silky feeling or appearing and you would probably think they are okay . I think they are way too expensive for what you get . I thought they would take me to the next level of more intense support , without resorting to compression hose . Barb H.
 What is the point of control top hose if the waistband rolls down constantly . It does n't control anything but my time because I have to keep pulling it up again . I would pass on these .
 Maybe I am too rough on my panty hose but these got a run in them the first day I wore them .

The style is okay , but it rides up in the back , and the wire shifts drastically because it is missing like two inches of wire . Not okay manufactuers , not okay . It arrived ahead of schedule which was great , but now I have to send them back because of the defect with the wire the other stuff I could have dealt with but the wire shift makes it hella uncomforatble to wear all day long . As a big girl I expect these kind of malfunctions when looking for a bra it is just the way it is . Sad but true .
 This bra should be called a minimizer bra . I ordered a 40C and when I put this bra on , I swear I could see my feet ! It was extremely uncomfortable . If I was looking for a bra to smash me down to a smaller size , this would have been ideal . But , I was looking for support and lift . I gave it away to someone who wears a small C and I hope it works better for her . I am a full C and do n't want to be a B !
 This bra is constructed exactly the way I like , with double-ply molded , SEAMLESS cups . But the underwire is slightly too long for my C cup size , and it digs uncomfortably into my underarm , making this maybe the most uncomfortable bra I 've ever tried to wear . I was very disappointed .
 I 've purchased Goddess foundation garments before and experienced great satisfaction ... until now . The bra cups have no elasticity and as a result , do not hold `` the girls '' up and in place . In fact , I 'm sad to report this bra requires constant re-adjustment throughout the day . Yes , I 've been endowed with more than the average gal , but I 've never experienced anything like this . Save your money , and DO N'T buy this bra !
 I bought the Alexander sweatshirt . The quality is substandard . The shoulders are off and the product is basically irregular ! Although the company 's statement shows that they accept returns and exchanges , after I received the item , I discovered that they do not either exchange or return because the item is considered a personal item -LRB- despite the fact that they have these items in stock -RRB- .
 I generally wear a 38x30 , and that 's what I bought in these , they are sized quite a bit smaller in the waste . I 'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in , but you may want to get a waste size up . I 'll be wearing them in a dress office setting , and I 'm surprised how good these look , hopefully they last a long time too .
 for no apparent reason these are humongous . my bf currently wears 32x32 which are a bit short and a bit tight on him so we tried to go a size up - but for some reason these were ginormous !
 my boyfriend currently wears 32x32s that were getting a bit tight and a bit long on him . for some reason these in 34x34 were ridiculously huge ! Returned
 These pants are fake no tags fake packaging.the zipper was broke.I work in 874s for over 25 years an I know how they look an feel an these look an feel &#34; FAKE &#34;
 Just going to list the issues
 My husband always wears 36 30 . He has several Dickie pants ... I got 874 which were the wrong ones . They were stiff and small . I had to return and now pay postage beause they were part of another order making over $ 25 . Also had to go to UPS and post and will have return postage taken out of refund ... My mistake and I paid for it
 Waist is not true to size just like many dickies products , its better if you just go to a store and try them on first
 These pants , for me , where a bit tighter than I thought it would be , also stiffer and smaller than I had hoped .
 I 've been buying Dickies , particularly the 874 's for over 20 years and I was n't impressed with these ones at all . . While the item was clearly marked as a Dickies product , it did n't look or feel like any pair of Dickies I 've ever bought before.The material seemed very thin , and the pants had no factory crease . . Live and learn . .
 Be aware that these run small - At least by a size or more . And they 're straight leg , not boot cut , so there 's a bit of a taper at the ankle .
 i ordered gray and they sent green . GREEN , come on guys really ? at least they were the right size . well done
 I remember when I was a teenager Dickies would last forever ; nowadays they fall apart pretty quickly . I think they must be cutting costs on quality control ...
 I had a pair of Dickies fall apart after a month . Then they would n't honor the warranty . Shady company and now making crap products .
 The pants have so much wrong with them , plus they look awful . It is my guess that dickies enjoys making money at the expense of the customer , both by making them pay too much for them and making them look stupid wearing them .1 . -RRB- CARDBOARD PANTS . They are STIFF . Wash them 100 times and I guarantee you they will still feel like cardboard .2 . -RRB- They are so tapered they barely fit over any boots you wear . Your feet look enormous next to these skinny pants . NO ROOM !! 3 . -RRB- They ride so high on your waist it is uncomfortable4 . -RRB- They are n't sized properly , a 36 is a 34 , 34 is 32 etc. ... STAY AWAY .

 Maybe I am too rough on my panty hose but these got a run in them the first day I wore them .
 I weigh just about 100 lb. , and am 5 ' 1 &#34; . These hose are much too big for me . Since there are no smaller sizes , I ca n't get the help from them that I get from Legs Everyday support hose , three pair for around $ 6.00 . I checked them side by side and the stretch is just as strong on the cheapies , and they are half as big before you put them on , length and inches across . Very disappointed . If you are heavier or have more leg , they are silky feeling or appearing and you would probably think they are okay . I think they are way too expensive for what you get . I thought they would take me to the next level of more intense support , without resorting to compression hose . Barb H.
 What is the point of control top hose if the waistband rolls down constantly . It does n't control anything but my time because I have to keep pulling it up again . I would pass on these .

 This was a really nice jacket . For some reason though we got it in a size too big and the wrong color . It took so long to ship that we just took it to a local store and exchanged it instead of trying to send it back to the company .
 I didnt buy this item but there 's no way it could be worth the $ 28,000 its being sold for . Its seems like a lot for panty hose .

 The previous reviewer is right . Women love to see a man in a thong and not in boxers . Afther I first put a thong on my wife has not stopped telling me how sexy I look.It has converted her in a nifomaniac ! If you want great sex , get a thong . Your woman will love it .
 My opinion as a woman
 I 'm a 40 DD and this bra does n't fit well . The band is a bit too tight and folds down . The cups are a bit too large , even on the highest hook . The front hooks that you use to drop the cup area are like standard bra strap hooks which makes them easy to unhook with one hand , but impossible to hook back with one hand . In fact , it 's easier , since it 's too big , to just pull down the front of the bra than unhook/re-hook . Just did n't work for me !

I 'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in , but you may want to get a waste size up .

 This is a fun and cute little hat . The spinner will bend and not spin without hitting the child 's head unless it is straight . To straighten it , you need to reach under the hat and find the spot in the middle of the underneath side and try to straighten that . It is a bit on the smaller side and does n't stay on easily . Would not recommend buying this unless you do n't mind spending the money for something that wo n't likely stand up to repeated use .
 the color of the shirt was totally different from the swatch . . I did n't like it all

 These are paper thin cotton and feel rough . They may soften if washed a few times but the fabric is so thin they may also disintegrate ! A big thumbs down from me and I 'm usually a CK underwear fan .
 The seams of this bra iched my skin . I actually thru it in the garbage it bothered me so much .
 This suit was a disgrace.The quality was poor , and the sizing was wrong.Very dissatisfied.Returned item immediately.That will be the last time I buy a Armani suit on line .

I had to return and now pay postage beause they were part of another order making over $ 25 . Also had to go to UPS and post and will have return postage taken out of refund ... My mistake and I paid for it
 Waist is not true to size just like many dickies products , its better if you just go to a store and try them on first
 These pants , for me , where a bit tighter than I thought it would be , also stiffer and smaller than I had hoped .
 for no apparent reason these are humongous . my bf currently wears 32x32 which are a bit short and a bit tight on him so we tried to go a size up - but for some reason these were ginormous !
 my boyfriend currently wears 32x32s that were getting a bit tight and a bit long on him . for some reason these in 34x34 were ridiculously huge ! Returned
 These pants are fake no tags fake packaging.the zipper was broke.I work in 874s for over 25 years an I know how they look an feel an these look an feel &#34; FAKE &#34;
 i ordered gray and they sent green . GREEN , come on guys really ? at least they were the right size . well done
 I remember when I was a teenager Dickies would last forever ; nowadays they fall apart pretty quickly . I think they must be cutting costs on quality control ...
 I had a pair of Dickies fall apart after a month . Then they would n't honor the warranty . Shady company and now making crap products .
 The pants have so much wrong with them , plus they look awful . It is my guess that dickies enjoys making money at the expense of the customer , both by making them pay too much for them and making them look stupid wearing them .1 . -RRB- CARDBOARD PANTS . They are STIFF . Wash them 100 times and I guarantee you they will still feel like cardboard .2 . -RRB- They are so tapered they barely fit over any boots you wear . Your feet look enormous next to these skinny pants . NO ROOM !! 3 . -RRB- They ride so high on your waist it is uncomfortable4 . -RRB- They are n't sized properly , a 36 is a 34 , 34 is 32 etc. ... STAY AWAY .

 I 've been buying Dickies , particularly the 874 's for over 20 years and I was n't impressed with these ones at all . . While the item was clearly marked as a Dickies product , it did n't look or feel like any pair of Dickies I 've ever bought before.The material seemed very thin , and the pants had no factory crease . . Live and learn . .
 I generally wear a 38x30 , and that 's what I bought in these , they are sized quite a bit smaller in the waste . I 'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in , but you may want to get a waste size up . I 'll be wearing them in a dress office setting , and I 'm surprised how good these look , hopefully they last a long time too .

 I was so tempted ! And I did it ! Do n't do it ! The quality of the fabric is not what you are hoping for ! The hems rolls incessantly ! I really like this company , have ordered from them for years , but this product really , really bit the dust !!! It did n't turn out AT ALL like pictured ! Very sloppy product . The fabric is horrid . Talk about `` panties in a bunch ... ''
 These are paper thin cotton and feel rough . They may soften if washed a few times but the fabric is so thin they may also disintegrate ! A big thumbs down from me and I 'm usually a CK underwear fan .

 I was looking for a comfortable , well made thong . It was not comfortable at all ... and was more skimpy than it seemed in the photo . If you have any sort of a tummy ... I suggest skipping this one .
 I tried these because I love the body lace camisole , but the crotch coverage is just too small and does n't do the trick .

 These are paper thin cotton and feel rough . They may soften if washed a few times but the fabric is so thin they may also disintegrate ! A big thumbs down from me and I 'm usually a CK underwear fan .
 I ordered the Adult 's Orphan Annie Costume -LRB- Size : Large 11-13 -RRB- , but was sent the CHILD 'S large by mistake . after slitting the sleeves i can just barely get into the annie costume zipping it all the way up . since i altered the costume , i ca n't return it , but i can wear it as a top with a red skirt of mine , and i also have a white belt i can use as the belt it came with was useless , being too small . i like the peter pan collar though !
 What was I thinking buying Lee ? Maybe it was the price . The right size . Must have been out of my mind.These jeans , if they can be called jeans , are cheap and flimsy compared to Levis . I work in the field and industrial environments and these jeans just did n't hold up . From the odd pocket designs to the absurd Lee logo which serves as a belt loop to the flimsy quality of the denim -LRB- i hope it is denim -RRB- , these jeans have been epic failures all around.I would have rated them lower but they , technically , still function to protect my legs.Results of wearing these jeans into the field ? Holes , tears , snags , and rips . They might be ok for casual wear ... but if you are looking for a high-quality pair of jeans that will last , look elsewhere .
 I have purchased Lee regular sized straight leg jeans for a long time . But I put on a little weight and needed a 46 waist , so I ordered big and tall straight leg jeans . They were a very long way from straight leg jeans . Very large lower legs just bell bottoms from the 70 's . I guess they are cut in that loose fit , sloppy , &#34; relaxed &#34; style . Had I known that the cut was going to be a radical departure from regular cut Lee jeans I would have bought something else . These jeans hang sag and bag , fit sloppy and look sloppy . I think when you cross over into big and tall you have to be prepared for a different cut . I do not recall reading anywhere that these would be cut in a different style , just larger sizes . I understood that in order to get them in a 46 waist it was the only option . I am a fatty , so I say this with true respect . Instead of Big and Tall these jeans would be better classified as Big and Thick because there is a lot of room in them to accomidate large sized legs . I see lots of teens running around with pants that look like these . Not my thing . I just want traditional blues jeans . Lee and Wrangler have been my mainstay for a long time . But Big and Tall cut jeans cut with excessive amounts of material will give me cause to search for something else . Maybe Carhartts
 These are enough smaller than other 52w jeans I wear on a daily basis that I ca n't zip them . The smaller size may be what Lee means by regular fit , but it still renders them unwearable in my case . Live and learn I guess .
 Western Pack Take-It-Easy Fanny Pack -LRB- Black -RRB-
 These are paper thin cotton and feel rough . They may soften if washed a few times but the fabric is so thin they may also disintegrate ! A big thumbs down from me and I 'm usually a CK underwear fan .
 This bra had such terrible fit problems -- the fabric was cheap looking . The cups were poorly molded and they did not lay flat to the body when wearing . This was purchased for the simple silhouette and strap style but overall the fit was totally off .
 In the past found this Danskin bra -- both straight strap design and high percent -LRB- 90 or so -RRB- cotton material -- comfortable for all activities . Lycra or polyester now almost half of the content and the comfort and absorbency are gone . This was a superior product . Now ruined by cheap downgrade in manufacturing process . Big disappointment to find it scratchy instead of getting high quality cotton .

 I am very disappointed in the T-Shirt that I received . Not only does it have small flaws but it is NOT the T-Shirt that is pictured on the web site . I will NOT be ordering anything else from this vendor .
 We have purchased Russell Athletic tshirts in the past and they were very true to size . My husband is 6 ' 6 '' and this `` tall '' size is at least 4 '' -6 '' short in the length compared to Reebok , Nautica and Cutter & Buck . Such a disappointment . I even washed them in cold water . I will say that the quality of the material of the shirt is good but does me no good if he wo n't wear them . Will NEVER buy these again !
 I bought these shirts because i have a hard time finding good shirts for tall people -LRB- 6 ' 3 '' 270lbs -RRB- . These shirts all shrank up in just a couple of washed the carhartt tall shirts have been far superior to these and so I will not be buying any more of these shirts .
 Disappointing ! This t-shirt shrank about five -LRB- ! -RRB- inches in the length even though I followed laundering directions on the label .
 I order 2 extra long shirts to try . I ordered 1 red 1 grey . When the package came the first thing noticed was the red shirt was in a smaller bag size than the grey shirt . Upon opening , the grey shirt had cardboard that the sirt was wrapped around . The red shirt had no cardboard that the shirt was wrapped around . The grey shirt had no size tag on the back of the neck for the size just a stamp and made in Pakistan . The red shirt had tag with the size Russel brand and made in Pakistan . I put the grey shirt on , it on and it was very good in size and length . Loose fitting all around and nice and log . I then tried the red shirt , it was tight fitting , almost choking me around the neck and clearly shorter in length than the grey shirt that came in the same package . I placed both out on the bed and the red shirt was around 2 inches shorter in width 3 inches shorter in length and the neckline was an inch shorter and the sleeves were not as wide.Maybe they shipped me a returned shirt that was washed and shrunk ? Who knows but a 2XT with 2 different packaging , tags and sizes is not acceptable quality imho . I will be returning both shirts .
 Quality not very good . My expectations for a Russell Athletic product were not met . To me , the material was of a very low grade .
 this shirt started out at 34 '' length after wash and dried on low heat it was 32 '' inches long so cant where it which is bad new because it cost a lot more than the others i bought of other brands , i would recommend no one over 6.0 to 6.2 buy this i am 6.7 and it is way to short unless you like showing you back off and if that 's the case save the money and do n't wear a shirt
 For years I have loved Russell Athletic products -LRB- I have one shirt that I have worn at least 500 times and it still looks new -RRB- , but then my local Academy stopped carrying them . Although I prefer to buy locally , I had no choice and so ordered from Amazon . One of the shirts I bought came out of its third laundry cycle with the sleeve seams split in several places . Not what I had expected !
 The first time my son wore this shirt the length was great , as soon as I washed and dried -LRB- on low -RRB- the shirt shrunk . Do not wash , this shirt will shrink drastically . At least 3 inches .
 The packaging had dead insects in it , and in one of the 3 shirts there was a hole in it , near the collar . Whether it was a sewing mistake or insect munching , I do n't know .
 At first I was thrilled that I finally found a 2XT Tee Shirt that was actually cut for a tall person and not a fatty.The material also had a nice thickness to it , which has become a problem with many garments of late.After some inspection , I realized that the construction of one of the shirts was so far off that I had to go back to see if I ordered a blemish or factory second.If you pay $ 30.00 -LRB- with shipping -RRB- for a Tee Shirt , you should n't expect such an awful job . One of the side seams is fine , but the other starts at the armpit and then takes a sharp turn , ending close to the middle of the back . Not only does this look ridiculous , but I feel the pulling from this terribly made shirt.The packaging said that this shirt was made in Pakistan , which might be the reason for this reject of a shirt.Shirt companies were having shirts made in Mexico and Honduras , which was a slight decline from what is made in the US , but this is just unacceptable.What is next , $ 40.00 for a Tee Shirt made in Madagascar ?????
 I ordered 3 of these and they were not only on the small side , they also had significant size differences between supposedly equal sized shirts ... Someone slip some irregulars into this batch ?
 These are paper thin cotton and feel rough . They may soften if washed a few times but the fabric is so thin they may also disintegrate ! A big thumbs down from me and I 'm usually a CK underwear fan .

 In the past found this Danskin bra -- both straight strap design and high percent -LRB- 90 or so -RRB- cotton material -- comfortable for all activities . Lycra or polyester now almost half of the content and the comfort and absorbency are gone . This was a superior product . Now ruined by cheap downgrade in manufacturing process . Big disappointment to find it scratchy instead of getting high quality cotton .
 ever shopped at the Gibson store for their products ? Only if you need to feel ANGER or Hilarious ! $ 85 for a Tee-shirt !! $ 97 for a decent `` mechanic shirt '' !!! This dragonfly is not my style , more like a Hawaiian-looking to me , but my Fender and Gretsch-wearing friends will hae to keep laughing at my `` not-guitar '' shirts when we jam and gig . If Gibson gets a single govt . subsidy dollar to make up for their PP marketing , I will throw up !!
 This bra had such terrible fit problems -- the fabric was cheap looking . The cups were poorly molded and they did not lay flat to the body when wearing . This was purchased for the simple silhouette and strap style but overall the fit was totally off .
 After never recieving the item all I recieved was the run around . After filing a grievance with Amazon I was able to get a refund .
 First shipment - size was way too big when I went by the advice of their web site . To send them back I was warned to insure the order or they could be lost in the mail . There goes about $ 7 on top of the first $ 17 + shipping and handling.After a couple of weeks they send the next shipment with the right color shirts with the wrong color pants . So , I mail the pants back , and add another $ 7 . This time , they now send me two of the three pants in at least an extra large size with a `` medium '' size tag on them . The third pair of pants are obviously a small size with a `` medium '' tag and a big flaw down the front making them totally un-wearable . I have given up at this point . I wo n't pay a total of $ 38 in addition to the initial shipping and handling charges for these `` $ 17 '' pants.I am wearing the extra large pants to work , and when people laugh and ask me what I 'm doing wearing such large pants , I can tell them about the crappiest service I have ever gotten so they can avoid this web site .
 I bought this Western Pack about 6 months ago and the main buckle has already broken . The tag says to mail back with $ 15 for handling . . The pack is not worth $ 15 ... live and learn . Buyers beware this pack has a cheap plastic buckle that cracked within a few months .
 The way the products are linked together is misleading . All the sizes on the page make it very hard to tell what are the junior and what are the kids sizes . thought I was ordering one , got the other . Price and quality where great though . I would have spent more sending them back than I spent buying them . So I have 3 pair of worthless shorts now .
 I purchased this item thinking that it would make a nice gift , but upon receiving it found it looks and feels like something from a dollar store , and it 's not even worth the dollar.Very cheezy item .
 I ordered 4 pairs of LARGE , and the shorts are way too small -- might fit a 10 year old !
 Is this a joke or what ? These are n't an adult X-large they are a childs medium . It wo n't pay to send them back because of the shipping so I wasted $ 7.99 on a cleaning rag .

 I got these for my daughter as her swim yeam uniform . They are a terrible cut . They look really like old school gym shorts .
 I was looking for some gym shorts for my little girl . These said they were for children . The shorts were adult size . I was stuck with them as to ship them back would cost more that I paid for them . I threw them in the garbage .
 I purchased a white one and it looked great.However , the only pro was looks and there were more cons.The hoodie is very thin and is n't worth wearing for fall nor winter.The inside cotton gets stuck onto clothing . It is not a smart idea to wear dark colors underneath it especially black.It 's a nice brand , not worth the price and there are better ones out there .
 I was looking for the biggest size possible for a Halloween Costume . The sizing chart was n't there , so I chose the biggest size they offered . They would not fit a truly PLUS woman , let alone a guy . Seller should offer a complete size chart and say what size you would need depending on height/weight .
 Can not purchase product as Merchant Sizing Chart is not available . Sizes listed are A/B , C/D , E/F - when you click the appropriate link their are no sizing charts suitable to allow you to select and purchase item online .
 this style does not say if it is Sandalfoot or reinforced toe ... could n't buy because of that
 I 've always loved this brand of pantyhose in the past , because of the great feel and fit , but some things have changed and not for the better . I ordered 5 pairs . Four in the `` barely there '' color , which is now a horrible orangish color instead of being `` barely there '' like they used to be , and one pair in a `` barely black '' , which is a nice color . I ordered pairs for both my daughter and myself , using the size chart . We both had problems with the length , being too short for both of us . The `` barely there '' color is really horrible , like a bad tan . I 'm sending back the three pairs that we did n't try on . I definitely wo n't be buying these again .
 Given the positive reviews that folks have left for Hanes Sheer Panty Hose , I was excited when my sheer Jet -LRB- black -RRB- pair came in the mail . Unfortunately , I only was able to wear them one day to work before noticing that they had pulled all over the back of my legs , both left and right . There must 've been hundreds of dark lines that formed over the course of the day , they looked completely ridiculous and I will certainly never be able to wear them again . I have never purchased a pair of sheer hose that I was only able to wear once , and given the quality of this pair , I wo n't bother trying again with Hanes . What a disappointment .

 These are factory 2nd that were not the size they claim them to be . I would not order from this company again .
 I buy these - become fed up , swear off of them , and then buy them again - no more . They always run the first day - and they run both ways . They should refer to them as disposable . -LRB- I ran the pair today before lunch -RRB- .
 I purchased a white one and it looked great.However , the only pro was looks and there were more cons.The hoodie is very thin and is n't worth wearing for fall nor winter.The inside cotton gets stuck onto clothing . It is not a smart idea to wear dark colors underneath it especially black.It 's a nice brand , not worth the price and there are better ones out there .

 Not much to say about this , really . The picture on the product page accurately represents what you 're gon na get in terms of style but one thing the picture ca n't show you is how it 's going to fit on your face . In short , it does n't fit . At all . This mask is enormous . The sides will stick out from your head a solid 2 inches in both directions . I hate it . I HATE IT ! Do n't buy this unless you have the ability to transform into a huge green rage monster and you 're worried that it might happen at a masquerade ball . In which case , keep this mask on you at all times . It would fit a head twice the size of a normal humans perfectly .
 My husband always wears 36 30 . He has several Dickie pants ... I got 874 which were the wrong ones . They were stiff and small . I had to return and now pay postage beause they were part of another order making over $ 25 . Also had to go to UPS and post and will have return postage taken out of refund ... My mistake and I paid for it
 i ordered gray and they sent green . GREEN , come on guys really ? at least they were the right size . well done
 I remember when I was a teenager Dickies would last forever ; nowadays they fall apart pretty quickly . I think they must be cutting costs on quality control ...
 I had a pair of Dickies fall apart after a month . Then they would n't honor the warranty . Shady company and now making crap products .
 The pants have so much wrong with them , plus they look awful . It is my guess that dickies enjoys making money at the expense of the customer , both by making them pay too much for them and making them look stupid wearing them .1 . -RRB- CARDBOARD PANTS . They are STIFF . Wash them 100 times and I guarantee you they will still feel like cardboard .2 . -RRB- They are so tapered they barely fit over any boots you wear . Your feet look enormous next to these skinny pants . NO ROOM !! 3 . -RRB- They ride so high on your waist it is uncomfortable4 . -RRB- They are n't sized properly , a 36 is a 34 , 34 is 32 etc. ... STAY AWAY .
 Waist is not true to size just like many dickies products , its better if you just go to a store and try them on first
 These pants , for me , where a bit tighter than I thought it would be , also stiffer and smaller than I had hoped .
 I 've been buying Dickies , particularly the 874 's for over 20 years and I was n't impressed with these ones at all . . While the item was clearly marked as a Dickies product , it did n't look or feel like any pair of Dickies I 've ever bought before.The material seemed very thin , and the pants had no factory crease . . Live and learn . .
 Be aware that these run small - At least by a size or more . And they 're straight leg , not boot cut , so there 's a bit of a taper at the ankle .
 for no apparent reason these are humongous . my bf currently wears 32x32 which are a bit short and a bit tight on him so we tried to go a size up - but for some reason these were ginormous !
 my boyfriend currently wears 32x32s that were getting a bit tight and a bit long on him . for some reason these in 34x34 were ridiculously huge ! Returned
 These pants are fake no tags fake packaging.the zipper was broke.I work in 874s for over 25 years an I know how they look an feel an these look an feel &#34; FAKE &#34;
 Just going to list the issues
 I generally wear a 38x30 , and that 's what I bought in these , they are sized quite a bit smaller in the waste . I 'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in , but you may want to get a waste size up . I 'll be wearing them in a dress office setting , and I 'm surprised how good these look , hopefully they last a long time too .
 Accidentally hit &#34; one click &#34; purchase when there was a lower price range than is currently shown . They were DEFINITELY not worth $ 10 and despite being very very very careful , they got a run after wearing twice . Worthless .
 I have n't actually put the tights on yet but when I first took it out of the packaging , it smelled a little odd . I follow the principle that it 's always good to wash clothing items before I wear them . I hand-washed these tights using some gentle handsoap . The first thing I noticed was that the nylon smells like vomit . I kid you not . I thought that this was only when it was wet , because some fabrics have an odd smell when they are wet , but even after I hang-dried these tights for 24 hours , they still smelled this way . Therefore , I am soaking them in laundry detergent and water right now , hoping that the smell will go away . I would n't purchase this again because I have a sensitive nose !
 The shipping was fast , I loved them when I saw them but I could only wear them about 3 times and they broke . I 'm not sure about the quality of these panty hose but I have a pair from Victoria Secret and I have had them for over a year . I guess you get what you pay for ...
 I have fair to medium skin tone so I ordered ` Cafe A Lait ' because it appeared to be slightly lighter than ` Natural ' . Instead , I received ` Cafe AU Lait ' , a different color entirely . I 'm not sure if ` cafe A lait ' exists and there was just a typo when entering AU lait , but it still does n't make sense because AU lait was an option as we 'll , and it appeared much darker . Either way , I 'm disappointed because I do n't want to deal with paying to return these because someone shipped me the wrong order and risk receiving another wrong color .
 I never got to wear them . I tried them on to see if they fit and took them back off again . Two days later I went to put them on to wear with the dress I was going to wear to go out , and found that there was a big hole in the back part of one foot . It must have happened in taking them off when I tried them on , but I was n't aware of anything having happened . I had to put makeup on my legs and go bare legged . Not a happy camper . If we can make materials that astronauts can wear in outerspace , we should be able to make nylons that can survive a little longer than these did .
 I could n't find regular navy pantyhose , so I bought these instead . I hate pantyhose that are too small and creep down your legs , so I usually buy a size bigger than I need , which I did with these . I bought size EF and they are SO SMALL ! I could n't even get them on . Keep looking if you 're searching for comfortable pantyhose .

 These nylons were not only overpriced but they broke before I even put them on . I was so frustrated ... it was not worth it . You are better off getting nylons at walgreens or rite aide .
 Sizing was fine , but they have a ` texture ' to them which caused them to get pulls quickly and were n't very comfortable to wear .

 This listing indicated these socks are 100 % cotton . They are not as advertised . The socks I received were 79 % cotton so were not suitable for the person for which they were intended

 For me the visor broke fairly soon , thus making it not worth a repeat purchase . I think the visor is the weakness of the product - it 's a flimsy piece of fairly brittle plastic . For hats , I need something I can put in my pocket and it does n't break , my kids can sit on it and it does n't break etc. .
 I love this hat and I am lucky enough to learn how to sew yard with thread ! It must be a second because I am constantly sewing a hole here and there . Warm though and has a visor .
 I was very disappointed with this item . I wanted to wear it to football games this fall . I do n't think it will even fit my eight year old .
 This hat came to me very quickly which i was very pleased with , however i only got an hour of use out of it before all the stiching started to come undone both on the top and around the visor . Other than that it was a warm snug hat .
 I was really happy when I received this item in the mail and I was impatient to wear it however when I was opening it up . I found attached to the visor , a sticker that said , `` This product contains lead , a chemical known to the state of California to cause cancer , birth detects and other reproductive harm . '' - ________________ -
 This hat may appear to be a decent hat for the money , but it is made poorly . I 'd write more about it , but I do n't want to waste my time on such a useless article of clothing .
 It is very cute but ... it ripped along a seam after the second use . Also since the bottom of the handle is not a hook but buzz , you ca n't hang it up to dry .
 for the price and customer service on this item , i was very pleased and will reorder when the time arrises . GREAT PRICE , GREAT PRODUCT !!!

 I purchased a white one and it looked great.However , the only pro was looks and there were more cons.The hoodie is very thin and is n't worth wearing for fall nor winter.The inside cotton gets stuck onto clothing . It is not a smart idea to wear dark colors underneath it especially black.It 's a nice brand , not worth the price and there are better ones out there .
 I could n't find regular navy pantyhose , so I bought these instead . I hate pantyhose that are too small and creep down your legs , so I usually buy a size bigger than I need , which I did with these . I bought size EF and they are SO SMALL ! I could n't even get them on . Keep looking if you 're searching for comfortable pantyhose .
 I have n't actually put the tights on yet but when I first took it out of the packaging , it smelled a little odd . I follow the principle that it 's always good to wash clothing items before I wear them . I hand-washed these tights using some gentle handsoap . The first thing I noticed was that the nylon smells like vomit . I kid you not . I thought that this was only when it was wet , because some fabrics have an odd smell when they are wet , but even after I hang-dried these tights for 24 hours , they still smelled this way . Therefore , I am soaking them in laundry detergent and water right now , hoping that the smell will go away . I would n't purchase this again because I have a sensitive nose !
 The shipping was fast , I loved them when I saw them but I could only wear them about 3 times and they broke . I 'm not sure about the quality of these panty hose but I have a pair from Victoria Secret and I have had them for over a year . I guess you get what you pay for ...
 I have fair to medium skin tone so I ordered ` Cafe A Lait ' because it appeared to be slightly lighter than ` Natural ' . Instead , I received ` Cafe AU Lait ' , a different color entirely . I 'm not sure if ` cafe A lait ' exists and there was just a typo when entering AU lait , but it still does n't make sense because AU lait was an option as we 'll , and it appeared much darker . Either way , I 'm disappointed because I do n't want to deal with paying to return these because someone shipped me the wrong order and risk receiving another wrong color .
 I never got to wear them . I tried them on to see if they fit and took them back off again . Two days later I went to put them on to wear with the dress I was going to wear to go out , and found that there was a big hole in the back part of one foot . It must have happened in taking them off when I tried them on , but I was n't aware of anything having happened . I had to put makeup on my legs and go bare legged . Not a happy camper . If we can make materials that astronauts can wear in outerspace , we should be able to make nylons that can survive a little longer than these did .
 These nylons were not only overpriced but they broke before I even put them on . I was so frustrated ... it was not worth it . You are better off getting nylons at walgreens or rite aide .
 Sizing was fine , but they have a ` texture ' to them which caused them to get pulls quickly and were n't very comfortable to wear .
 Accidentally hit &#34; one click &#34; purchase when there was a lower price range than is currently shown . They were DEFINITELY not worth $ 10 and despite being very very very careful , they got a run after wearing twice . Worthless .
 I hardly ever leave reviews unless I think a product is really good , or as in this case other shoppers need to beware . Now ... Since I already own some Russell Athletic T-shirts like the one pictured for this product , I went ahead and purchased two . I did n't recieve what was shown on the website or described in the product description . The shirts I recieved were of much lighter fabric and holes quickly developed on the bottom of the pockets . The fit is okay , but I 'm still not real satisfied with the purchase . I should have been sent what was shown in the picture and not something cheaper and of less quality . Amazon needs to monitor their sellers a little better !!
 Russell Athletic Men 's Big & Tall Basic Short Sleeve Solid Crew Neck T-Shirt With Chest PocketI purchased 4 shirts . When I received them the material was puckered along the seams under the arms . Looked like a high school home economic class did the sewing . The seam joints were misaligned also.I subsequently bought shirts from another supplier made in the same country and the workmanship was excellent . This may have been a problem with one assembly organization .
 Sure the shirt is good , but if I was n't a big fatty , I could get 6 or more Fruit of The Loom pocket T 's for the price of one big fatty T . But it 's like trying to buy a drink at a movie theater - they can charge what they want because you 're stuck .
 Shirts are probably fine but took stupid amazon two and half months to get them in , kept giving me the run around , and I still do n't have them . do n't count on a refund either as long as they are `` on the way '' what a joke .
 I 've worn Russell tees for about 30 years now . I 'm 6 ' 2 '' tall , and used to weigh 260 - 270 pounds ; they used to fit , not shrink , and have neck room.I 'm down to 230 pounds , but as soon as I wash the shirt , it shrinks - even in cold water wash , and delicate dry . The neck size is more like for someone that wears a medium.I had to `` stretch '' / pull the shirt to be able to wear it ; upon the 2nd washing I noticed that the stitching is falling apart.Only the Russell Premium has held up -LRB- although the neck size is smaller than XL -RRB- . All tee shirts are becoming like this - I too think it 's due to poor craftsmanship & sizes running smaller - due to being made outside of U.S. , with no real quality control in place.Gary
 I could not recommend this product unless changes are made . I purchased several of these shirts not long ago and they were great . However , I recently purchased two and they lost at least two sizes after the first washing . The lengths were almost four inches shorter . I just wear them around the house now . The previous shirts had a label printed on the inner collar . The newer ones have a label attached to the inner collar . So , they are obviously different and probably manufactured at different locations . Not very good product quality control . I have ordered more shirts , but from a different manufacturer .
 i bought 5x 's . and they fit like they are 3x 's . i was very dissapointed in this tee shirt . i would not recomend them to any one
 every piece of clothing is under going repairs from the first day . how about american made products .
 Ordered two of the XXL tall Russell t-shirts and after one wash the red one shrunk and can not be worn again . The red one was made in Pakistan and the black one we ordered was made in China . The black one did not shrink . Would not order these again .
 for no apparent reason these are humongous . my bf currently wears 32x32 which are a bit short and a bit tight on him so we tried to go a size up - but for some reason these were ginormous !
 my boyfriend currently wears 32x32s that were getting a bit tight and a bit long on him . for some reason these in 34x34 were ridiculously huge ! Returned
 These pants are fake no tags fake packaging.the zipper was broke.I work in 874s for over 25 years an I know how they look an feel an these look an feel &#34; FAKE &#34;
 I generally wear a 38x30 , and that 's what I bought in these , they are sized quite a bit smaller in the waste . I 'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in , but you may want to get a waste size up . I 'll be wearing them in a dress office setting , and I 'm surprised how good these look , hopefully they last a long time too .
 Just going to list the issues
 i ordered gray and they sent green . GREEN , come on guys really ? at least they were the right size . well done
 I remember when I was a teenager Dickies would last forever ; nowadays they fall apart pretty quickly . I think they must be cutting costs on quality control ...
 I had a pair of Dickies fall apart after a month . Then they would n't honor the warranty . Shady company and now making crap products .
 My husband always wears 36 30 . He has several Dickie pants ... I got 874 which were the wrong ones . They were stiff and small . I had to return and now pay postage beause they were part of another order making over $ 25 . Also had to go to UPS and post and will have return postage taken out of refund ... My mistake and I paid for it
 I 've been buying Dickies , particularly the 874 's for over 20 years and I was n't impressed with these ones at all . . While the item was clearly marked as a Dickies product , it did n't look or feel like any pair of Dickies I 've ever bought before.The material seemed very thin , and the pants had no factory crease . . Live and learn . .
 Be aware that these run small - At least by a size or more . And they 're straight leg , not boot cut , so there 's a bit of a taper at the ankle .
 Waist is not true to size just like many dickies products , its better if you just go to a store and try them on first
 These pants , for me , where a bit tighter than I thought it would be , also stiffer and smaller than I had hoped .

 Their costumes are mis-represented and they are not honorable in their business dealings ... I have had a terrible experience trying to return a costume that was three sizes smaller than they said it was . They are rude and arrogant -

 for the price and customer service on this item , i was very pleased and will reorder when the time arrises . GREAT PRICE , GREAT PRODUCT !!!
 was not happy w this bra . the inside of the cup did have a seam and it was not comfotable .
 I wore it once and never wore it again . It makes my `` girls '' look pokey and weird . And it was a bit small .

 Bought this , and was shipped super fast but the quality of the stitching was subpar for under 20 dollars the sticthes had to be reinforced the day he put it on and the following 6 days he wore it . Great price but bad workmenship .
 The back only has one velcro at the top and leaves a big gap on the middle back . Would be great if they added another velcro to close the middle back
 The boots is missing and not included in the package as stated . The material is not of good quality compare to the price of the outfit . I was forced to buy this outfit as my 4 year old son is really into it . He 's kind of excited for awhile and lost interest later .
 My three year old loves this costume ... it really is the cutest I 've seen , but he has had it for several hours and already the seams are ripping out , the S is coming off of the front and the fabric is tearing . Day two , had my mother re-sew all the seams , fabric is still terrible but hopefully will last several more outings ! Sad because this is a very cute costume .
 My son really likes his costume , since it arrived 2 days ago he 's wanted to wear it non-stop . But it 's really poorly made . Since we unpacked it the superman logo on the chest was coming off on one side , I had to glue it back on . And several seams are coming undone -LRB- from the very first day -RRB- , so I have to keep sewing them back together . Last year we bought a Buzz Lightyear costume that 's still in perfect shape except for some fading from washing and my son has worn it almost everyday for a year . I was hoping this Superman costume would hold up just as well , but I doubt it .

 Quick shipping by vendor , costume cute , but material/fabric on the arms was very `` itchy / scatchy '' and ripped immediately so I had to buy another costume because my daughter would not wear it -- seems to run small & hat did not fit .
 Dockers are Dockers , so that 's not the problem . Just be sure you do n't trust the images if you choose to buy these via Amazon . `` Cafe , '' for example , should be `` Coffee . '' Despite the fact that the image for `` Cafe '' shows a stone or very light gray color , `` Cafe '' is actually dark brown . So the product is n't defective , but IS misleading
 I have worn these pants for years ; my size is the same as always . I could n't get them on ; they were so tight I could n't get the button buttoned around the waist . What is going on ? These pants seemed to be cut for a skinny 25 year old , not someone who is a little on the hefty side . Further , the shipping and handling charges are just out of sight ... $ 16.95 above and beyond the already rather pricy product . I would not recommend doing business with this seller at all . You can go to other outlets and get the same thing without the shipping and handling , and there are `` deals '' out there from major store chains . I was really disappointed in this product and the seller . Go to WalMart and get their khakis ; they are very inexpensive and wear like iron .
 I have bought dockers for years but these are cut smaller than they usually are . Even with the `` stretch '' waist band they are tight . So much for an `` extra '' inch . Beware . Try these in a store before you buy .
 I DID NOT GET THE SLACK THAT HAD THE WAISTBAND . I GOT SLACK WITH NO WAISTBAND , SO I SEND THEM BACK AN WAS TRYING TO GE A 42 29 BUT I RECEIVED A E MAIL STATETING THAT THE PRODUCT WAS NO LONGER AVABILITY . SO FAR I ` AM NOT SURE WERE MY REFUND WENT . PLEASE LET ME KNOW.TOM ATKINSON
 I agree , these are cut small ... Buy an inch or two larger than you normally do . The waist band does NOT stretch .
 I got the shippment quickly . But wrong items was sent . I have to return it to the seller . I got the refund pretty quick , but only for the value of product . I spent about & 10 for two way shipping without geting anything .
 Did not like the pants at all , and threw them in the trash rather than pay return postage . Flimsy , smelled of dye , cheap fabric , etc. . Too bad .
 Merchant was out of stock on the second pair of pants , so when it was shipped I was charged $ 9 again when the second pair was in stock weeks later.Will not buy from Amazon vendors again .
 If you search for Super Saver shipping this advertisement comes up , but this product is not shipped by Amazon is does not go out with the Super Saver shipping , and the cost of shipping is nearly 20 % the cost of the pants .
 I must echo the sentiment of the other reviewer who mentioned that she has gotten much more wear out of much cheaper brands . This is my second pair of Spanx - the first time I bought full pantyhose and they ran in the toe within 3 hours of my first wear , so I decided to try the footless and I got a run in the leg just putting them on for the first time ! I am better off with cheaper control top hose and/or cheaper hose with separate control top panties . I really think that Spanx has become too popular and quality has gone out the window for the sake of mass production .
 I heard about your product on OPRAH and was impressed so I ordered 2 pair even though they are pretty pricey . I thought they would be worth it if they were the quality I expected . Well , I loved the way they felt when I put them on and also how my clothes looked ... but I had only been at work 2 hours when I was showing them to a friend and noticed a RUN right down the front !!!!!! I was so disappointed to find that they are n't made any better than regular panty hose even though they cost more ... they would really be a great product if they were made of stronger fiber to resist runs ! Needless to say , I waisted my money.Linda McCollumMadison , Ms.
 After placing this order , I waited several weeks for its arrival to no avail . I received an email telling me that the product would arrive late in an untimely manner . While awaiting arrival , I found the same product at half of the price I paid this company in a local store .

 The shipping was fast . But the quality was very bad . It 's genuine leather of lowest grade possible . The price should tell . I ordered burgundy color . I was still not prepared to see such poor stuff . Quite a few spots have loose threads right out of box . A couple of spots along the thread line have thread holes but no threads . Inside , the corners are showing fringes . Inside leather also has black marks here and there . Very very poor quality . I do n't even think it can pass any normal quality inspection . If they sell such stuff , they should be honest and mark it as `` not quite right '' . Very disappointed . I 'm returning it .
 I ordered a size c , although my weight and height put me in a b. I ordered big just to be comfy . I think i need a size f ! These were soooo tight . These are awful for a pregnant person . I couldnt even get them past my thighs . Sending them back . I got the skinny britches instead . Way more comfy .
 If you have any problem with itchy skin over your belly , I do n't recommend this ! A half hour into wearing it , I was going nuts ! The belly panel is like a very sheer pantyhose fabric , and the second time I wore it , it had a tear already . Just not worth the money !
 I was very excited to see that SPANX had a maternity line and bought a pair of these in black . I put them on , they felt great and was happy with the level of support . On my second trip to the ladies room I was pulling them up and the whole front panel ran like a pair of stockings . Trust me this was a fabric/deisign issue - I have short nails and was extremely careful rolling them back on.I was extremely disappointed - this is an expensive item , especially when you are pregnant and trying to manage a maternity wardrobe suitable for the office . I have no idea if there is another alternative .
 This is a great idea ... except after only wearing them 2 times the extremely sheer panty-hose type material over the belly ran . I had multiple runs popping over the belly and I was only in my first tri-mester . No , I 'm not overweight , I 'm not overly aggressive tugging them on . I suspect , however that later in the pregnancy tugging them on would be necessary considering the belly will grow . These are COMPLETELY worthless and total waste of money !
 At the beginning I was very happy with panties however after 2 weeks of very careful wear only hand washing them and air drying them they ripped in 3 different places . I am very disappointed as I was so careful with them . If you wash them you ca n't return them so I am very upset about the purchase
 I purchased this despite the poor reviews and boy did I regret it ! I always was items before wearing and one time in the wash destroyed it ! I took it out of the wash machine and the belly panel had a bunch of runs in it . The material they use on the belly panel is the cheapest panty hose material they must make . I put it on and the panel literally fell apart . Do n't buy this item !
 Do yourself a favor and save $ 32.00 . These shorts are ready for the trash after just a few times you wear and wash them . Cheaper version are much more resistant !
 Let me preface this by saying this is the first Spanx product I 've ordered that I have n't liked . While I have n't actually worn them , I 've only tried them on twice , I am disappointed in the amount of support it provides . I ordered a size B as per the sizing recommendation based on the website . The back band is baggy and sags beneath my shirt . This would be a problem if I was wearing a dress as it would show through the fabric , I have to keep pulling it up . I was hoping for a product that would provide some compression/ligament support in the upper legs , and belly support in front . This product does not do that . Again , I think it 's probably a matter of getting the correct size . I have contacted the seller to ask whether it 's possible to exchange for a smaller size , just beware of the size guidelines given . If you are on the fence about what size to go with and are hoping for more support , go with the smaller size !
 I had runs begin in the very first wear ... not even in the belly panel as you would expect , but the thicker material on the legs . By the third wear I had runs all over and one seam 's thread was loose .
 I 'm on my husbands account , as I ordered these after the doctor recommending I get a support belt . I ordered several products and the reviews on the Mama Spanx products are very misleading . This is a sheer and flimsy pantyhose that does not have any supportive elements to it , smoothes out a bit , but feels tight and sticky . Plus , I have issues with yeast infections when pregnant -LRB- I know , kinda tmi , but extremely common during pregnancy !! -RRB- and this seemed to make them happen more often . I found success with a much more superior product that focuses more on the support and smoothing elements I was looking for , plus it 's worn over pants or my maternity jeans kinda like a belly band , so it 's much easier to wear everyday with my clothes . They should be paying me to promote their product because I still tell all my pregnant girlfriends about it even though my son is now almost 2 ! ha !
 I found that this is okay for smoothing lines in clothing just like panty hose but I did not feel `` supported '' in my tummy which was the main goal of this purchase . It almost feels as though it pulls down on my tummy making things even more uncomfortable than before I put it on .

 I ordered this for my daughter for kindergarten . The zipper was broken upon delivery rendering the backpack useless . I guess you really do get what you pay for ! I did n't try to return it as it 's more trouble than it 's worth , but I am very disappointed . : -LRB-
 i really liked this back pack at first but after a couple months one strap broke off and i tied it together then the other one did the same now time to get a new better quality one :{ i think my son ran with it while books were in it and it couldnt take the weight
 Very thin material for absolutely perfect figure.dress is very open and extremely short.That can be good for some hollywood night clubs or tet-a-tet dinner with you life partner.Most of boyfriends would not let you wear it in public

 I am mind boggled that a fairly expensive and seemingly well made product such as this was n't tested before marketing to see if the clasps actually held the briefcase closed . THEY DO N'T . They are cheaply made - particularly in comparison to the rest of the case - and do not hold the case closed when there is anything as heavy as laptop in it . It is absolutely infuriating to not be able to use the handle at all , and only be able to use the shoulder strap in the ` lightest ' of situations , without the bag spilling open . Buckles , straps , latches - anyting would have been more effective than these clasps . Think twice before you get this product . I 'm needing to find a leatherworker or cobbler who can add buckles and straps to mine , to save it from being utterly useless .
 The case is is best part of the kit , although I 'll just throw the ALICE clip away . It should have some larger needles , heavier thread . I was expecting something like what I was Issued when I entered the military in 1967 . This is far inferior to that . This is more suited for a debutante to patch her panties with it than to make any field repairs to field equipment , uniforms , outdoor clothing , etc. . I 'll have to supplement the kit with some additional needles , pins , safety pins and heavier thread .

 I am a big fan of Chantelle bras -- but this one is embarrasing to wear because it makes this squishy noise when you move . Strangest bra I have ever owned ... it fits well , but I do n't wear it much because of the noise ?? Anyone else have this problem ? All my other Chantelle bras are great .
 Especially for the price , this bra is just terrible . The descriptions reads `` Molded underwire cups '' . Not only are the cups not molded , on the one I got , they are not padded or even lined . The construction is bad & the material is cheap . I have purchased bras for half this price that are constructed better . Maybe I got one different from the other reviewers because I just ca n't give it more than one star . I have heard this brand is good , but this particular one is not & is going back . Do n't waste your money .
 It 's a piece of junk . Looks like it 's been used for a year once I opened the package . I found scratches , wrinkles , and dents on the dull leather surface . The leather smells bad chemicals . It 's way to large and bulky to be a passport cover . Want to return it right away .
 The item looks much better in the picture , I was very disappointed upon receiving it . It looks and feels cheap ... while this may be a good price , it 's not worth what you get .
 Poor quality of leather and zip . Do n't buy this product . May be the whole Gem Avenue products are like that .

 The cotton is really bad and not comfortable . I dont think ill ever buy a bathrobe online again . This was a very bad experience . Very cheaply made from cheap material .

 was not happy w this bra . the inside of the cup did have a seam and it was not comfotable .
 I wore it once and never wore it again . It makes my `` girls '' look pokey and weird . And it was a bit small .

 Product appears to be to feminine and cumberson to carry along with luggage etc. . I would not recommend this for a man .
 This is the worst pouch for the $ $ $ . Do n't even dare buying it . It 's all scuffed up and the zippers are horrible quality .
 I purchased this hoping to use it for an every day wallet . I should have known that the price was to good to be true . I do have to say the size and amount of compartments are great but the quality is poor . All in all I think Amazon has worn out its usefullness . Most of the prices here are inflated plus you have to pay shipping .
 I bought this costume for my 3 year old . Given it 's a 3-4T , I thought it might be a bit snug -LRB- she 's big for her age -RRB- , but I thought it would be ok for a few hours . It was awful ! It fit my 1 year old -LRB- and even left an elastic imprint on her torso -RRB- ! It was kinda cute , but looked a little cheap at the bottom - like the lace would fall off . Disappointed .
 I suppose I should have hand washed this bra , but , I never have done that with any bra I bought before . I was so pleased with the fit of this bra ... and then I washed it . It shredded !!

 I purchased these because of the extensive history I have with wearing carhart clothing . Currently I am furious that I have to contact carhart because on the three pairs I purchased all three pairs have stitching errors so badly that they are falling apart at the seams literally . i am severely irritated not only because of this problem but then I find out this product is made over seas and not here in the USA . Shame on you carhart .
 I have ordered these twice now , double front dungaree , black , 32x32 and both times I have received pants that are marked 32x32 but are 32x34 ish . I wear carharts 5 days a week for work and have about 9 pair . All are the same size , 32x32 and the inseams measure 32 . The first pair measured 34 second pair measured 33.5 .
 In my first attempt I thought I ordered wrong . After reordering I ordered a 34w x 31L and my confirmation email said I ordered a 31x34 which is what happened the first time ! I am not sure what is going on but I they are shipping right away and the first time I was only allowed a refund and not an exchange :-LRB- 80 bucks in limbo : -LRB-
 Carhartt makes the best , most durable work gear I have ever used but PLEASE , pay a few more bucks and buy them somewhere else , I ordered two pairs from here on May 13 , 2009 . It is now June 3 . In fact , it 's almost June 4 and they just shipped them today . They have had my money for almost a month but I still do n't have their product . If I had known it would take them a month to get the product to me I would have happily gone down the street and paid a few dollars more to actually have the product in hand . Do yourself a favor and do n't lend these people your money , interest free for a month.Carhartt Double-Front Work Dungaree Pant - Men 's
 Do n't spend your hardened money on this . I bought this pair for hunting trips , but after to machine wash it start folling a part like a piece of the paper . There quality going down to the gator .
 I am not nearly as pleased with my recent purchase of the moss &#34; Double-Front Work Dungaree &#34; as I am with the brown &#34; Double-Front Work Dungaree &#34; I have purchased in the past and have worn almost daily for three years . Although the description of the material seems to indicate that both pants are essentially cut from the same type of cloth the moss dungarees have a light weight feel in relation to the brown . I ca n't explain it . In addition the dye has faded/washed out in places on the moss giving the pants a tie-dye effect over the legs of the dungarees . The legs also have annoying creases approximately one inch from the sewn seams . These phantom seams were visible when I received the pants . -LRB- The phantom seams are the type most people have experienced in a least one pair of denim jeans . The type of seam you do battle with after every washing in the hopes that it will somehow disappear -RRB- . The dungarees also have noticeably more loose/dangling threads compared to my brown dungarees . All in all , not very satisfied . I will continue to buy the brown dungarees as long as the quality does not decline and I am able to stand in front of them before I make the purchase .
 i bought this thinking its a cover-all onecie , otherwise i would n't have bought this one ... their product description does say '' an orange romper with nonskid soles '' ... but , feet not covered like it shows in the picture or as per their description ... very disappointed !!

 Poor quality and poor fit . I returned the pair I bought . Do not waste your time or money on this product .
 Fits like a glove ? Well , yes ... they 're gloves ! Are they worth Seventy-Six Dollars ? I do n't think so ?!! I was not impressed when I received them in the mail . First impression was , `` So these expensive gloves come in a clear plasic bag marked Made In Italy , and that 's it ?!! '' Next was the so called `` Sewn with Italian styling and care '' ... in which I had to cut threads that stuck out . Looked more like it was sewn with not that much care . I do n't know , but to me these look more like they could be knock-offs , or maybe that 's how Fratelli Orsini gloves are ?
 I 'm not impressed , within a week of use the screw on one of the ear pieces came out . word word

 Although I ordered the size I usually wear , the sleeves were much too long and it was n't large enough around the bust even though it was advertised as being loose fitting . Apparently this item was designed for tall , slender women with long arms . The advertising is misleading .
 I was trying unsuccessfully to replace a really nice white Columbia fleece jacket that I bought some years ago which resisted stains amazingly , looks really nice on me , and goes with everything . This is not it . This -LRB- Benton Springs Style Number 209 WL 6114 -RRB- is a cheap imitation of my old fleece Columbia jacket -LRB- style number 207 WL6114 -RRB- . I bought three Benton Springs jackets on 1-27-2010 at Sports Authority and I 'm returning at least the two white ones , where the difference in quality is really noticable . I 'm going to keep a navy blue one where the inferior cut , styling , workmanship , and quality control is not as noticable . In white , mine look cheap and slightly flawed , workmanship wise . I have another white fleece jacket from Walmart with the same problem that came as a liner with a -LRB- cheap -RRB- white raincoat.Another difference is that the new ones are fuzzier , softer and thicker and the white is pinker . That would be fine if it hung and fit nicely like it 's predessor.It 's so hard to replace women 's clothes when they wear out , even in classic styles . Often I have to go to another brand to get the same thing since it 's `` out of style '' in the brand I start with . Are they assuming it never wears out ? The zipper eventually broke on my original Columbia fleece jacket , not before I got a lot of wear out of it , and a white jacket can not stay stain free forever even though this fabric was very stain resistant .
 I ordered this item through Amazon from The Fashion Rack on December 8 , 2010 and never recieved it . I have ordered many things from Amazon and have always received them , but did not recieve my order from The Fashion Rack or a response from The Fashion Rack . I watched the USPS tracking as it came to my state then went to a totally different state . I emailed The Fashion Rack through Amazon and never got a response to my email . I have emailed a second time still waiting to hear something .
 I ordered this columbia fleece in a size small . I received it today and it was a medium . The tag on the inside of the jacket says medium , and the sticker on the bag it was packaged it said medium , but the price tag said it was a small . The jacket is way too big for me , and I would like to return it . I am hesitant though , because I 'm worried that if I return it and order from this seller again I will receive another jacket in the wrong size . Has anyone else had this problem ?
 I owned a similar Columbia jacket years ago -LRB- not sure exact style -RRB- but I know that even then I would n't have spend an arm and a leg on it , so I figured it was reasonable to compare the two . This jacket feels incredibly cheap ! It 's ok , keeps me warm . A nice light fleece , but I was expecting something a little heavier and more durable . Hanging this over the back of my chair , I was worried that the posts on the chair were going to pop a hole through ! They are n't pointy and are a good size , at least an inch , and this was n't by exerting any sort of force on the jacket.The seller shipped me the wrong color anyway , and I 'm supposed to be getting a full refund . Otherwise , I 'd likely return it and fork some money out for something worthwhile .
 I ordered This almost 20 Days Ago And still Havent recieved it.So Im Completely Done With this seller.If you Expect it a Certin Time Dont Bother .
 I was very eager to get this set after getting the dress from the regular survival kit as a hand me down . The problem I have with the warm weather set of clothing is that its designed for tall women . The pants are several inches too long -LRB- I 'm 5 ' 2 , which is not all that short , esp with shoes ! -RRB- The dress hangs off me like a sack , even though I am 7 months along . I have gotten a good bit of use out of the skirt and shirt , so its not a total loss . However the shirt no longer fits since I have gone from an A to a C cup . I imagine anyone who began her pregnancy with a medium to large sized bust wo n't be able to wear it for more than a couple of months . If I had to do it over I would have used the $ 150 to buy nice individual items that would have actually fit ! I would n't recommend this set unless you can try it on before purchasing .
 I received this as a gift , and I was pretty disappointed . The skirt and pants are great and I wear them all the time , but the shirt and dress never fit right , even toward the end of my pregnancy . I definitely would not buy this set for myself , since it 's so expensive . Instead I 'd get the pants and skirt separately . I bought similar pants from another website for $ 15 , and I 'm sure a similar skirt is out there for under $ 50 .
 Customer service is worse than awful , especially a gal called Kim . I did n't get a 2nd chance to give purchaser 's name & she refused to talk to me further , no matter how much purchase information I gave to show I 'm the actual purchaser . The irony is that it was they who got my records wrong ! So , do n't sigh , nor cough , nor say `` what ? '' . She 'll count these as buyer 's name misquoted too . The consolation is that the product is of good quality for the discounted price .
 I ca n't believe someone would rate this costume anything but one star , if that . The fabric is not flannel , it is a cheap knit that will run if pulled and is so thin you can see through it . The pants are cut very short . A man who wears a 40 -48 will have a hard time not showing his bare knees . Do not waste your money , please . With shipping , I spent over $ 70.00 for something worth 5.00 .
 The pictures are not the same as the costumes ! They lie ! The goods are from China ! This is fake ! Scammer !
 Poor quality and poor fit . I returned the pair I bought . Do not waste your time or money on this product .
 Fits like a glove ? Well , yes ... they 're gloves ! Are they worth Seventy-Six Dollars ? I do n't think so ?!! I was not impressed when I received them in the mail . First impression was , `` So these expensive gloves come in a clear plasic bag marked Made In Italy , and that 's it ?!! '' Next was the so called `` Sewn with Italian styling and care '' ... in which I had to cut threads that stuck out . Looked more like it was sewn with not that much care . I do n't know , but to me these look more like they could be knock-offs , or maybe that 's how Fratelli Orsini gloves are ?
 I can still imagine this is one of the most beautiful items I 've seen , while , in reality , all I have is disappointment , since all I got was the wrong shirt with the right tags on it . I got a refund with no problem.Allsold out .
 Although I ordered the size I usually wear , the sleeves were much too long and it was n't large enough around the bust even though it was advertised as being loose fitting . Apparently this item was designed for tall , slender women with long arms . The advertising is misleading .
 I ordered This almost 20 Days Ago And still Havent recieved it.So Im Completely Done With this seller.If you Expect it a Certin Time Dont Bother .
 I owned a similar Columbia jacket years ago -LRB- not sure exact style -RRB- but I know that even then I would n't have spend an arm and a leg on it , so I figured it was reasonable to compare the two . This jacket feels incredibly cheap ! It 's ok , keeps me warm . A nice light fleece , but I was expecting something a little heavier and more durable . Hanging this over the back of my chair , I was worried that the posts on the chair were going to pop a hole through ! They are n't pointy and are a good size , at least an inch , and this was n't by exerting any sort of force on the jacket.The seller shipped me the wrong color anyway , and I 'm supposed to be getting a full refund . Otherwise , I 'd likely return it and fork some money out for something worthwhile .
 I was trying unsuccessfully to replace a really nice white Columbia fleece jacket that I bought some years ago which resisted stains amazingly , looks really nice on me , and goes with everything . This is not it . This -LRB- Benton Springs Style Number 209 WL 6114 -RRB- is a cheap imitation of my old fleece Columbia jacket -LRB- style number 207 WL6114 -RRB- . I bought three Benton Springs jackets on 1-27-2010 at Sports Authority and I 'm returning at least the two white ones , where the difference in quality is really noticable . I 'm going to keep a navy blue one where the inferior cut , styling , workmanship , and quality control is not as noticable . In white , mine look cheap and slightly flawed , workmanship wise . I have another white fleece jacket from Walmart with the same problem that came as a liner with a -LRB- cheap -RRB- white raincoat.Another difference is that the new ones are fuzzier , softer and thicker and the white is pinker . That would be fine if it hung and fit nicely like it 's predessor.It 's so hard to replace women 's clothes when they wear out , even in classic styles . Often I have to go to another brand to get the same thing since it 's `` out of style '' in the brand I start with . Are they assuming it never wears out ? The zipper eventually broke on my original Columbia fleece jacket , not before I got a lot of wear out of it , and a white jacket can not stay stain free forever even though this fabric was very stain resistant .
 I ordered this item through Amazon from The Fashion Rack on December 8 , 2010 and never recieved it . I have ordered many things from Amazon and have always received them , but did not recieve my order from The Fashion Rack or a response from The Fashion Rack . I watched the USPS tracking as it came to my state then went to a totally different state . I emailed The Fashion Rack through Amazon and never got a response to my email . I have emailed a second time still waiting to hear something .
 I ordered this columbia fleece in a size small . I received it today and it was a medium . The tag on the inside of the jacket says medium , and the sticker on the bag it was packaged it said medium , but the price tag said it was a small . The jacket is way too big for me , and I would like to return it . I am hesitant though , because I 'm worried that if I return it and order from this seller again I will receive another jacket in the wrong size . Has anyone else had this problem ?
 Poor quality and poor fit . I returned the pair I bought . Do not waste your time or money on this product .

 After receiving the beret , I formed it to fit my head . The stitching around the clutch was already coming out and one of the two eyelets on the side of beret had come off . Poor craftmanship on this beret , thus the low price .
 It 's OK , somewhat cheap looking , in my view a much better product is available elsewhere -LRB- guess where -RRB- for less . No return information that I can find . I could not discern a difference between their less and more expensive versions . Wallet seems convenient , but I 'm not sure that I can bring myself to give this as a present -- too cheap appearing .
 This wallet arrived quickly and was packaged well.After I opened it and transfered all the usual stuff from my old wallet to the new I set it down and did some other things . I returned about 30 minutes later and could not believe the stench from this wallet . It smells as if the leather had mildewed and then dyed and made into its current shape . It has been a while now and it stinks as much now as when I first got it.I will not buy another item from this manufacture and as soon as I find another zippered wallet I will purchase it and trash this stinking mess .
 This is a lovely soft wallet , however when you insert the credit cards the bottom ones overlap the ones before it and makes it inconvenient to get to the others . Leather is nice .
 The logo on my sleeve has n't been colored properly , the colors are n't aligned with the outline of the ghost . The straps on the pack are barely usable and the belt does n't really work like it should . You are n't really able to hold the gun like you see in the picture , and the pack is deflates pretty quickly . The actual jumpsuit is decent but it 's a little big.This product will due for this Halloween , but I would n't recommend it to my friends .
 Should be considered strictly a one-use item . I tossed mine after wearing it and do n't regret doing so at all
 The product is not as it seems . I bought the size based on the size chart given . When I received the product it did not fit my husband at all . The suit was way too short and see through . I strongly do not reccomend this outfit
 Ghost busters suit was just fine . Worked great but the back back never would blow up and hold air . Gun is a joke . The gun needs alot of redesigning . This costume is good for kids but for adult better have backup plan for back pack and gun . . suit no problem . Wore mine on halloween night with my kid so it served its purpose .
 Out of 4 of these I ordered , 3 of the inflatables were damaged . I had to be on it all night so it would n't look deflated ... Definitely a big hassle and headache.Sizing was fine , a little baggy for my taste -LRB- 5 ' 6 140 pounds -RRB- but with the backpack strapped on it looked better . Do n't get me wrong , people loved the costume , a BIG hit , but after paying for this the least I could hope for was a non deflating backpack .
 All inflatable packs I ordered had holes in them so we tried to patch them up but to no avail . We were quite disappointed as $ 30 a costume is n't cheap and what we received was only $ 5 quality .
 The costume was a major disappointment - did not fit me one bit , I looked like a funny blob than a Ghostbuster . It was really not what I expected . The backpack and gun were poor quality plastic . Overall it did not look anything like the display pic .
 I thought the idea was great . I had to return this because I am 5ft 6 in and it was HUGE !!! The crotch was literally all the way down by my knees ! The backpack , although a great idea was very hard to keep in place . I would not recommend if you are around my height . This is made for maybe a taller person but not a big person . I am average and could barely squeeze in the upper part . Needless to say I had to return this because it was just too big and uncomfortable . The item I got was just not what I expected . I wish these would come in sizes instead of one size fits all , I think it would have worked had it been by sizes . I was upset I had to return it and then run out to look for a costume here in town for my kids Halloween carnival . Needless to say I am still waiting for a refund and no word on that yet . Disappointing : -LRB-
 Over the past few years I have come to find out that Rubies produces a lot of garbage . This costume was no exception . The jumpsuit quickly came apart under both arms within a few minutes of normal wear . The inflatible gun had a leak so it could not be used . I would be hesitant to purchase anything else made by these jokers . Garbage !
 We bought 2 of these . Both fit differently even though they were the same size . Both backpacks leaked air . Both `` Lasers '' were poorly made and required a small piece of cardboard -LRB- included -RRB- to be added to them to keep their circular shape . No instructions so was difficult to understand the cardboard piece -LRB- We just used a paper towel roll to add body and circular appearence -RRB- . One of the back packs primary straps broke . The costume did look ok but disappointed in the quality . If you purchase it be prepared that its a 1-time use . I 'll avoid this manufacturer moving forward . Gave 2 stars for appearance and price was a little better than competitors .
 The costume has black marker ink on it and was a complete diffrent color than the matching girl costume made no since at all was verry disapointed !
 I really wished I had had time to buy items and make my own GH costume . But with only a few days , I opted to get this one , and it was a mistake.First off , the size . Apparently they only sell one , and if you are above 6 foot , or 185cm , this costume WILL NOT FIT YOU . I 'm 6 ' 3 , 193 , and this outfit is so tight I can barely move , sit down or bend over.Adding to that problem , is the actual quality . This suit is almost paper thin . I know that if I move too fast , turn the wrong way , or struggle too much getting in to it , it will literally fall apart at the seems.Finally , the colour . No Ghostbuster , not big screen or small , has ever worn a suit this yellow . Add to that the terrible printing of the logos , and it just makes a big mess not worth the minimum 1 star I have to give so I can review it.If you are short and thin , this costume may last you for one night . But at $ 27 , I would really have hoped for something better . Shame on this costume company for producing such tat , and shame on the movie company for allowing it .
 This costume did n't live up to the positive reviews . It was very cheap and one of the plastic components appeared ripped off completely . I returned it and purchased a similar priced costume that was 100x more quality for the moneyCalifornia Costume Men 's Adult-Hercules .
 it does n't have the phaser , i was fairly disappointed when i opened it . I thought it was already with the product but to my dismay it was n't .
 The suit itself was very low quality material and very thin . We blew the backpack up and it would not hold air over an hour . Our friend also bought one as they were used as costumes in a talent show and her 's did the same thing . Not reccomended if you plan on using the backpack as it never held air .
 We were very disappointed in this wallet for the amount of money we paid . It is very cheaply made , and the person we got it for did n't like it . We would have been better off going to a discount store and getting a $ 5.00 wallet .
 Rib Caps are fine as long as they stay on the head . The problem occurred when the conditions were heavy snow and the Ribcap became very wet . I crashed twice and the Ribcap fell off both times . Not only did the Ribcap not protect at all as it flew off , I then had to retrieve the Ribcap from down the slope.Some Ribcaps have ties to secure them but I feel that the non secured Caps are very dangerous as they expand when wet and give a false illusion of protection.I believe that these products should be withdrawn immediately before someone seriously hurts themselves .
 Although the case is attractive and of apparent good quality , more space is needed for accessories.The compartments just are n't deep enough . My surge cube does n't fit comfortably anywhere . And the gray packet of info and cd 's supplied with the macbook , just barely fits . I 've decided to put this case in a larger computer carrier only because I 'm too lazy to return it and because it will add additionaly protection for my macbook in the other carrier . If you intend to use a case for items other than the Macbook , buy something else .
 Although a few ` older ' ladies said I looked good , it is not a pattern that is flattering for any pregnant person . And note , the ` older ' people liked it !
 I tryed to buy this item for a gift for one person 2 times . I placed my order 2 times because the item said that was in the stock and I never get the product and in one time my credit card was already charged and I did not have the product . I wrote to amazon team and they cancel my order but I do not like that an item that you want to buy seems as available and is not really . The amazon team should check what products are really in stock in order to give to the costumer a currently information .
 It took nearly 4 days for the seller to tell me the product is discontinued when it was `` in stock '' when I ordered it . Buyer beware .
 In the past found this Danskin bra -- both straight strap design and high percent -LRB- 90 or so -RRB- cotton material -- comfortable for all activities . Lycra or polyester now almost half of the content and the comfort and absorbency are gone . This was a superior product . Now ruined by cheap downgrade in manufacturing process . Big disappointment to find it scratchy instead of getting high quality cotton .
 I have worn these pants for years ; my size is the same as always . I could n't get them on ; they were so tight I could n't get the button buttoned around the waist . What is going on ? These pants seemed to be cut for a skinny 25 year old , not someone who is a little on the hefty side . Further , the shipping and handling charges are just out of sight ... $ 16.95 above and beyond the already rather pricy product . I would not recommend doing business with this seller at all . You can go to other outlets and get the same thing without the shipping and handling , and there are `` deals '' out there from major store chains . I was really disappointed in this product and the seller . Go to WalMart and get their khakis ; they are very inexpensive and wear like iron .
 Dockers are Dockers , so that 's not the problem . Just be sure you do n't trust the images if you choose to buy these via Amazon . `` Cafe , '' for example , should be `` Coffee . '' Despite the fact that the image for `` Cafe '' shows a stone or very light gray color , `` Cafe '' is actually dark brown . So the product is n't defective , but IS misleading
 I agree , these are cut small ... Buy an inch or two larger than you normally do . The waist band does NOT stretch .
 I got the shippment quickly . But wrong items was sent . I have to return it to the seller . I got the refund pretty quick , but only for the value of product . I spent about & 10 for two way shipping without geting anything .
 Did not like the pants at all , and threw them in the trash rather than pay return postage . Flimsy , smelled of dye , cheap fabric , etc. . Too bad .
 Merchant was out of stock on the second pair of pants , so when it was shipped I was charged $ 9 again when the second pair was in stock weeks later.Will not buy from Amazon vendors again .
 If you search for Super Saver shipping this advertisement comes up , but this product is not shipped by Amazon is does not go out with the Super Saver shipping , and the cost of shipping is nearly 20 % the cost of the pants .
 I DID NOT GET THE SLACK THAT HAD THE WAISTBAND . I GOT SLACK WITH NO WAISTBAND , SO I SEND THEM BACK AN WAS TRYING TO GE A 42 29 BUT I RECEIVED A E MAIL STATETING THAT THE PRODUCT WAS NO LONGER AVABILITY . SO FAR I ` AM NOT SURE WERE MY REFUND WENT . PLEASE LET ME KNOW.TOM ATKINSON

 It was n't expensive so I should n't have expected much . The material was so thin a finger nail could go through it and the snaps never , ever stayed snapped . I should have returned it but life got in the way .

 Sport Rain SuitI was very disappointed in the rain suit pants . The seam on the pants delaminated after the first wearing . I had specifically ordered one size larger to prevent seam stress but this planning was worthless . I found myself without the coverage I had hoped for for two weeks while on vacation white water rafting in the Grand Canyon -LRB- hence unable to buy a replacement -RRB- . Perhaps these rain suits are more appropriate for the golf course .
 It 's a well constructed bag , but it 's just to small -LRB- at least for a MacBook Pro -RRB- . With the computer in , I have to stretch the pockets to fit in essentials like the power supply and even cables . I 'd also like to keep my glasses case in there but that 's too much.Also , the shoulder strap is n't balanced well . It crosses over the zip , so it keeps falling off my shoulder . Incredibly frustrating when , for example , in a hurry to catch a train .
 The product is not as advertised!It does not contain anything resembling cloth or other soft interior parts.The item does not have zippers and pockets as advertised.When returning the item , the company guaranteed a 5 -7 business day turnaround , but it took 10 business days , just to get the code to mail the piece back . I still do not have my refund.I am thinking of challenging with the credit card company.AVOID THIS COMPANY and THIS PRODUCT !!!
 I previously had a Tucano laptop PC briefcase for a business Vaio that I returned with the Vaio when I left the company . That Tucano model was large enough for my new -LRB- thicker -RRB- Toshiba Satellite . However , this Tucano model will barely fit the Satellite , power cord , and a small mouse . Make sure your PC is as small as a Macbook , or you will have the same problem .
 I just received my bag and liked it but how can you use the nice shoulder strap as mine has nothing to hook it too ???? Can you anyone explain that ? Thanks J.r.I mean no loops on the sides where it should go . I am shocked !
 These were a Christmas gift that only lasted for three wearings . The heal became quickly threadbare . Compared to other socks that were bought at the same time these were the earliest dropouts .
 As the other reviewer wrote , the suitcase dents easily - in fact after one trip already . Unfortunately , my experience is contrary to the other reviewer in that the suitcase DOES break . After 15 months and about 10 trips , one of wheels is almost torn off . What 's worse is that Samsonite recognizes the problem but only wants to replace the suitcase at a cost , while the newer models clearly have reinforcements in the wheel area demonstrating that this is a design flaw and should be covered by warranty.I agree with the other reviewer that the `` expandable '' feature is great and spinners are the way to go . The concept of the suitcase is nice but the material selection is flawed resulting in a huge dissapointment over the Samsonite brand .
 I had to call to find out that they did n't have the items I had pay for ... Do I need to say more ?

 I recently purchased two of these adapters for a trip to Ireland . For those who are looking at buying this ... DO N'T . This adapter cost me two curling irons and a hair dryer . This item is a complete waste of money . I suggest that you continue looking for another adapter .
 Most US electrical devices now use a a plug with two different sized prongs . This adaptor does not allow for the longer prong . So if you 're looking for an adaptor so you can dry/style your hair during your vacation - do n't get this adaptor !

 Ordered this to replace my old one , bought several years ago and recently stolen . The older style was very romantic and almost ankle length with a very large hood , worthy of the opera or a formal evening out . By comparison to the older style , the new style is extremely disappointing , much shorter , much skimpier , hood is ugly and the coat is simply no longer special or elegant with the style change . If I could contact the maker I would urge them to bring the old style back . I hear the style change only recently occurred in fall 2012 , so all the wonderful reviews are for the older style . I sent mine back . The newer one not lovely . Bring the old style back !
 I have not yet received the product ... I did get notified awhile ago that it was delayed .
 I have been buying outer banks shirts for at least ten years , but apparently there is no longer any quality control.I purchesd five shirts -LRB- 2108 -RRB- and none of the five was the same.They all had sleeve problems , either being too long or too tight .
 Received my bra fairly quickly . Looks like a quality garment , kudos to Warner . My issue is with Freshpair . Since clothing from different manufacturers can run smaller or larger than the size you order , trying on an item is always necessary to ensure a good fit . Unfortunately this bra was one size too small . I read the online `` No Hassle Return '' policy , and still had questions , so I wrote to company . They did not respond to my email . I called them . Their recording is very lengthy and goes into much detail about the return / exchange process . Still left me with questions so I waited on hold . The Rep was short and snippy with me , even before I described my situation . I asked for exchange instructions -LRB- did not fit -RRB- . Was told item can not be exchanged because it has been discontinued . The listing did not say this . I asked for a return authorization . She said it can not be returned because the packaging was opened . -LRB- How can you try on a bra without opening the package ? -RRB- I was feeling `` stuck '' with a bra that I can not use . She put me on hold , then came back and said they will give me a partial refund if I pay shipping to send it back , plus shipping from original order . So basically send the bra back , I have no merchandise , and I have kissed about ten bucks goodbye , due to their `` no hassle return '' policy . I wo n't order from them again . In fact , ordering clothing online has never been a good idea , in my mind , due to the problem of size differences . There are companies out there that offer exchanges or returns , for any reason , where the company pays the shipping , and the return shipping , because they care that much about satisfied customers . I think I will go look for those companies to order from . Never again from Freshpair .
 Dickies - Girls ' Flat Front Pantsi found the same pants at walmart.com for $ 12 each . Why would i pay more in amazon.com ?
 I loved this bra when I first got it a year ago . It gave me great support , it looked great and I was the happiest with a bra that I have ever been . My girls are in the F range so it has been difficult to find the right size . A year later , the girls are headed south and the bra has no support left in it . I am really disappointed in the quality after paying almost $ 70 for one bra . They are on a great product if it could stand the longevity of time . One year just does n't work for me .
 I discovered this bra at Nordtstom and loved it so I ordered a bunch more from amazon.com where the price was better . The bras that arrived were not the same . The cup came up way too high on the outside and dug into my armpit and the straps were about about 1 12 '' further out the shoulder so they kept falling off . I ended up sending the rest back . I assume that le Mystere changed the design but I do n't know which design was older and which was newer .
 For some strange reason Le Mystere decided to redesign the Dream Tisha . This is the redesigned version which has flimsy cups with no shape . So , if you are looking for the original Dream Tisha with the molded cups that keep their distinctive shape , this is not it . Shame on Le Mystere for ruining a great product . Very disappointed.Also , Amazon needs to take more care in how they ship bras . These bras arrived crushed and indented , there was nothing in there to keep the bra 's shape and prevent them from getting damaged .
 I ordered this bra because I needed a t-shirt bra . However , I ordered the smallest band size they had available and it was still too large . I have a small band size of 28 so I will have to continue ordering bras from the UK as they carry beautiful bras with small band sizes for slender women who have D + cups sizes . I just found a t-shirt bra on Figleaves.com and ordered a couple . I am waiting to receive them and hope they fit well.Besides being too large , this bra was very thick and oddly shaped . It also pushed my breasts up way to high and my breast tissue did n't fill the cup . This bra looks like a piece of sculpture as it is so moulded that the bra looks like breasts are already inside it . The bra cups stand erect on their own . :-RRB- If you like that type of shape then go for it.However , if you are slender with a small band size this bra is probably not the one for you .
 I really wanted to love this bra . Finding bras that are supportive when your full figured is difficult , not to mention expensive . I was fitted for this bra before I bought it , but the store did n't have my size so I started looking for the bra online . I ordered exactly the size that I was fitted for , received my two bras , and the fit was terrible . The bra is too tight , and the cups do n't fit . I 'm not spilling out over the sides of the bra , usually the first indicator that the bra does n't fit , there 's all this extra material in the center of the cup.Aside from my fitting problems there are two other problems with this bra I 'd like to point out . Being full figured there are two things necessary to support bigger chests . First , a bra band that is wide and has four hooks on it , this bra does not have that . Second , you need wide , supportive straps , again this bra does not have wide enough straps . There are better bras out there .
 Purchased the dream tisha 9955 two years ago ... havent found another to match the fit and comfort . Looked to purchase additional bras and found that the new style DOES NOT fit as well . The bra specialist informed me that the company changed the style to fit better . I DISAGREE . The specialist admitted also that this improved bra has not worked for many of their customers . I wish I would have purchased more than the one bra at the time - no matter what the cost . I have not found a bra that fit as well as this one has . I 'm sorry the new and improved hasnt worked for me ...
 I bought the dream tisha several years ago and fell in love , rushed to buy three more . Since my original purchase , they have changed the fit . I 'm a natural 34D , with narrow/small shoulders ... the straps are now too long on this bra and even at the smallest adjustment , there is no lift , `` the girls '' merely rest in the cups . I even went to be resized , to make sure I had not changed , it was not me , it 's the bra . I 'm very disappointed as this was a fantastic bra that gave lift and minimized at the same time , now I have to search for another brand .
 I bought this bra because of Oprah 's nod to the product . However , this bra is a minimizing bra . It mushes you until you look like you have a small overly padded chest . The worst part is the quality . I bought this bra less than a year ago and on both sides , under the arms the fabric has `` split '' . On both sides the seams tear out . Now I have to admit , I do not always wash my bra 's as recommended , sometimes they get thrown in with the wash however I do not wash them daily . I really was looking for a high quality bra for a full figure . This may be for a full figured person but it does not flatter . A plain old wonderbra in a large size works better . At least you look pretty and not like you are wearing armor under your shirt .
 I absolutely loved this bra when I first put it on , but after only a couple of washings the metal underwire broke through the fabric and started poking at my underarm . I thought it was just a rare occurence , but I bought a couple more of these bras and the same thing happened everytime . They cost way too much money to only get two or three wears out of them . I am so disappointed in the quality of the underwire .
 Too bulky ... When you have big breast the last thing you was is a bulky bra ... It felt more like body armor than a bra ! I know a lot of women like lined bras for nipple coverage how ever the lining in this bra much like most bras from this maker is more like stiff card board which does n't move comfortably .
 I bought the Dream Tisha Lace , Dream Tisha , and Tisha bras . I expected them all to fit similarly , but they did not . Here is my comparison : Tisha -- 2 hooks in back . Unlike Dream Tisha lace , cups did not keep their shape for me . Fits smaller than Dream Tisha and Dream Tisha lace . Works better than Dream Tisha or Dream Tisha Lace for lower cut tops . I kept 1 of these bras for lower cut tops , but the lack of cup smoothness is a problem.Dream Tisha -- 3 hooks in the back . Straps are wider than Tisha . Cups were flimsy and creased when I wore them . Looked terrible on me . I returned this bra.Dream Tisha Lace -- 3 hooks in the back . Straps are wider than Tisha . Nice and supportive for my 36D frame . Molded cups held their shape on me . Perfect fit for me . Only problem is that the lace comes up high enough to be seen with some tops . I will buy enough to wear this bra almost all the time .
 I have been buying this Myst&egrave;re 9955 for at least 3 years now . This last purchase was low quality . Same model but material changed and the width of the straps is a lot thinner . I bought two in the same purchase and both bras were not exactly the same . VERY deciving when we think we are paying for quality !
 I wear a 32F -LRB- same as 32DDD -RRB- in the Le Mystere Isabella : Le Mystere Women 's Isabella Memory Foam Bra - 2535I 'm generally a small DDD , so I ordered two sizes , 32E and 32F , to be sure I go the right fit . Unfortunately , I did not.The 32E was too small on my breasts , and though my breasts filled the cups , they also bulged out the top when I lifted my arms.The 32F fully encased my breasts , but the cups had a bit of extra material in the bottom when I `` scooped and swooped '' my breasts into the tip of the cup.Also , even when the straps were properly adjusted , the shape of the bra pointed DOWNWARD ! I do n't mind having some classic pointy sweater kittens , but when they point downward , it 's very unflattering . It could be because I 'm only 19 and rather perky for my size , so my breasts are less malleable than some breasts . Still , I 'm very disappointed with this bra , and I do n't think it 's a good style for many people .
 I really really wanted to love this bra because of all of the great reviews . Although it is true that it is best to try on bras before you buy them , and get a professional fitting , I wear a 36DD in every brand that I have tried on at a store , and I own dozens of bras from various makers , but this bra is the first one that is too small for me around the band . So , I bought a bra `` extender '' but then had a second problem -- I am 5 ' 3 '' and a little short-waisted and the hard sides of the bra poke me under my arms and distract me all day . It does `` lift '' tremendously well , but I do n't understand why this brand does n't size their bands accurately .
 I was very dissatisfied with the two Le Mystere Dream Tisha bas that I recently bought . I have worn this model bra for the last five years and have been very satisfied but the wire support has already come out of one . Probably will not buy in the future . Not sure if this is typical of the construction/quality control but I will probably look at another brand .
 I 've been desperately looking for a new bra . My go-to bra is all worn out and it needed replaced . I 'm currently wearing a bra a size smaller than I should , because I can not find one that fits . I 've been fitted for a 36DDD and a 36F/G in the past . So , I thought that a 36F would be my best bet here . This is not the case . It fits so poorly , the underwire dug into my armpit and I had a severe case of `` double boob '' . I guess this one will be sent back and I 'll have to find another one !
 I ordered this in a 36G and a 36H . -LRB- I know I 'm a 36H ; I 've been professionally fitted -RRB- . The fitting on this bra is all wrong . The 36G was too small -LRB- `` quad boob '' -RRB- but the 36H was too big and gaps at the top and sides . I am short waisted and have more of the `` tear drop '' shape so I think it 's just not the best style if you 're shaped like that . It rides high so the wires are right there on the underarms and you ca n't lower the straps too much . Too bad it got lots of good reviews so I was hoping it would work.One thing about Amazon is they are wonderful and easy at returns and shipping so I highly recommend ordering thru them .
 It seemed to be made to last , very durable . Yet this makes for a very large bulky bra . It was hard to move in and was not very appealing to the eyes . It is practical and not pretty at all . The cup sizes run large , so I returned it and got another style from the same company that fit a bit better .
 I just received this bra today and after only wearing it for about 45 minutes , I can tell you that this is not a very comfortable bra . If you ca n't tell from the picture , this is the type of bra that holds it shape even when you are not wearing it . I have never really liked these type of bras , but if you have , then this bra might work for you . I will also say that this fit is not that great because the center of the bra is not laying flat across my chest . If you are used to buying a certain size , you might find that your size runs a little small with this bra.Pro : This bra is smooth and will not show lines under a t-shirt . Straps are comfortable -LRB- but also very wide so you ca n't wear a tank top -RRB- Cons : The underwire is very uncomfortable on the rib cage and near the armpits.Fit is not great , runs a little small.Straps are very wide -LRB- more comfortable but less versatile -RRB- All in all , I would not buy a bra like this again . If you like the type of bra that holds it shape , then you may like it . I have had much better comfort and fit from this bra
 I was looking forward to this model of bra based on all the fabulous reviews ... plus Oprah 's approval seemed to make it a done deal . I was surprised to find out that while smooth in the front , it is far from smooth when you turn around to see your backside . I wonder if all these women who are reviewing this model of bra have actually turned around to see what their back rolls look like . I am basically a pear shape , so back rolls are not normally a problem for me ... until I put this bra on ! The band that goes around the body is made of very thick . tight corset material ... like the kind they use for girdles . So the least amount of extra flesh on your back pokes out over the top and under the bottom , accentuating your extra flesh back there . Then the cups are so stiff that when you try to cross your arm over your chest the cups push together and prevent you from fully reaching across your own body . I literally could not reach over my own breasts to grab something off the dresser ! This is one of the most uncomfortable bras I have every tried . I am sending it back after 3 trys in 3 different sizes .
 Allthough it was comfortable , I ordered a 34E , and It was 4 inches too small around the ribcage . Plus the cup size was too small . It fit like a 32 DD . I could n't breath after I finally got it on .
 I 've enjoyed this exact style bra for at least 10 years as it provided fabulous support and a smooth look under fabrics . The sizing has definitely changed resulting in the band being way too snug and the cups too small . -LRB- In the spring I ordered one of the same size worn for many years . It was way too small . . in all aspects . I then ordered a size up , and it too , is too small . -RRB- The straps also do not adjust as much as my previous bras.I do n't know that I will repeat this purchase which is VERY disappointing after having been such a loyal consumer for so many years .
 The manufacturer should n't make this bra in larger sizes . The straps are too flimsy for someone with my size -LRB- 42H -RRB- . No matter how many times I adjusted the straps , I still looked droopy . I returned it for something else .
 I ordered two of these in different colors and had to return both . I agree w / other comments re
 I purchased a size 44 , the bra extended on reached 32 inches , either it was sized in error or these run extremely small . Seemed like a nice product but I can not attest to how it feels on .
 I have been on the search for the perfect bra for years now ! These bras are in the range of 50 + $ and are not worth the money . I was measured at Macy 's just before ordering and they were of course the wrong size . I reordered and the smaller bra is still the incorrect size ! They are incorrectly sized , painful in the armpits , the cups look crinkled and not smooth and the straps slide off constantly , no matter what the tension setting is . Oprah commendation for these bras is way off base and definitely proves to me it was a monetary endorsement ! VERY UNSATISFIED !!!
 This bra is odd . It pulls the breasts apart which makes a woman look upshapely . Very strange . The bra smelled horrible when I received it , too .
 I did not like this bra . The fabric and construction were nice , hence the two stars ; however , I had to return it because it was not true to size , and the straps were enormous ! Not only were they almost as wide as my shoulders , they are padded and puffy ! I tried it on under a sweater , not even a T-shirt , and they popped through the fabric . If you order up in size , and do n't need to wear tailored clothes , I can see the appeal of this bra . But ... if you do n't have the shoulder-span of a Chicago football team half-back , and actually like your clothes to fit , and your over-the-shoulder-boulder-holder to not show through , this is NOT the bra for you !
 Due to my breast shape this bra did n't fit well . I have a more bottom heavy conical breast shape . Unfortunately this bra is for a more fuller busted person with more upper breast than I have .
 I have ordered this from another website and bought it in stores and it was always perfect . This one just never fit right .
 I have been purchasing this brand/style/size for several years . The quality is no longer the same , the sizing has also changed . I have the same style and size purchased a few months ago that fits perfectly this does not fit at all . This was , I thought the best bra you could find , I no longer feel that way . Will not be keeping this purchase .
 Sent bra back , I was very disappointed it has sooo much padding it was terrible . Why would any company make a bra with so much padding for someone with this size .
 I tried this bra at a store in the Bahamas and was pleased with the way it looked and how comfortable it was , but the price was too steep . So I decided to buy it on Amazon and although it is the same bra name and number , the fit is totally different . This bra is so uncomfortable , the band of the bra digs into your entire chest after wearing for an hour . I would not recommend it .
 I received this item today and was very upset to find that this is an older model of the bra , not the 2011 model . This bra has undergone significant redesign this year , so if you were sized in the 2011 model , the old model Amazon sends you will NOT fit . It 's as easy as pie to know the difference ... this year 's model does not have a fabric sizing tag attached . The sizing/bra info is printed right on to the bra fabric , on the inner side of the back closure . The old models have the fabric tag attached at the inside of the back hook closure . I called Amazon directly today and was told that they only know as much as is printed in the item description . The item description does not say that this is an old model bra so how is the buying public to know ???? Shame on you , Amazon .
 The dress is made as the pattern shows but the coloring of the dress is much darker a green than is shown on viewing the item on line . It is a sort of muddy green . A brighter green much as was shown on the screen view would have been much better . Please ship the product you see pictured on the screen , same color and shape .
 I bought it for a friends sweet sixteen and it was awful . it just did not fit at all . it was way tooo small . also it took about a month + for them to refund the money . bad experiance !!
 When I hear `` full coverage '' I think of bras that wo n't reveal nipples . This is not the case with this bra . I do NOT want anyone to see my nipples showing through a blouse . Ever . I returned it immediately . I 'll go with something else . If you do n't care about having a bra give you full NIPPLE coverage , then by all means ... consider this one .
 I bought this bra from Macy 's online and had to return to the store because the under wire dug into my ribs causing discomfort and pain especially when sitting . Someone taller and built differently than I might find it comfortable and have no problem with it . I guess due to how my ribs are this bra was n't for me . I own other Wacoal under wire bras that I love and have no problem with . I 'm petite , 5 ' 3 tall and 34DD bust if this helps you decide if this bra could be for you.Other than the discomfort I really liked this bra and wish I could have kept it , I like that it has no seams .
 This is a comfy bra and I would love to get more , but the wire started coming out pretty quickly and I ended up having to throw it away . But , it is the best bra I 've ever owned up to the point of the exposed wire .
 I have exclusively ordered Wocaol minimizer bras for years now . I am least satisfied with this one for 2 primary reasons
 The manuf boast that this is a bra for full figured women . I bought several of these bras and spent a great deal of money , and they simply do n't work.Straps : They boast that these are comfort staps , but the comfort part is very short and does not extend to the area where most women experience discomfort . In order to get the comfort straps in place you have to tighten the strap and then the bra is way too high on the rib cage which causes other issues . So you have to choose between shoulder pain or rib pain.Cups : The cups have underwires that do not stay in place after more than 2 washes . The seamless sides do not support the DD cup and you spill over the top because you have to wear it on the last set of hooks . The cups do not provide any support for the DD cup size . It flattens and makes you look older and hanging.The cups are lined , but do not mistake this for light padding that hides the nipple . You will need a t-shirt bra for that . You can see all of your nipple in this bra.Elastic Sides : The elastic sides gave way and began to stretch out of shape after just a few wears . The elastic began to poke through the fabric in little white bands . The fabric looks worn on the sides while the rest of the bra looks brand new.Material : The material does not feel comfortable in the summer . The side panels are thick and they leave a lumpy impression you can see through your clothing . I hand washed and line dried these bras because I spent so much money on them . I bought special laundry detergent for these bras . I spent over $ 360 for these bras , chocolate , nude , black , white , & pink.This was a very bad investment because they did n't last 1/2 the year.I eventually switched to a better bra which is also made by Wacoal 835170 .
 I bought this bra almost a year ago . At first , it felt great to wear . It was comfortable , provided a good amount of support -LRB- I wear a 34DDD , so good support is a must -RRB- , and it was good for wearing under everyday clothing -LRB- though not for anything too low cut . -RRB- It seemed like I 'd made a good purchase overall.HOWEVER.About 2 months after I bought the bra , I noticed that the foam sling on one of the cups had detached at the top of the cup . I take good care of my bras , so I 'm not sure how it happened . At any rate , it has gotten to the point where I 'll only wear this bra if every single other bra I have is dirty and I 'm not going to be out in public because it only supports properly on one side -LRB- and it 's the side that needs support the least . -RRB- You can clearly see the sling 's detached on the one cup underneath clothing , too . There 's no way to fix it without ripping open the bra , and I 'm not a good enough seamstress to try to fix it myself.It 's a shame this happened , because I think the bra would 've been a decent one otherwise . I wo n't buy this kind of bra again , out of fear of the same thing happening a second time after spending another $ 60 .

 Owned it for a month before the zipper started giving me problems . Zipper teeth come apart for no reason . Material is good , but do n't expect to zip it and have it stay zipped .
 I PURCHASED A SIZE 11 AND RETURNED THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO SMALL FOR A SIZE 11 ... THEN I PURCHASED A SIZE 12 AND THEY FIT UNTIL I WORE THEM AND THEN THEY STRETCHED OUT AS I WORE THEM THAT DAY AND BECAME LONG AND BAGGY ... THE CROTCH AREA GETS LONG AND HANGS BETWEEN YOUR LEGS AND GETS THIN , LIKE YOU HAVE NOTHING ON . SO I WOULD SUGGEST YOU BUY YOUR CORRECT SIZE AND NOT GO LARGER ... THEY WILL FEEL SMALL AT FIRST BUT LIKE I SAID THEY REALLY GET LOOSE AND DO N'T FIT WELL ...
 I thought I had ordered Vanity Fair Panties but that is not what I received . They were much too large so I donated them to a Charity Thrift Store .
 I wish I had read the reviews before ordering these instead of just looking at the stars given . I ordered 2 packs and am returning them . Within 2 hours of wearing a pair , they had stretched out in the leg and crotch . I felt like I had a wad of fabric in my crotch . It rubbed and chafed . They need to put some elastic inside the cuff -LRB- INSIDE
 1 -RRB- wig did not fit an adult male head2 -RRB- there were no sideburns as pictured3 -RRB- the hair was falling out of the wig4 -RRB- I was charged a 20 % re-stocking fee for something that SHOULD NOT be restocked
 This wig was NOT very Elvis-like . It came flat in a package . The packaging said to `` style ' it , but it was virtually inpossible to style . The sideburns look much longer than they actaully are .
 Customer service is worse than awful , especially a gal called Kim . I did n't get a 2nd chance to give purchaser 's name & she refused to talk to me further , no matter how much purchase information I gave to show I 'm the actual purchaser . The irony is that it was they who got my records wrong ! So , do n't sigh , nor cough , nor say `` what ? '' . She 'll count these as buyer 's name misquoted too . The consolation is that the product is of good quality for the discounted price .
 Washed it in cold water , blead lots of red out . Came out of the washer wrinkled , I dried it on low , still completely wrinkled , and stiff . It 's like wearing a plastic bag and as noisy . Bad cut . No shoulder room , baggy and not tapered like in the picture . Waste of money . I guess I could cut it up for rags ?
 I would say these should not be more then $ 20 . Very cheap quality and only a basic plastic shell . Extremely disappointed .
 Not breathable and very uncomfortable to wear . You would be better off just wearing black garbage bags on your legs ...
 I purchased this costume for my grandson . The costume was very cute . There were problems though . The costume has very large hands that are enclosed . We had to remove the big monkey hands to allow my grandson to be able to hold anything including his candy bag . The feet we also very big making it difficult for my grandson to walk . The head piece was large enough for an adult , much to large for a toddler . Although the costume is very cute , I would not recommend purchasing .
 This costume is not as cute as it is in the picture . When I recieved it I will have to admit I was disapointed . It was falling apart at alot of the seams , the feet just looked like pajamas not like the monkey feet in the pictured and the tail was about to fall off . If you are looking for a warm quality costume as I was I wouldnt recommend this costume as your choice = -LRB-
 In the past found this Danskin bra -- both straight strap design and high percent -LRB- 90 or so -RRB- cotton material -- comfortable for all activities . Lycra or polyester now almost half of the content and the comfort and absorbency are gone . This was a superior product . Now ruined by cheap downgrade in manufacturing process . Big disappointment to find it scratchy instead of getting high quality cotton .
 These pants were way too big -LRB- looked about 2 sizes larger -RRB- , and they were incredibly stiff . They would have been very uncomfortable for my daughter to wear all day .

 My daughter uses these tights for figure skating , and they seem thin . She wore a hole in them right away . However , she probably wore them outside of skating too . They 're good if you do n't plan on skating very much .

 do n't buy'em the jacket is kind of like Towel lookinand it 's heavy and too thick for this summer ~ ~ oh my gosh I do n't think I can even wear themdo n't buy'em it just the waist of money ~ ~
 What a badly designed jacket . I was given one as part of a management gift at work and I was shocked . The jacket is all outof proportion , with the arms being extremely large and puffy . also it seems the arms are way to long in comparison to the body of the jacket . The tapered back of the jacket -LRB- there are 2 pleats -RRB- gives the wearer the appearance of a hunch back as well as giving the wearer shoulders that are wider than the rest of the body . The only good thing about this jacket is that your dog would love it as a bed since it is overly bulky . Mind you the jacket is stiffer than Andie MacDowells acting ... Not a good choice of jackets ...

 this product does not work for the three pronged plugs , which is how most modern plugs are . so you can maybe plug it in , but have to be very careful not to touch the third prong , or you can electrocute yourself . i sent them back , need to get something less flimsy .

 This is the sheerest cashmere I have ever seen . Looses it shape after one wearing . Huge seams . TRULY a disappointment .
 unless you weigh 300 lbs and 6.5 feet tall , this will be too big . it is made of poor construction , bad stitching , and junk material . DO N'T BUY . I had to buy it for a Mardi Gras thing . We were going to wear them again and again , but they are n't good , no one liked them and we threw them away after just one year . What a waste of money !

 Dickies - Girls ' Flat Front Pantsi found the same pants at walmart.com for $ 12 each . Why would i pay more in amazon.com ?
 Was way smaller and tighter then it looks . I 'm a size 10 and got an XL and it was still too snug . Works great under a t-shirt , but alone , not so much !

 just did not fit ! way too tight and small compared to all other clothing of that same size that I have ordered on the web
 The item did not fit and that 's fine , it happens ... but there was no invoice in the packet so it will be difficult to return .
 Fast shipping which was good , as for the item ? Well it is okay if you like to repair things you just bought . One of the straps was sewn on twisted so I had to cut it and repair it . I would have sent it back but I had already washed it as I always wash new apparel before I wear it . That is when I realized the strap was twisted . I also bought a white cami and that one was fine . I suppose you get what you pay for in the end , may-be that is why they were cheaper than the other products listed ? Would I buy from this seller again ? I might give them one more chance . Thank-you .
 This camisole is the MOST uncomfortable cami I have ever worn . The shelf bra is very tight while the straps are extremely loose and thats after they are tightened as far as they can go and then the top creeps below your bra ! It 's horrible . Looks nothing like the picture .
 There are several problems with this camisole . As a Yoga teacher Im always looking for Yoga tops and hoped this might work out . It wo n't . The material is thin with virtually no support . I like being held in not only the obvious breast area but all over when I 'm working , this top will not do at all . I 'm only 5 ' 3 '' and this camisole is very short on me -LRB- just below the navel -RRB- and being short I always prefer the shorter style camisole but not this one . My biggest frustration is that I was following a link for `` shelf bra camisole '' and this came up so I was VERY surprised when it arrived and had no built in bra . I kept it because it was inexpensive and I did n't want to spend more money on the return . The only thing this will be good for is lounging around the house .
 I ordered XXL . The item that arrived SAID that it was a 2xL but no way ! Perhaps if you are a size 12 or less , this size might fit . Good luck . I sent it back , and do not plan to order from this vendor again .
 These are very well-made camis , however the other reviews are right about the sizing being way off . I wear a size 6 , sometimes a 4 . My other camis -LRB- made by esprit -RRB- are medium and fit beautifully . After reading the reviews , I decided to play it safe and order a large . When I put it on it was so tight I could barely breathe and fit more like and extra small .
 these were well made but so very small . I gave them to my daughter who is about a size 6 and they were even too small for her . She gave them to her daughter who is about a size 0 . I ordered and received an x-large . Hmmm . Not pleased at all . Sorry .
 it did not fit i gave it away . much too small for an extra large . iguess ineed a 2x large size
 I wish I had read the other reviews before purchasing this item . The sizing is n't right at all ; the product runs at least 3 sizes too small , if not more . I bought a 2x , because I normally wear a large and wanted it to be big and loose , and it felt like I had tried to squeeze myself into a small or medium . Buyer beware !
 I purchased four of these tops . I sent all four back to exchange for a larger size.I normally buy these sorts of tops in a medium ... well , this manufacturer has a messed up idea of medium because even the extra large is a bit too snug.However , the material and construction of these tops is phenomenal but the sizing is off.If you decide to purchase one or more of these be sure to get them AT LEAST a size larger than what you normally purchase .
 The material was nice and the color red was perfect , but the band on the shelf bra was so tight I could n't get the camisole over my bust .
 This comes in a 2x , with a built in bra , so I bought it . Oh , dear ! It is skin tight , maybe even tighter than my skin and the bra is laughable . Or it might be if it were n't such a horrifying sight . If you 're really skinny , go ahead and get this , but otherwise you should probably pass .
 While the material is very comfortable on the skin , the size is not . This camisole seems to run a size below the tag . The large is really a medium , when up against several comparable products I own .
 Title says it all . I normally wear either an XL or XXL . I got the XXL . it is way too small .
 This bra at first seem great . I liked the lift sling in the front and it was comfortable ... for the first hour or so . Then I started to feel less and less comfy and less support . When I took it off I realized why . The metal piece attaching the strap to the back was sideways . it is like there is not enough material to fill the slot and it turns and just becomes uncomfortable . This is my last resort bra these days .
 I guess Glamorise bras are not for me - I 've tried a couple and none have really fitted correctly . Maybe you will have better luck . Also had problems with the vendor -LRB- Freshpair -RRB- charging me a restock fee in contradiction to the terms published on the invoice.Glamorise Women 's MagicLift Active Support Bra # 1005
 This bra is NOT very comfortable and I do not see ANY lift ! I was recently measured so I know I have the correct size , but this one is just not that great ! I recommend Playtex !!
 this could actually be a great bra but the straps dig into your shoulders . if you can get over being in pain then try it .
 Pros
 I was not impressed by this bra . It is scratchy , not soft like I had hoped . I will return it .
 This would be a great bra , but the seam that runs through the cup is UGLY under a t-shirt . I supposed I could put on a camisole to disguise the seams , but in South Miss , it 's too hot to wear all that extra material in the summer . Hate it , but am going to have to return this item .
 While I love this bra as far as comfort and support , I 'm giving it only two stars for the `` separate '' feature . Why do most bra manufactures think we plus-size women want to be lifted and separated ? I finally found a bra -LRB- from Amazon -RRB- that I hope will work . I wear a 42H bra , and most bras that lift and separate make my breasts look like they 're growing out of my arm pits . The new bra not only lifts but provides support at the sides , so I 'm upfront and center and my breasts are where they 're supposed to be , i.e. growing from my chest , not my armpits ! If this new bra , which should arrive on Friday , fits as I hope , that will be the only bra I 'll ever buy again . In addition the price on the new one is reasonable . If others of you have the `` growing out of your armpit '' problem , just search for a side support bra.This is the bra I ordered and hope works : Goddess Women 's Keira Soft Cup
 This bra offers bare minimum support , it is not an active wear sports bra unless you consider `` active '' to be sitting on the couch . It 's also uncomfortable and the fit is off .
 I wish they would make this bra in a size 36D . Just vewing the picture , it looks like it would be a very comfortable bra to wear . I am running into the same problem shopping for a bra in the stores . The size 36d bras are far and in between .
 I am not an over-sized guy , but after the first wash , the shirt does n't even cover up my belt . It hardly did before I washed it . I bought a Batman Logo t-shirt in smaller size , and it fits better than this one.Cool graphic otherwise is its saving grace .
 the pants say 42x32 but they have to be sized wrong I have a pair of the same pants I bought from Kauffmans and they fit great , but when I tried these pants on they did n't fit . I could even get them to go around my waist .
 I was very disappointed to find that this vest was n't the same thickness I have purchased in the past . I ca n't imagine this layer will be able to really keep me that much warmer as it 's intended . What happened to the Columbia quality of old ? My husband also received a vest for Christmas , and we were equally disappointed with that one for the same reason . His vest that I bought him 4 years ago is much thicker -LRB- aka much warmer to wear in below freezing temps -RRB- . We were very disappointed .
 I purchased this looking for a nice all over body briefer as it was advertised . The cut and fit on this was HORRIBLE . I am short 5 ' 3 '' and short waisted -RRB- so it I was pretty suprised to find this really didnt fit in length , where it pulled so uncomfortably in the crotch and also pulled down in the top , that after 30 minutes of wearing it , it was so uncomfortable and also looked so bad , I realised I wasted my money . I can only imagine how it fits a taller long waisted person if it fit me so badly . I would honestly recommend anything but this .
 I suppose the product would have been great . THey looked good but I had only worn them for about 5 minutes when I brished a cabinet and they snagged . Not JUST snagged , but snagged and then ran all the way from the thigh to the toes . So they are n't very strong . I guess they were n't made to be actually `` worn '' maybe just put on for short time sex appeal ...
 I bought these for a photoshoot and they served their purpose but in no way would they last . Also , I 'm 5 ' 7 '' and the crotch of the pantyhose was very low on me no matter how much I stretched / pulled them up . So they worked in photos because we could pin them and hold them or position myself a certain way but I would never wear them otherwise .
 I got these and was so excited to try them on , but when I took them out of the package they looked child-sized . I gave it a shot anyways , but I 'm 5 ' 78 '' and a size 12 and I could not pull these up all the way which was a big disappointment . I was afraid to pull too hard because they are extremely thin . If you are tall or plus-sized these are not for you .
 These look SO sexy , but the butt part of the darn things came up to my thighs ! I am 6 ' 1 and 140 lbs . My legs and butt are MADE for hosiery like this , but it did n't fit . Also , the entire front is just plain stocking . The nylon is TISSUE-THIN . Like another customer said , these would be great for a photo shoot or a one night romp with someone special , but nothing else .
 My mom and I bike rode to Party Time to see if they had their Halloween stuff up . They did n't have costumes up yet but they had there usual Halloween arsenal of costume weapons with the unusual suprise of a six foot whip . I immediatly wanted to get it because it would go well with the gangster hat I bought that looked like Indiana Jones ' fedora . The minute it came out of wrapper I noticed it was covered in tar like stuff and the red part was split because there was no knot to hold it together . After a few minutes of trying in vain to crack or pull things with it the red part broke off and the end became unbraided so I got mom to take me back to Party Time to replace it . When I got home I wrapped the end of the new one it in tape . The only reason I got because it was at Party Time .
 about as cheap quality as you can get ... but for the price what can you expect ?
 I ordered this as part of a Halloween costume . The image shows a nice toy whip . What I received was a filthy . used-looking item that came in a dirty white plastic bag . I threw it away rather than have to handle it again to even bother returning it . I am beyond disgusted with this purchase .
 Customer service is worse than awful , especially a gal called Kim . I did n't get a 2nd chance to give purchaser 's name & she refused to talk to me further , no matter how much purchase information I gave to show I 'm the actual purchaser . The irony is that it was they who got my records wrong ! So , do n't sigh , nor cough , nor say `` what ? '' . She 'll count these as buyer 's name misquoted too . The consolation is that the product is of good quality for the discounted price .
 Customer service was very condesending and argued with me to the point of exhaustion . I was told I would not receive shipping cost refund of the original purchase or the shipping cost that I had to pay to return the costume . I lost $ 11.75 in shipping . I sent pictures of the costume I recieved and a picture of the costume that was posted by Costume Craze . No one could dispute the differences in the costume . I recieved no reply to my e-mails with attachments or from the letter in the costume that was returned . They lost a very large order for over 60 children 's costumes that I placed with a helpful costume company !
 I pulled this out of the package expecting cloth . It is not cloth but s sticky rubber mess that makes noise every time you move . The costume sticks to itself , is extremely uncomfortable and overall not worth it .
 The product was rich in color but the quality is horrendous.The lace that comes with it is sturdy but the holes to put this lace through are flimsy.It fits nicely but not one of my preferred investments.Do not recommend this item at all .
 I bought two Safe-T-Gard supporters and wore them with my old Bike flexi cup for fencing , 2 or 3 times a week . They replaced a pair of Bike supporters that had lasted 4 or 5 years . The Safe-T-Gard supporters lasted barely 4 weeks . After about six wearings and 2 or 3 washings each , the pouches started to shred at the bottom where the leg straps are attached.I have asked for a refund .
 I ordered a Black shirt and received a Grey one . When order was placed and they took my money ... no word was mentioned that the did not have Black shirts in stock . I do not want to waste my time sending back a shirt that I did not order.What is the deal ... Simple solution ... Refund my money
 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .
 This item was labeled as `` One size fits all '' and I am on the curvy side and it was huge with no way to tighten it without making it look extra funky . The red crushed velvet cape was probably the nicest part of the whole costume but it really did not look very pirate-ish . The laces in the cheaply made corset were pretty much pointless and I felt like if I tried to tighten them anymore they would have torn right through the material . I repackaged it up and returned it right away . -LRB- I put together a much more realistic pirate costume by going to the local thrift stores and finding a striped shirt and cheap pants to cut up as well as lots of fun accessories for less than half the price of this costume . -RRB-
 I 've wanted this hoodie for years and finally ordered one , only to have it wear much much faster than any other hoodie I 've ever owned . I washed it before wearing it the first time and sadly , the logo was 1/4 worn off after ONE WASH!it 's very poorly printed and not worth what I paid for it.I 'd go with a REAL hoodie company I you 're looking for quality.This item was a real let down : -LRB-

 Dickies needs to start making these shirts in an athletic or slimmer fit . The shirts are wonderful and comfortable for working in , but the tails are too short and the excess room in the stomach area makes it both come untucked and bunch up way too much . We 're required to wear these where I work , and tucked in , so the strange -LRB- boxy almost -RRB- cut makes it keep coming untucked . The bunched up look around the waist line is also very sloppy.If they made these in a slimmer athletic fit , I would but a million !
 The shirts are fantastic . I wear dickies pants and shirts and they hold up great . My reason for the 2 stars isthat the wrong size was sent . I ordered a 2xx and received a 1x . Not a big deal but I did n't check the size before I removed the tag so i could not return it . The first time i found out that the size was wrong My wife and I went on a trip and when I put the shirt on I almost ripped it . It was my fault for not checking the size but if the right size was sent in the first place it would not have been an issue .
 After I purchased this hat the shippment date was 3-weeks so I tried to cancel it . Amazon 's policy of not becoming involved , and the fact that the seller 's cancellation email is not functional started a very hard process . It took two weeks to cancel . This makes me think twice about buying major purchases from Amazon .
 This waist cincher did nothing for me . Very hard to put on . Maybe if you are a size 14 or below it might do something but not for the plus size woman .
 It is simultaneously too big -LRB- even though I ordered down a size indicated from the size chart , I can slip my finger between the garment and my skin if I suck in -RRB- and too small - too short , as it 's cut up in the front - which makes it flip up in the back .
 I got a size bigger so it will not bend but that didnt work the quality is great but it just doesnt do the job i was asking for . I guess i was expecting a miracle but i guess its back to the diet n gym i go
 I bought this as a prop for my Little Bo Peep costume last halloween . It was very flimsy , and the plastic was virtually see-through , but it did okay . I would NOT suggest using it as a toy , as a child would doubtless break it very quickly .
 Easy to decorate , hard to screw together . Not very durable and very tall and difficult to get in and out of a car if used with a Halloween Costume . We did not use one of the attachments as it was hitting ceiling fans and would n't fit in the car .

 I 've had this bag just under three months and started having issues with the zipper for the past month or so . Today the zipper completely broke . I was happy with this bag till these zipper issues , now sadly I feel like I just threw money away .
 Material felt rough and uncomfortable . I returned item . Spend your money on better quality pajamas .
 I just received these pajamas yesterday and was so disappointed . The blue on the screen looks pretty but in person these are a sensational metalic blue . Yikes ! They are way too big on me even though I bought the right size according to the merchants chart . They are so stiff & scratchy . I thought they 'd be softer like the ones I buy at Target from Gillian & Malley . I 'll be sending these back .
 My husband bought me these pjs . I had n't worn them but packed them in the bag to bring to the hospital after my daughter was born . Did I mention he got them a size to big to accomodate my pregnancy bloated-ness . I wore them for the first time at the hospital and they ripped . They are un-wearable after half a use . They 're flimsy and I actually was n't very fond of them anyways because the fabric made me feel like I had a plastic drapped around my body -LRB- it did NOT breathe ... even a little -RRB- . So do n't waste your money . These are not worth the packaging they come in .
 I bought 2 pajama sets , size small , for a xmas present . Both tops were like extra large and both bottoms were like extra small . I returned them at my cost -LRB- $ 10.00 -RRB- . Intimo did not correct the problem as promised or phone me back as promised . One month later , they emailed me that the sizing was correct . WHAT ??? Intimo issued me store credit . NO REFUNDS . Would you have faith in buying here again with the strong potential for the same result at your return cost ? Credit card disputes did not help . Do n't shop with Intimo !!! I regret it . I give this item one star because they don tallow 0 . Intimo Women 's 100 % Silk Pajama
 We were disapointed in the durability of the back pack . My son is in kindergarten and the zipper broke the first day .

 These cat ears are n't soft and fuzzy , more sparkly . Not as cute as I thought , but fine . Not like I 'd return it , just would n't suggest it if you 're looking for fuzzy .

 This seller , `` In the Mood Intimates , '' is disreputable . I bought a matched bra and panty set , same color , as a gift . The bra was at a great sale price , the matching panty was at full price . The total , in excess of $ 100 , qualified me for a $ 10 discount and free shipping.Twelve -LRB- 12 -RRB- days after receiving my credit card remittance , they shipped the panty only to me , with no explanation as to the missing bra . I left eleven -LRB- 11 -RRB- detailed voice mail messages with In the Mood Intimates over the next three days , with no response . Finally , another nine -LRB- 9 -RRB- days later , I received an e-Mail asserting that they no longer had the bra in stock , and refusing to accept a return -LRB- even though the panty packaging is unopened -RRB- owing to the nature of the item.Meanwhile , they have charged me for shipping and taken away the $ 10 discount.These people are disreputable . Stay away from them .
 I bought this dress for my 11-month old -LRB- who wears 12 mos -RRB- . The dress was way too big , and one of the gold buttons fell off on our way to get her pictures taken ! After I washed it , the navy blue bow fell off , and two more buttons came off as well . It is an adorable dress , but Save Your Money .
 I received my product rather quickly after placing my order . I am 5 ' 6 '' and I found the outfit too short . My cape was longerthan the dress . I did not like the feel of the velvety material .
 This seller , `` In the Mood Intimates , '' is disreputable . I bought a matched bra and panty set , same color , as a gift . The bra was at a great sale price , the matching panty was at full price . The total , in excess of $ 100 , qualified me for a $ 10 discount and free shipping.Twelve -LRB- 12 -RRB- days after receiving my credit card remittance , they shipped the panty only to me , with no explanation as to the missing bra . I left eleven -LRB- 11 -RRB- detailed voice mail messages with In the Mood Intimates over the next three days , with no response . Finally , another nine -LRB- 9 -RRB- days later , I received an e-Mail asserting that they no longer had the bra in stock , and refusing to accept a return -LRB- even though the panty packaging is unopened -RRB- owing to the nature of the item.Meanwhile , they have charged me for shipping and taken away the $ 10 discount.These people are disreputable .

 Dickies needs to start making these shirts in an athletic or slimmer fit . The shirts are wonderful and comfortable for working in , but the tails are too short and the excess room in the stomach area makes it both come untucked and bunch up way too much . We 're required to wear these where I work , and tucked in , so the strange -LRB- boxy almost -RRB- cut makes it keep coming untucked . The bunched up look around the waist line is also very sloppy.If they made these in a slimmer athletic fit , I would but a million !
 The shirts are fantastic . I wear dickies pants and shirts and they hold up great . My reason for the 2 stars isthat the wrong size was sent . I ordered a 2xx and received a 1x . Not a big deal but I did n't check the size before I removed the tag so i could not return it . The first time i found out that the size was wrong My wife and I went on a trip and when I put the shirt on I almost ripped it . It was my fault for not checking the size but if the right size was sent in the first place it would not have been an issue .
 I bought these for a costume and wanted white opaque tights . Unfortunately , they were not opaque and my legs looked pink/white . But since the package was opened , I was not allowed to return them . Do not buy things from ilovesexy , difficult to return and products are not what they advertise .

 I normally take a medium to a large -LRB- wiast 34 -RRB- and this item arrived , brand new , and arrived fast , however , it did not fit at all . This item runs incredibly small ! -LRB- more like a small than a large ! -RRB- I wasted my money on this item .
 I ordered medium . Way too big for mediums . Thigh length is too short . Material is not the best . Also , they charghe s/h for each item you order . Ridicculus . Maybe , might make good winter underwear . Would not order these again .
 Save your money and buy a pair of Hane 's or Fruit of the Loom underwear . It 's the same thing , just alot cheaper . What I really needed was a pair of biking shorts ... padded in the seat .
 I have recently lost 30 lbs . i was n't sure of my new size so I thought it would be safe to get something with a little give . These shorts were perfect . They move with me , they do n't bunch up , They breathe great . They are great for exercise , aerobics or strength fitness . I am totally going to buy more in different colors .
 NOt as firm as described . Feels more like underwear , not like nylong compression shorts .
 This costume is for my 4 year old daughter . She was upset that the eyepatch fell apart the first time she tried it on . The hat is a flat , floppy imitation of a pirate hat . The nylon costume ran the first time she tried it on . We were also disappointed that the coordinating feathersword was not available to order .

 I bought this to help carry groceries while I was in college and the plastic holding the wheels to the bottom broke the first time I used it and I ended up having to drag it the rest of the way back to my apartment . Unless you plan to carry only really light things with this , do n't waste your money . I 've had many shopping bags like this in the past -- cheaper ones even -- and this one has been the worst . The bag itself is nice enough , but the wheels on the bottom are not strong enough to hold any weight .

 When it came , it was awful , wrinkled out of shape , and looked like something that had been returned if not worn . I called and it was readily replaced . The second one is okay . It will do for halloween and for the price .

 While this costume looked cute in pictures -LRB- both this one and on our son -RRB- , it was horrible flimsy quality . Barely made it through the three Halloween events and was trashed afterwards . On the positive side , it 's easy to get into , son was comfortable in it and from far away it looked good . But if you 're kid 's a climber , crawler , etc. you may want to go with something sturdier .
 came in timely manner . but the snap to the hood fell off when checking servicability .
 I ordered this and was very lucky that it ended up being delayed and did n't arrive on time for halloween . We improvised a fun costume instead but went ahead and accepted the package when it arrived thinking it would be fun for her to play monkey ... I only ordered a monkey costume because I did n't have the time to sew something - but this was so incredibly thin , you can see through the fabric . It is not built to be worn by a toddler , it is n't an easy on/off thing - how are they gon na go to the bathroom ? No tail , basically just a thin brown cloth body suit thing with a cheesy face mask -LRB- with no eyeholes , designed to be worn above the eyes -RRB- . Save your money and draw a mask on cardboard and put your kid in a brown sweatsuit - that 's be more durable , and realistic , than what I received .
 The way the products are linked together is misleading . All the sizes on the page make it very hard to tell what are the junior and what are the kids sizes . thought I was ordering one , got the other . Price and quality where great though . I would have spent more sending them back than I spent buying them . So I have 3 pair of worthless shorts now .
 I got these for my daughter as her swim yeam uniform . They are a terrible cut . They look really like old school gym shorts .
 I was looking for some gym shorts for my little girl . These said they were for children . The shorts were adult size . I was stuck with them as to ship them back would cost more that I paid for them . I threw them in the garbage .
 IT WAS MY MISTAKE . I DID N'T REALIZE THAT THIS ITEM WAS &#34; JUNIOR &#34; SO OF COURSE THEY DID N'T FIT . I DID N'T HAVE A PACKING ORDER SO I COULD N'T RETURN THEM . I 'LL FIND SOME SMALL PERSON TO GIVE THEM TO .
 I ordered 4 pairs of LARGE , and the shorts are way too small -- might fit a 10 year old !
 Is this a joke or what ? These are n't an adult X-large they are a childs medium . It wo n't pay to send them back because of the shipping so I wasted $ 7.99 on a cleaning rag .
 I have not received this item but was charged for it . I contacted the supplier , they did not ship it -LRB- at the time it was not in stock but since then they have it -RRB- . Not sure what has happened . The supplier said to contact Amazon about the charge but I could not find a phone number to report this issue to Amazon . Seems I am caught in the middle of something . Would really like the product !!! Hope someone helps me soon !!!

 I ordered a small , it is huge and has shoulder pads that are on my elbows
 the socks come with a pocket for the heat pads which get so red hot through movement that it burns . the socks without the hot packs are great and warm enough . those heat pad things are dangerous in my opinion .
 These are fine , thick , well-made socks . Yippee-skip , I could have gotten THAT anywhere for half the price . What sold me was the LIE that the stupid chemical packets would do a thing . They did NOTHING . I am not saying they were inadequately warm , I 'm saying they produced no heat at all ! I just got back from four hours of freezing my feet off at the stadium watching my team lose , and as soon as my feet flaw out , I 'd like to put one of them right up this company 's ... ! You want nice , thick socks ? Fine , buy them . Just do n't think the stupid chemical packets will help . If you want extra heat on a cold day , set fire to the socks .
 No good for skiing . To bulky to fit in boots and do not keep your toes warm -LRB- lack of oxygen ? -RRB- . Disappointing .
 These are just regular socks and when you put the hand warmer in it is difficult to walk comfortably because of the extra bulk . Works ok while sitting and you can loosen your laces .

 One star rating for a incomplete description of the item ! What the description fails to mention is that the back of this jacket is covered in sewn on patches - a huge patriotic eagle on the middle back as well as several smaller patches . The 2 patches on the front I can handle ; 5 + more , NO . If I had known they were there I would not have purchased the jacket . Since I got it for such a good price it is not worth the shipping fee to return it . I will donate it to a local charity that provides coats for the needy , and buy my son another jacket .
 To start , I would like to say that this jacket is relatively cheap for being all leather . Which is nice , except that it is literally frankensteined together . It is made of about 400 different buffalo hide scraps , and they are not symmetrical.It also came with a secret . The back of this coat had 5 patches sewed on , including a huge decal that read `` Live to Ride , '' and had a picture of an eagle and an american flag . I did manage to get them off , at the cost of ripping the jacket in a small area.Saying that , this is a warm , heavy coat that fits good enough -LRB- tight sleeves and a loose back for a huge beer gut to fill -RRB- . I probably would n't buy this product again , as I would rather have fabric over this patchwork of leather strips and patches .
 when I got this item had a Rip in the seam in the back and it wasent worth the shipping cost to get it replaced . over all after i got the Seam fixed and take off all the patches it looks great over all worth the 40 bucks you 'll spend on it . Prob not worth much more then that .
 Cheap Charlie ! Husband hated it ! I hate it . look at pic closely before buying ! Diamond plate must be another name for little pieces stitched together
 1 when i buy the jacket the pic was from a different jacket a straight jacket ! 2 is made by small pieces and in the specifications doe n't show nothing about it
 First the image here is not representative of what you 're buying . in fact the leather is just made of small fragments sewed in together and the quality is rather poor and the sown starts to fall apart just after a few times of wearing it . Furthermore some of my leather pieces are of poorer quality and the paint starts to peel off.And of course the back has some huge decal that is not shown in the picture and it should be .
 Your ad indicated the jacket had logo on front but not so much on back , not happy with that . Would have preferred plain back with no logo . But the worst part about the jacket was when I opened the box it had a strong mildew odor . It was as if it had been stored a long time in someones basement . Will most likely return itRB Ellis , Michigan
 `` You get what you pay for '' applies perfectly . I thought this would be a good motorcycle riding jacket but it 's too thin and looks like from a rack in a bargain basement . OK for hanging out with posers .

 The underwear was tempting to buy only for its price . I liked how it looked , but wasnt all too impressed . When i wore it , the first thing i noticed was how uncomfortable the sling system was . I got rid of it , and that aside , the underwear was perfect . . comfortable , fitted really well and looked good . But after what seemed like one wash , the ends started giving away and it now looks more like a skirt than a trunk . the lower edges have flared up -LRB- dunno why -RRB- . The 2 stars are for the initial fit -LRB- looked super hot -RRB- . . I ordered 5 pieces , so I got 5 days of awesome sex ! Lol . .
 Uncomfortable ! Poor quality ! Bad Customer Service ! Nice box/advertising ! I purchased 3 of these -LRB- different colors -RRB- , never having owned this brand . I purchased from another online retailer , not Amazon . One had a tag that read `` Medium '' which did n't match the size on the box or the size ordered , which was `` Large '' . Upon calling the online retailer all of their stock in the color `` gray '' was the same situation . Returned it and received a replacement pair , size `` Large '' , which was significantly bigger than either of the other 2 pair which were supposed to be size `` Large '' . I called C-in2 to express my dissatisfaction with the initial stock mix-up of all gray pair , received no response.Lastly , the `` sling '' advertised , sounds better in theory than it is . After a couple of minutes the sling gets uncomfortable , feels like a paper cut .
 I ordered this item and received the one w/the pencil case , twice ! So if you want the pencil case instead of the lunch kit , order here ! Plus it 's a really , cheaply made vinyl book bag . It does n't look durable at all ! Do n't waste your $ !
 Like the buyer above me , I purchased this backpack and recieved the pencil case one instead . I am in the process or returning it and hopefully will not receive the pencil one a second time !!!
 I bought these for my husband and the color said rinse so I thought regular jean color . In fact they were so dark that they almost look black . I have washed then about 5 times but they wo n't fade .
 I am vey unhappy with the sales professional in Nautica outlet stores . I had a very bad experience at Nautica store outlet stores . The customer service representatives are very rude and unprofessional . They basically said they do n't really care if they lose one customer , other customers will still buy . -LRB- if that is the case , why are prices slashed by 50 % ... it is because people do not want to pay the full price ... -RRB- I do not think I will ever buy from Nautica . A few uncaring sales represtatives give a very bad name to the whole company .
 Strap was way too tight and constricting ; did not stay on when walking around .
 I bought this item and the identical one without the sling . I tried the sling in every POSSIBLE position and it does n't show my package much more than the regular ones do . The sling does spin and twist and it isnt worth 3 extra bucks . The regular ones without the sling are on here for 12 bucks . go for that and your wife or girlfriend will be happy .
 I was very disappointed to find that this vest was n't the same thickness I have purchased in the past . I ca n't imagine this layer will be able to really keep me that much warmer as it 's intended . What happened to the Columbia quality of old ? My husband also received a vest for Christmas , and we were equally disappointed with that one for the same reason . His vest that I bought him 4 years ago is much thicker -LRB- aka much warmer to wear in below freezing temps -RRB- . We were very disappointed .
 I 'm sorry , maybe it 's in my genetics , but I have always had really stinky feet , and that 's never changed , plus it never bothered me . I decided to order this to see if it would give m any results , and guess what ? it made my feet smell even worse !!? lol , I would much rather have the natural , sweaty smell of my feet ... then this stinky smell , If it worked for others , then great.But me , I 'll stay away from this stinky feet spray .
 these were made horribly . i doubt they are even adidas . the ones i bought at dicks sporting were more money but better quality .
 Not cotton . Very badly made . I do not think it is Adidas . From the quality , it is more like imitations you find in the black market.Size is correct . Fits .
 This hat bends out of shape really easily . The only reason why I gave it 2 stars is because it looks good when it 's new .
 Is this a joke or what ? These are n't an adult X-large they are a childs medium . It wo n't pay to send them back because of the shipping so I wasted $ 7.99 on a cleaning rag .

 I was pleased with the look of the tights but hugely disappointed in the quality . I purchased the silver ones . I wear regular tights all the time and NEVER have a problem with them getting a run unless I snagged them . I got a run in these tights in the toe/foot within minutes of putting them on , before I even had shoes on . I had no choice but to wear them since it was for a special event and I had only purchased 1 pair . They are one size and I am average height 5 ' 5 '' and weight , size 6-8 . Even I felt they were a little small . Do not buy them if you are taller than average , they will never fit . They are not control top and I felt like I was jacking them up constantly for the few hours that I had them on even though I had a slimmer bottom/leotard on `` over '' them . For the price , they were a huge disapointment . If they had been better quality they would have had a repeat customer but next time I will just buy the glimmer pantyhose by regular manufacturers and take my chances on getting a run . They were a little more opaque i.e. not as sheer than I really wanted , more so than the regular glimmer pantyhose . I could live with that , just not the run within 5 minutes of putting them on . Another BIG thing , they have a big line across the thigh i.e. they do NOT have an invisible panty . You really can not wear them with a leotard , the line is clearly visible and that was not clear in the description of the tights . I would have passed on them had I known that since I intended to wear them with a leotard . They arrived by the promise date but they were the last of about 10 items to arrive that I ordered at the same time .
 Ordered this hat according to the hat sizing chart and received a hat obviously too small . I followed the return policy instructions and tried to contact the seller -LRB- three times -RRB- and after a month they have yet to respond . Unless my head starts shrinking rapidly , this fella is going to Goodwill .
 The description was not helpful to us . We were looking for a much tighter fit . The shirt was loose fit .
 Waited over a month for this shirt to arrive in the mail . Most likely came from a knock off chinese factory . NOT the UA Tech shirt . Tag says it has 5 % elastane in the fabric , but it does n't , so I can only assume this is not authentic Under Armour clothing . I own several products from UA and a couple UA Tech shirts . This does not resemble any of them and feels exactly like a shirt that I have from them that is 100 % polyester . I wont be sending this shirt back , because I have already waited a month for it and wont be wasting my time . From now on i will only be purchasing my clothes from the brands website , if Amazon is going to allow knockoff companies to copyright other brands products .
 i recently ordered a Large one , but it 's bigger than large . i think it 's like XL or something like that . i just waste $ 17 . i would n't recommend this .
 -LSB- UPDATE -RSB- - Under Armour has a new updated version of the UA Tech -LRB- tm -RRB- T-Shirt that is awesome ! My review below applies to the old version ... the ones that I received when I ordered from this page before . Looking at the images I believe that they are now shipping the new version -LRB- based on appearance and colors -RRB- but , I do n't know for sure . Please consider this when reading my review . I will leave my rating at 1 star until I order one and verify that they are shipping the good version.I purchased about 6 of these shirts , 3 at Amazon and a few more at a local Sports Authority . All of these shirts had the same core problems : Poor Quality - They are irregularly cut , from one shirt to the next they fit differently . Some had tight collars , others were lose and baggy , some were a bit too long.Clingy and Itchy - These shirts cling to everything , including themselves . Performance shirts like this should be smooth and move with you . These shirts grab onto my workout shorts and running pants and then pull and stretch when I move . Also , there 's a peculiar scratchy roughness to the material that makes them slightly itchy.I 'm really surprised that UA put their name on this product . I have many other UA shirts , shorts and underwear and they all perform exceptionally well . These shirts simply have no redeeming qualities ... yeah , they 're inexpensive -LRB- aka cheap -RRB- and you get what you pay for . My advice
 I have others UA products and they are really good , but this item that i 've got it 's not.I dont recommend , the material it 's not like the others . Looks like a normal sleeve .
 This shirt definitely disappointed . All my work out shirts are cotton so I needed to upgrade especially since I am one to sweat . The reviews were overall good so I went for this one . But it did not deliver . Reviews claimed it was comfortable -LRB- reviewers even claimed to use this as lounge - and sleepwear -RRB- but it is not . At all . It is scratchy and rough and fibery . It 's cut oddly so it has a strange shape , especially at the neckline and the rim . It has strings coming out of it . And to top it off , it 's overpriced . Do not get this . Look elsewhere . I have not tried other UA products so these issues may or may not be restricted to this specific UA product but if I were looking to buy another work out shirt I would try a different brand .
 I spect something better from under armour ... the material of the shirt it 's so common , 95 % cotton and 5 % expandex and the shirt collar is tight and itching , if you want something better try this shirt : Under Armour HeatGear Compression and dont forget to buy a size up .
 This item is not the snug fitting , smooth feeling under armour heat gear I have come to love . This is a loose cut synthetic tee shirt . The material is very thin and cheap feeling . It has that itchy , plastic-like feel against the skin . The materials performance is irrelevant to me at this point since I do n't even like putting it on . The shirts cut and style give it a very different range of applications than the traditional under armour apparel . This was my mistake . A similar quality synthetic `` tech '' tee shirt can be purchased at wal mart for much less than I paid for this thing .
 WARNING IT 'S NOT ACTUALLY ARMOR , IT 'S ARMOUR PROBABLY FRENCH BECAUSE THIS THING DOES NOT PROTECT AGAINTS BULLETS I LEARNED THE HARD WAY .
 I bought the large and was very disappointed with the fit . Very baggy - wears like a regular tshirt so it is n't worth the price at all .
 I ordered these in XL -LRB- 40-42 -RRB- and they fit like a 36 . Most of my 40 boxers are almost too large but these 40-42 I can barely get on they are so tight . At first I thought I was sent the wrong size , but the label right on the boxers says XL 40-42 . I will be returning them .
 It 's too long for M size i did n't expect that and it 's ore is bad it 's too classic to wear it . i do n't like it
 Having worn Hanes boxer briefs in the past and loving them this was a natural purchase for me . However , when I got them and tried them on I quickly realized they were not the same fit as my previous collection . Unless you wear your underwear up to your armpits then do not order these . Wearing them in a normal position under the navel means you have about six inches of sag between your legs .
 I 'm looking for a new brand . I have n't tried these others . See the Butt Hole blow Out Underwear video on you tube b29349 Hanes are paper thin . FOTL is the only one worse .
 These are 75 % cotton and 25 % polyester and consequently are very poor at holding their shape . These will hang very loose and closely approximate traditional boxers . I originally bought the Hanes 95 % cotton / 5 % spandex Boxer Brief Underwear and ordered these by mistake . Beware , if you 're looking for the more form fitting , shape holding pair , these are not them . If you like a lot of room to roam in your underwear , these are definitely for you .
 They 're nice when they 're new , but the waist and leg bands last less than a year , at which point you 've got ugly boxers instead of comfy briefs .
 I bought these because i loved the way my first purchase of these boxer brief fit , especially in length . So thinking , i was getting the same fit , i bought another set . I was disappointed to find that these revised boxer briefs are NOT the same as the original boxer briefs . First the the length is almost 3 or 4 inches longer , almost looking like shorts . Second , the fit is all-around loose , and not close-fitting as I would 've preferred .
 26 % Poly . FALSE ADVERTISING ON AMAZON 's PART . not 100 % cotton do not buy . how can any human being wear poly underwear ???
 One pair had a huge hole in the crotch . Worst purchase ever . The reason I bought new ones is because my old one 's have holes in them !!!!!
 I returned theses because you can get the same item for 7 dollars at target . Why spend more money than you need too .
 Do not buy these , I wish I had not thrown the money away on these . Originally when I bought these for my husband he really enjoyed them . I even went so far as to order a second package of 4 , especially when I saw the price decrease . SO SORRY I DID . Original purchases early 2012 - it is now August . He absolutely can not -LRB- not to be confused with will not -RRB- wear these any more . The first 2 months were fine - he really liked them a lot ; very comfortable and glad he changed from the regular briefs he had been wearing for years , usually Hanes brand . I followed washing instructions to the letter . He said after a couple months the elastic was no longer holding up . First
 I bought some briefs from Kohls a couple of months ago and got the best briefs ever . They were expensive at the time so I figured perhaps it may be cheaper on Amazon.I found the exact same briefs I bought at Kohls for 1/2 the price , BUT ... ! These new briefs from Amazon SUCK ! The quality is nothing like Kohls . The material from Kohls is 95 % Cotton and 5 % Spandex . I enjoy a tight fit and these new briefts are 75 % Cotton and 25 % Spandex . These new briefs do not hug my legs and ride up . They are already streched out and the material is poor . I am very disapointed in these briefs and will be getting my briefs from Kohls .
 One of the four briefs came with the fly sewn completely shut . I 'm not sure whether that was a gross oversight in quality control or someone 's idea of a joke .
 Cheaply made w / thin material . In an experiment , I purchased boxer briefs from BVD , Fruit of the Loom and Hanes . Hanes -LRB- this product -RRB- rated the worst at 2 stars , Fruit of the Loom is slightly better at 3 stars and BVD 's are the best -LRB- but still not perfect -RRB- at 4 stars .
 Hard to find good boxer briefs that do n't ride up your legs . I am neither fat nor skinny and I am constantly pulling the legs back down . Do n't believe the promise that they wo n't ride up . In fairness a lot of other boxer briefs I buy do the same .
 When I first received these Hanes Classics Men 's 4-Pack Multi-Color Boxer Brief Underwear , I was pleased with their fit and comfort . After a couple of washes -LRB- on gentle cycle in cold water and without over drying -RRB- I noticed that the there were little strings coming out around the waistband on a couple of pair . Not long after this the stitching continued to come apart and the waistband began separating from the boxer briefs.I therefore can not recommend these . I can however recommend theHanes CSWB Boxer Briefs . They are comparably priced and seem to be better made with a nice comfortable fit .
 cheap but bad quality and not durable , I rated it two star because it is cheap boxer.I do not recommend to get it .
 They used to be shorter and tighter . They are too baggy . Son could not wear them so we gave them to a friend . This is the brand that we bought about two years ago and they were a MUCH better fit then . They must have done something to their sizing .
 The description says 100 % cotton . When the product promptly arrived -LRB- thank you Amazon -RRB- the outer packaging said 75 % cotton , 25 % polyester . I opened the pack and the label inside the garment said the same thing . I ca n't wear polyester . If you want 100 % cotton , do n't buy these . I 'm returning them .
 I have old pairs of Hanes that I bought in stores recently and the pack I received from Amazon does n't compare in regards to quality of material . The band is not as durable as the packs I bought in stores . Also , I do n't know if this just happened to me but I bought a pack of mediums and my pack came with 3 mediums and 1 extra large ... Definitely returning this item asap.Also had issues with a pair of Levi 527 jeans I bought off Amazon which turned out to be knock-offs which is why I question buying clothes off of Amazon now .
 Read other reviews too late and these do n't hold my boys in place too well . I have to hike them up to wedgy status above my belly button to keep everything down-under in line . Please either change the size chart or send these back to China or where-ever their made for us &#34; overweight Americans &#34; which I 'm not one of .
 The sizing of this product seems very inconsistent . It 's hard to match what we have , which is large . I get the large and they 're too big ; I get the medium and it 's too small .
 It fits comfortable but the fabric is not as expected.It 's a little coarse and obviously weak and does n't seem that could endure much .
 I am not very happy with these , they do n't hold their shape that long , had a much better luck with Tommy 's Classic Brief . Go for them instead .
 I have used CK for a number of years -LRB- ~ 8 years -RRB- but it seems that the quality has changed with my last order . CK used to mean quality ... Not anymore . These are thin material , , weak bands , etc. . Just cheap !
 I 've bought these Calvin Klein briefs for at least ten years and they 've always fit perfectly , but this shipment definitely does not . they are to `` short '' . . they 've decreased length , or amount of material between the waistband and legs , making you constantly want to tug them higher but if you do they pull around the legs at the bottom . uncomfortable . disappointing . guess I will have to find another brand .
 Shocking - holes developing already come on CK ths ca n't be right . Any comments elsewhere as I am surely not alone ? Not worth a premium price .
 i did not see it . where is it ? where is it !! I paid money but did not get anything
 A white waistband on black briefs ???? How about putting that in the description , Amazon ?
 Ordered these Calvin Klein Briefs directly from Amazon -LRB- no other Company was mentioned -RRB- . The 2 most important layers of clothe do not stay overlapped and everything falls out ! I have NEVER had this happen before even with my older Calvin Kleins . Embarassing , useless , and who 's going to return used underware ?
 I have been buying these briefs for 10 years and this is the first time that I have had shrinkage problems with them . The must have gone from a size 42 to a 38 after the first washing .
 I have been happy with Calvin Klein underwear in the past , but these are the most uncomfortable I have ever owned . I should have never purchased them . They are cut extremely low and simply do not fit the body .
 I have used these briefs before and have washed them in warm water and dried them in warm/cool dryer , which proved to be good . For some reason these recent ones shrunk more than they should have . They became too short in highth.The seller finally replied but did not offer any compensation.I had bought 4 three packs of briefs all a waste . -LSB- ASIN : B00062WSNO Calvin Klein Men 's Basic Brief , 3-Pack -RSB- -RSB-
 I like the fit of these underware , however , I ordered 5 pair of black ones that came from Macys . The waist band indicates size 30 . But actually they are size 34 + . $ 10.00 a pair for 5 pair.Cant return then so stuck with underware big enough for a linebacker .
 I have worn these briefs for years and loved them . However , on my most recent purchase , -LRB- from Macys -RRB- I experienced the same `` lack of overlap '' as a previous reviewer . I thought it was just me . I do n't know if it is a flaw in production or a style change , but if it is a style change , I do n't like it . If I run up stairs or make other less active moves , my ball sac completely comes out of the briefs between the fly .
 I got these about a year back but they seem to have shrunk . My waist is 32 '' and has remained the same mean while . The briefs are of poor quality and they wear out fast . I would not recommend any basic briefs by CK whether in grey or black . I own both and have had to dispose all of them within a year . I strongly recommend GAP or H&M or even JOCKEY instead . They are more expensive but they are on the money , 7 of those boxerbriefs/briefs and you are good to go . If you are buying Calvin Klein underwear please know that these 3-in-1 briefs -LRB- H&M 3 in 1 's though are gorgeous -RRB- are not of the same quality as the other brands I have mentioned . Buying 3-in-1 may seem like a good idea for those who do n't do laundry twice a week but they are so worn and shrunk . These became very uncomfortable to wear , my boys feel cramped .
 Same size and shape as always , but the quality of the cotton is terrible . I 've been purchasing these for better than 20 years . The ones that I have that are 2 years old and been through many washes are a thicker cotton than those just purchased . Very disappointed . If you have not bought these in a while , do n't buy them now . They are not the same good cotton as before .
 cut was unflattering with loose flaps at sides , colour tones were flat and dull for all 3 colours ... high-rise brief would be a more accurate description forpeople who prefer mid-rise or low-rise
 Ok nice looking shoe . Big wide toe box , good sole , comfortable fit with no real break in required.So whats not to like ? A
 These bibs are a big waste of money!They are too difficult to get around my son 's neck , and he HATES it when i put them on him!Then , once it 's finally on , he is constantly getting his arms stuck under it and getting frustrated that he ca n't get his hands to his mouth.Also , the pocket part of the bib is always getting smooshed by the highchair tray so that no food can get into it , so it all ends up on his lap - what 's the point of a pocket bib then?They are easily cleanable and wipeable and do n't have to hang dry forever ... those are the only positive things I have to say about them.I recommend trying the Bumkins bibs instead , we love them!Grade
 I ordered this product with pocket . Received it without pocket . The product is of good quality and I will keep it anyway .
 I ordered 3 of these Polo Shirts , and I regret wasting my money . I did n't read the reviews until after I placed my ordered and they were right . The fabric is EXTREMELY thin and a bit transparent , and the stitching was horrible . Very LOW QUALITY . I seriously do n't recommend you buying this product , cause you just gon na end up returning it .
 The vendor did not ship the merchandise I ordered . The customer service is poor . The vendor tried to get paid for merchandise I did not have after I returned the shirts .
 Sizes run small , material very thin , did n't wash well - net-net
 the total price of almost ten dollars -LRB- including shipping -RRB- was n't worth it . the quality was very thin and the sewing was n't professionally done - the buttoned down part by the neckline was not straight and there were threads loose here and there . i would have kept it if it was just thin but the sewing was just too cheap looking .
 I was very disappointed to find that this vest was n't the same thickness I have purchased in the past . I ca n't imagine this layer will be able to really keep me that much warmer as it 's intended . What happened to the Columbia quality of old ? My husband also received a vest for Christmas , and we were equally disappointed with that one for the same reason . His vest that I bought him 4 years ago is much thicker -LRB- aka much warmer to wear in below freezing temps -RRB- . We were very disappointed .
 I was very upset when i received this purchase it is soooooooooooooo small and i think i was deceived especially with the sheep , they make it look like a decent size but it is as small as a chew toy and now i have to buy something else to give along with this gift . This was not worth the money i spent . = -LRB-
 When I received the Cloud b Baby Sheep , I was sure it was a mistake ! This is the worst misleading product representation I have EVER SEEN . It does n't even look at all like the picture , it 's about 3 inches , I thought it was the rattle , and the Sheep would come later , I was shocked to find out this was the product . Shame on the Company and shame on Amazone for selling it !
 Whoever buys this , realize that it 's about the size of a coffee cup . Literally , you could probably fit the gift into a large coffee cup . Definitely not enough to give as a stand-alone gift .
 Everything you see , only exists in the front . There is no design to the back , basically without the cape , you look like a total fool considering the back looks nothing like the front -LRB- it 's not even gray -RRB- . This costume is also extremely hard to wear if you 're under 250 lbs considering the waist band seems like it was designed for someone 300 + lbs.When I wore it , I had a hard time keeping the pants up , will probably use a personal belt in the future , however there are no loops , so I 'm not sure how I can pull that off.The yellow belt is also comedically oversized , so do n't expect to be taken seriously -LRB- why would you ? :P -RRB- . As for the arm components , they are very poorly held on by a single velcro strap on each side . it is also VERY difficult to find any kind of free-movement in this costume considering how oversized and non-flexible the arms are.I 'm 5 ' 11 , I should of been able to move freely , but that 's just not the case.I suggest shelling out a bit more cash for a better costume if you 're serious about walking around as batman . This one ? It looks cool from the front , and all around if you wear the cape , but as far as quality/comfort , I suggest you avoid it.Lastly , the straps that are supposed to keep the chest plate on -LRB- yes , straps , it 's extremely 2 dimensional , as I said , you look really stupid from behind -RRB- , they ripped right away , incredibly low quality for something I just spent $ 500 + on.Happy shopping ~
 1 . belt was danmaged 2 , the same with mask ,3 two left biceps 4 lines and mistakes on chest , very bad for 660 dolars
 The products were not as good of a quality as expected . Although each shirt was the same size in the order and the tags when received , there was a significant difference in the size of each . The seller did offer replacement but I did not bother . I was also very annoyed by political advertisement for Barack Obama that was shipped with the merchandise .
 The jeans were well made , but the sizing was on the small side . I wear jeans with some stretch to them now , but they are by no means tight . The Lee jeans were either cut small or the manufacturer seems to think larger sized women should be wearing skin tight clothing . Hello !!!! Look in the mirror and out on the streets . The only people who can get away with wearing tight clothing are under 13 .
 I 've had this for over a year now . I bought it looking for wind protection and am very disappointed with the breathability of this product . It traps moisture inside and I end up with a visibly damp shirt and have to turn the jacket inside out to dry . That 's what happens in dry weather . The fit is comfortable and it 's otherwise conveniently designed . The fabric in white is quite see-through . Later I purchased Turfer 's `` Womens 's Light Weight Endurance Jacket '' for $ 14.95 and that 's been the perfect windbreaker . It 's now up to $ 19.95 and I 'm ordering another color .
 took 3 weeks for my item to arrive . bought it for my brother 's birthday , he did n't get it until 2 weeks after it already passed
 I bought this shirt as a gift for someone and received it with two holes right in the front center of it . Extremely disappointed in this purchase and will be returning it .
 I have a Dunder Mifflin shirt ... Michael Scott 's fun run . So I bought this , thinking it would be the same quality . As soon as I took it out of the envelope I noticed that the logo design , which is the whole reason you buy shirts like these , was completely faded and horrible looking . It looks like the rollers did n't have enough paint on them or something . I sent the shirt back as soon as I opened it . Big disappointment , as I was planning on wearing this to a party tomorrow . I am surprised that someone would even package this to ship to a customer , as it is obvious it is defective . Now that I think about it , I think they put a `` distressed logo '' shirt in the envelope instead of the regular one , which is the one I bought . Not being a fan of distressed anything , I am sending it back .
 I am a long-time Amazon customer and recently began searching for leathermouse pads as gifts for my employees and our clients . Found this item andjust want to share a note of caution with you : Bonded Leather , or `` Reconstituted Leather '' is not really a true leatherbut a man-made material composed of 60 % to 90 % leather fibers -LRB- often scrapfrom leather tanneries -RRB- . Bonded leather is not as durable as genuineleathers , and is recommended for use only if the product will be usedinfrequently . -LRB- data from WIKIPEDIA online -RRB- There are many true genuine leather mouse pads from other vendors and atbetter prices ! Amazon may also have some , keep searching , but rememberonly the words `` GENUINE LEATHER '' or equal terminology should appear inthe description .
 Material felt rough and uncomfortable . I returned item . Spend your money on better quality pajamas .
 I just received these pajamas yesterday and was so disappointed . The blue on the screen looks pretty but in person these are a sensational metalic blue . Yikes ! They are way too big on me even though I bought the right size according to the merchants chart . They are so stiff & scratchy . I thought they 'd be softer like the ones I buy at Target from Gillian & Malley . I 'll be sending these back .
 My husband bought me these pjs . I had n't worn them but packed them in the bag to bring to the hospital after my daughter was born . Did I mention he got them a size to big to accomodate my pregnancy bloated-ness . I wore them for the first time at the hospital and they ripped . They are un-wearable after half a use . They 're flimsy and I actually was n't very fond of them anyways because the fabric made me feel like I had a plastic drapped around my body -LRB- it did NOT breathe ... even a little -RRB- . So do n't waste your money . These are not worth the packaging they come in .
 I bought 2 pajama sets , size small , for a xmas present . Both tops were like extra large and both bottoms were like extra small . I returned them at my cost -LRB- $ 10.00 -RRB- . Intimo did not correct the problem as promised or phone me back as promised . One month later , they emailed me that the sizing was correct . WHAT ??? Intimo issued me store credit . NO REFUNDS . Would you have faith in buying here again with the strong potential for the same result at your return cost ? Credit card disputes did not help . Do n't shop with Intimo !!! I regret it . I give this item one star because they don tallow 0 . Intimo Women 's 100 % Silk Pajama

 Bought this for my husband 's birthday . I was appalled to find out , by reading the warning label , that it contains lead and can cause cancer , birth defects and reproductive problems . It also says to wash your hands after handling . I returned it but had to pay the return fee myself . Not feeling too warm and fuzzy about this purchase !
 I do n't usually write reviews , and I like to stay as positive as possible . But I feel I must warn others about my experience with the store/co . that tried to do business with me through Amazon.In early Nov. . I requested a men 's size Large of the Turfer Unixex Metro Fleece and they sent me an XXL ! Somebody is either in too much of a hurry , or they do n't care , or they ca n't read , or ALL of the above . When I brought it to the company 's attention , they returned a very `` breezy , '' off-hand , reply , again reinforcing my opinion of their lack of attention to matters that count . I returned the size XXL and ordered a L . So far , I have n't heard a word from the co. that sells this item . Frankly , I 've just given up . But I NEVER want to do business with them EVER again .
 Wow ... the size was so far off you could fit 2 people in this v neck sweatshirt . . not happy ... no size chart on the site ... I want to return but they want me to pay the shipping ... do n't order unless you can get some kind of sizing information from them .
 This product was received on time and in very good condition but `` fit '' people beware ! First I should say that I 'm 6 ' 1 '' and 170 lbs . No beer belly here ... and that seems to be part of the problem with the way this product fits . -LRB- Or more accurately does n't fit -RRB- I 'm pretty sure I could curl up into a ball and fit my entire body into the torso of this `` sweater '' without stretching it out . Perhaps this was designed to fit a more `` husky '' body type . If you are short and stocky you have a better chance of being satisfied with this product .

 Nice construction , but it did n't hold up . Need another bra underneath and that was n't the point of this purchase .

 What a total waste of money ... TOTAL . I know holiday costumes arent supposed to last long I get that , but this one was extremely cheap and poorly made . It already had a run up the costume before I even tried it on . Plus I get short , but this costume was even too short for me and I am short -LRB- 4 ' 11 ! -RRB- and it barely covered my back side ... to say it was horrible is an understatement . Do n't waste your money .

 I do n't usually write reviews , and I like to stay as positive as possible . But I feel I must warn others about my experience with the store/co . that tried to do business with me through Amazon.In early Nov. . I requested a men 's size Large of the Turfer Unixex Metro Fleece and they sent me an XXL ! Somebody is either in too much of a hurry , or they do n't care , or they ca n't read , or ALL of the above . When I brought it to the company 's attention , they returned a very `` breezy , '' off-hand , reply , again reinforcing my opinion of their lack of attention to matters that count . I returned the size XXL and ordered a L . So far , I have n't heard a word from the co. that sells this item . Frankly , I 've just given up . But I NEVER want to do business with them EVER again .
 Wow ... the size was so far off you could fit 2 people in this v neck sweatshirt . . not happy ... no size chart on the site ... I want to return but they want me to pay the shipping ... do n't order unless you can get some kind of sizing information from them .

 Nice construction , but it did n't hold up . Need another bra underneath and that was n't the point of this purchase .
 I 've bought only Gold Toe Canterbury Over the Calf Socks for about 20 years . The last few times I 've bought them I 've been sorely disappointed . One pair was so thin I could see my skin through them . A sock in another pair developed a hole on the side of the ankle after wearing it two times . I 'm now looking for another brand to buy . I 've had problems with others as well . The quality of Gold Toe has gotten much worse over last 6 months to a year .
 I read the reviews before purchasing but after using the socks I 've found that ; they cling to your pants . When standing , pants do not slip down to your shoes , they cling to your socks . When sitting , they grab your pants and stretch your pants tightly over your knees . They socks are also very tight.I gave them 1 star because they do n't fall down as advertised , and they do cover your ankles.I 'll go back to occasionally puling up my socks .
 The product description says these socks are for shoe sizes 7-12 . I wear size 9 , and these socks are much too big for me . These socks do seem to be of good quality , but I 'll be returning them .
 the weave is too thick . sock is not wide enough so it is tight . Heavy and rough texture . Sock runs small .
 3 pairs , 2 different lengths , so 1 pair long , 1 pair a little shorter & 1 pair of different lengths . to be fair it is not a great deal difference & they all work for boot socks , it 's kinda like grandma knitted them .
 GOLD TOE is only capable of manufacturing these socks in one color . I literally have purchased , and have in front of me three different pairs of this same model in `` SUPPOSED '' gray , navy , and black . I am an optical engineer by trade . The socks are literally in front of me under a calibrated light source and THEY ARE ALL BLACK . The Canterbury Over the Calf Dress Socks in gray , navy , and black are utterly indistinguishable , they are all black . If all you need are quality black socks then by all means purchase these socks . If you need a color other than black you will not be able to acquire it from this company in this model . This is because Gold Toe Men 's Canterbury Over the Calf Dress Socks are only manufactured in black . Just to be clear , the manufacturing plant for these socks probably only carries black dye . I can not illustrate how epically disappointing the color of these socks are . GET YOUR GAME TOGETHER GOLD TOE !!! Make socks that do n't fall down in the right color !! It 's not rocket science ! All socks purchased at Amazon .
 not a good product , immediately shrunk , too expensive , took forever to get to me . overall representative of a failed business model .
 I thought I was getting socks with part wool ! These socks are `` OK '' but not what I thought I was getting . The problem may be that the socks were along-side some wool ones . It looks like I made a mistake , especially since the socks I bought did not list the composition right in the description.Now , I 'm somewhat skeptical of the socks ads therein.Chuck
 These are NOT Over the Calf as advertised in the desc . They barely go halfway past my calf , and when I try to pull them higher , they wind up sliding down until they become bunched up crew socks as I walk.I bought a similar product called `` Canterbury over the calf athletic sock '' last year , and those were TRUE OTC socks -LRB- almost reaching my knees -RRB- , but unfortunately Amazon was out of black in that design.These should really be re-labeled `` mid calf '' , as they are definitely not OVER the calf .
 Up until this purchase I have been completely satisfied with every single gold toe product I have ever purchased . I would only wear gold toe socks . I can not fathom that the owners of Gold Toe would destroy their brand by producing this product . They are the worst socks I have ever purchased , do not buy this product !
 I paid a pretty penny for these and then i realized that you can get packs of 3 Goldtoes from Ross for around $ 7-8 . I wo n't say they were identical but they were pretty good for me .
 These are great if you do n't care that you look like an idiot . My husband bought these and expected them to zip off to shorts . Instead they become Man-Capris !!

 I like the t-shirt but the size chart is not correct . I had to give this away to someone because it was way too small for me ... I would say it was more a L instead of 3X
 I did not like this product . It is not worth buying . I would not shop here again . The material is not recommended .
 I have not received this item but was charged for it . I contacted the supplier , they did not ship it -LRB- at the time it was not in stock but since then they have it -RRB- . Not sure what has happened . The supplier said to contact Amazon about the charge but I could not find a phone number to report this issue to Amazon . Seems I am caught in the middle of something . Would really like the product !!! Hope someone helps me soon !!!

 At first my wife ordered two womens smalls . They were much too small . I mailed them back , at my expense , to exchange for mediums . These were too tight around the waist and too wide in the shoulders . It 's not worth my effort to return them for credit .
 Sleeves much longer than expected . If the shirt did n't allow push up sleeves to elbow I would return . Otherwise the top is ok

 I 've been shopping on Amazon for years and have often seen negative reviews to which I paid little attention . This time , I should 've listened.The reviews about sizing problems are correct - I got this item after ordering 2 sizes larger than I usually get , and it was completely off . The waist was too small and the torso section was n't anywhere near long enough . Maybe for smaller men or females this would n't be the case , but for me I 've never been so disappointed in a purchase , and this will be the first product I 've ever returned.If this were $ 20 or less I 'd say take the chance , but at $ 50 find something else.The one upside is that it arrived quickly and , for once , in appropriately sized packaging .
 The jumpsuit showed up quickly.Awesome.I tried it on , and really ? I ordered it a size big figuring I would rather it be baggy.My balls wish I had ordered it two or three sizes bigger . The legs could also be a good six inches shorter . I had planned on using it for part of a halloween costume then as a coverall for paintball . There is NO WAY I could run around or crouch in it.If you are going to have freakishly sized clothes , please have your own sizing chart , thats actually true to your clothes .

 The Signature Merino Wool Cable Crewneck Sweater by Jos. A Bank I purchased is very shoddily constructed and I have had to mend it twice so far , with the neck part coming away from the sweater in parts . If I could have clicked on a negative star or no star , I would have . I am not satisfied with this product .
 I bought this for my daughter to wear for this winter . I order her actual size -LRB- 3T -RRB- . It runs atleast 2 sizes to big and the buttons all broke . I ca n't even believe that ALL the buttons broke just from trying it on . I would love to know if i just got a `` bad '' coat or if they are all like this ... . Thanks C
 I ordered two Kid 's Long Sleeve Royal blue Rash Guard shirts in large for a slender son . They were absolutely sized incorrectly and he could barely get into them . These were a birthday gift so it was really a shame . Then when I returned them they charged a restocking fee . So , they made the shirts too small and then charge a fee.I will not order from this company again .
 Nice construction , but it did n't hold up . Need another bra underneath and that was n't the point of this purchase .

 I bought this t-shirt for a friend of mine depending on the coloring of the picture but when i received it , i was disappointed because it 's sooo different , the upper part -LRB- neck and shoulders area -RRB- is faded GREEN , however in the picture it shows as if the color is blue-ish grey . So the whole T-Shirt looks odd , with the Green upper part and the purple part -LRB- hem area -RRB- . I 'm not so happy with it nor is my friend . but i have to admit the quality of the shirt is Good !

 I ordered this hat in September so that I could go as cousin It for Holloween . I never recieved it and it is now 20 November . I do not recommend buying anything from this company .
 you guys should have said in the review it was a FAKE bowler hat that has like I do n't know a cardboard shell around it . .
 These look cute but are made very cheaply . I only danced in them twice , and the heel part of the soles totally popped off of both boots . Waste of money .
 Poor quality and a bad fit . The picture does not represent the product well at all . It has a `` sweat band '' type material inside that I was unaware of and find uncomfortable . I would suggest shopping for one in person .

 I like these because they are so cute looking and nice and thick but they are just a bit on the small side
 I was very disappointed with this rain suit . I bought it , especially after seeing the above review , since I too bicycle to commute . I 'm not sure if they sent me a different rain suit or what , but the one I got did n't have the overall pants . I bike an hour each way and , after the first ride , the pants have holes around the bicycle seat area and the material is breaking down at other points in the pants as well . The jacket immediately started coming away from the bottom snap . -LRB- Definitely not a `` rugged '' suit ! -RRB- I did n't have a problem with being too hot , although perhaps that is because this is springtime in New England . I would n't bother buying this suit unless your commute is quite short .
 I am a long-time Amazon customer and recently began searching for leathermouse pads as gifts for my employees and our clients . Found this item andjust want to share a note of caution with you : Bonded Leather , or `` Reconstituted Leather '' is not really a true leatherbut a man-made material composed of 60 % to 90 % leather fibers -LRB- often scrapfrom leather tanneries -RRB- . Bonded leather is not as durable as genuineleathers , and is recommended for use only if the product will be usedinfrequently . -LRB- data from WIKIPEDIA online -RRB- There are many true genuine leather mouse pads from other vendors and atbetter prices ! Amazon may also have some , keep searching , but rememberonly the words `` GENUINE LEATHER '' or equal terminology should appear inthe description .
 ski & rescue ; suit , i had to ship this garbage and cost $ 9.80 usd plus the cost of shippingi lost about $ 15.00 usd.this thing was made for a old man with big belly and very short legs and long bodythis kind do n`t exist , you have to be rescue from once you put it on
 Leather looks like the type you would see in an airport shop , or maybe one of those monogram it stores in the mall . It could have fooled me into thinking it was n't even leather at all . Did n't live up to the price . Was an embarrassing gift at Christmas , but what can you do when you order on the 21st ? Wish I had had time to return it and get something better .
 Disappointing . Why does not some one make a tie holder that does not have to be folded . I bought one a Dunhill several decades ago , but they are no longer in stock . The foldover type crushes the neckties and creases the fabric . I use it now by not closing it , but this has its disadvantages .
 i got the bag 10 months ago for my birthday . it has been falling apart , the cord is shreading and the zipper just broke today . i am suprised and dissapointed by the quality . i begin to suspect that maybe this is not the real Prada bag.maybe the company could advice me where i can repair/exchange the bag . thank you .
 I highly doubt this was an authentic product . It fell apart very quickly , the snap broke , the zipper pull came off and the seams split and frayed ... this all happened with very minimal use . Shame on Amazon .
 The wallet looks better on the website . Additionally , the clasp broke after only two months . It 's nice enough , but for that price , I 'd expect much better .
 This line `` 2 +2 = 5 '' is the name of the first song on Radiohead 's album `` Hail to the Thief '' . The line is drawn from Orwell 's book 1984 to illustrate the extent to which a totalitarian government can control , warp , and alter what the society holds as `` truth '' in order to serve its own interests . Even something as obviously untrue as `` 2 +2 = 5 '' can be twisted , in this case with the caveat `` for very large numbers of 2 '' . Even Winston Smith , an intelligent man who had vowed not to break , ends up doing just that -LRB- under physical and psychological torture -RRB- . By the end of the book he gives up trying to resist the lies and is transformed into just another brainwashed automaton of the State.Reading the song lyrics of 2 +2 = 5 -LRB- the alternate title of which is `` lukewarm '' -RRB- I see them as a dialogue between a lukewarm type who is well-intentioned but wishy-washy , and a more radical type who is trying to get the former to pull the wool off his eyes . So you have the first line -LRB- the brainwashed one talking to the radical -RRB- : `` Are you such a dreamer ? / To put the world to rights ? / I 'll stay home forever / Where two & two always makes five `` In this way he is stating , as Winston found out , that life is so much more easy and comfortable if you stop challenging the lie . You must lose your idealism and honesty , but you do n't have to think for yourself . All you have to do is accept and repeat the ever-changing party line.The radical then replies later on : `` It 's the devil 's way now / There is no way out / You can scream & you can shout / It is too late now / Because You have not been paying attention `` The radical then reminds the conformer the price he has paid for his complacency . He has allowed the government to become so fraudulent and powerful that there 's no turning back . Instead of being a watchdog to the government , he allowed himself to be distracted and now he will pay the price . The last line is not just a statement , it is an accusation.As to whether or not this song is not-so-subtely aimed at the current US administration , that is for you to decide . The slogan `` Hail to the Thief '' was picked up by opposition after the dubious 2000 election which won Bush the presidency . Thom York has denied that the album title is directed at Bush . Who can say ...
 I weigh just about 100 lb. , and am 5 ' 1 &#34; . These hose are much too big for me . Since there are no smaller sizes , I ca n't get the help from them that I get from Legs Everyday support hose , three pair for around $ 6.00 . I checked them side by side and the stretch is just as strong on the cheapies , and they are half as big before you put them on , length and inches across . Very disappointed . If you are heavier or have more leg , they are silky feeling or appearing and you would probably think they are okay . I think they are way too expensive for what you get . I thought they would take me to the next level of more intense support , without resorting to compression hose . Barb H.
 What is the point of control top hose if the waistband rolls down constantly . It does n't control anything but my time because I have to keep pulling it up again . I would pass on these .
 Maybe I am too rough on my panty hose but these got a run in them the first day I wore them .
 wasnt very happy . I believe this is a misses size - not adult size . Ordered adult large and barely fit my 13 yr old . The `` adult large '' was written in marker on the plastic wrap - but did not say adult on tag . The shipping to return it was too much to be worthwhile and put a damper on a birthday gift for a friend - who has given it to her size 2 daughter to wear . It did however come in a timely fashion .
 The wig seemed to be really hard , and the dress just was n't as cute in person .
 This product is described as 100 % cotton . In fact , it is a 58 % poly/42 % cotton blend . I ordered specific colors and received all grey . Amazon needs to correct this listing and ensure that it delivers the products as advertised . I have had good luck over the years with Amazon , but will be reluctant to order any apparel in the future .

 Item shrank a bit . Useable but not same quality as earlier purchases of same brand
 Purchased CuttleDuds . Good price although they were much smaller than the same size purchased through a department store .
 When i first put these on they felt nice and warm but a little thin . I put them on anyways and began wearing them only to have a hole in one of the socks within 20 minutes of use . I bought two pairs and will be seeing if the other pair also has this issue but i was a little disappointing in it giving out so quickly .
 Disappointed ! The picture shows these sox as ULTIMAX . I have some older ULTIMAX sox and this is not the same . Kept the name and changed the soxs . While these soxs appear to be good soxs , when compared to my previous ULTIMAX they do n't measure up . The original ULTIMAX are thicker and the knitting is visibly denser .
 I ordered L socks . The socks were labeled L . But the socks were very SMALL , do not fit , are useless.Quality , color , fast delivery were fine . But what good is that if I ca n't wear the socks . And I ca n't think of a 10-year old that would wear those socks .

 I have several pair of NB shorts in size medium and they fit great . But these run extremely small . -LRB- I 'm wondering if this batch was mislabeled . -RRB- They 're also very high-waisted , sitting above my waistline . Try yours on first ! Do n't make the same mistake I did by washing them first , then trying them on thinking they would fit like all my other NB shorts !! No returns for me !
 Item looked decent , not a bad looking blazer , but not the best buy for what it normally sells at , but good if you can get it on sale . My complaint is not the product but the service , or lack thereof by the merchant . They do not get in touch with you about concerns in a timely fashion , took over a few weeks for them to get in touch with me after I first got in touch with them . When I returned the product for a refund , then emailed them about the status of my refund , they responded to my message as if they did n't even read what I wrote to them , just randomly writing useless information to me . Now they are claiming to have never received my return , which upsets me because it 's been more than 3 weeks since I sent it back . I hope theese guys get their act straight because I am waiting for my refund and I am not happy about the run around I 've been put on.Wish I could rate this a -1 , because a 1 is too high .
 The shirt was advertised as having 1/4 inch pleats . The shirt that arrived had 1/8 inch pleats . I ca n't tell you anything about the quality of the shirt because I did n't even take it out of the plastic bag . I returned it the same day .
 I ordered the shirt with FRENCH CUFFS , but instead , received regular cuffs with the cheesy cuff-link button holes next to the button on each side . Very disappointed because I needed the shirt by Monday 1/14 . Please look at the product offered and tell me if these are French Cuffs !
 I did not return this item as I accidentally poked myself with a pin and bled on it while trying to repackage it . I was VERY DISAPPOINTED with it . The shirt itself is very nice . The problem was it had obviously been worn for an entire evening , repackaged and returned ! The shirt was grungy and reeked of sweat . Due to this packaging mishap and time constraints we are having it cleaned and using it anyway . We found a similar shirt made by another company that was just as good a quality for 30.00 less but it was for a bow tie so we will clean this one . NOT HAPPY !
 Hemmed sleeves are already coming apart . Either poor product or poor quality control . Be aware that you might need to return it .
 This Santa Suit was a total dissapointment . First of all , the actual suit we received has nothing to do with the one portrayed in the picture . Even though the description states there 's no actual jacket -LRB- wich is what looks like when you see the photo -RRB- it has a pullover wich is not fit for large men acting as Santa , buth rather for a slim one . If you 're Santa-like at all , this pullover will look like a girlish nightie on you ! Not a good idea if you want to act/work as Santa for family , friends and others . Also , the fabric is sort of seethrough , to make things even worst ... On the other hand , we paid $ 69.98 for this suit . But if you search for a Rubie 's Santa Suit -LRB- which is the manufacturer -RRB- you 'll get it for as low as $ 32.00 -LRB- Economy Flannel Santa Suit Adult Halloween Costume -LRB- One-Size -LRB- Standard -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- wich is the product we received.Avoid this item as you would avoid the plague !
 ski & rescue ; suit , i had to ship this garbage and cost $ 9.80 usd plus the cost of shippingi lost about $ 15.00 usd.this thing was made for a old man with big belly and very short legs and long bodythis kind do n`t exist , you have to be rescue from once you put it on

 How can I review this product when I never received it ??? Tried e-mailing Fans Edge who said they delivered it , said I would be refunded , but then had to go through Amazon to get my money back .
 I too , had the same problem as another customer . After a month the seams in the pants ripped , in the front no less . The jacket is still holding up but the pants are useless . Very disapponited in my purchase . My best advice , read lots of reviews and shop around .
 This rain suit kept me dry , but the seams connecting the arms ripped after a month of wearing it during our rainy season . I was using it for yard work , but it should last longer than that ! I am very disappointed with this purchase .
 This item was a little disapionting for me . I ordered it thinking it was a truer , more peacock blue that would go well with other items I had . But as it turns out it is much more of a sky blue . Also the sizeing was a bit off and so I was n't able to wear it when I had hoped . I accually have n't worn it at all because untill I get it altered it will just fall off !

 The quality of the costume was n't quite what I had expected for the price I paid . The material is pretty thin and flimsy and the sizing of the pants runs extremely small . I wear a size 8 to 10 , and the `` supposed size 12 '' was incredibly tight . I was n't impressed by the costume .
 The product would have been perfect but the sizing is about two sizes smaller than actual . I had to return all three camisoles . I did n't trust reordering the product , so I did n't . Sorry . This is the truth .
 Wow it sure depressed me trying this on . I ordered the same size as the rest of my clothes - but could n't squeeze into it . Maybe it 's a junior size ?
 The camisole is smaller than sized . Looked far better in pictures . Sizing needs more work . The fabric is okay , just .

 I wore these shoes for only a few weeks and the synthetic uppers beagan to tear !!! They are made of JUNK .
 My wife and I went to Amsterdam a few months ago , i searched the internet for the best rolling duffle bag i could find , i bought two of these for the trip.My wife 's wheel broke off on the street day one and on day two the back of mine shattered , yes shattered and that made the wheels cave in . We searched all day for a luggage cart to bunge our new broken bags to and spent the next 10 days traveling europe wrestling with this shattered back , wheel draging crap ! Although i did like the color : -RRB- Dont bother with this brand if you need a strong pull bag !!!
 The camisole was pretty , well made and everything except , this is nice only if you want and like the elastic straps . I bought this for my mother and did n't notice the straps in the photo . So she liked the camisole except for the elastic straps . They 're marketed now as `` Built-Up Straps '' some have this elastic , some not , so look carefully at them . The camisoles without the elastic are fine and she kept those.Vanity Fair Women 's Simply Special Camisole # 17-720
 The T-Shirt in the picture is nothing like the one you get . The one they send you is deep black , and the colors on the target go

 I purchased these socks for myself specifically because they were advertized as 100 % cotton socks . THEY ARE NOT !!! They are 42 % coolmax -LRB- whatever that is ! -RRB- , 42 % cotton , 12 % nylon , 3 % lycra & 1 % natural latex , as copied from the packaging . This is why I have rated only 1 star . They are nice socks , one pair grey toes/heels the other pink , which is n't what was pictured , and I do n't care about the color . But I wanted/needed 100 % cotton , and this blend is a far cry from that .
 while the pant was an excellent cut and a nice fit , my husband does not like the material of the pant they collect lint and losses its color after one wash . buyers beware !!
 I was expecting a soft-cotton camisole , but instead these camisoles are made of rough and scratchy cloth.I completely agree with the other reviewer that did n't like them . I also would have returned these , but paying the restocking fee and shipping would not make it worth the trouble .
 I 've read other reviews that criticize these pants for being too light weight and not being actual sweat pants . But that is exactly why I like them . They are light enough to wear around the house and breath well and keep you cooler while exercising in the summer heat . They have a fairly wide elastic waist . I do n't care for the draw string which tends to dig in a little -LRB- especially since the draw string knot faces inward -RRB- but for the price what can you expect . I also care less for the light and dark grey ones that are not 100 % cotton . Overall fairly durable and a good value for the money.UPDATE
 These sweatpants were thinner than I expected and they also did not fit well around my waist . They have the one looped cord in the elastic and I find that those do n't work as well as one cord split that you can tie .
 HI we rec 'd a `` Large '' which was more like an Xtra Large `` TALL '' . Returned for a full refund .
 While these are ok for lounging , they will not keep you very warm . As other reviews state , these are incredibly thing ... so much so that you can easily see light coming through them . I would n't even think about playing any kind of sport in these , unless you consider chess to be a sport . Would have been nice if they were described as `` lightweight '' .
 The first time I put on these pants and sat down , the drawstring snapped off -LRB- evidently sewn in back as I could n't get it back in -RRB- . Contacted Essential Apparel and all they did was give me the 800 number for Russell . The other two pairs I ordered are standing up well so far .
 These were thin and clingy and the size seemed to run smaller than the size charts implied . That happens a lot with the sizes on Amazon . I had to return them - could n't wear them at all . They were uncomfortable , not relaxed as I expected .
 these sweat pants are undercut
 The fabric is comfortable and light-weight but they fell apart too fast . Also the size runs big . I bought a Large and it was like wearing a mumu with pants legs .
 RA bottom pants are HUGE - size charts for these are completely inaccurate so be aware of this when purchasing !
 i ordered 3-4 pair of sweat pants that day . one pair had a rip in it.another pair , one leg was longer than the other one . i di n't send themback , but i should have . it 's such a crazy time of year , i had them forwhile before i opened the package & tried them on . i will never orderthem again , especially , Russell 's
 Got these and in less than a week , the tie string broke . Sent them back for a replacement pair . Second time wearing them , snap - broken string . Looking at the string you can tell it is cheap but this is insane .
 I ordered a size Medium and that is what the clothes tag read on the athletic pants . The pants had to have been erroneously tagged because the pants actually seemed to be Size XL or XXL . My family at least had a good laugh after I tried the pants on and walked around like a clown in the circus trying to keep his baggy pants from falling down!Amazon provided an instant refund .
 As others have commented , be sure these are what you want . These are , in no way , what I think of as traditional `` sweat pants '' . I also do not believe they fir the definition of `` jersey '' . They are very thin cotton , more like what I would think of as `` thin , cool cotton summer lounge wear '' . My stupidity for not checking further .
 too flimsy for our weather , and it did n't say in the description , how flimsy they would be.Not a good product for a cold climate .
 The pants are way , way larger than normal sizing . Had to return it . On the plus side , no hassle returning .
 I expected fleece lined old fashion sweat pants . These are very lightweight and I sent them back . Please read the description carefully before you purchase .
 These are very cheap and flimsy . Very disappointed . Have purchased Russell sweats in the past , last time a few years ago . The pants have really declined in quality . Awful . Will be returning these .
 These sweatpants are a total letdown and not even close to the quality Russell sweatpants I 've owned in the past . I have n't even worn them yet or taken the other two I ordered out of the box . To say these are lightweight would be an understatement , they are thin as cardboard maybe more so . I can tell just by the look and feel they will not last long and I plan on returning them ASAP . I will post pictures when I have the time so others can see exactly what they 're getting . If this kind of `` quality '' is what I can expect from Russell , then they 've lost me as a customer . It does n't help either the description makes no mention of how thin these pants are either , and I do n't know whether that 's on Amazon 's or Russell 's part . Buyer beware !
 Not what I expected . The material is very thin and flimsy , and the pants are cut super baggy , like clown pants . I expected the cuffs to close at the ankle , but they do n't have elastic and are open at the end . I would have returned them , but just did n't bother , with the shipping and all .
 They surely were not designed as they arrived . If they were they should be sold in a clown store . Size ` Medium ' was at least an &#34; X-Large &#34; . And they are beyond pantaloons . I could have pulled one leg up over my body until they were above my waist . In addition to all that , the material was very thin , had no body , was like something I 'd want to use to polish the last bit of wax off of my car . I have already received the e-mail from Amazon saying they have received my return . Great service from them as usual.The whole experience was laughable . Figuratively and literally when I tried the pants on . But it also makes me want to rave about manufacturing being sent to some sweat shop -LRB- pun intended -RRB- where apparently no one cares about the product . But then neither did Russell Athletics . On top of all that it 's just boggling for me to think about how they let anything like this get by them and right out into the market . Maybe some of their products are alright , but it 's a gamble I will never take again with Russell Athletics.Now , Amazon , I say this with love . Making these sweatpants was not your work , but purchasing them is . I 'd either take on more responsibility for checking the quality and consistency of their products before you add them to your site or dump Russell Athletics as a vendor . Products like this do not befit the higher standards you work to set . Fairness aside , shoppers who have experiences like this will take a bite out your reputation and maybe even forget that the product was manufactured by someone else .
 These are very sheer and lightweight , to the point of being able to almost see through them . There were strings hanging from the one pair I opened to inspect and I was extremely disappointed with the workmanship as well as fabric quality -LRB- definitely not what I would call `` jersey '' material -RRB- . I am returning them as these are really unacceptable - I should have paid more attention to the prior reviews from other purchasers . .
 I used to buy these all the time -LRB- Medium size -RRB- and never had a problem with them . They used to be well fitting and very airy feeling so you do n't sweat too much.The latest edition is very wide and stretchy ... the same medium size is way too wide of an elastic waistband . And the legs are very wide and also the pant length is longer than usual . Additionally , the pockets are about 33 % smaller than previous versions.All in all , this was a very disappointing version of an otherwise great product . I hope Russell goes back to the drawing board on this one ...
 I did not believe another reviewer who said that these sweat pants were made with really THIN fabric . I thought he must be mistaken - or just disgruntled somehow . But he was correct . The fabric these sweat pants are made from is VERY THIN - kind of like wearing dress slacks with an elastic waist . Who at Russel came up with this idea ? Not the sort of sweat pants I 've ever seen or worn before . Not comfortable . `` Russell Athletic Men 's Cotton Performance Elastic Bottom Jersey Pant '' BUYER BEWARE !!!
 While these pants seem to be of good quality , they certainly are n't as advertised . I purchased two pairs of them thinking they were made of heavyweight material , since that 's what the product description says . However , they are very lightweight and are n't good for anything other than sitting around the house . I 'll keep them just for that purpose but I am disappointed that I ca n't use them to go running in the cold weather -LRB- what I 'd originally purchased them for -RRB- . I wish I 'd have read the reviews before buying these , as others have made the exact same complaint . The product description should be updated to say that they are lightweight . Otherwise , it 's very misleading .
 Do n't buy . One size fits no-one and brother I 'm not kidding . There.s an excess of material that borderlines on insane . Poor design ... Retailers should not sell products designed this poorly .
 I purchased this item and when it came I was totally disgusted with them , they where not only irregulars but cut in the front and then resewn as if anyone would not notice.They were advertised as 1st quality , will never purchase from this Co. again
 These are standard sweatpants , nothing out of the ordinary . But they are NOT all cotton ; they are the usual 50-50 blend , hence my two star ranking .
 this sell needs to clearly state that these are made with t-shirt like material not the traditional sweat shirt material users of russel products have been acustomed to
 Russell seems to have changed its sizing since the last time I bought a pair of these workout pants . Way too big , way too baggy for the gym . Now they 're just new pajama bottoms .
 I ordered these because my husband always liked Russell Athletic clothing , however , these sweats are very thin and not like ones he has had before.I would not recommend them .
 I 've worn Russell sweatpants for years , and size medium always fit . This pair however is long enough and wide enough to fit a large big and tall . Since I 'm maybe 5 ' 3 ' these were ridiculous . The elastic at the ankles is so loose it may as well be an open leg . The material is also incredibly thin -- I 've never seen `` sweatpants '' so thin . I was very disappointed . I 'll look for another brand .
 This item arrived with a hole in one pant leg and the bottom elastic hems being different sizes . Either Amazon is selling defective product or the supplier of this item has hoodwinked Amazon into selling it without inspection . This is the first time I have been this disappointed in a purchase .
 ordered extra large after washing and trying on the legs were approxmatly 7 lnches too long the rest of the order fits .
 I thought that these sweatpants were going to be of a better quality , i saw some of the reviews say that they would use them as pajamas , who does that ? you buy sweats for nighty-nite ? these pants are cheap , very oversized , and would n't last a week on the job . buyer beware .
 I have worn these pants for 10 years for working in the yard and garden . They are light enough to wear in the hot summer months and help keep the creepy crawlies away . This particular pair was 6 inches too long . I think they must be `` seconds '' .
 These sweatpants are designed to be infinitely expandable . Basically , the designer had extremely obese people in mind . Not great for looking decent while jogging .
 Well lets start with this , I did not like the sizing of these pants nor was the thickness acceptable to me.In the past Russell has made the highest quality jogging pants on the market , these I bought was just to thin for my tastes .
 Awkward fitting pants here . They seem more like balloon pants than sweat pants . I would not buy these again . They are soft , but the fit is too big in the mid areas .
 In my opinion the pants are too bulky and hang loose enough to look and feel really baggy . The weight is just not what I expected of `` sweatpants '' that I am used to . Altogether I 'd not recommend these to anyone and I 'll probably just throw mine away and learn from the bad experience .
 Low quality all around . Thin flimsy fabric and lightweight elastic . Plus sized wrong , ordered XL , item tagged XL but was at least 2X or 3X . Amazon did do a prompt refund.Better deal is theChampion Mens Closed Bottom Jersey Pant - lower price and better quality than the Russell .
 I try to buy only 100 % cotton sweats . For that reason I ordered these in black which at the time was the only color available in 100 % cotton . The material is fine . I ordered large based on the sizing guidelines . It was too large - especially in the length . Since 100 % cotton is hard to find I decided to wash them in hopes of them shrinking . They shrunk a bit , but not much . I then ordered a pair of mediums . They are also too large , again especially in the length . After washing , the large and medium are of almost identical size . So the sizing of these pants seems very sloppy . However my primary complaint is with the elastic waist . The elastic is not strong enough to hold the pants up . It does have a built in rope , but it 's not elastic and therefore not comfortable . I give it 2 stars only because it 's 100 % cotton .
 I thought I choose thicker of several pants . I was wrong . These pants are very thin cotton . I will buy next pair from brick and mortar store .
 They were not a sweat pant that i ` m use to , I thoughtthey would be alot heavier . I have not wore them yet maybe I will change my Review then
 The sweats i got were not as they looked on the ad . They are very the almost like pj 's . Very Very disappointed
 I searched sweatpants and this came up . Even in the photo , you ca n't quite tell that these pants are thin t-shirt fabric material . Bought it , it showed up and it was definitely NOT what I expected . Who would even wear this ? Definitely will be returned .
 These pants would be nice on the hotter weather when you want a pant that 's not too bulky or insulated.The material is a typical jersey cotton so it feels more like a tee shirt than a sweat pant material.my husband did n't like them since he likes a heavier traditional sweat pants.So in all they 're not bad but more so on a light weight cheaper feeling pair than anything appropriate for winter .

 The slacks are nice , but the first time washing , they have a tendency to lose a lot of color . Instead of dark khaki , they have a faded greenish brown . This happened on two pair , so I have learned the hard way
 I bought these pants for my husband less than a month ago , and they have already shrunk TWO INCHES in length , its like I wasted my money . Do NOT buy these pants with your true inseam , they will be too small in a month !
 I bought two pairs of these pants about three months ago on the strength of their reviews and their low cost . Cut to the present , wearing each pair once a week to work , and one pair 's crotch has just completely torn open . I guess you get what you pay for . Up until the crotch tore out , they were comfortable and stain resistant , so I guess if you really need a pair of decent looking slacks NOW and do n't have the cash/care if they last long , these are the pants for you .
 Buyer beware , I ordered a 30x32 and the waist was closer to a 28 and the length was close to a 30 . These pants are also very thin and cheaply made , buy at own risk !!
 This was my second pair of Lee pants from Amazon . The first pair were of good quality . On this pair the waist came in two inches less than every other pair I own in this size - I measured . I could snap the button but had to forgo breathing . The return process was fairly straight-forward but I got stuck with the return shipping in the end . It was deducted from my refund . Otherwise the price would have been nice and I would have loved the pants if they fit , but this experience was definitely dissatisfying .
 I got two pairs of these pants after believing the reviews but was disapointed . The quality is not worth the money . I could get much better pants at cheaper prices at the mall . This was my first online shopping experience for dresses and am never doing the same mistake again .
 THE OTHER KAKAIS I PURCHASED ON WERE 100 % GREAT BUT I SPILT BLEACH ON ONE OF THEM . COULD FIND THE SAME VENDOR OR MAKE , SO I BOUGHT THE SAME SIZE BY LEE . BIG MISTAKE . GREAT PANTS IF THEY FIT . 46WAISTx32LONG . O'WELL I 'LL GO BACK TO WALKING .
 These wrinkle resistant pants are sup-par , in my opinion . Upon arrival nearly every seam had loose threads hanging out . After just one or two washes , my `` black '' slacks have faded and are clearly no longer black - especially noticeable when wearing any other black-colored articles of clothing.I would suggest investing another $ 15-20 in some quality pants .
 I initially purchased a 29 X 30 waist Khaki colored pant and was very pleased with it . Its was a hard to find size and fitted perfectly . Encouraged by this I went on to purcahse two more string and grey colored kahkis . Unfortunately , both were much more tighter than the earlier ones and when measured by tape its 28.3-28 .5 waist . There seems to be too much variation in the waist size despite a being sold as a 29 waist . I will be very reluctant to buy this brand again ... atleast not online.Material-wise its excellent ... so 2 stars !
 All of my pants are 36 x 32 while the leg length is fine for the Lee Jeans Men 's Wrinkle Resistant Relaxed Double Pleat Pant , Khaki the waist was more like a 34in . If the sizing was correct I would be very satisfied with the product .
 Bag smaller than I imagined , S&H was double the price of this bag . - final cost not worth the the $ . You can find something comparable elsewhere and at a better deal .
 Read the description carefully and do n't let the picture of this mesh bag fool you . See how the bag in the picture is crammed full of beach stuff ? In real life , not so much . The bag is actually quite small -- it holds maybe one beach towel and perhaps some very small beach toys . The handles are sewn on wrong , or something , because you ca n't get the bag to open wide as shown in the picture . -LRB- The handles on both sides are actually attached . -RRB- This might be good for laundry or something small -- but for my purposes , it just was n't what I thought it was going to be .
 this bag is not AT ALL what is pictured . and unless you have some sewing skills , be prepared to have to relocate the handles . I do n't know what idiot designed this thing , but the handles are located in such a way that you need about six people to help you hold open the bag . WOW ! I did n't return this bag , and just relocated the handles because we needed it ASAP for a swim meet on the weekend . It worked great once the handles were in the right place . They make it look like it holds so many things too . Make sure you read the dimensions on this item !!!
 This bag is SO SMALL . I bought this bag thinking that I could carry my daughters ' beach toys in it and nothing fits . I ca n't even imagine someone putting laundry in it as the advertisement says . The only reason I gave it one star is now my 3 year old daughter is carrying it around as a purse and puts her stuffed animal in it ... that 's how small the bag is ! Not worth the money . I would have been disappointed even if I found this at the dollar store . Do not buy ... do n't waste your money .
 This bag is much smaller than it appears in the picture . It is flat like a pillow case , so keep that in mind when you consider the size . The picture looks like the bag has a bottom but it does not . I feel like an idiot for not reading all of the reviews before purchasing , hopefully you will not make the same mistake . I 'm not returning it only because it would cost me more to send it back than to just keep it
 This bag is absolutely useless . I usually read reviews before buying anything online , but for some reason , I did n't before buying this bag . Big mistake . It holds nothing - the dimensions are totally off and the picture appearing in the add is totally deceiving . You would be lucky if you could get a single towel in it . Also , like other reviewers , I found the straps to be sewed on in a ridiculous manner , making it impossible to even stretch out the bag to get items inside . Will not but from this seller again . Totally deceitful advertising .
 The bag is a nice size -- it can hold a towel and bathing suit , goggles , etc. . It has a drawstring at the top of the bag to keep it closed , but after less than a week of use the stitching began to come apart . We can still use the bags but the drawstring closure is useless now .
 I 've been shopping on Amazon for years and have often seen negative reviews to which I paid little attention . This time , I should 've listened.The reviews about sizing problems are correct - I got this item after ordering 2 sizes larger than I usually get , and it was completely off . The waist was too small and the torso section was n't anywhere near long enough . Maybe for smaller men or females this would n't be the case , but for me I 've never been so disappointed in a purchase , and this will be the first product I 've ever returned.If this were $ 20 or less I 'd say take the chance , but at $ 50 find something else.The one upside is that it arrived quickly and , for once , in appropriately sized packaging .
 The jumpsuit showed up quickly.Awesome.I tried it on , and really ? I ordered it a size big figuring I would rather it be baggy.My balls wish I had ordered it two or three sizes bigger . The legs could also be a good six inches shorter . I had planned on using it for part of a halloween costume then as a coverall for paintball . There is NO WAY I could run around or crouch in it.If you are going to have freakishly sized clothes , please have your own sizing chart , thats actually true to your clothes .

 The style of the champion shorts was not quite what i wanted ... would 've liked them a lot better if they had a draw string cause elastic was somewhat gappy . Also the style was a little shorter than it used to be a couple of years ago and wish the other style was offered as well . Also was not fond of the lining and the outter mesh being separate . . in almost like a reversable style but not ... the over product was pretty disappointing since champion shorts are non existent in stores and i know what style i like .
 I can see sizing being off a little , but the person modeling these must be a really thin teenager . I always wear a medium in champions and these are small in every dimension . Forget the nicely drapped appearance . These cling to my thighs , which while not small , are n't huge either . They also seem much shorter than the picture and with the waistband turned down would sit a good ways below my navel . Since I got them mostly to work out at home , I wo n't bother to return them , but they are much too small to wear to the gym . In my opinion this is not a woman 's size but a `` juniors cut . ''
 You need to list if any of these short have side pockets big enough for tennis ball ... have not bought any cause you do not state if any of the shorts have side tennis ball pockets ...
 Maybe it 's me , but these shorts kept bunching up my inner thighs and made walking uncomfortable . I sent them to my sister . Maybe she 'll like them

 I ordered this as a gift for someone and was excited when i had found it because the person it was purchased for is a HUGE bls fan . I must admit i feel like i wasted my money and i 'm not sure if i should give it . there is not really a good description of this item so i must admit i didnt know what i was getting . it seems , to me at least , very cheaply made -LRB- and i think it shows -RRB- and way oversized . not worth more than a few bucks in my opinion , im just totally disapointed with this item and wish i could get my money back to spend on something better/more worth while for the intended recipient . i think i will only buy from amazon -LRB- the actual seller -RRB- from now on since they seem more reasonable with their pricing and give descriptions of the items they are selling ... bottome line ... RIP OFF !!!
 This purse is super cute . That 's where it ends though . I used the bag once , did n't over fill it , just a few evening essentials and came away with pink hands -LRB- the dye from the sequins rubbed off on my hands -RRB- and seams -LRB- where the handles are attached -RRB- coming undone . Find a cuter bag some place else !
 I purchased this bag for our daughter . It was a little pricey for dress-up play , but if it did n't fall apart so easily I 'd say it is worth it -LRB- she loves it -RRB- . It was falling apart when it arrived , but I could n't get a replacement from Amazon so I had it repaired . It has since broken again twice , due to a flaw in its design . The bag is attached to the handle with thread -LRB- it is sewn into holes in the metal handle/frame -RRB- and when the metal rubs against the thread it cuts it just like a knife . It 's a poor design , plain and simple . If you buy it , expect to repair it .
 I too , had the same problem as another customer . After a month the seams in the pants ripped , in the front no less . The jacket is still holding up but the pants are useless . Very disapponited in my purchase . My best advice , read lots of reviews and shop around .
 This rain suit kept me dry , but the seams connecting the arms ripped after a month of wearing it during our rainy season . I was using it for yard work , but it should last longer than that ! I am very disappointed with this purchase .
 I ca n't review the product because I never received it . I tried contacting the company and I promptly received a condescending response . In general , the response was find the missing t-shirt myself . If you can afford to lose 20 plus bucks in the current economy , then I recommend you take a chance and order it . As for me , I 've chalked it up to a loss and lesson learned .

 The shirt is great looking and well made ; however , it is so very long . I ordered the shirt in regular size , but it 's much longer than those in most tall sizes . I 'm over six feet and the shirt hem hangs down almost to my knees . What 's not mentioned in the shirt description , is that it is almost three feet long .
 Apparently this was old stock from someones window that got sunshine . The parts that were exposed to the sun were faded.I mean FADED . It makes a great work shirt if you are sure to get grease on it , other than that Its a rip-off .

 Great travel pack for my daughter , neat pink color , but handle just broke off after 8 mos . of light use . What a bummer ! Pack is hardly dirty . Not sure how to fix it and no name or any other info on pack to contact fabricator . Seems like a waste ! You 'd be best to purchase two bar handle , not this uni-handle .
 Within a couple of weeks of my son using his new -LRB- expensive -RRB- backpack the handle broke . I 'm hoping that they will honor their lifetime guarentee . I will be contacting the company and hope to get a replacement . Not what I expected to happen with a backpack that cost so much !
 Bought this for my wife who is a 1st year nursing student.PROS
 I bought this bag and I loved the room and the spacing . The very first day , I went to get the telescope handle , and w/o any weight at all , it snapped off . The metal split and the plastic broke . I have returned it and I am looking for another bag from another company , but I really am disappointed b/c the bag part was cute and roomy .
 I bought this bag for my 5th grader after he went through a couple of rolling backpacks earlier , thinking that this is the one . After only 2 weeks , the handle came off when he was getting ready for school.Although the backpack looks pretty solid bag wise , the handle part does look very shaky . I remember thinking about that when I first received it . Guess my instinct was right .
 My daughter has used this -LRB- expensive bag -RRB- since 2010 . It started falling apart after a few months of use . The zippers break for no apparent reason . We also had a zipper separate from the material leaving a whole that I tried to patch . The latest news is that the extendable handle broke while wheeling the bag across a street . When it broke -LRB- once again , for no apparent reason -LSB- global warming maybe ?? -RSB- -RRB- , I realized that the concealed portion of the carry handle was made of cheap plastic . This is deceptive because the outer portion appears to be made from some type of metal . Why they would make this critical part out of cheap plastic is beyond my understanding . This thing is really overpriced for the quality you get . Buy a cheaper bag so you wo n't get angry like I did when it starts falling apart .
 I purchased this product for my first semester of nursing school , however , a week after I bought it I received an e-mail from the company stating that they no longer have any in stock . I was disappointed b/c I was waiting for it to arrive . I ca n't recommend this since I did not receive it . I 'm giving a 2 solely on the seller 's actions . The refunding time was quick .
 This is the largest rolling pack I could find for my son 's MANY books at school and it is wonderfully large . However , the 1st day at school he was walking down the corridor to his locker and the handle started to bend . After his first class the handle broke right off!I guess I should have read the 1 star reviews after I read the 5 star reviews before I ordered this backpack . I see others have had this happen too . I will put this down to poor manufacturing of the handle . It is too bad , the bag is wonderful except for that .
 We purchased a High Sierra Oversteer Wheeled Backpack for our son at the end of January 2008 and we have not yet reached the end of February , yet the top section of the telescoping single pole T-shaped handle has detached from the bottom , loosing any fasteners.His prior backpack lasted a year and the double pole telescoping handle only started to fail at the same time the backpack itself showed the strain of too many books packed within . This is why we ordered a larger capacity one . However , perhaps it is possible that this single pole handle is inadequate on a larger capacity , fully loaded bag . I am not sure but I believe his prior backpack may have been a Jansport .
 Wouldnt recommend this item ... For the cost the quality of the product is lacking . I travel for a living and have used many different types of bags so was interested when I saw the design . The handle broke off a month after I bought it , the problem is it broke off and left a metal wire sticking out . Try explaining that to the Airport Security when trying to get back after a business trip .

 I like the mask alot , It is scary and all But ... There is no nose holes so it is very hard to breathe in . The eye holes are very small . Its very hard to see out of .

 I bought this based on the positive reviews on the amazon website . But when the wallet arrived I was completely disappointed . the wallet design is too small to contain my change , credit cards and cheque book and i had a hard time closing the thing with the annoying snaps once it was full . Would not recommend this wallet . Still searching for the perfect roomy wallet .
 The item I received did not look like the item shown in the picture . The color , stitching and Kipling label were all different . The customer service was helpful , however , and provided me with a few options to compensate me for the problem.The product itself , however , is a good product with lots of compartments to keep things organized .

 Not comfortable , no support , I thought they were the new style pouch type but they are not .
 This garment is poorly sewn with cloth which was too thin to provide some very necessary functions for men . If you just want underwear look on ; however , if your aim is to obtain a bedroom brief you can do better for less . At is unless the view is everything

 The jumpsuit showed up quickly.Awesome.I tried it on , and really ? I ordered it a size big figuring I would rather it be baggy.My balls wish I had ordered it two or three sizes bigger . The legs could also be a good six inches shorter . I had planned on using it for part of a halloween costume then as a coverall for paintball . There is NO WAY I could run around or crouch in it.If you are going to have freakishly sized clothes , please have your own sizing chart , thats actually true to your clothes .
 I 've been shopping on Amazon for years and have often seen negative reviews to which I paid little attention . This time , I should 've listened.The reviews about sizing problems are correct - I got this item after ordering 2 sizes larger than I usually get , and it was completely off . The waist was too small and the torso section was n't anywhere near long enough . Maybe for smaller men or females this would n't be the case , but for me I 've never been so disappointed in a purchase , and this will be the first product I 've ever returned.If this were $ 20 or less I 'd say take the chance , but at $ 50 find something else.The one upside is that it arrived quickly and , for once , in appropriately sized packaging .
 The shirt is great looking and well made ; however , it is so very long . I ordered the shirt in regular size , but it 's much longer than those in most tall sizes . I 'm over six feet and the shirt hem hangs down almost to my knees . What 's not mentioned in the shirt description , is that it is almost three feet long .

 We have worn and appreciated Champion clothing for years . They are usually of the highest quality . However , be very careful which non-Amazon `` seller '' you deal with -- they are not all the same . In our case , the items were offerred from only one vendor . Buy from Rockin ' Sox at your own risk . If you have any choice to buy your items from a different seller , do so . Our items arrived on time but were dramatically inferior to other Champion products that we have purchased from Amazon . Specifically , the size of the garments -LRB- W-M -RRB- was significantly smaller than any other mediums we have purchased . We even tired to have a relative , who wears a small -LRB- W-S -RRB- , try on the garments and they were far too small for her . Clearly , there was a problem with the manufacturing -LRB- maybe Rockin ' Sox receives cheaper `` seconds '' from Champion -RRB- or in the size labeling.When we attempted to return the items to Rockin ' Sox , we were informed that return shipping would be at our expense . We carefully packaged the items and returned them with the `` return authorization '' number enclosed.We have not heard from Rockin ' Sox since . For a company , who was able to place the original purchase amount on our credit card within one day , to take over a month to credit that same card , is absurd.Amazon has always been great to deal with in the past . Rockin ' Sox should be avoided . Their business model appears to be a `` mom & pop '' operation , running merchandise out of their garage . Stick with buying only from Amazon itself . Some of the other `` sellers '' are just too risky .
 Looking for a great bra I can run in AND wear underclothing that is a racerback , I thought I 'd found it . This is one of the ONLY Champion bras that comes intaupe - perfect for under white . I noticed the design in front , but thought - hey - that 's not a SEAM so it wo n't show under a t-shirt -LRB- I was right it does n't -RRB- . Nipples still show , but do n't SCREAM , look at me ... I can handle that much.It 's very comfortable and supportive but not enough for running -LRB- real runners -RRB- . Then came the band.WHAT band?There is NO real chest band -- it 's just a corrugated version of the materialand it ROLLS like no tomorrow -LRB- I am not obese 5 ' 4 '' and 125 -RRB- . WHY WHY WHY crying like Nancy Kerrigan -LRB- slight exaggeration okay -RRB- did theystop creating wonderful when they got to the band ???!!! WHY ?!!! I 'm a 34b and ordered medium and the breast part fit perfectly , but theband ??? I could practically slide my whole hand under the band without eventouching the band . The band around the chest is crucial if your going tostabilize anything ! You know ` barely there '' underpants ? THIS IS THAT BANDand nothing more ... how disappointing . Come on ... put a REAL `` Action TECH `` band around the chest and you have a great bra . But not for runnning.Gardening or Yoga only . Why did they SKIMP ON THE BAND AROUND THE CHEST ???
 Maybe this would work better for smaller size chests . For me -LRB- 38c-d -RRB- - there 's no separation and it makes a UNIBOOB : -LRB-

 I was looking forward to wearing this costume but was very unhappy on opening the box . The costume did come as avertised but the quality of the costume is very poor .1 . There is no back to the leg and cod parts and they are fastend by 4 pieces of string , these do not keep them in place .2 . The chest is held in place by one strap of velcro on the back which does nothing to hold in place .3 . The full mask was out of shape and did not fit correctly .4 . The overall rubber material was of a low quality and does not reflect the overall price tag.I have returned the costume and I am now looking for an alternative .
 This entire costume is from the front . From the back without a cape you 'd look like an ass . Cod pieces tie on with string . Back uses a piece of velcro . The chest is baggy . The mask I had to replace with another mask which cost a few hundred bucks . Boot cover things are kind of a joke . So are essentially strapping some rubber pieces to a leotard . garbage . Thing probably cost less than $ 10 to make . poorly .
 This item was already broken when I received it . If you 're looking for something that 's durable , look elsewhere .
 I was pleased with the appearance , however , the fastener on the chain does not stay tight on my glasses . After they fell off the second time . . I threw it in a drawer . I was very disappointed in this product .
 Silver Eyeglass Holder Fashion Chain By Apex MedicalCheap , but not worth the money.The links are weak , and the chain broke after a couple of days .
 I found this to short for my purposes and the chain gets caught in my hair . I would n't have purchased it if I could have seen it before hand .
 This broke the moment I tried to put my glasses on it also very light in weight would have been comfy able if it had n't broke
 Cheaply made . . broke within the first 5 min of putting it on . Dont waste your money or time . Terrible product
 A chain this size , when you are not using it for your glasses , can be used to tie up your car , can be used for keeping fences closed , or any other thing that requires a big , fat , wide , ostentatious chain .
 I bought these for my mother in law , since she reads alot , but always misplaces her reading glasses , they looked nice , but it only took a couple of days before they broke , cheaply made .
 The chain was so flimsy and possibly made out of tin . It broke the very first time I used it . You are better off spending more money and buying something solid and not cheaply made .
 The shirt is great looking and well made ; however , it is so very long . I ordered the shirt in regular size , but it 's much longer than those in most tall sizes . I 'm over six feet and the shirt hem hangs down almost to my knees . What 's not mentioned in the shirt description , is that it is almost three feet long .

 I emailed their customer representativ requesting status of order . Only to know that the order 's been backordered . He presented me with a new color option . I chose another color and 3 days later item still has n't shipped.I would expect the vendor to follow up with the customer , not the other way around.Poor customer service .
 I am extremely disappointed . If you read the reviews , you would think this bag is huge . Well it 's not ! It can barely pass for a medium size . There 's no zipper whatsoever , and it 's flimsy . You have to be careful when opening the flap where the buttons are because it can rip off . I think the only good thing about this is the material . It 's soft , and can probably withstand some rough wear . Do n't buy this if you 're looking for space and reliability , you can buy a better bag at a Korean gift store !!
 I used it once . I ran 20 yards with it on my back and all seams came apart . Great construction .
 I bought 3 of these for my family to take to the beach . Two of them ripped on the bottom after children 's clothes and a normal sized bath towel were placed inside .
 I purchased 2 bags based on the reviews I read , all great according to reviews.My kids used these bags once , returned home , 1 of the bag straps had de-attached and made bag useless . day 2 and my other boy comes home with the same issue . now , I have 2 mesh bags that are useless unless I start to fix them . but I feel like I should n't be fixing them after just 2 uses . . My recommmendation , do n't purchase these bags .
 I had bought this same bag for my older son last year to carry his wrestling equipment . He STILL has his bag , which is the same except that it is a different color . His has NEVER given us any problems . Therefore , I ordered the same bag for my younger son for the same purpose . Within its first week of use , the seem was split , requiring me to sew it back . Now the zipper on the front pocket is torn and there is another hole where the strap is sewn to the bag itself . I am disappointed that it has n't held up as well as the other one we purchased . The bag itself is a nice size and I like that it is mesh , allowing for the wrestling equipment being able to be `` aired '' out ... I just wish it held up as good as the first one I purchased .
 I got this to carry toiletries to and from the latrines . I only carried a couple of travel sized bottles , a towel and my sonicare toothbrush travel case in it . It only took a couple of weeks before the bottom started unraveling . I used it until the hole was big enough for the travel bottles to slip through . I ended up buying a larger Speedo version with a little less mesh -LRB- more privacy -RRB- and thicker shoulder straps . The second bag is much better than this one .
 Updating my review to 2 stars . The seams on the bottom of the bag have now come open , and I still have n't used it that much in the 2 years I 've had it . My advice
 this certainly falls under the catergory of you get what you pay for . my son used it for two days , by the third day , i guess he pulled too hard and the bottom part of where the straps connect to the bag , a hole was created . the seams are not sewn tight enough or the mesh is too big . either way , i was quite annoyed that the bag was used only twice and it was not worth my time or effort to return . in addition , they certainly took their sweet time in picking it and mailing it to us .
 If you have small kids that do not have heavy books or just want to carry toys in this , then this would be good.My daughter took it to school and it ripped on the first day with a couple of high school books in it . Not for heavy duty .
 First let me start off by saying I love this bag type . It 's the perfect size and shape and even sits just right when it is slung on your back . It fits snugly on your back even full with notebooks , pens and a water bottle with the bottom of the bag barely resting any lower than the small of your back . I would buy another in a heartbeat if they would fix the glaring issue with this bag.The bottom is made of a very cheap nylon and therefore is prone to ripping particularly on the seam where it started . After just a few months of being used daily to carry three 120 page note books , a 32oz water bottle and a handful of pens the nylon torn and now has a fist sized hole , right across the seam . Had they continued the durable mesh fabric across the bottom I doubt I would have any issues . Currently I have duct tape covering the nylon on the bottom and the adjacent seams on an otherwise flawless bag to see if the simple change in fabric was the culprit .
 I was trying to get a bag for cheep and you get what you pay for here . The bag is kinda annoying because it slips around when you try and put it on so one strap always ends up being way larger than the other . Also where the straps get attached to the bottom of the bag it ripped the bottom and it is slowly getting larger . I bought two because the price was so good and it happened to both bags . I would recommend these bags if you are only carrying a few light items in the bag at a time or only plan on using it two or three times .
 I guess I expected too much from this based on the good reviews.Here 's the stuff I do n't like : - The small pocket is separated only from the main compartment with mesh . That means if I put my earbuds in there , they are getting dirtied by my shoes in the main part of the bag . - Straps are too small to wear as a backpack when the bag is full . . made for a child really . - Not really that big as the other reviews seemed to indicate . It 's a tight fit for my shoes , a pair of shorts , and weight lifting gloves . - Mesh is very thin.Also , I do n't think all the pictures on this page are for the same item . As you will see , some appear to be very dense soft mesh like a pair of gym shorts . My buddy has one like this and its very nice . The one I got was very thin mesh.All of this probably would have added up to a 3 star review , except the thing broke apart at the seam after only a couple of months .
 THE VERY FIRST DAY I USED THE BAG THE SEAMS ON THE BOTTOM SEPERATED . NOT VERY GOOD QUALITY . WILL NOT PURCHASE AGAIN .
 The bag seemed good at first , but after less than a week . It started to fall apart . The strings fall off , holes opened up near the bottom . And I did n't put anything heavy in there ... Just two small hand towels , jump rope , hand chalk , and a light knee brace . Just pay a little more and get a better bag .
 The bag looked like just what I wanted - a bag for my husband , a coach , to use to carry his wrestling shoes to practice . I gave it to him as a Christmas present and one of the straps is already completely torn out .
 Color is nice . Fit our needs . But - Both straps broke after minimal use . The backpack is now useless . Returning for refund .
 Bag was nice when first recieved however it only lasted about 2 weeks . Bag started to rip at the bottom of the bag . My wife quit using it because she thought she would lose something out of it .
 Used two of these on a recent trip to Hawaii . Neither was overloaded ; just regular beach stuff ; compact towel , sunscreen sunglasses , iphone , etc. . One strap held by a thread after one day . That thread broke on day 2 . Other bag had both straps hanging by a thread on second day of use . Junk .
 The ordering process was great and the delivery timing was amazing but I 've had it a month carrying small items that I need for work and the bag has already started to rip . I bought it because I thought it looked sturdy enough to hold a few things . I have to buy another bag now .
 This bag may be great for lighter loads , but not good for school books . One of the seams tore apart the first day my son used it .
 Bought two of these for my stepkids to use for the pool . Zipper on front of each broke before they even made it out of the house . I was the one using the zippers so it was n't do to the kids being rough with it . Otherwise bags held up ok for frequent water park and pool excursions this summer . Buying tote bags from LL Bean or Lands End for next year .
 I ordered this backpack for my daughter to meet her schools mesh or clear backpack requirement . This bag started falling apart on day 4 of school ! As a 2nd grader , there was very little weight in the bag during its 4 day lifespan so I know it was not due to the load it carried . Also , it was not easy to open and close . I would not recommend this backpack to anyone regardless of intended use . It is not worth it .
 I understand the bag is cheap so you really ca n't expect a lot but this leaves a lot to be desired . - The draw string and the shoulder straps are one piece going to each side making it hard to have the straps even when you wear it . I gave up after a few tries to even them and just hold it on one shoulder . - The draw strings are so snug in the pull top that the bag does not open very well . Seems minor but when you enter and leave the gym and you spend time tugging on the bag to open and close it becomes irritating . - After about one and a half months going to the gym the bottom of one of the straps where the mesh connects to the solid bottom of the bag had a blow out . I walk the half mile to and from the gym with an iPad and a pair of gym shoes in the bag so nothing heavy to cause a blow out and I had to have it repaired.All in all this bag is not worth the money .
 After one month of use , the bag started to rip by the straps . We were using it to carry pool toys that were not heavy . I would not recommend this bag unless you are going to carry very light items .
 Not comfortable , no support , I thought they were the new style pouch type but they are not .
 This garment is poorly sewn with cloth which was too thin to provide some very necessary functions for men . If you just want underwear look on ; however , if your aim is to obtain a bedroom brief you can do better for less . At is unless the view is everything
 The shirt is great looking and well made ; however , it is so very long . I ordered the shirt in regular size , but it 's much longer than those in most tall sizes . I 'm over six feet and the shirt hem hangs down almost to my knees . What 's not mentioned in the shirt description , is that it is almost three feet long .
 Apparently this was old stock from someones window that got sunshine . The parts that were exposed to the sun were faded.I mean FADED . It makes a great work shirt if you are sure to get grease on it , other than that Its a rip-off .

 This bra does a very good job of `` keeping everything in place '' however , it is painful to wear for long periods of time , and putting it on ? Well , that requires body contortionist moves . It does have a hook on the back that comes apart , however the racerback cross one inch above it does not , rendering it almost useless . I can tolerate it for short periods of time , but I do n't like it at all .
 I did n't have trouble putting this bra on . Hook it beforehand and put it on over-head like a t-shirt . Very easy to reach back to unhook and take it off the same way . If you want to take it off without unhooking it , good luck . That was next to impossible . I tried it and felt like it would rip the fabric of the bra , I had to tug at it that hard . It provided decent support for my 40DD girls and it was fairly comfortable , but something was just off . It did n't feel like a good fit . If you want support AND comfort in a great looking bra , I 'd go with this one : Saucony Motion Sensor Sports Running Bra
 I do n't want to exercise in this . I hate how the hard wires dig into me with every step I take , just walking ! The fit is on target , cup-wise , but I would never use this any longer that I must . I paid way too much for it and it 's took late to send it back . I will wear it if I am in public and need to exercise but I 'd rather have the bandeau tops that are more like tube tops to give me support than this torture device .
 Totally horrible back fat explosion . So bad , so utterly mortifying . I had to return this bra.It would be a great bra if back fat was n't an issue for you .
 Although ... once on -- the support is great -- there is no way to get this on unless you are a contortionist ! It must be slipped over the head with arms through straps first ... and remember this is a support bra ... then -- if you are double jointed ... you may be able to reach around the back and fasten the band at bottom ... ugh -- I bet this was designed by a guy !
 This bra was crazy to put on . It is a t strap in back but it does not have a hook to open the bra . I do have to say the cup was well fitted , but the underwire poked on outside of breast .
 Based upon other reviews I ordered a larger cup size - huge mistake . It is baggy , which does n't do much for support . I am a nursing mother , and need the extra support when exercising , especially when it is getting closer to feeding time , and this is even baggy then ! I wish I had ordered my regular size and had not paid attention to the cautions by other reviewers .
 I am extremely disapointed with this bra . The cups are not padded ! so you might as well not wear a bra as nipplescan be seen .
 It was pretty hard to get on , but omg , I thought I 'd have to dial 911 to get the thing off . I bought this and a Bali Comfort bra -LRB- http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00550PUNC/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title -RRB- ... to relieve strap irritation , but this one was not the answer . The Bali Comfort Bra is great , but this sucker is going back to Amazon !
 The Bra gives perfect support , once you have broken your arms and have it on . Then the struggle of taking it off starts . Too me it was too much hassle to do that and I returned it . I am still looking for this kind of support but an easier way to put it on or take it off .
 It 's difficult to get on/off . It chaffed my skin all around the bottom of the bra . It does not have good motion control for sports like running . Very uncomfortable . Do n't buy it !
 First off , let me say that the material of this bra is silky which definitely is n't an attribute I want in a sports bra . It 's difficult to take off and on , and the support is minimal . I am a 36DD , and I get better support in some of my regular bras . The sizing was large in my opinion , so I should have gone down one band size . I ended up ordering the '' Moving Comfort - Juno '' and I am very happy with that purchase .
 The onlin description of this product did not tell you that you had to put this bra on over your head and then somehow fasten it with your hands behind your back . I could never get it on to even see if it fits .
 I am so confused by the positive reviews for this bra . It functions exactly as a -LRB- considerably more unattractive -RRB- regular bra ; it has the same level of support . I have a larger than average chest -LRB- 36D -RRB- but nothing requiring extreme control . Bizarre . I am returning this for sure .
 Customer service is definately lacking at NY Lingerie . In my attempt to return the product I was treated very unprofessionally . Advised in an antagonistic manner and not treated fairly . I paid to have the item shipped to me and paid again to return it . No electronic return label or credit was offered . I had to eat the second shipping charge . I will never use this vendor again.THE PRODUCT IS FINE - CUSTOMER SERVICE LACKING !
 This bra is both a pullover AND triple hook closure . Once I squeezed my shoulders through , smashing my breasts with the underwire in the process , I nearly dislocated my shoulders trying to hook the clasps ! I had to be satisfied with two hooks because I never did get the third . Of course it provided great support on my four-mile run . Removing it when both the bra and my body were sweaty was nearly impossible ; both difficult and painful . For smaller breasts or more flexible women this might be a good choice ; I am a reasonably fit 34DD . Even if you had help to put it on and take it off , you are in for a chore . Champion has other choices that provide the support without the risk -LRB- try double dry spot comfort full support -RRB- . This one is going back .
 I hate this bra . I have no idea what purpose the hooks serve . It goes on over your head . Look closely at the picture of the back , read the reviews ... I wish I had . I have several slightly similar Champion bras from several years back that I loved so much - they had great control , and although I bought them for exercise , I started wearing them all the time . Champion sadly no longer makes them , but I thought this bra looked very similar to them and probably had similar `` engineering , '' but I was mistaken . The strangest thing is , for all its massive structure in the back -LRB- which you ca n't get to to try to adjust without doing some straitjacket-like contortions -RRB- , the support is minimal . Ca n't express how disappointed I am in this product .
 supportsattractive bralifts and separates , but in a kind wayI have a hard time connecting the back snaps . I am not flexible enough to snap them after bra is on , and if I try to snap them then get it on , I can not get it over my head.major design flaw , unless there is some set of instructions that I neglected .
 I ordered my regular bra size , and the fit in the band at the tightest setting was way too loose which means the bra offers no support whatsoever . If it fit , seems like it might be pretty good , but I do n't really know . I got a nearly perfect and very supportive fit with another bra I 'd ordered at the same time , the Champion Shape Scoop Sport Underwire , in one band size down from my regular size -LRB- that was all they had but worked out well -RRB- and usual cup size .
 DESIGN WAS INPOSSIBLE TO GET ON FOR A 42D CUSTOMERSPEC WAS NOT TRUE TO SIZE AS INDUSTRY BRANDS LIKEBALI , NATORI ETC ...
 Unless you 're incredibly flexible , this is a tough one to get on over your head and get hooked.With a bad back ... forget about it !
 I do n't like underwire ... especially in a sports bra , they bind and pinch me . I find them uncomfortable to wear at the gym .
 Do n't waste your money . very uncomfortable . Not what I expected . Would have preferred softer material . Very ruff and itchy . Too bad .
 this workout bra has a good/true fit with good support and eliminates the uni-boob , but needs to have some padding . looked like headlights are on , and thin workout gear would not hide it .
 I purchase a 36 DD and could n't close the back . Cups size are not larger enough . Get a size up .
 When I buy a sports bra it 's because I want it to hold me steady when I 'm running on the treadmill . This item did not do that . I have to wear another sports bra over top of it to get that holding down effect . The second thing I want in a sports bra is boob seperation , I 'll give it a great on this task . The underwire is pretty comfortable and seperates nicely . Lastly , I get underwire because i do n't want my boobs to touch my stomach -LRB- is this TMI ? -RRB- . The underwire on this bra does an ok job of this , not great . It 's better with the sports bra over top of it.Lastly , before I dig too hard on this bra , I think I either ordered a size too big -LRB- i ordered my actual bra size -RRB- or lost a little weight before it got to me -LRB- NOT LIKELY -RRB- . I should have ordered a smaller size and that may have been more supportive and restrictive . So my suggestion , if you get this bra is to buy a size or two smaller than your current bra size .
 I definitely like the motion control of this bra ! The downside is it is very difficult to put on ... it 's almost do n't worth using :-LRB- .
 I am a 42DD and I must say that this is like an average bra for me.You ca n't tell as much on the model in the picture but the under wire that comes up in the middle is more than likely just there for design cause it does n't even separate my boobs sufficiently . It has no function . It does n't even hold my chest . It does give you a nice `` boob silhouette '' under a shirt though . I am going to go and shop for another bra however .
 I do a lot of high impact exercise . I 'm also a 36C . This bra is almost impossible to get on and it 's extremely frustrating . Also , once it 's on , the cup lining is so flimsy and had no compression that my `` friends ' were sticking out like points . I looked awful in this bra and will never wear them . I ca n't even remember if I bounced or not because I was too embarrassed with my appearance .
 Obviously I am not Timothy - I 'm his wife . I 've never owned a bra I could n't put on my myself until now . It 's tight fitting like a sports bra should be but there is no way to hook the strap and slip it over your head . I have to slip it over my head first and then ask my husband to hook it for me . So ladies , if you live alone , do not get this bra - you will never get it closed .
 I bought this bra because of the good reviews . Being a 36 DD , it is hard to find the perfect sports bra that can carry the weight of my DD 's and provide movement control . I bought the 36D to get the tightness , but it still felt too big-probably due to the fact that the straps were too long and there was n't much room for adjustment at all . I really like the look of this bra , but just by putting it on and jumping I realized that it was n't going to provide the support I needed . The back is uncomfortable-felt like something was digging into my skin , like rough fabric .
 I returned this product . Front was comfortable but the back did not like at all.What is wronjg with a regular back closure .
 I went for a 5 mile run and felt the top of the underwires digging into the center of my chest . After my workout , I was appalled to find that my skin was chafed and bruised in that spot -LRB- never happened with a sports bra ! -RRB- . It 's otherwise true to size -- wider in the band than I 'd expected -LRB- I 'm between band sizes , so I ordered up -RRB- and supportive , just that I 've never used the bra again , since there 's still a dark mark where the underwire wore at my skin .
 After reading the very positive reviews about this bra I was inspired to purchase a 34dd which is my exact size in other brands . My intention was to use this bra for running and high impact aerobics . However , after trying it on when it arrived , I realized immediately that it would not suit for either of these activities . The fit around the band was not snug enough and it did not hold me as tightly as I would have expected for a sports bra . After lightly jogging in place for a few seconds it became apparent that this bra would not work for any of the activities that I had hoped to use it for . My breasts were not supported , rather they were jumping up and down along with me . Even after trying to adjust the straps I noticed no difference . What I noticed was that I had to hook it on the tightest hook at the back for it to fit just regularly . I am not sure if I should have ordered a size down but many of the other reviewers had said it was true to size or suggested ordering a size up ... In any case , I plan to either return or re-sell this bra because I have absolutely no use for it as a regular bra and I cant use it as a sports bra .
 the point of a sport bra is for it to be tight , not to wear it like a t-shirt . sizing is way offf
 This is a great sports bra , but for me it just did n't fit properly . For one it was too tight and I had taken other reviewers advice and gotten a larger size than I originally would . It is uncomfortable to wear .
 For years I have worn a Moving Comfort 34D . I thought this might show more of a figure . This bra has elastic in the back that does not stretch . If you have shoulders that are wider that the middle of your back this bra is not for you ! I did contortions to get it on and nearly had to cut it to get it off .
 but it is so small and made of such strong material -LRB- like an ACE bandage -RRB- I could barely stretch it enough to get it over my head . When I finally did manage to maneuver it over my shoulders it was so excruciatingly tight across my upper chest , I did n't think I pull it any lower , but I could n't get it back over my head either , so I had to continue on with it ! I did eventually manage to get it where it should be , but it was so tight and uncomfortable I could not have exercised in it . Getting it off was another hassle and I had to wrangle it down and step out of it , as there was no going back the other way . I would estimate that it is almost 3 sizes smaller in band size than a regular bra . When I lose 30 pounds , I will try it on again as I think it would give a lot of support . I did n't send it back because of shipping and insurance costs . It would have been helpful if the seller had stated in the product description that the bra does not actually open up in the back -LRB- or front -RRB- . I should have read the reviews before purchasing -LRB- the way wised-up readers do -RRB- because I saw that several purchasers who think the bra is great actually have someone help them get into it because it is so tight .
 I could not get this bra over my head and shoulders . I returned it and got a different champion sports bra .
 I bought my Powerback at the same time as I got the Powersleeks . The Powersleek is definitely superior for bounce control . Because I run sometimes -LRB- in addition to cardio kickboxing and other bouncy stuff -RRB- , that 's my top concern with a sports bra -- it HAS to control bounce ! And at 36C , I ca n't afford to let the girls loose once in a while.Pros
 I am a TRUE DD but this only fits about a C cup ! It 's a great bra but too small
 I was very dissapointed with this bra difficult to put on it does not come apart basically a pull on style with a clasp . It gives little support and cups provides no compression . I purchased 34DD . This style may be ok for A/B cups , those requiring little support and having very narrow shoulders in order to pull over the head !
 This is really hard to get in and out of , and once you 're in you 'll be high-beaming everybody at the gym , as the cups are thin .
 I ordered an underwire sports bra and expected a lot of support from it since other reviewers said this was a great product . It is now in the pile of bras that I use to sleep in . It is not fit to jog in unless I want my breasts flopping all over the place . Save your money and buy the cheap Hanes version , that 's what this compares to .
 I bought this bra because Champion no longer makes the bra that I love - so I tried to replace it with another Champion bra . This bra is so difficult to put on and remove that I literally had to recruit my husband to help both times I wore it ! It has a powerback and hooks - it must be donned over the head then hooked in back . Trying to pull a fitted , not too stretchy bra with a ton of underwire around the shoulders and over the breasts then hook it behind the back is just too much trouble ! The support is good , although it does n't fit me nearly as well as the old Champion model . Unfortunately , this will not be the new favorite Champion bra that I was hoping for .
 VERY , VERY difficult to get on and off ... back hook and eye but must slide all over head to fit ... a `` contraption '' at best ... poor length in straps etc. etc. . Would definitely NOT recommend
 I 've figured this out , that you actually have to hook the enclosure and then put it over your head and somehow pull it down over your bust if you want it on , and then you can unhook it from behind and take it off -LRB- but you ca n't put it on and then hook it -RRB- . Someone else said they figured a man must have designed this . I laughed because that 's exactly what I said -LRB- along with some mild swearing -RRB- when I was trying to get it on . It 's ridiculous . Wish I 'd read the others reviews . Do not buy this bra !!
 The shirt is great looking and well made ; however , it is so very long . I ordered the shirt in regular size , but it 's much longer than those in most tall sizes . I 'm over six feet and the shirt hem hangs down almost to my knees . What 's not mentioned in the shirt description , is that it is almost three feet long .
 Apparently this was old stock from someones window that got sunshine . The parts that were exposed to the sun were faded.I mean FADED . It makes a great work shirt if you are sure to get grease on it , other than that Its a rip-off .
 I love cute shoelaces , but these are cheap and even the red background is printed on the laces and rubs off on my shoes .
 It worked quite well at the beginning , warm , comfy , space friendly . However , i 've now experienced water seeping thru the hood -LRB- thru the material -RRB- while the strings were tied and secure ... My hair at the top of my head got real wet in the rain . I do n't know if mine has a fault , as no other part leaks as yet .
 I received this item today and was disappointed to find adhesive stains on the back and some adhesive tape still attached , small stitch holes on the sleeve where it was accidentally sewn and the thread removed , and dirt on the inside of the anorak . This is really unacceptable even at this price.It came in a plastic bag folded nicely , I do n't know how it got dirty inside the garment , inside the bag.The item was sized appropriately for layering.I bought this to use hiking , it 's light enough for that use . I know it 's not waterproof , but I just sprayed it with a durable silicone based water repellent and I 'll update this review later with my experiences.The anorak packs inside it 's own pocket inside out and has loops for attaching to a belt , I guess.Update 3/11/2009I received a call from the seller on March 6 and he apologized citing some problems and that a replacement was going to be sent at no cost . I received the replacement today and upon thorough inspection it is flawless . I am satisfied and will probably buy more garments from them . The only thing that could make this transaction better would have been for the second anorak to come the first time.Also , I wore the flawed anorak with the silicone water guard applied and it functioned well . I stayed dry and the anorak did not get saturated . So I would rate this anorak , as far as waterproofness , waterproof able in that you could use it in a moderate to heavy rain , but not even moderately water repellent on it 's own . This speaks more to the Atsko product than the Anorak by Turfer Sport.I have found the design functional as well . The drawstrings on the collar and waist allow you to increase or decrease ventilation to keep you warmer or cooler . The garment breathes well even after the application of silicone water guard . *** It appears that I ca n't edit my star rating , but it would be a 3.75-4 now since the garment functions well , but only with the assistance of another product .
 I bought this jacket for a trip to Boston and needed a peice of raingear that could be bundeled up really small and fit into a purse . This worked great for that and looked pretty decent on . My complaint was that was sort of rain resistant the for the trip , but after washing it upon arrival home it lost all rain resistancy .
 -- fit is large , not especially the length but in the arms and body . I purchased this to wear over layers -- it is lightweight and the price was great .
 This is NOT a rain jacket . If you are outside for like 10 minutes and its raining really light than its fine . If you are expose longer to heavier rain then you 'll be surprise ! My cell phone got we even when I pocketed it in my jacket with this thing pulled over . Regret ever bought it .
 I do n't believe after wearing this in the rain that any of the other reviewers who gave this piece of junk a good review actually wore it in the rain.I was all excited about getting mine and trying it out in the first downpour . I just stood out in my backyard wearing this in a moderate rainfall for about 3 or 4 minutes , and although most of it seems to be waterproof , there 's one part that is not and it 's probably the most important area . At the base of the neck and on the back part of the hood it got saturated both inside and out making the back of my neck WET . I was planning on wearing this for hours tomorrow working outdoors . I think I 'll be better off wearing a trash bag exactly like the one I 'm thinking about throwing this piece of junk into . However , the only reason I was generous enough to give this 2 stars is because it is kind of a stylish piece of clothing and can be worn as a wind breaker , so I do n't think I really will trash it , but buyer beware , it is NOT WATERPROOF as promised
 I did n't expect much from this , but I ordered it anyway . They said is water RESISTANT -LRB- not water proof -RRB- , I can tell you it is not . The rain goes in through the seams which completely defeats the purpose of this jacket -LRB- unless you like to wear a colorful plastic bag because you think it 's stylish -RRB- . The Sleeves are way to baggy . The hood when laced covers your eyes so you ca n't see . And unless you get some other cheap windbreaker or rain pants you will be half soaked from the waist down -LRB- because the water will drip to your pants -RRB- . About the only thing this jacket has going for it is that it stores well into a small little pouch . But otherwise it does n't do what is advertised , keeping you dry . Buy a poncho or go with an umbrella ...
 This item was described on the website as a unisex jacket . I ordered the jacket in a large which is the size I would order for a woman 's jacket . I was disappointed to find the jacket was clearly designed for a man . It was much too large , with broad shoulders , a thick waist and narrowed at the bottom . The fabric and the color were fine , but because of the poor fit I returned the item to the seller .
 I adore the wrangler aura twill pants . Clean lines , slimming , etc. . The jeans - not so much . I really wish I had simply returned them instead of seeing if they washed a bit better.Sizing is all wrong . You need to order at least 1 if not 2 sizes smaller than you really wear . A little insulting as though you 're going to like these pants better because the number is smaller ? At any rate , the fit is pretty loose , to the point of simply looking like they just do n't fit.Admittedly , I have zero backside which is difficult to make look good in any jeans but these make it even more of an issue.If you decide to try these - expect that you may have to send the first pair back . Keep all the paperwork & shipping info . Oh & washing actually made the fit looser . The color is really very dark - sort of a blue-black .
 Quality of material was very poor ... jeans stretched away to an almost size 12 . Would like a refund !
 I ordered the same size that i order in other brands but this one just did n't fit right . I just ended up looking frumpy .
 didnt have any stretch and it didnt fit good at all . i couldnt even wear them
 Whereas I really like Wrangler jeans , I have n't been able to wear this pair yet as I 've been having to run them through the wash several times to try to get rid of the funky smell they arrived in . I have n't yet . They still smell some . Makes me wonder where these jeans were produced . I 'm not likely to buy them again online as now I 'd probably just return a pair that arrived smelling like these .
 Can I give a minus stars here ? I 've worn Aura jeans for five years . The style I had been wearing seems to be discontinued . I thought I 'd give these a try . Who knew they 'd be such a strange fit ? I know to order one size down in the Aura line . These are at least two sizes two big and an inch longer than any other Auras I 've owned.I guess I 'll be looking for a new brand . Aura has really let me down . These are headed in a donation bag to Goodwill .
 Though the jeans are alright , the sizing is ridiculous . I am traditionally a size 6 , but ordered size 4 according to the chart . I slipped them on , over my hips , without unbuttoning or unzipping them !
 I could n't believe it but these started separating at the seams and the lining started coming out after only a few uses . Total garbage . I buy these shearling slippers all the time and never had this happen before . I will be writing the company .
 Second time I ordered these shoes after the first pair came unhemmed at the outside sole . This pair , same thing . Chinese made , these things are pure garbage . Do not waste your money!Buy minnetonka mocs instead . They 're actually made to last more than a few days .
 Even though this is a cheap wig ... it wo n't look good on anyone . The hair shed everywhere and it was basically disgusting . Do not buy !
 well , you get what you pay for . i have many synthetic hair wigs that are more in the $ 40-90 range and the difference is 180 degrees . this wig showed up in it 's plastic bag , bunched up , entire sections of the hair had already come out and the hair sheds off the wig like crazy when you try to brush down the bedhead look -LRB- not as in the the picture , but as in a bag that 'd been smashed against things during shipping and had lumps of hair facing in all the wrong directions -RRB- you lose more clumps of hair and volume . you get what you pay for , and i wo n't settle for this ever again.digging deep down for a positive point ... it 'll be good to give away to someone who wants to have matching pink hair on at a costume event where wigs are assumed , rather than hoping it looks real .
 I should have payed attention to the other review for this wig . Granted , it 's not HORRIBLE but it 's definitely cheap . Because of prolonged packaging , it does n't look a thing like it does in the picture -LRB- style wise -RRB- . I 'm going to see if I can restyle it somehow , but it will probably be a fail since you ca n't really restyle a synthetic wig . Do n't buy this . Spend some extra cash and get a better quality wig .
 What a piece of garbage . The top was chopped and clumpy and trying to brush it was a nightmare . Very disappointed . The shipping was fast , but cost too much .
 It 's okay . It 's a lot more skimpy than the descriptive picture indicates.I kept it because I needed it and was n't willing to run from store to store to find a better constructed garment . Greatly overpriced .
 This camisole did not fit my purpose . The idea is great , but it did n't fit me correctly
 Very dissatisfied with the quality like several other reviewers . Relegated to cleaning after just one use .
 like the birdies sing ... cheep cheep ... yep they are cheapi got the izzue -LRB- sp -RRB- shirt and it was great ... these blass ones , not so great ... plus amazon plays the price game , they were 5 bucks , but then came a special promo , they raised the price to 7.50 ... to get you to buy more ; using the promo code bringing the price back to 5 each , gamesmanship ... got ta really watch amazon prices , always double check at other sites ... like the contek sunglasses , amazon had them at 130 retail ... heck the mfr only had them retail at 80 ... games
 All I can say is do n't waste your money.This has to be one of the worst shirts I have ever purchased.It looks nice in the pictures , but in this case looks can be deciving . Flimsy material , and the collar appears to be simply paper inside .
 These shirts chafe when sweated in . Do not sweat . If you are a heavy sweater , I strongly recommend going for at least a 20 dollar shirt . Twice as much fabric would be a good idea . There is no way that Bill Blass himself wears these shirts . I do n't know if you can handle the truth , but this shirt has puffy arms . The Fashion Pointed Collars are a MUST HAVE though !!! A slight downfall though , they sometimes slice my shoulders open . Just kidding , but they do kinda poke . :-RRB- If you 're still reading this , you should check out some of those other reviews . They 're ridiculous . I should know . I read them . What is a Lovett Ogre , and how does its back produce so much cotton ? Anyway , if you 're still reading this , I 'll be going to the movies tonight wearing my blue Bill Blass Dress Shirt with Fashion Pointed Collar , if you want to meet me . You ca n't miss me . It 's a stunning shirt . It basically has a glow to it . The light blue tint also matches my eyes . Enough about me . What about you ? Note
 I bought these shirts for $ 6 each thinking that I 've got a bargain , but once I received them was disappointed in my purchase . As previous reviewers mentioned , the material is flimsy , 60 % cotton - 40 % polyester -LRB- and feel like the latter -RRB- , the fit is improper and finish poor . Am wearing one of the shirts now , and it wears uncomfortably -LRB- feels like a poorly made medical scrub -RRB- and looks just as cheap -LRB- yes , even the French Blue color -RRB- . Will either send these back or they will end up collecting dust in my closet .
 If you want a cheap thin shirt that likely will not last a dozen washing then this is the shirt for you.Be aware that Amazon has a $ 3.99 plus $ 0.99 -LRB- per item -RRB- return shipping fee.Is all Bill Blass stuff this `` quality '' ?
 I bought this shirt for one reason , the price , and I soon as I open the box I found out why it was so cheap . Because of the cheap materials . Save your money , spend couple of dollars more and you will be happier with quality .
 it is only worth if you get it for under 5 bucks
 The shirt is NOT at all of a good quality . It does not worth $ 6 at all . Its transparent also . Please save your money and buy a better quality shirt .
 Collars will go bad as soon as you wash them or send them to the dry cleaners . I would prefer going to Marshalls or Ross and get a better deal . Please dont waste your money .
 If you are looking for Bill Blass quality -LRB- go and check it out in a store -RRB- , then keep away from this.On the other hand , if you are looking for a CHEAP shirt , then this is the real thing .
 I wore this shirt just once . It 's almost transparent . Not worth it even if you get it for free .
 I bought 6 of these shirts going by the photographs and some of the reviews . Dont mean to be rude , but people who gave these shirts probably have n't wore a decent dress shirt . You can frequently get ` good ' $ 45 shirt for $ 10 in malls when on sale . I thought this was a better deal . But boy oh boy , I can assure you this is not much better than what you might get at a dollar store . I had ordered these as a gift , but now will give them to Red Cross because these should not be worn at any kind of formal occassion , or even for daily use -LRB- except maybe when you are working at Septic tanks or something -RRB- . These are from Bangladesh , and I can assure you , they are not much better than what would be sold for $ 0.50 in BGD . If you have any self-respect and work in anything but a lowest income group atmosphere , DO NOT BUY THESE SHIRTS .
 The negatives were as reviewed
 Pros : I bought this shirt before it changed to $ 10 a pop.Has magical powers.I wore this shirt on Superbowl Sunday and the Steelers won.Cons : I put the shirt on and chaos erupted , i.e. , it is flammable .
 The shirt fits well , good style , good shirt . But Bealls of Florida sucks as a retailer . Their customer service is rude , crude , and unrefined . Even the supervisors of Customer Service suck , they do n't return or accept any items back . So BEWARE , you better be damn sure that size fits -LRB- ordered product before -RRB- . Because Bealls of Florida will not let you return the item for different size or style . I will not shop here again ! I repeat , I WILL NOT SHOP HERE AGAIN . THIS PLACE SUCKS AS FAR AS A RETAILER .
 I had 3 of these shirts in my cart and saw the reviews and just took these shirts out of my basket . Thanks all for the warning . Bill Blass , Hmmmmmmm , I thought they made quality merchandize . Live and learn .
 Shirts of average quality ... worth about what I paid for them , $ 10.00 ... built in collar stays ...
 I did not like the texture/material . The fitting was also loose for me . Having used Eddie Bauer cotton shirts , these shirts were disappointment .
 I bought these shirts based on great reviews . After receiving them , I realize that it was a total mistake . I did n't even bother to put these on me , as the quality is horrible . By the way , Amazon will charge you money to ship them back as they do n't consider `` item is n't as described on the web site '' is their fault . Things I found out about these shirts :1 . The pictures are misleading . These are n't `` fitted '' shirts . They are quite big .2 . Amazon search engine is misleading too . If you search `` fitted shirts '' , these will show up , but in no mean they are fitted .3 . Poor quality . They are see-through shirts . Unless you like to show off your underwear , these are horrible shirts.Do yourself a favor and do n't order these shirts . You will be ~ $ 8 happier .
 First thing you have to know about clothes
 Not of Good quality.It 's not even worth for that price.Packaging is also not good.The pictures are misleading and they do not look like that .
 My shirts arrived today.Thin , ... an understatement!I 've seen support hose that was thicker!It would take three of these shirts to to make one good shirt.Good for summer wear someone said . These shirts are the kind that are so thin they would cling to you!I 'll need nipple patches on about the third wearing . You know , like the knee patches we used to use on blue jeans.Looks like Bill Blass has gone the way of other companies , selling off their name . I would n't even rip them up for cleaning cloth.NO THANKS ! Back they go ! I 'll suffer the shipping .
 do not buy these shirts , not worth the money , certainly not worth bill blass label , very poor style and stitching and fabric .
 I didnt knew that amazon had such a poor quality control and also they dont have any control over other vendors , Save $ 8 by not buying this product ... Very thin and very large sized shirts ... . they are see thru and look no where like they are shown on web site ...
 Though good workmanship , I was expecting a heavier material for this brand name .
 Fabric is one of the cheapest . Stiching is very bad and sizing is off . Not even worth $ 7.50 sale price .
 I bought two shirts and later I realize never ever buy cloths over net . What you see is not what you get . These are poor quality shirts .
 This shirt is absolutely the worst in the market . The fabric is cheap , so cheap , that I threw the darn thing away
 Why do I keep forgetting about these type of `` sales '' ??? Thanks to all of the wonderful people - reviewers - who truly care about others.I 'll pass on these .
 The material is almost see-through and the collar stays are sown into the material . Not really the highest quality although what can you expect for the price ?
 Paid around 10 bucks for the shirt , but its not wort 10 bucks at all , cant wear to office cos the cloth is see thru . very thin cloth .
 I know that when you buy a Halloween costume , it never looks as good as it does on the box . That 's not a shock . But what was a shock was the total lack of quality in this shirt . It 's thin , tiny , almost see-through , and somehow made of pure itching woven into a material . I knew within ten seconds that there was no way I could wear this thing .
 Wonderful material for the price , but whoever sewed it together chose to sew black with WHITE thread.Used four bobbins of black resewing everything . The gromets had to go because they were open and sharp.Spent three hours remaking this item and now it almost looks good enough to wear anywhere .
 The material for this was what I expected when compared to other similar products
 When I did a search for silk boxers this product was displayed . I bought this product thinking I was getting `` silk '' boxers for my husband . Although these are nice boxers , SILK THEY ARE NOT . Do not be fooled . 100 % polyester does not equal 100 % silk .
 I ordered `` Softsilk '' because I wanted SILK . I payed $ 18 for a pair of boxers because I thought I was getting a deal on SILK . Not over priced 100 % polyester . Polyester is not SILK . Silk is SILK . If I wanted polyester boxers , I 'd have gone to any area store and bought them for $ 5 . Now to return them , I have to repackage them , and I assume pay for postage . There is nothing here to let me know how to have my gift card credited either.This is more trouble than it 's worth to me , so I 'll just be sure to never buy anything from -LSB- ... -RSB- I 've seen this kind of thing with lots of companies . It 's irresponsible at best and deceptive at worst . It 's the responsibility of the company to not mislead their customers . After all , I did n't pay you with sea shells and call it money , did I ?
 No where in the item description does it say that it uses Velcro to keep the wallet closed . I feel like a twelve year old whenever I go to pay for something . It makes that loud separating Velcro noise every friggin ' time . And unfortunately for me , it 's not an `` amazon.com '' product , so the return process is n't as simple . I 've been using it since 09/2007 and it still looks new , so that 's a plus . And the outer edge is a harder material that just does n't seem like hemp , though I 'm not an expert and it could be . There is a plastic cover on the one side -LRB- inside -RRB- to hold your DL or other identification .
 Nice looking socks , but they are so paper thin and light I do n't imagine they will last long . I figured these socks would be better quality with the Tommy Hilfiger name attached to them . Guess not .
 Socks does not stay up and you will be constantly pulling them up ; the socks are comfortable , but the slippage is not worth the comfort .
 These socks are perfect for those who want a tight fit . If you are looking for an elastic pair , look elsewhere .
 Very dissatisfied with the quality like several other reviewers . Relegated to cleaning after just one use .

 If you want a cheap thin shirt that likely will not last a dozen washing then this is the shirt for you.Be aware that Amazon has a $ 3.99 plus $ 0.99 -LRB- per item -RRB- return shipping fee.Is all Bill Blass stuff this `` quality '' ?
 I bought this shirt for one reason , the price , and I soon as I open the box I found out why it was so cheap . Because of the cheap materials . Save your money , spend couple of dollars more and you will be happier with quality .
 it is only worth if you get it for under 5 bucks
 The shirt is NOT at all of a good quality . It does not worth $ 6 at all . Its transparent also . Please save your money and buy a better quality shirt .
 Collars will go bad as soon as you wash them or send them to the dry cleaners . I would prefer going to Marshalls or Ross and get a better deal . Please dont waste your money .
 If you are looking for Bill Blass quality -LRB- go and check it out in a store -RRB- , then keep away from this.On the other hand , if you are looking for a CHEAP shirt , then this is the real thing .
 I wore this shirt just once . It 's almost transparent . Not worth it even if you get it for free .
 I bought 6 of these shirts going by the photographs and some of the reviews . Dont mean to be rude , but people who gave these shirts probably have n't wore a decent dress shirt . You can frequently get ` good ' $ 45 shirt for $ 10 in malls when on sale . I thought this was a better deal . But boy oh boy , I can assure you this is not much better than what you might get at a dollar store . I had ordered these as a gift , but now will give them to Red Cross because these should not be worn at any kind of formal occassion , or even for daily use -LRB- except maybe when you are working at Septic tanks or something -RRB- . These are from Bangladesh , and I can assure you , they are not much better than what would be sold for $ 0.50 in BGD . If you have any self-respect and work in anything but a lowest income group atmosphere , DO NOT BUY THESE SHIRTS .
 The negatives were as reviewed
 The shirt fits well , good style , good shirt . But Bealls of Florida sucks as a retailer . Their customer service is rude , crude , and unrefined . Even the supervisors of Customer Service suck , they do n't return or accept any items back . So BEWARE , you better be damn sure that size fits -LRB- ordered product before -RRB- . Because Bealls of Florida will not let you return the item for different size or style . I will not shop here again ! I repeat , I WILL NOT SHOP HERE AGAIN . THIS PLACE SUCKS AS FAR AS A RETAILER .
 I had 3 of these shirts in my cart and saw the reviews and just took these shirts out of my basket . Thanks all for the warning . Bill Blass , Hmmmmmmm , I thought they made quality merchandize . Live and learn .
 Shirts of average quality ... worth about what I paid for them , $ 10.00 ... built in collar stays ...
 I did not like the texture/material . The fitting was also loose for me . Having used Eddie Bauer cotton shirts , these shirts were disappointment .
 Pros : I bought this shirt before it changed to $ 10 a pop.Has magical powers.I wore this shirt on Superbowl Sunday and the Steelers won.Cons : I put the shirt on and chaos erupted , i.e. , it is flammable .
 I bought these shirts based on great reviews . After receiving them , I realize that it was a total mistake . I did n't even bother to put these on me , as the quality is horrible . By the way , Amazon will charge you money to ship them back as they do n't consider `` item is n't as described on the web site '' is their fault . Things I found out about these shirts :1 . The pictures are misleading . These are n't `` fitted '' shirts . They are quite big .2 . Amazon search engine is misleading too . If you search `` fitted shirts '' , these will show up , but in no mean they are fitted .3 . Poor quality . They are see-through shirts . Unless you like to show off your underwear , these are horrible shirts.Do yourself a favor and do n't order these shirts . You will be ~ $ 8 happier .
 First thing you have to know about clothes
 Not of Good quality.It 's not even worth for that price.Packaging is also not good.The pictures are misleading and they do not look like that .
 My shirts arrived today.Thin , ... an understatement!I 've seen support hose that was thicker!It would take three of these shirts to to make one good shirt.Good for summer wear someone said . These shirts are the kind that are so thin they would cling to you!I 'll need nipple patches on about the third wearing . You know , like the knee patches we used to use on blue jeans.Looks like Bill Blass has gone the way of other companies , selling off their name . I would n't even rip them up for cleaning cloth.NO THANKS ! Back they go ! I 'll suffer the shipping .
 do not buy these shirts , not worth the money , certainly not worth bill blass label , very poor style and stitching and fabric .
 I didnt knew that amazon had such a poor quality control and also they dont have any control over other vendors , Save $ 8 by not buying this product ... Very thin and very large sized shirts ... . they are see thru and look no where like they are shown on web site ...
 Though good workmanship , I was expecting a heavier material for this brand name .
 Fabric is one of the cheapest . Stiching is very bad and sizing is off . Not even worth $ 7.50 sale price .
 I bought two shirts and later I realize never ever buy cloths over net . What you see is not what you get . These are poor quality shirts .
 This shirt is absolutely the worst in the market . The fabric is cheap , so cheap , that I threw the darn thing away
 Why do I keep forgetting about these type of `` sales '' ??? Thanks to all of the wonderful people - reviewers - who truly care about others.I 'll pass on these .
 The material is almost see-through and the collar stays are sown into the material . Not really the highest quality although what can you expect for the price ?
 Paid around 10 bucks for the shirt , but its not wort 10 bucks at all , cant wear to office cos the cloth is see thru . very thin cloth .
 Rothco makes soem good gear but the real deal is a lot better . but not a bad light weight fleece .

 I have this in all 3 colors , and only the blue color looks fine . The other two colors , I do n't think I would like to wear to office where I am a mid-manager level . Reason being that the fabric is a blend hence thinner than the normal 100 % cotton shirts that I prefer . Looking at the retail price of the shirt , I was expecting something better .

 but the material is not really good , is up to uone of the 2 i bought fall apart ...
 Did not like product . It was just a basic brief with padds that are too far apart . A waste of money . I would not recommend .

 The wig did not look anything like the picture . It was really poor quality and it shed a lot . I was n't even able to use it . What a waste of money . I would have returned it for a refund , but since they do n't refund shipping and to return it , I would of had to pay to ship it back , it just was n't worth the hassle to get a couple of dollars back ! Money lost .
 I purchased this cashmere robe for my husband for his birthday , but the XL men 's size robe that arrived was woefully too small . It would maybe fit an x = large napolese man , but certainly not an American . To make it worse not only was my husband disappointed , but I had to hassle with shlepping to the post office to return it only to now have to argue with `` the boutique '' to have my money credited to my card . `` They are generously offering me a store credit '' -LRB- yeah , right -RRB- . so ... now they have their merchandise AND my money ! BEWARE , DO N'T BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE .
 Do n't allow air to flow through the shirt . Sticks to your skin . Stitching from the reflective strips cause skin to itch
 Went into the Goodwill bag first thing . Flimsy , obviously too small and I could have gotten something better , a thicker , more substantive and flexible knit , -LRB- and later did -RRB- at a department store . I was seduced by something in the description -LRB- looking to fit someone w / large calves -RRB- but I should have known better .
 I placed an order from this seller on 1/17/09 and I have not even heard one work from them and my order is suppose to be delivered by tomorrow . I 'm sure it has n't even been shipped yet . I wo n't order from them again . They get and F - from me . Not a reputable seller .
 The suspenders look good and come with the ability to clip to pants or connect to buttons inside the waistband . Unfortunately one of the rivets where they connect to the pants failed within the first few hours . Maybe this was a fluke or maybe its because they are poorly constructed .
 One of the studs which holds the leather clasp together came unscrewed and was lost . Had to order a second pair for `` parts '' . Recommend that you glue the studs in place . Overall they work but are cheaply made .
 I DID NOT RECEIVE THE PRODUCT YET !!!!!!! WHENEVER I RECEIVE IT I CHANGE THE RATING , BECAUSE I CA N'T REVIEW SOMETHING I NEVER RECEIVED!LOOKING FORWARD TO HEAR FROM YOU .
 After thirteen months , the fabric is failing . They typically get worn only once a week . Not acceptable for a pair of boxers that cost sixty-two dollars

 As usual Amazon did a great job of getting this order to me in record time ... However the product is not Maroon ... It is awful gaudy pink ... the inlay is cheap gold that flakes and leaves a mess everywhere ... I would return it however the item only cost $ 3.95 and the shipping is too much ... : -LRB-
 I only gave it 1 star because they sent me the WRong Color -LRB- Orange -RRB- but I ordered Pink . They ran out of stock so I was stuck with the Orange . I was very upset with Amazon but had to keep the item .
 I got a 3x & it fit someone that wears a 1x !! Nice jacket - but sizing is way too small !!
 I like the coat , but the sizing is off a bit . Plan to go up a size than your regular size because it 's a snug fit .
 Hi , Purchased this item recently for myself . It is good quality , that is not the problem . This coat runs EXTREMELY SMALL . You will need to order at least 2 sizes bigger than you would normally wear .
 Fur does n't look that great ... and , like one of the other reviewers , I thought it ran true to size . Based on the other reviews , I ordered one size bigger , but it was too big . I probably would have kept it if it fit right , but since it was so large , back it goes !
 Contrary to previous posters ' opinions , I found this jacket to run large . Even if it fit properly , I would return it because the faux fur is horribly cheap-looking .
 I ORDERED THIS BECAUSE I REALLY WANTED A JACKET THAT LOOKED FEMININE AND THEN I RECEIVED AN EMAIL THAT IT WOULD BE HERE IN APRIL DONT SELL IT IF YOU DONT GOT IT OTHERWISE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE
 AS SOON AS I PUT THESE ON I BEGAN DEVISING A PLAN TO RETURN THEM TO OUR LOCAL KMART FOR AN EXCHANGE ... TOOK TWO TRIES BUT I GOT THEM SWITCHED FOR A KMART BRAND THAT WAS MUCH BETTER ... AND YOU COULD SIT DOWN IN THEM .
 Im not sure if this review will link to the seller at all , but this seller is ridiculous . For one pair of pants , it took them 12 days to ship it and THEN another 12 days to arrive once they were marked as shipped , and I paid over 8 $ in shipping costs . bogus . The specific seller that i suggest avoiding is Silberman 's .
 I just purchased these double knee along with 2 regular pair of Dickie workpants . All three pair were 32 x 30 , but the pair of double knee were more like a 34 '' waist . So I am returning that pair and will try again . After reading all reviews , it seems as though the problem with fit isnt new to this company .
 Not even kidding ... brand new they are stiff as cardboard and extremely uncomfortable , especially when you walk or sit/crouch . Washing them a dozen times may help slightly , otherwise wear them everyday for a couple years without washing them.Unbelievable .
 Got my work pants and found they sent the completely wrong size . The slip with the correct size was sitting in the bag . Laziness is what I call it . Unacceptable .
 I recently purchased my first pair of these work PANTS . Size 30 x 32 . I have been happy with OTHER Dickies pants ... namely the workhorse jean with double knee . But if you are on your knees at all with these work PANTS , the lower seam of the double panel falls directly under your kneecap , making it almost impossible to kneel down on a hard surface without pain . Note that on their double knee JEANS , the reinforcement panel starts 10 inches above the bottom of the pant leg and works like it should . On these work PANTS , the panel starts 13 inches above the bottom of the pant leg . Why would they change it up like that ? I assumed when I bought them , the positioning of the knee reinforcement panel , within the same manufacturer , would be the same . When kneeling down , they ride up just enough to be too high for knee reinforcement . More like thigh reinforcement.When Dickies Customer Service was contacted for explanation , and refund , I got just the standard , non-personal form letter , not signed by anyone -LRB- but still saying to `` just call me '' if you have questions -RRB- They want me to pay shipping , handling , and insurance to send them back , and all they can do is send me another pair of the same style , size etc. . Very disappointed in this product and their customer service .
 I ordered a large shirt of the one pictured but I got a completely different gray one that was XL

 Screen protector is received extremely scratched as if someone went over it with a sanding paper . It 's a nice case but the scratched ruined it .
 The case is classy and well built.No armband is included as advertised.If you do not need an armband then this product may be for you .
 I purchased 2 , 60 in wiggs so that I could go as cousin it . The wigs were verry long just as the say but they were very thin . 2 wigs were not enough -LRB- thick enough -RRB- to cover myself for my intended costume . the color was very nice . So depending the purpose of the wigs it was an ok item . They were synthetic and not real life feeling and you can not brush out or comb them when they became tangled .
 This wig is too thin to adequately cover anyone 's head . It is not easily brushable . I am only going to use it to try to create extensions . The colour is nice , but if you 're using this as the sole wig for your event , I would recommend another wig . While it is definitely as long as the picture shows , it is far too thin for anyone 's head .
 There are a few strands that are 60 inch long that come from the top of the head ; the rest of the strands are 1 foot long . you can see the netting when you put on the wig . The promo picture is very misleading . This is false advertising . Very disappointing . I thought I found a bargain judging by the picture , but was misled . .
 Total garbage . Should have coughed up 20 or 30 more dollars and got a better one . Even had a wig burning ceremony after the final day of shooting . Caused me and my actress nothing but grief .
 This wig is EXTEMELY thin and with the slightest movement of the fake hair it becomes HORRIBLY tangled !!! Not usable for my granddaughter 's Rupunsel costume . It 's a big mess !!
 i bought this brand wig its like two or three layers of short hair then on the top a thin layer of long hair its as long as the pitcure but very thin is impossable to get a brush through , right out the pack its matted and it sheds hair very cheaply made i really dident mind the tangles cuse its a witch wig but the sheding !!! the best brand wig i bought it was thick no tanglesit was a uk store -LSB- ... -RSB- they shipp to the us very good wigs nice wigs
 Not something you want to wear unless you were caught in bad weather without anything else . Not an `` everyday '' wear type of coat . I keep it in the trunk of my car for emergencies .
 There really is n't much to this ` jacket ' . If you want to stay warm in a chilly rain , you will need to wear something heavy underneath it . As they say , ` You get what you pay for ' . I believe the ` low ' price was a bit high for what I actually got . I will not buy anything like this ever again !
 this should have been sold as disposable clothing for emergency use only.worn twice.felt stupid putting it on because of its appearance.second time it looked dowdy and fabric did not breathe at all.the fabric is used in enviro shopping bags and $ 2 labcoats.i purchased a nike on ebay for same money . it is real clothing not costume .
 not enough contour ! The contour is about 2 inches too short for the bra zise.I did not snt it back , because I did not want to pay for sipping.waste my time and money with this buy.Thank you .
 It 's very stiff and still does not provide as much support as I would have expected . Will stick to purchasing this type of stuff at store ...
 If you are one of the lucky few that this bra fits , I bet it is wonderful . However , There are no strap adjustments . So if it does n't fit , it does n't fit .
 I do n't know what I expected from a posture bra , but this one has no structure to it . It basically just feels like a wireless bra . I 'm not sure how it 's supposed to help with posture if it 's all just material . I give it one star because Amazon sent it really fast ! I 'm sending it back to Amazon today . = -LRB-
 If you 're going to order this bra , be sure to order up a full band size , or 2 . It runs very small in the band , but the cup size seems accurate .
 I purchased two posture bras & was displeased that the Eyes were all set so far back under the fabric that I had to rip that strip out & place them farther out so that the hook could catch them!Not pleased with that situation at all . ! Bobi
 Having heavy breasts , by the end of the day my posture becomes worse , and often my back will feel a bit sore as well . I wear a 40DD in most brands , but when I ordered this bra in my size , it did n't fit at all ; for one , the band was too tight . Secondly , the cups were too large ! It also puckered badly along the seams running through the center of the cups , making it impossible to wear under a t-shirt without being noticeable.I noticed no assistance at all all with my posture ... I could slouch with my shoulders thrust forward and did n't feel the slightest bit of resistance . There are bands crisscrossing one another across the back of the bra , which I assumed were what would offer posture support & resistance , but there was no discernible difference between the stretchiness and resistance of these bands and a typical cotton sports bra.The material is actually comfortable , but the bra just did n't do what it claimed to do regarding posture . If you still want to try , I would recommend going one or two band sizes up , and one cup size down .
 It is a good posture support bra , but it rolls up . making it uncomfortable . I returned this item
 Wore it one time made a sore where it rubs your skin at the closing in front . Not stretchy at all
 This bra did not fit properly so I returned it . I would not recommend it unless you order a size larger .
 The only all cotton oart of this bra is the cups . I ordered it because of an allergy to synthetics and I am very disappointed .
 I bought this in hopes of improving my posture but I was disappointed with the fit . It was a bit loose and ca n't be adjusted . I do n't understand how it 's supposed to help your posture .
 I wanted a bra I could wear most days to correct my posture . It 's bra , while a great concept , looked truly awful . It left me looking oddly shaped and unattractive .
 item is undersized . Consider buying one or two sizes larger -LRB- or more -RRB- This is not rocket science , a circumference can be measured , ca n't it ?
 My 15 year old daughter has bad posture so we thought we 'd try to correct it by purchasing this bra , as braces and other gadgets are not recommended by doctors . This bra is very lightweight & does not offer enough coverage or support , and my daughter hates it . She has to wear it with another bra to get the coverage and support she needs . The strap design is created to try to remind ladies to stand up straight , but it 's not really working for my daughter . Overall , a waste of money for us .
 Based on the photo , the cups appeared to be seamless , but they are not . The seams ripple and result in a bumpy silhouette -- bad for t-shirts .
 The title of this item says COTTON BRA . It is not . Only the cups are cotton . The rest is very tightly woven non-breathing polyester and nylon . The description is misleading . I returned mine . I need something that breathes !
 I bought these in khaki for work . Problem is I ca n't use them for work , because in florescent light they are green . They are perfectly khaki in natural light , but in a big box retail store they are green . Yep , definitely green .
 Not even kidding ... brand new they are stiff as cardboard and extremely uncomfortable , especially when you walk or sit/crouch . Washing them a dozen times may help slightly , otherwise wear them everyday for a couple years without washing them.Unbelievable .

 I have always loved this pullover and used to buy this item every few years because I would literally wear them out . Now I understand why Kohls has discontinued selling this item though , because Columbia keeps making this item cheaper and cheaper . I recently bought two to replace the ones I had . They now cost more and the material is pretty much see-through -LRB- just hold it up to the light -RRB- . I have previous versions of this item and you can definitely see how much cheaper they 're being made . The thin fabric makes the collar look terrible and the item just sort of hangs on you . As well , a few washes pretty much destroy these `` new '' versions . Columbia please make these the way you used to even if they cost a few bucks more - your reputation is at stake !!
 this is really flimsy , the back string broke on me . also its an odd fabric and doesnt offer enough fabric for the size breast you order for
 Worked OK for a couple of weeks until the plastic tabs that grip the belt lost their strength . I would not buy this again or recommend it .

 Well it certainly is big . I recently bought a hook to hang it off the towel rack as to use up less counter space . After maybe 4 times of doing this , the inner plastic lining began to tear . I can see this is not going to end well . Without this issue , I 'd give it 4 stars .
 The area on the bottom is a pain in the neck , since you have to hold the top to get the zipper to zip . The containers that came with it leaked , and should not be used . I wish I had gone for a simpler kit instead . The material is already starting to show some wear , and I do n't think it will hold up to heavy use . When it goes , I will get a plain leather kit .
 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac .

 The costume is very thin , not worth the money !!!!
 I received the product and suprised to know that the actual product is different in picture - it is in nylon . Amazon , you are deceitful .
 These socks have no elastic to hold them up , and even if they did , they 'd still be too short to wear under slacks . I 'm glad these were an inexpensive stocking stuffer !
 Returned this bag , it looks very plain and junky . I 'm sure it would be fine for functional use , but if you 've graduated beyond using zip lock bags for your toiletries , why not get something nicer ?
 These are really cute , but do n't believe the size charts , they run small ! I wear a 6 at old navy and thought based on the size chart here that would translate out to a medium ... I was wrong ! These were so tight on my hips that it was uncomfortable . I figure that I need at least a large for them to fit right ... oh well , at least they were super cheap so I did n't waste much money .
 I bought this product 9 months ago and only used it on 2 trips and the zipper pull broke off on one of the zippers . I ca n't find Delseys phone number or company address because they took down the contact us and customer service information off of their website as of 1/08/2008 . I had to find their address via the Better Business Bureau and still ca n't reach them . Dont buy this luggage unless you want to use pliers to open your bag.They are not honoring their warranty .
 I had this bag for exactly one trip before it broke . The wheels folded in as I was leaving the airport . Upon inspection I found the internal frame which is made of cheap and brittle plastic to be in about a hundred pieces . Materials for construction are thin and brittle . This bag will not hold up . Avoid .
 This bag may be good for the occassional travler , but I returned this suitcase because it did not appear sturdy enough to withstand the rigors of frequent travel . Additionally , the expandable suiter feature was a disappointment and not as well designed as other luggage at a higher price point . I purchased this bag for my wife , as I already have a Delsey Suiter which I paid more for . The higher priced Delsey I have is fantastic and it withstands frequent travel . The purchase of this bag validated that old cliche ' , `` you get what you pay for '' and I found that saying is certainly applicable to luggage . I suggest you invest a little more money and buy a better , sturdier suitcase , because it will last longer ...
 This is not as lightweight as I would have thought . It weighs about 10 lbs empty.After using this suitcase for a year , 3 of the zipper pulls are broken so it is no longer usable . Very disappointed in this piece of luggage .
 The belt pockets are too small , because standard photo IDs & credit cards -LRB- CC -RRB- are too wide to fit in the pockets . Thus , if you are like me & are ordering this item so that you will be able to put your ID , CC & cash in the belt pockets instead of having to carry your purse/handbag to an event then unfortunately this item will be useless to you . The manufacturer needs to slightly increase the pocket dimensions to accommodate an ID & CC ! What is the point of placing pockets on this belt if the pockets have no real functional use !
 I ordered the item pictured in the product description . The one I got came in a package with the same picture on the front . But it was not the item pictured.If you are looking for a long beard and wig , that look remotely like real hair , do n't bother . This one is actually so short that it barely comes below my neck , and the mustache has a giant elastic band that sticks up above the hair . It looks literally nothing like the picture , aside from being white . the hair is dull , not glossy , but not dull in a real hair way . Dull in a 5-year-old 's costume way . This is the sort of thing you might wear as a joke and then throw away after one use.It looks nothing like the picture . I can not stress this enough .
 The picture & description is very misleading ! I have 3 issues with this product . For one , the beard is maybe Santa length not wizard length . Secondly the mustache part is cut uneven and looks ridiculous ! Like you have a lopsided mouth . And finally . The wig itself . The damn thing looks like someone took a crimper to it ! I have my party tomorrow -LRB- Halloween -RRB- and I do n't think I am going to be able to use this . Or the very least I have to change what I am going as !
 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon .

 1st , the cups were a bit small , & I know I gave the right size . Then , the strap broke ! It 's pretty , & they had my size , which is a small miracle in itself , but I would n't buy this again !
 This bra is not true to size it is smaller than the 34 G bra I was replacing . The faberic is very ichy and uncomfortable . A very disapointing purchase .
 I think the fit of the bra is great , but I can only wear it briefly because it is so uncomfortable . The fabric is stiff and itchy and the metal adjustments in the front poke me on both sides . I have washed it several times to try and soften the fabric ; did n't work . I would love to be able to wear it because it give such good support and shape , but I just ca n't .
 The size is wrong . I ordered my regular size and it 's much too small . Am returning for a larger . We 'll see .

 I agree , these are cut small ... Buy an inch or two larger than you normally do . The waist band does NOT stretch .
 I got the shippment quickly . But wrong items was sent . I have to return it to the seller . I got the refund pretty quick , but only for the value of product . I spent about & 10 for two way shipping without geting anything .
 Did not like the pants at all , and threw them in the trash rather than pay return postage . Flimsy , smelled of dye , cheap fabric , etc. . Too bad .
 Merchant was out of stock on the second pair of pants , so when it was shipped I was charged $ 9 again when the second pair was in stock weeks later.Will not buy from Amazon vendors again .
 If you search for Super Saver shipping this advertisement comes up , but this product is not shipped by Amazon is does not go out with the Super Saver shipping , and the cost of shipping is nearly 20 % the cost of the pants .
 I DID NOT GET THE SLACK THAT HAD THE WAISTBAND . I GOT SLACK WITH NO WAISTBAND , SO I SEND THEM BACK AN WAS TRYING TO GE A 42 29 BUT I RECEIVED A E MAIL STATETING THAT THE PRODUCT WAS NO LONGER AVABILITY . SO FAR I ` AM NOT SURE WERE MY REFUND WENT . PLEASE LET ME KNOW.TOM ATKINSON
 I have bought dockers for years but these are cut smaller than they usually are . Even with the `` stretch '' waist band they are tight . So much for an `` extra '' inch . Beware . Try these in a store before you buy .
 I have worn these pants for years ; my size is the same as always . I could n't get them on ; they were so tight I could n't get the button buttoned around the waist . What is going on ? These pants seemed to be cut for a skinny 25 year old , not someone who is a little on the hefty side . Further , the shipping and handling charges are just out of sight ... $ 16.95 above and beyond the already rather pricy product . I would not recommend doing business with this seller at all . You can go to other outlets and get the same thing without the shipping and handling , and there are `` deals '' out there from major store chains . I was really disappointed in this product and the seller . Go to WalMart and get their khakis ; they are very inexpensive and wear like iron .
 Dockers are Dockers , so that 's not the problem . Just be sure you do n't trust the images if you choose to buy these via Amazon . `` Cafe , '' for example , should be `` Coffee . '' Despite the fact that the image for `` Cafe '' shows a stone or very light gray color , `` Cafe '' is actually dark brown . So the product is n't defective , but IS misleading
 I was very excited to receive this item , but when I did I was extremely disappointed . Besides being made of cheap material -LRB- hey its not like you plan on wearing it alot/for long periods of time -RRB- it 's proportions were WAY off . The legs of it fit fine , but when i went to snap it on behind my neck , I noticed , this must have been made for a person with a midget torso and regular legs ! If I did snap it on all the way , i would have had the largest camel toe possible ! needless to say , i never got to actually use/wear it , and it never will be .
 I would say that the item itself is nice but do not order from `` in his dreams '' they took a life time to ship the product . It said it would be here on a certain day and came like 4 day after their last said date .
 The neckline was very tight on my throat as I put it on , and it was so unconfortable , there was no way I was going to wear it that way , if even for just a short period . So I did n't cross it in front and just connected it behind the neck , like a halter . Not great , but at least I was able to wear it . Otherwise , the material and size was comfortable . But I was n't happy that I could n't wear it as pictured . I already have a halter style , and if I would have known this would turn out the same , I would n't have bought it .
 Let me start out by saying every product I have purchased from this seller has been perfect with the exception of this item . The package details say body stocking fits most . Now by most it says between 5 ' 0-5 '10 and between like 110-175lbs . Now my wife is 5 ' 2 and 115lbs . The overall body stocking wasnt made with enough lace to stretch comfortably around her body and she could barely get the thing on . It has nothing to do with the leg position , but more along the lines of the torso/mid section of the body stocking being so short . And by that I mean the seam that should line under the breasts ended up lining the navel . Very displeased and I would send it back and get a new one , but its not worth the time or the shipping costs .
 I 'm only 5 ' 3 so it fit kind of big . I always have that problem with `` one size fits all '' items . The material is nice , the hole at the crotch is great and the button to keep it in place is nice too , but it just does n't work for me . I 'd recommend for anyone 5 ' 6 or taller .
 please be aware that the shirt sizing runs small -LRB- an XL is really a L -RRB-
 Cap does not fit over your teeth and just falls right out . There is no adhesive and is just a clip that you have to bend to get on . Once on , you ca n't re-bend it to clamp and it just falls off .
 Beware ! In the description above , it states shoe size 6-9 , but in the manufacturer 's description it states size 8-13 . Thus , the socks which I thought were my size ended up being MUCH larger .
 It really needs to be mentioned in the product description that this backpack is made of mesh fabric . You can kind of tell if you look at the enlarged views , but I just thought it was a pattern on the fabric . If you intend to buy an all mesh , transparent backpack , you 'll probably like it a lot more than I do .
 The picture shows the waist belt . But when I received the product , there 's no waist belt . I returned the bag .
 Looks cute , seems a bit wide for a 0-3 size , the seller stinks though , they charched me over $ 3 for each headband -LRB- I ordered 2 from them -RRB- even though they came in one envelope . Not ordering from them again !

 I purchased this item for college and possibly some hiking . The price seemed reasonable for what looked like a quality bag . Unfortunately , this was n't at all the case . The very obnoxious shoulder straps , which feed through the buckle , ALWAYS slide loose . They wo n't stay where you put them . At one point , I simply tied them into a very tight knot in order to keep them from completely unbuckling . Also , if you put very much weight in the top compartment , the stitching soon gives out and you 'll have to resew it . The spacious design seemed like a good idea , but the pack will keep no shape unless thoroughly filled . Because of the poorly designed straps and the stirching giving out so soon , I attempted to deal with the company instead of writing a bad review . Unfortunately they are unwilling to refund your money unless you pay for all of the return shipping - in my case that would be atleast a third of the cost of the bag ! They do n't consider the pack defective since `` another pack would be just the same . '' I would n't recommend this pack to anyone !
 I purchased this bag for a medium pack for camping . While the material of good quality and the bag holds up nicely , the shoulder straps attach in an A-design near the top of the bag , verses a H-design found on most backpacks . The problem with this is that weights in excess of 7 lbs will pull on your neck muscles in a spreading manner unless you loosen the straps , at which point the bag pulls back on your shoulders vs. downward like it should . Long story short , it will feel like you 've been packing 30 lbs for 4 hours within 20 minutes of hiking . No padding on the shoulder straps also have it rub into your skin in a less than comfortable manner.As much as I like the durability of canvas , I would not recommend this pack.While it costs a good penny more , I would highly recommend theSnugpak Rocket Pak System , . Its much better for extended excursions into the wilderness and an awesome bug-out-bag if you 're looking for one .
 Took this along on a hike around downtown New York city ... big mistake.My biggest complaint is the shoulder straps are stitched far too close together at the top.They are also thin and without padding.Do not waste your money here on this item.Spend an extra $ 30 and get something that is at the least comfortable to lug around for an extended time period .
 No good ! The straps do not like to hold , its not logical to use for anything more then holding clothes in . I wish it had had been better .

 The cut of the shirt was weird , the neck hole was too large and the sleeves come almost down to the elbow . Characters on the shirt were colored red and green when picture shows them as being black . The shirt is more school bus yellow/orange than ths shirt shows . My wife has adopted it as a sleep shirt .
 The design may be good in theory , but the materials and assembly are the cheapest the manufacturer could find . The straps , rather than being nylon or some other strong material , are cheap cotton . Two of them tore on my first use of the bag . One just ripped in two , and the other tore out where it attached to the bag . The handles -LRB- also cheap cotton -RRB- are starting to tear out as well - after the bag 's first use ! The strap and handle attachment points look nice and strong , but the straps are barely inserted into the gussets . It looks like the stitching holds the straps in a large x-pattern , but in fact only a thin line of stitching holds it about 1/4 inch from the end of the strap . This bag is made to look strong , but it poorly made and not worth the money.My recommendation is to shop further and find a better duffel bag that is made of better quality materials and assembled with more care . It does hold a lot , but it better be lightweight stuff if you want the bag to survive the trip .
 I bought this product for a trip to South America ; it 's light in terms of weight , has a bunch of external pockets and great internal space ; however after my first trip start to begin unravel , so I lost the confidence on the product
 I bought the bag for my camping trip in Arizona . There are things you have to be aware of.The price and the design is excellent . However , the material not so . When I received it the bag was folded and because of that the bottom part , which should be reinforced with a durable plastic , was already cracked on several places as well as in one of the corners . I did n't have time to return it so I brought it on the airplane the way it came . After I received it back on the airport in Las Vegas also the cotton fabric was ripped off exactly there , where the hole in the corner was.I did not have any troubles with the zipper as many were concerned with.Overall , the shoulder straps were very comfortable , the adjustments were also fine and as I said a good price too . I just wished the plastic on the bottom would be made out of better material . Then it would be an excellent bag . Since it s not I would not recommend it to a friend or anybody else . If you 'd like to buy a nice duffle bag look for a Cabela . They seem to be better .
 Perfect size , light and practical design . Sadly poor construction . Shoulder strap unstitched on 2nd trip . Carry handle disappeared courtesy of a British Airways flight . Shame the materials were 2nd rate as this is the best bag ... as long as you don ; t plan on taking it away from home ; - -LRB-
 The color was what i wanted however , the vest was obviously not brand new which the seller did not indicate on the product description .
 The stockings were not in the package , and there is no good way to get in touch with the company that sold me outfit in the first place . My girlfriend was disappointed and I felt like a fool when no one even took the time to return my call . I will not do business with this company again .
 This was a `` Woochie '' soft nose which was not stated in the ad.Looked great in the picture . It did n't fit my face , even when I cut it down , itwas way too large . Would cost too much to send it back . My lose!I had to get a `` Pro Nose '' . Anybody need a Woochie nose -- cheap ?
 I could not wait to get this hat form reading all of the reviews . BUT It is HUGE !!!! While I do like large sun hats for the beach , this one makes me chuckle it is so large . It looks ridiculous on . It also came to me with bent places along the rim . I have tried reshaping this hat & to get the bent places out , but it 's still ridiculously large . I do n't know how anyone can travel with this thing -LRB- by plane -RRB- . I would recommend getting a hat that the rim is adjustable . I have a black one like that , & I love that feature !
 I ordered the hat based on the generally postive reviews . The hat arrived promptly but when I opened the box , found that the hat looked nothing like the picture . It was really cheap looking -LRB- made from woven paper -RRB- and was a really ugly yellowish white color . Considering that I had just paid $ 30.00 for it , I didnt even bother to try it on . I boxed it up and shipped it back the next day swallowing the disatisfaction of knowing that shipping both ways was non-refundable and totaled close to $ 15.00 . The one star is for the hat itself and over-pricing , but I should also say customer service tried very hard to make it right , they emailed me right away to see if they could send me another hat and when I returned the hat they credited my account right away . But I wouldnt order from them again based on quality and high price .
 I bought this hat a couple of days before going to the beach because I read the reviews on amazon , and most of them said how wonderfully surprised they were that the hat fit them because of their big head . The hat came the day before we left for beach , and did n't fit - too small ! Bummer .
 this hat was massive . the actual head part was huge . if you try to tighten it with the string it makes like a muffin top which does n't look good on anyone . i have a pretty big head and i was still swimming in it . because the head part is sooo large the hat falls well over u eyes and u cant see a thing . the floppiness is awkward . it does n't sit right on the brim . also the material felt cheap and the wholes of the woven straw a huge . its a piece of junk . on top of that the seller charged a restocking fee . i ended up paying more for shipping and restocking then the item was even worth . veryyyyyyyyyyyyy disappointed .
 Wanted a large hat for a cruise that I went on so thought this hat would be it . I was totally disappointed when I took it out of the box . It was HUGE ! Too HUGE for me . I was going to return it but figured it would cost too much to return . Suggest when purchasing a product such as this you have it in hand . 8 '' does not describe the actual size . Will wear it to cut the grass .

 I bought these because I have another pair of Hot Chilly 's winter leggings that are more like stretch fleece , and that 's what I thought these were . But they 're not -- they 're kind of like Spandex only thinner , and not warm at all . I live in Yosemite where it gets very cold at night and I went out in these like I did my others , but unlike the other leggings these left me very cold and sorry I spent $ 50 for them . Be sure you know what you 're buying . Thank goodness I have a couple of pairs of silk base layers to wear . I 'll stick to silk from now on !
 I was very excited about receiving this item , as I had scoped it out for a few years now looking for something a little spicy to wear to a costume party . I received it just a few days ago and thought it looked and fit as well as it did in the pictures . The fact that it loosens by the ties in both the front and back allows it to be put on easily.HOWEVER , I have tried the dress on twice now and while tying the string on the front the second time , the very top grommet fell out of the material . Of course , this does not instill a lot of faith in the other grommets maintaining their rightful place on the dress , so I 'm extremely disappointed . Especially since I likely wo n't be able to wear it to the party I purchased it for without fearing the material with rip without the grommet.Needless to say , if you plan on wearing the dress once or twice , it 's a decent purchase ... but do n't expect it to last much longer , or you 'll be disappointed like me . : -LRB-

 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .
 I 've used this brand since 2009 . They are not particularly long-lasting , but the utility makes up for it . Unfortunately , the quality has degraded . The last batch -LRB- three pair -RRB- I bought have a big problem
 Loved these things when I received them , but seems my washing machine was just too much for them . the zipper just fell apart . Have another pair and so far so good .
 I thought these would be the same as the fatigues sold by Captain Dave 's , but these are way bigger . I bought a Large , and these are about 3 '' wider and 3 '' longer than the other pants I bought . They have cinch straps on the sides to adjust the waist , but those do n't even stay tight . It has a nice material and I ca n't say how long lasting they are , but the size is just so off . I 'd give it 1 star , because I 'll probably never wear these , but at least now I have pants I can wear with my Halloween costume and not mind ruining .
 If you 're looking for trousers remotely stylish , these are not your pants . Block looking , machine made , rough fabric , and pretty darn ordinary.If you 're looking for a great pair of pants , I just bought `` Louis Raphael '' recently at Belks . I 've seen other Louis Raphael pants at other stores like Macy 's and they are incredible . Well made , interior linings , soft fabrics , much more stylish , and deep pockets . And cheaper than these .
 their 34 34 was not . They are more like a 33 33 . Liked the color but they are definately going back .
 It 's cut fine , but the material is scratchy and would probably grab a lot of lint . Perhaps , a really good wash and fabric softener would help , but I did n't want to risk it and make it non-returnable . I returned it right away .
 Bought 2 from Kohls . Did n't last 5 months ... I had better experience with Dockers , Ralph Lauren.I had some bad experience with Haggers . But this one is the worst of it 's kind . Something that you do n't expect from a brand like Lee.I am never going to buy Lee . The durability of the fabric is questionable !
 One pair of pants had an ink stain on the back of the leg . I did n't notice it until after I had put them through the wash so I could not return themVery disappointed !
 After three weeks of wearing the pants broke down . Not recommended to anyone , the material it 's very weak . thank you
 I always felt that Lee was a good manufacture of men 's pants . However after buying four or five pairs of these pants my opinion has greatly changed . I have found the material to disintegrate especially in the crotch area , in some cases in as little as two days of wear . This is not just the seams comming apart but the material itself pulling apart reducing it to threads . I did have one pair last almost a year but that was the exception . Another problem is that the size I ordered in one case was not the size stated . It indicated the correct size on the tag but the pants themselves were at least one size too small . I need a large size waist and the reason I tried over and over to make these pants work was they were reasonably priced and available in larger sizes . However I will not waste my money further . I have no problem with Amazon in general , I have always been happy with their service , it 's just that this particular product is nothing better than junk . I gave it a one star rating but if it were possible I would give it a negative star rating.In summary DO NOT buy these pants . Even if you have to spend more , in the long run you will probably be saving money . I found another brand of pants on Amazon that I am trying out and hopefully they will be fine .
 nice pants but are cut small for a 34 x 30 . i usually wear a 33 or 34 in the waist but these are exceptionally tight . order a size larger .
 These pants are very comfortable and water just rolls off of the surface . However , after only a month of use , I got a giant rip in the groin . It 's not even on the seem ! The seem itself is fraying though . All I do at work is wash dishes and drive around on deliveries . This should not have happened .
 Obvious too baggy for me.However , the material is good value for the money . . If you like this style , it is worth every penny .
 I bought these pants for my husband less than a month ago , and they have already shrunk TWO INCHES in length , its like I wasted my money . Do NOT buy these pants with your true inseam , they will be too small in a month !
 I ordered these for my husband for work , within two weeks the seams had split . Can not return , will have to sew and patch pants . Next time will spend the money on a higher quality pair . His Dockers have lasted years .
 I ordered black pants , but when they arrived , they were not a true black . More like a dark navy blue , but definitely not black when compared to other black pants I own . But I wore them anyway , until this week when they tore for no reason . They were definitely not too tight , but they just did n't seem to be as high quality as the last pair I had , and the fabric was quite thin . These used to be great pants for everyday business casual wear , but I guess it 's time to change brands .
 I have good experience with Lee casuals through Essential Apparell in the past but something has changed . Orderd the same style as I wear now but the fit is inconsistant ... not sure if I 'll stay with the ` tried and tested ' or look for a new label .
 You 'd think pants designed for big , less face it fat people with fluctuating waists would have more than a thin piece of thread holding a button at the waist to fasten them
 When I received the box from Amazon , pants was smelling like rotten fish , I returned them immediately .
 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .

 I bought these because I have another pair of Hot Chilly 's winter leggings that are more like stretch fleece , and that 's what I thought these were . But they 're not -- they 're kind of like Spandex only thinner , and not warm at all . I live in Yosemite where it gets very cold at night and I went out in these like I did my others , but unlike the other leggings these left me very cold and sorry I spent $ 50 for them . Be sure you know what you 're buying . Thank goodness I have a couple of pairs of silk base layers to wear . I 'll stick to silk from now on !
 This bandana is adorable , I must confess . I have a pampered pooch who has many bandanas , and the price on this one is quite average and certainly not unreasonable to pay for a small square of fabric.After I ordered it , however , I was shocked to see the standard shipping fee for this one small square of fabric was not $ 1 , not $ 2 , not even $ 3 - no ; the shipping for this item which can not possibly weigh more than an ounce or two , is $ 9.40 . Until somebody can explain to me the absurdity of this I have cancelled my order , and will not order anything from this company again .

 Years ago , I bought an adidas shirt , which I still own . I doubt that this new one will match the old one for wear resistance - after two washings , it already looks ready for replacement , and the color has faded somewhat .
 It is nice but the sizes are very wrong , I bought M and this is at least large and maybe XL . You should buy an smaller size . Unfortunately I removed the prize before noticing so I will give it someone bigger .
 Good model.Looks good.You have to buy two sizes too small.For example.Your L = S.But it is synthetic.Do not they feel.On the body pricked.There 's no cotton.In the heat can not be worn.this is not ClimaLite.I 'm sorry but it 's true.Real ClimaLite soft and gentle to the body - this shirt is not the same.Asked to write a review.I have written .
 I 'm usually between a small and medium , admittedly a slight frame - about 5 ' 11 '' 160 . I ordered the small in this shirt -LRB- two of them -RRB- and they are at least 2 sizes too large ; I 'm absolutely swimming in it . I 'm not sure who they thought they were sizing these for , but this is huge , even by standard fat-american sizing standards . I 'm returning both for something , likely by Nike , who has proper sizing on their apparel .
 I bough a white L size polo and looks like a XXL size polo !!!! now i have a really great gift to my fat uncle : -LRB-

 I ordered X Large . I expected the shirt to be very loose . This was n't a standard extra large . It 's more like a medium . I did not intend to purchase a form-fitting top . If the sizing on the shirts was accurate I would not have purchased the shirt in this size . Also , the color is a bit lighter than the picture .

 I placed a phone order for 4 pashmina scarves - I emphasized my expectation of a high quality pashmina consisting of 70 % cashmere and 30 % silk - what I received was `` pashmina wool '' that is scratchy and not wearable . I returned all items unused , in the original packaging with all tags intact - but a 20 % re-stocking charge was levied against my credit card , even though I asked about any additional charges when I placed the order ! No fun ...
 I knew I was taking a risk because this item was only $ 20.00 , but what I got was n't worth the shipping . It is simply an itchy piece of wool . It is not even pleasing to the eye .
 Weak product . I am very disappointed . Goes back to the old adage
 They sent me the wrong color scarf and then expected me to pay shipping when they sent me the correct color ! They also charged me a 20 % resocking fee even though I returned the items within the 2 week timeframe required to avoid the charge . Some of the scarfs are very nice - depends on the color . Was planning on buying more but bad customer service has put me off .
 It looks great out of the box , it feels great but after less than 3 weeks of wear it is falling apart !

 These were purchased for a trip , and although the fabric dried quickly as expected , we were very disappointed to find that the long length of the sleeves made it impossible to wear them with a short sleeved shirt ! This is just plain bad design .
 I purchased a couple of these t shirts for trip but had to return them . I have no doubt the material is excellent -LRB- I own some of their boxer briefs -RRB- when it comes to wicking moisture , but the fit was really weird . I 'm 6 ' with a slender build and found the sleeves to be really long while the length was way too short . There 's no way it would stay tucked in as an undershirt , so I returned them . Perhaps , a large would have been better lengthwise but the sleeves would have fit like a 3/4 sleeve baseball jersey . I like retro but not that much . . haha .
 I have a lot of Ex-Officio products - they make great travel/outdoor pants and shirts . I ordered two of these undershirts in medium and they fall short - literally and figuratively . I am a perfect medium size and 5 ' 10 '' tall . While the width around the torso is fine , the length is too short - it barely meets my belt line . I should have studied the catalog photo more closely , you can see for yourself , the proportion indicates a shorter length .
 I 'm not as pleased with these as I was pleased with the boxer briefs of the same brand . These are n't wearing as well , and they do n't seem as tough . After purchasing the underwear , I purchased more of them . I will not be purchasing more of the t-shirts .
 I love this company 's products , but the collar on this shirt frayed immediately . I do n't know if it 's because of contact with razor stubble or a beaded necklace , but it did n't hold up at all and immediately began fraying . That was a surprise given how wonderful their other products have been . Would n't purchase again .
 Great t-shirt except it balls up and has wear issues . The material is great . I could almost overlook the weird wear issues except it 's very expensive . I like plain black t-shirts and this one became my favorite for about two weeks . Then it started to look worn out around the waist area , balling up and looking generally unkempt . If it kept it 's condition I would buy about 30 of these , one for each day of the month . Maybe there is another black t that will get into ` exclusive black t ' territory .
 I wear a size large and ordered that size . I could barely get the shirt on . I wear a size 42 sport coat , so I 'm not a big person , but this was sad . It was also over priced for the quality . Seems like Ex Officio needs to start making quality gear again .
 The product description states , &#34; this tee is odor resistant &#34; . Not true . First time I wore it as an undershirt , I sweat a little bit and I could smell it through my dress shirt . It 's very comfortable though but not worth $ 31 .
 I am really disappointed in the Tee from ExOfficio . The boxers are amazing , comfortable and seem to be durable . The Tee shirt pilled around the neck after only 5 wearings . I have purchased 2 and am returning them to Amazon . For the cost , they should be better quality .
 Pros : - Absorbs sweat-Dries * kinda * fastCons : - Gets ruined easily ; backpack straps , anything velcro , they will tear at the material and ruin it REALLY quickly.-Though it absorbs sweat , that sweat SHOWS-Doesn ' t look good . Definitely not a shirt you can wear out . -LRB- IMHO -RRB- Definitely would n't buy a shirt with this material again .
 Miss-marked -LRB- small -RRB- Way off on waist . I bought this pair and a pair of linen shorts and the linen was true to size and this on was n't even close .
 AS SOON AS I PUT THESE ON I BEGAN DEVISING A PLAN TO RETURN THEM TO OUR LOCAL KMART FOR AN EXCHANGE ... TOOK TWO TRIES BUT I GOT THEM SWITCHED FOR A KMART BRAND THAT WAS MUCH BETTER ... AND YOU COULD SIT DOWN IN THEM .
 Im not sure if this review will link to the seller at all , but this seller is ridiculous . For one pair of pants , it took them 12 days to ship it and THEN another 12 days to arrive once they were marked as shipped , and I paid over 8 $ in shipping costs . bogus . The specific seller that i suggest avoiding is Silberman 's .
 I just purchased these double knee along with 2 regular pair of Dickie workpants . All three pair were 32 x 30 , but the pair of double knee were more like a 34 '' waist . So I am returning that pair and will try again . After reading all reviews , it seems as though the problem with fit isnt new to this company .
 Not even kidding ... brand new they are stiff as cardboard and extremely uncomfortable , especially when you walk or sit/crouch . Washing them a dozen times may help slightly , otherwise wear them everyday for a couple years without washing them.Unbelievable .
 Got my work pants and found they sent the completely wrong size . The slip with the correct size was sitting in the bag . Laziness is what I call it . Unacceptable .
 I recently purchased my first pair of these work PANTS . Size 30 x 32 . I have been happy with OTHER Dickies pants ... namely the workhorse jean with double knee . But if you are on your knees at all with these work PANTS , the lower seam of the double panel falls directly under your kneecap , making it almost impossible to kneel down on a hard surface without pain . Note that on their double knee JEANS , the reinforcement panel starts 10 inches above the bottom of the pant leg and works like it should . On these work PANTS , the panel starts 13 inches above the bottom of the pant leg . Why would they change it up like that ? I assumed when I bought them , the positioning of the knee reinforcement panel , within the same manufacturer , would be the same . When kneeling down , they ride up just enough to be too high for knee reinforcement . More like thigh reinforcement.When Dickies Customer Service was contacted for explanation , and refund , I got just the standard , non-personal form letter , not signed by anyone -LRB- but still saying to `` just call me '' if you have questions -RRB- They want me to pay shipping , handling , and insurance to send them back , and all they can do is send me another pair of the same style , size etc. . Very disappointed in this product and their customer service .
 Stated 100 % cotton , but actually is 10 % spandex . Other than that a nice bra , however if I ordered the same bra again I would order a larger cup size .
 Miss-marked -LRB- small -RRB- Way off on waist . I bought this pair and a pair of linen shorts and the linen was true to size and this on was n't even close .

 The item had two slices in the left front pocket.We returned it to Fogdog and requested a replacement be shipped and that we did not want a credit.when I next heard from them they said they were issuing a Credit . We sent a e-mail and again said we did not want a credit . The next thing we knew we received a e-mail saying that a credit had been issued . We are NOT HAPPY!Mary Maskill

 These bibs are a big waste of money!They are too difficult to get around my son 's neck , and he HATES it when i put them on him!Then , once it 's finally on , he is constantly getting his arms stuck under it and getting frustrated that he ca n't get his hands to his mouth.Also , the pocket part of the bib is always getting smooshed by the highchair tray so that no food can get into it , so it all ends up on his lap - what 's the point of a pocket bib then?They are easily cleanable and wipeable and do n't have to hang dry forever ... those are the only positive things I have to say about them.I recommend trying the Bumkins bibs instead , we love them!Grade
 We used to have kiddopotamus bib , which was from nice , soft rubber , this one is considerably stiffer , not so good . It is less than perfect but since the original ones are nowhere to be found , there is not much options ...
 I did not like this bib . The collar is hard to adjust around my baby 's neck without choking her ! It feels too hard and cuts into her neck . I regret buying it . I was looking for a bib that would n't get too messy or wet during feedings , something I could just wipe . But this bib was way too uncomfortable for my baby .
 I 've noticed that Jos A Bank Sweaters are always paired in such a way that there 's ambiguity in what exact pattern of sweater one is ordering . You like one pattern but when you order you get the other one on the ad that apparently does n't move as well business-wise . I got burned once , last year . They count on folks not sending the items back . They are deceptive advertisers , at least for sweaters ! Potential buyers beware ! This particular ad is a classic example .
 Why did this company wait three weeks to cancel my order , did they not realize that it would make it extremely difficult to find other items like this at this time of year . I purposely ordered these items six weeks ahead of time so as to ensure I would have them . Now three weeks later , I am back at square one . I wish when orders are cancelled they had to come up with a plausible reason why they canceled
 These bibs are too hard and difficult to store . I found the Dex bibs softer on baby 's neck and easy to store !
 These bibs are a big waste of money!They are too difficult to get around my son 's neck , and he HATES it when i put them on him!Then , once it 's finally on , he is constantly getting his arms stuck under it and getting frustrated that he ca n't get his hands to his mouth.Also , the pocket part of the bib is always getting smooshed by the highchair tray so that no food can get into it , so it all ends up on his lap - what 's the point of a pocket bib then?They are easily cleanable and wipeable and do n't have to hang dry forever ... those are the only positive things I have to say about them.I recommend trying the Bumkins bibs instead , we love them!Grade
 Miss-marked -LRB- small -RRB- Way off on waist . I bought this pair and a pair of linen shorts and the linen was true to size and this on was n't even close .
 This jacket looks good from afar but the quality isnt all that great . The zipper broke on mine within 2 days of wearing and there are loose strings coming out all over . The sizing is very european and 3x really means 2x . I wont buy Kappa again Im goin back to addidas and Nike they are much better quality

 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .
 Not very durable . Looked good when it arrived but rapidly became sloppy looking . The texture and shape seemed to age after a few wearings .
 I ca n't recommend ordering ties on line -- or at least , from this vendor . Tie was not Navy -- it was ROYAL blue . Plus , the stitching started falling apart after 2 uses .
 To be honest , this mask is cheap looking , not very pliable , and not very realistic . When we got it out of the box , it was deformed and it was virtually impossible to see out of the little slits designed for your eyes . We have not been able to re-shape it to normal , and we have found it pretty much useless .

 I would like to order these for my daughter but the product description does not say how many briefs per package . Please update the description to include quantity . If the quantity is reasonable for this price I will order them .
 My husband has worn L and XL . I purchased a pair of these in the XL but he said they were snug . They looked nice but they obviously run small and since they do n't have an XXL , I will have to keep looking . Very disappointed .
 they have very light colors , not bright like the picture , and it shows as if they are not original , i didnt like them i didnt even put them on my bag
 I thought this night gown looked cute from looking at the picture advertisement . . but when I received it I was sorely disappointed ... The gown is made of a very thin , cheap fabric ... the design on the collar is cheap looking ... even though in the picture , everything looks fine ... I would be afraid of the thing falling apart if I washed it ... I 'm positive it would look raggedy by next summer if in fact you still had kept it.I think it 's worth $ 2-3 .00 ... not any more ... something you 'd find at the 99 cent store ... This does not even deserve the one star that is printed here ... but the computer wo n't allow me to do erase the one star.It almost has a seersucker appearance in the picture , but it is n't ... do n't be fooled ... you can buy something better at a thrift store for ALOT less money!The only thing good about my experience was that this company was nice enough to accept this return and refund my credit card ... BUT ... My shipping on the other hand ladies was NOT refundable ! I repeat NOT refundable!Do you have $ 8.00 -LRB- approx -RRB- to throw away ? I do n't ... but that is what happened to me ... at least I got my $ 21.95 refunded -LRB- approx -RRB- . TIP : If you are looking for a quality gown ... then look up `` Shadowline '' gowns/sleepware on the internet or on ebay ...
 I was happy at the appearance of the bag , but was extremely disappointed in the smell of the backpack . I received it around Christmas time and have had it hanging outside since hoping to air out the smell . It still smells making it unable to use .
 I received the back pack but returned it . I have not yet received a refund or any correspondence from the company .
 Too dark for light toast . I was expecting something just a bit darker than nude . Unfortunately had to return . I will look at Capizio .

 While you might like this bag as a shoulder bag , the adjustable straps do not work well as a backpack .
 I bought bag for my son , but he did n't like it . When I called customer service , I was told that I must give order number to return . There was not a conventional invoice in package . So I was told to look for invoice number on mailing label . I could not find it . Perhaps UPS covered it with their label . So I wrote to website and computer told me it did not exist . Therefore , I can not return item . I 'll save it as present for someone else .
 The dress is made as the pattern shows but the coloring of the dress is much darker a green than is shown on viewing the item on line . It is a sort of muddy green . A brighter green much as was shown on the screen view would have been much better . Please ship the product you see pictured on the screen , same color and shape .
 I bought it for a friends sweet sixteen and it was awful . it just did not fit at all . it was way tooo small . also it took about a month + for them to refund the money . bad experiance !!
 I really buy this backpack with a certain risk because I read the reviews , i received it last week , and it 's nice , soft ; but i used it yesterday and in the part of the back where the snaps are , something coming off , I find that to be new this should not happen ! , I 'm not very happy with this = -LRB- .
 I can not recommend this item . When I tried to close the bag for the first time , the lock fell . Very bad quality ...
 I 'm very disappointed with this backpack . It 's too small and cheap looking for women with child . May be it 's good for teens . It would be useful to make other photo to realize size.I have backpack from Le Donne and it 's much better , leather is thick but soft.And this one is rough , shiny like PVC and smell awfully . I wish I could return it .
 The first disappointment was the look of the leather . It 's rough and rugged and looks like it 's more for a man . I returned it because the snap closure kept coming off and once spilled my contents at the airport!One good thing is the customer service . As soon as I emailed them that I wanted to return it , they replied with instructions .
 The front snap fell apart at once and then the bad of course would n't stay closed or hang properly . It is also does n't fit very well .
 I would NEVER use this bag , is n't attractive and so poorly made . Totally flimsy is my best description ; crap oversized buckle on the front opens a top flap ... this flap is flimsy even when secured by the buckle . Straps are thin and do n't zip together to allow the option to use this as a sling bag over the shoulder.There 's a zipper on the back , very ridiculous because it also opens the backpack main compartment ... this feature makes this bag even less secure for small items to fall out.The only good features is the two small zipper pockets on the front for keys and cell . But , I have nice backpacks that have total organizing features . This bag just scores ZERO with me ; not attractive nor has the features I depend on.I offered to give it to several friends whom declined , I bought this at Christmas 2010 and could n't give it away . Thankfully , this severe disappointment does n't happen to often . I 'm not fond of purses , my backpack is very important to me . I 'm still looking for a lovely new BROWN backpack .
 Disappointed in how flimsy the apron is . I ended up using it for a pattern to make a much nicer apron . Nice pattern , but kind of expensive if that is all to use it for .
 My husband has worn L and XL . I purchased a pair of these in the XL but he said they were snug . They looked nice but they obviously run small and since they do n't have an XXL , I will have to keep looking . Very disappointed .
 the miss a kit is lousy quality . i begged for it for about 6 months and my mom got it for me for Christmas and it broke within 1 day . me and my mom agree that it is lousy quality and if you are looking for a sturdy knife i would recommend Victorinox Classic Little Pocketknife Toolbox . if it is for a girl they do come in pink but if you do not like that knife the original swiss army knife is a great choice . both knives are better quality than the miss a kit . i really loved the idea and tools but the quality left much to be desired .

 I felt very bad when I received my order , because buying a number 2 and when I get is a tiny baby . Amazon SPECIFICATIONS no age and it is wrong . I am a disappointed customer .
 Sunglass in picture are original not the replica you get . The replicas are cheap . Not even worth the $ 10 plus shipping I paid . They look of the same quality as those sunglasses sold in gas stations .
 The look and the fit of this item is good but the glass is bad . When I look at the ground with the glass on , the ground looks uneven and closer to me . I would n't recomment this even though it is cheap .
 I got these soon after the last movie came out , because I thought it would be funny to walk around like Neo.The frame was seperated from the lens just by me pushing the glasses back up my nose . Not to mention the aluminum frame was about as thin as , well , a soda pop can.I know they are only around $ 10 , but still , save your money .
 I ordered this holster bag expecting it to be the same quality as my Botkier trigger bag . It lacked some major details . It should have had a magnetic closure on the two main outside compartments . The side pockets also should have had a better closure . The flaps would not stay closed ! The blue color is beautiful and the look of it is nice . It 's just not worth the money , so I returned it .
 Well , I would like to buy this but this page is very confusing . It lists 11.00 each and then it states SALE price of 7.50 each . Yet , when I place the items in my cart ... the sale price does not appear . Very confusing to say the least.Bali is a very good name and I am sure I will be pleased BUT before I purchase . . I want to know the TRUE COST !
 I purchased 5 pairs of Bali Women 's Light Control Tummy Panel Briefs on September 4 , 2010 . I sent them back for a return on September 20 , 2010 . In the meantime I ordered a different size of the same panel briefs -LRB- 5 pairs . -RRB- I waited and waited for the refund . Finally , I contacted the Espot company , and they were very rude concerning my refund . There was a lot of correspondence that had to go back and forth and time wasted . Today , February 3 , they have credited my refund with Amazon . Even though I love the Bali products I will never deal with Espot Apparel again .
 To make these cheap underware fit , I had to stretch out the waste band until I heard all the threads breaking . I think it will only take a few washings before these crappers are too small to wear . You should order 1 size larger than you actually wear .
 1st , the cups were a bit small , & I know I gave the right size . Then , the strap broke ! It 's pretty , & they had my size , which is a small miracle in itself , but I would n't buy this again !
 This bra is not true to size it is smaller than the 34 G bra I was replacing . The faberic is very ichy and uncomfortable . A very disapointing purchase .
 I think the fit of the bra is great , but I can only wear it briefly because it is so uncomfortable . The fabric is stiff and itchy and the metal adjustments in the front poke me on both sides . I have washed it several times to try and soften the fabric ; did n't work . I would love to be able to wear it because it give such good support and shape , but I just ca n't .
 The size is wrong . I ordered my regular size and it 's much too small . Am returning for a larger . We 'll see .
 I wore these socks once and they had a hole in the toe when I removed them .
 I have the same problem some others have mentioned . These socks run way too easily . Believe it or not , my regular knee-high nylons are more durable that these socks have been . I had gold toe trouser socks in the past and specifically sought these out to replace my last bunch . Guess I 'll be looking around for a different new brand , these were definitely not worth the money .
 If you think that spending nearly $ 50 for a costume slip is worth it , this may be OK . for you . When we unpacked and shook out the slip , we thought it was n't even the same slip , but zooming in , I can see that it is , in fact , the same - one can see the edge of the bustier through the fabric of the slip . I think perhaps it is the fact that the image is cut out and pasted on a white background that makes it look more opaque.Basically , there is one layer of nylon , with a draw-string - not even an elastic waistband , and at the hip ONE layer of tulle netting , each tier gathered into the one above . It would not support much weight in a skirt over it - anything more than a filmy fabric will crush it down . To hold a classic poodle skirt shape , one would need several of these , which could be built for about two bucks and an hour 's work . Only those in a great hurry or no ability to sew at all will find this worth while.This is costume , not clothing underpinings .
 I have to agree with the other buyer that was disappointed . First I would like you to change the title of this ad . I bought this skirt to go under a vintage poodle skirt for a photo shoot that is a only a couple of days away . The tulle is not even going to stand up under the felt . The only thing poodle about this slip is the color `` poodle pink '' as the card reads.To say I am highly disappointed is an understatement .
 ok What the hell ... i just spent 70 on a pair of sunglasses that do n't fit !!! unless you have the same size head as a baby then these sunglasses are going to be to small >> >> they only look cool >

 I bought this after I had a baby because I 'd lost the weight , but wanted something to flatten the looser skin around my lower stomach . This fits me properly but the top squeezes me in a very unflattering way . Eh , oh well . Maybe it 's intended for something else . FYI , I 'm about 5 ' 5 '' and 120 pounds .
 I have no issue with the brief as I have ordered them before directly from this same source however the briefs come in a package of 2 which is what I was expecting . The cost was a few dollars more than when I ordered them directly and not through Amazon . My complaint is that the company sent me only one brief that had been removed from the Bali package of two so I ended up paying more than double for one brief . I called the company and customer service agreed that one package containing 2 briefs should have been sent . The Bali briefs are no longer available . I returned the brief and got a refund however my shipping cost of $ 5.99 was not refunded . Needless to say I am not happy with this company that sells products through Amazon .

 This item does not cost $ 195.00 new it cost $ 168.00 from Ardyss distributors . Do n't get your money taken we are in a recession find a distributor in your area .
 The body magic costs a small fortune for all the claims Ardyss makes but in actual fact the product does not really survive longer than about 30 continuous use . Mine fell apart -LRB- the boning came out -RRB- just over a month after I purchased it -LRB- not from Amamzon seller -RRB- . I called the Ardyss freefone line and they told me that they do not refund after 30 days . Considering the average cost is in excess o 80 , I can help but feel like I have been fleeced . I spent 250 purchasing for myslef and gifting others . It is a hell of a lot of money to spend only to be told that they will not honour responsibility for what looks like a manufacturing fault . What does anyone else think ?
 I am not happy with this cheesy so called ardyss body magic ! I have the real one and not sure what this is . It is flimsy and light weight . I am not happy at all . What a waste of 150.00 dollars . Can I get a refund or half back ?
 The order was never received . I have made several attempts to contact this company , to no avail . The voice mails are all in Spanish and when you press a number and leave a message , there is never a response to your call . I have written Amazon.com several times and I still havent received my garment . I have order serveral items from Amazon.com and have never ever had a problem . I have found there services to be swift and correct . However , this experience with the Ardyss garment has left me very frustrated . My suggestion is that Amazon not blemish there reputation by continuing to allow Ardyss to sell on their network . I am so sorry that I had to go through this experience . Wondering if my card information is safe , etc has been so disconcerting . The not being responded to was pretty bad . It like they 're saying , `` We have your money , now go away . '' That 's right , they have my credit card information and the item I paid for . I have nothing , not even a return phone call . You are right , it 's magic , I never saw it .
 I placed an order for this product on April 15th , it was supposed to be delivered by April 24th . I did not receive the merchandise so i contacted the seller on May 1st asking for a tracking number so i may track the package since i had not received the merchandise . Well , i never got any feed back from the seller . On May 7th still no feedback from the seller and no merchandise , so i emailed them asking to cancel my order and refund my money . I also called Amazon customer service and they were very helpful and apologized for the problem . The representative started the claim process to insure my funds would be refunded . Although my experience with this seller was terrible i would still recommend purchasing goods from Amazon they back their customers 100 % .
 We ordered the Body Magic -LRB- by Ardyss -RRB- for my wife via Amazon . The product was shipped from the distributor Star Enterprise of Hurst , TX . Paypal was the method of payment . My wife was VERY disappointed with the Body Magic ; the sizing was the primary problem . It took a good deal of effort to contact Star Enterprise via PayPal . When we finally reached Star we were informed that there is a no return policy on this product -LRB- our fault for not reading carefully -RRB- . We were further informed that we could not exchange this item as we were over the seven day exchange period -LRB- the product was delivered while we were on vacation -RRB- . Our suggestion is that , if you insist on purchasing the Body Magic , do so at a retail store where you can try it on and make a decision . DO NOT PURCHASE via Star Enterprise as they are difficult to contact and not very helpful when attempting to resolve an issue . I would also recommend that you use a credit card and NOT use PayPal -LRB- as you can stop payment with the credit card -RRB- . This entire experience has been unpleasant ; please benefit from our experience !

 This case -LRB- more or less -LSB- less -RSB- as pictured -RRB- is available ONLY in the original black version . I ordered the metallic black thru amazon , and the third party seller -LRB- Best Price Center -RRB- did their best to correct the situation when I discovered the case was inferior , including sending a replacement case -- which unfortunately , was still not as advertised . The case is of cheap quality and not very useful at all . There is only one restraining strap -LRB- pictured is two -RRB- in the original black and not present at all in the metallic black -LRB- the one I ordered -RRB- . Further , the accessory compartment -LRB- also pictured -RRB- is totally missing unless you order the original black . The screen covers are excellent , and are the only redeeming item in this order . Your best bet is to order the DS Lite Travel Kit from Gamestop -LRB- a really good sturdy padded case for your DS Lite with an ample completely separate padded accessory compartment -RRB- and the screen protectors separately . This item as pictured is a big waste of money . Cheap . Poor Quality . Do n't get suckered in like I did !! This is no bargain !
 The case for this is to small you will not be able to have games inside with the DS , I can not zip mine if I have a game in the case also . . DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY go for a better and bigger one ...

 Bought this for a Marge Simpson costume and the thing bombed . I was unable to poof out the wig and it looked dented on my head . Do n't waste your money . Ended up turning the dress into a fairy costume .

 1st , the cups were a bit small , & I know I gave the right size . Then , the strap broke ! It 's pretty , & they had my size , which is a small miracle in itself , but I would n't buy this again !
 This bra is not true to size it is smaller than the 34 G bra I was replacing . The faberic is very ichy and uncomfortable . A very disapointing purchase .
 I think the fit of the bra is great , but I can only wear it briefly because it is so uncomfortable . The fabric is stiff and itchy and the metal adjustments in the front poke me on both sides . I have washed it several times to try and soften the fabric ; did n't work . I would love to be able to wear it because it give such good support and shape , but I just ca n't .
 The size is wrong . I ordered my regular size and it 's much too small . Am returning for a larger . We 'll see .

 I liked those sunglasses until the temple tips started to fall apart , this is some sort of problem with the plastic they used . I have seen other reviews complaing about the same defect.Tried to call for warranty service sending e-mails and got no answer at all.This is my second Ray-ban sunglass that has manufacturing problems . The other one had issues on the lenses.Will never purchase from them again !!!
 The helmet is too big even for my husband and the body suit is small . Our son was not comfortable in it really either . It is cute though .
 My 2 yr old is 34 lbs , 37 '' and this costume does n't fit without some alterations . The opening on the bottom of the costume is so small , I could n't pull it down around my son 's shoulders and hips when slipping it over his head . I had to slice the back open and re-fasten with extended velcro tabs . The hat is gigantic , but I 'll just wear it when we go trick or treating . Overall , I feel like I overspent for this costume and I wish returns were easier .
 We got this for my son for Halloween this year . My son is almost 2 , about 24lb and it fit him pretty well except for the helmet . The helmet was too big for even me and I 'm a 200 + lb adult male . Unfortunately there was a huge problem with the way this outfit was designed around the neck . There 's a thin very sharp piece of plastic that goes around the entire neck that the foam is supposed to protect your child from but it does a pathetic job . My son fell once while wearing the outfit and the sharp plastic above the eyeball cut up his neck and underneath his little chin . After putting some bandages under his chin we had to put tape all over sharp plastic edge before we could continue trick or treating . It 's really a cute outfit and we got some great pictures but it 's stupidly designed and dangerous right out of the box for kids to wear .
 This costume is cheaply made and cheaply packaged . The fabric covered foam of the main body is thin and the eye is inserted through slits , not attached . The helmet arrived smashed in and could not be made right by pushing the dented in sections out ... it was permanently dented . It would be a real question as to whether the costume would hold up for even one evening of play . It would be a bad deal at $ 5 , and at $ 28 it is a huge ripoff . I returned this item .
 I read the reviews for this costume and even though a lot were negative , i purchased it anyway ignoring the comments . This was a terrible purchase . For one the hat is the size of my adult head and my son could n't even wear it with the costume . This costume is said to fit up to a size 7 i think it said . My son is a size 3T-4T and it was hard getting it on it was so small . The fabric is the thinnest crapiest material ever and with little effort i could rip it right in half if i wanted . The eye on the costume is not attached . . it merely slips into little slots . . since it kept stabbing my son in the neck when he would sit , he was able to pull it off with no effort and would n't allow it back on . So he walked around without the eye or hat . Next time i will just pay for a sturdy costume from a thrift store for $ 8 and not feel so disappointed .
 I , ve worn these for years and need to order more . They wear better than any others I , ve puchased and will order more .
 Inferior quality . It does not run true to size . The size 6 I ordered was quite huge . I feel like I wasted my money . I do not recommend it .
 Very disappointed with the fit , fabric , and overall quality of this panties . It tends to ride up in the back and the material is so thin it will not last long . The lace elastic on the upper part of the underwear folds back instead of holding your stomach in . Very disappointed !!
 I like pretty , lacy panties . These would be great but please note , Hi-cut means HI-CUT . Do not wear these with regular or low rise pants . Recommended for dresses . They lose their shape easily . Hand wash only.Reasonably priced , quality is ok , but not the sexiest ... unless you like half of your stomach to be covered by your panty .
 The waistline is too high for me . I ordered according to the size chart but it just seems too big . The fabric is ok and is washable . I 'll try a low-rise next time .
 I have bought many Bali items and loved the quality , fit , color , etc. , but not these . They run small and are tissue paper thin . Make sure you read the return policy . At the very end they state no returns/exchanges on initmate apparel .
 They cancelled my order after 5 days . This happened after Jos A Bank confirmed everything was in stock and they were processing my order . Shame on you Jos A Bank.You ca n't bank on them . Just bang ... bang .
 I bought a brand new Propper M65 OD field jacket on line . After approx 20 wearings -LRB- I only wear it in my car to work and back ; that 's all . I do n't wear it at work ; I 'm an office worker -RRB- , the bottom snap broke . After approx five more wearings , the mext-to-the-bottom snap broke . I contacted Propper , but they said tough s *** . Propper does n't stand behind their product , is the bottom line . Just wanted everyone to know .
 I bought this dress for my daughter 's 8th birthday party . We were doing a costume theme . The picture of the dress gives you the impression that you are getting a great dress & floppy hat . The dress is made out of transparent netting so you can see straight through to the plastic cheap shower curtain-ish hoop skirt . The hat is a floppy mess . It is not a real hat , that would have been fine if the crown fit like it did in the picture . There was no depth on the bonnet so the hat was useless.My daughter with out any prompting was so disappointed . She said `` why did the company lie and send me this dress ? It is nothing like the picture and the color is a different green '' -LRB- much brighter -RRB- , she said . I packed up the dress and still need to mail it back for a refund . My daughter decided to make her own costume using one of my dresses . I would never buy on line with this company again . I will just go in person to the costume shops .
 This outfit looks great but is designed for children smaller than 48 '' tall . My daughter is 54 '' tall and it looks like a tea-length belle on her . The fabric is all but see through and the layers are horribly wrinkled . I am returning it for something else ... . Not what I ordered .
 Cute outfit but cheaply made . Hat ripped the first time my daughter put it on .
 Bought for daughter for Halloween and she refused to wear it because it was uncomfortable and it made plastic sounds when she walked . Very poorly made , disappointing .
 Looking at the photo online , this costume looks beautiful . The costume you receive is made of such cheap , sheer material - it is actually see-thru ! It runs very small , my daughter is a petite 8 year old and this Med barely fit . If your daughter is average , tall or plus for 8 yrs old , this would NOT fit . The skirt is basically sheer netting that is not sewn all the way down and kept together only with the ribbon trim , over a crinkly , plastic hoop skirt . The bonnet is also sized small and does not look anything at all like the photo . My daughter had her heart set on keeping this costume , so I went to a fabric store and spent $ $ $ on a bolt of tulle to attach more layers to the skirting , ribbon trims and added some flowers , feathers and ribbons to the bonnet . After all that work , it did look cute and she received many compliments . Just do n't expect it to come out of the package looking like the picture - also bought this in the adult size for myself so we could match and it was even worse , so I returned that one .
 This costume was not true to size . I ordered a 12-14 and it was more like a 8-10 . Inexpensively made . Plastic inner hoop liner ... . Not bad for something quick . I did n't expect the quality to be there . Does the job .
 I bought this dress for a program my daughter was having at school . It was cute and served the purpose but was not put together well . The seams were open where the material around hoops met , only tacked at ends to hold together . The shaw around the top of hat was not tacked and flipped from front to back so I had to tack it to the front myself . Before the program started my daughter stepped on the bottom of her dress once and the bottom border of the dress ripped . I had to sew it back on that night so she could wear it again for the program the following day .
 Out of the package it was so wrinkled . It looked a wadded up shopping sack . Then the dress tore 2 hours into the ight .
 This is a TERRIBLE costume . The underneath solid white material looks and sounds like straight up PLASTIC , not even polyester . It rustles funny , just like a bunch of plastic bags would . The tulle overlay is cheaply made too and tears VERY easily . The big bows on front are funny looking . I am returning this immediately I am so disatisfied with it .
 This costume is just a tragedy . The `` tulle '' is see-through , it is just kind of cheap netting material and arrived shredded in some places - so it ca n't even make it out of the warehouse ?? and the bottom layer is not long enough to cover the cheap plastic underdress . It is all see-through . There are no layers and layers floating delicately as one would expect from the picture . Just one layer of cheap `` tulle '' and one layer of cheap plastic . The plastic is cheaper than the cheapest shower curtain liner you buy at the dollar stores . This dress probably cost three dollars to make and they are charging outrageous prices for it . I wanted to love it , and I do love the idea of it . Margaret Mitchell is one of my favorite authoresses and GWTW is one of my all-time favorite books/movies . But , I HATE this costume . It not only disappointed me , it disappointed my daughter without me saying anything . She came out of her bedroom after running in so excitedly to try it on . She had quite a change in demeanor after coming back out . I am going to attempt to return this , but I suspect it will end up being more trouble than it is worth . Lesson learned
 The merchandise was just fine but it took weeks to receive it . Not like Amazon !!
 i ordered a small one , i am skinny , and it showed my nipples , it wasnt really good to me , if you 're skinny dont purchase this
 These wings are less white and more fleshy pink with purple highlights . I bought them with the matching tail looking for costume parts to go with a silver dragon mask , and they 're not the right color at all . Very disappointing!The wings are only textured on one side -LRB- the front -RRB- with the other side being mostly smooth . It 's not noticeable from a distance , but once you 're up close , it 's not a great effect.The rubbery texture is durable , and looks like it would last quite a long time . I 've used them for two halloweens -LRB- without the non-matching mask -RRB- and they hold up well to abuse . The harness that holds them to your back consists of two velcro straps , and it is quite sturdy . I would recommend hiding the harness by cutting two wing-holes in an old jacket or something for a better effect.Now to find some white dragon wings that actually match my mask . Maybe I 'll cut these wings apart and use the sturdy wire frame inside the rubber to build something better .
 ok so let me start out , i was sopposed to get a white one . i got a cream color one with stains all over it
 I liked the hat when it first came , looked very good and fit well -LRB- I wear my beanie jutting out at the back -RRB- . But it being white it got a bit dirty , so I threw it in the washwhen it came out it had shrunk to about 1/3 of the original size
 I felt like I wasted my money buying this product . The quality is so inferior , I wonder if it would survive a washing . I do not recommend it .
 I am so disappointed in these undies . I wore them twice and threw them away . I was hoping to find a style to replace the discontinued Olga French-cut briefs -LRB- style # 23913 -RRB- , which were full-cut briefs but with an attractive lace band at the waist and slightly raised leg holes in front . I wanted undies that would n't ride up but would still look attractive on my middle-aged body . I 'm nearly 60 , and &#34; hipster &#34; styles now seem to accentuate any paunch . I 'm not overweight , but I 'm not some svelte little chickie anymore either ; still , I do n't want to look dorky . These undies were so unattractive , though , I did n't want my husband to see me in them ; I looked like sausage in casing . The legs are cut really low , which I assumed would mean that they would n't ride up . Unfortunately , the right side rode up a bit anyway . Other reviewers apparently had better luck with these than I did , but I 'm going back to the drawing board .
 The panty is nicely made . The elastic at the leg is comfortable , and the lace at the waist is pretty and soft . But the waist is so tight and uncomfortable ! I own other Bali panties in the exact same size as the `` Skamp Brief '' -LRB- who makes up lingerie names ?!? -RRB- and the waist is more than an inch bigger . I 'm glad I bought only the one pair -- I wo n't be wearing this item .
 I have purchased this product for at least 20 years , and the quality of the fabric has declined terribly ! Very thin and transparent compared with days gone by . Very discouraging .
 This product must have been an older model that is being passed off as the newer one . The whole reason I loved these was because of the slip grip no ride up feature on the panty and it was replaced on the sent item with old school elastic that does n't quite measure up . Very unhappy with this purchase . : -LRB-
 All 6 pairs were itchy enough to be distracting during a run.On the bright side , I did n't have any trouble with the seams.I tossed these on the top shelf of my closet and bought a 6-pack of balega running socks , which are great .
 In spite of what the description says , these socks are cosmetic seconds . They are clearly marked as such . They have defects . YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED !
 These are very light weight socks , but they are intended for biking . For running , the toe seam is too thick for comfort and will chafe right at the knuckle behind your toe nail . They are okay for walking , or gym work , but not for any exercise that involves foot strikes . Despite the light weight , they are no less hot after exertion , and there is no wicking effect as there is in higher quality running sock .
 I 've been carrying this for almost a month now . and I do n't like it . If you do n't have books in this , then it 's like UN-STRUCTURED . the top does n't close well at all . and it 's just ALL FLOPPY . and when I say `` books '' you better have some SMALL BOOKS . regular books are n't gon na fit b/c it 's a small/med purse like thing.I DO N'T recommend . Look else where for something that will hold up .
 I ordered this bag April 2nd , and waited patiently for it to come . I had read the reviews and did n't particularly care if it came out small or not , I really wanted a military styled bag ... this bag never came . When I emailed the man in charge , he told me that he had one left in stock and that he personally held the bag for me and brought it down to the post office . I thought `` Fine , I 'll wait again . '' I waited five days past the email and asked again where the bag was , and he basically told me that he had never sent the bag because he did n't actually have any in stock . I was too cowardly to call him on his first lie , and then he stated that he had emailed me asking if I would wait or want to be refunded the money . I never got this email until it was added on to his second correspondence , so that again , led me to believe he had lied . To top it all off , I felt that this elusive `` Paul '' was snippy during our emails . I do not suggest buying this bag , you will just get ripped off from your shipping and handling money when they have never shipped the item in the first place ...
 This belt is terrible . It started to fray almost immediately and you can feel the lack of quality as soon as you touch it . This belt appears several times on Amazon as separate items , but I believe they are all the same . Unless you absolutely need a belt and have no other options , I would not recommend this . If you 're looking for a belt to put a buckle on , find another one .
 * FALSE ADVERTISING ** FALSE ADVERTISING ** FALSE ADVERTISING * The title says it all . These belts are NOT LEATHER , they are cheap man made material .
 DO NOT buy this item!The yellow is not true to the image , it arrived as a dark yellow almost mustard color rather than the bright sunshine yellow in the photo . Also , I ordered XL based on sizes listed , and the belt was probably 3 holes too big . Luckily only needed this for a halloween costume , however it was n't great because it was the only thing that was the wrong yellow ! Also , the photo shows it yellow on both sides , mine is only yellow on one side , and you can tell the paint is very cheap and started cracking after just one night of wearing it !
 I ordered this belt to go with a batman buckle I had ordered , but never received it . I wanted to surprise my grandson with the complete set and was unable to do so .
 Give me a break , Real leather ???? from what ? this is not real leather and should not be sold as real . It is real something that I would never buy again and wish I could send back .
 I purchased this belt in brown and black . While the brown belt was fine , I tried on the black belt with a pair of khaki pants . The black dye from the belt bled onto my pants and is still there after several washes . I did not expect the belts to be of high quality leather -LRB- based on the price -RRB- , but I did expect to be able to wear the belt with any pair -LRB- and color -RRB- of pants without leaving a black ring around the waist of my pants . You definitely get what you pay for . Oh ... and it took 2 full weeks for the belts to arrive . I received a shipment email , no tracking for the package was ever available , and my emails to the seller went unanswered until after I received the belts -LRB- 2 days after the estimated delivery date . -RRB- Not satisfactory !
 Belt is nice , but it does n't come with a buckle -LRB- of any kind . -RRB- Now we have to find a buckle to fit it . Lame !
 This shirt size although listed as a LARGE , was most definitely not . I buy large t-shirts all the time and this was very small even though the tag on the shirt stated it was a large .
 GREAT NAME , HORRIBLE CRAFTMANSHIP.AFTER THE FIRST WASH , ALL THE INSIDE SEAMS CAME APART.I FOLLOWED THE WASHING DIRECTIONS ON THE TAG , HOWEVER IT SHOWS THAT THEY SURE DONT KNOW HOW TO MAKE THEM LIKE THEY USED TO .
 order placed 7/4/07 -- needed the dress on 8/4/07 -- it arrived 8/7/07 -- and this was after i contacted the seller to see where it was -- the item was not even avail for tracking till end of july when i found out it did n't get to a trackable location till 7/16 and then nothing till 8/2 when it showed up in new york -- then , i did n't even get the item i ordered -- i ordered a long dress and the item description even says it is a dress -- what i got was a tunic top with a pair of pants and there is no elastic or drawstring in the pants !! what a rip off !! i 'm not sending it back cause i have too much invested already and i do n't want to pay shipping to india !! but i will never use this seller again !! i wish i could have done this review with zero stars !!

 their were ok exept the Xsmall was still to big . and they shrink once you put them in the dryer .
 No idea why what I received is different than the other reviewers , but the bib I got looked like it was for a baby and DID not even go to my 2 yr old 's waist let alone his knees . In fact , the neck closure was even too small for him . He is a normal sized 2 yr old . I was VERY upset when I opened it . It was n't worth returning so I just gave it to my sister who is having a baby soon but I would not recommend buying this item from them . I believe they sent me the wrong bib , the artwork was the same it was just not the right size .
 Product arrived quickly . These were tights for my grand daughter for Easter . We opened the package on Easter morning and went to put the tights on . Unfortunately there was a hole in the crotch . She had to wear them anyway and throughout the day the hole got bigger . I spent much more on these tights hoping they would be long lasting . What a waste of money !

 the design is good but the material the clips are attached to are very stiff . It digs into the skin . It 's not even tight and it is bothersome . I would not order a second one .
 The bra is relatively comfortable -LRB- for an underwire bra -RRB- , and seems to be well made . However , unlike in the photo , the cups created an unnatural pointy shape . I know my correct size ... Either these bras are sized wrong or they 're just oddly shaped .
 I was hoping to find a comfortable bra and this one looked interesting but the clasp design is very stiff and uncomfortable under the bust . The idea is good , the product itself needs some design/fabric improvement .
 I gave me weird pointy boobs and pulled them far apart . I prefer a round cup and a little closer together .

 I am disappointed to find this item being offered as Humorous - real bestial behavior actually occurs and injures goats & sheep , often fatally . I recommend this item be discontinued and destroyed , written off as a BAD idea .

 I normally really like Hue tights . But these smell terrible . They smell like a cross between a chemical plant and some mildew or mold . I 'm not even going to put them on-they 're going straight to the trash . Do not buy these if you have functioning olfactory bulbs .
 These look like your grandmother 's old , dark nylons from 100 years ago . I was looking for a natural , darker than nude color .
 The fit and color is okay , but tights should be thick and non-snagging . These are more like pantyhose . They 're not thick , not warm and not durable as they snagged the first time I wore them .
 I am not sure that this is an original HUE product . The tights did not have a tag and it looked like were not in the original package .
 The tights are great and well priced ... however , unless you want to wear something that smells like a chemical plant on your legs do not buy . I read one other review -LRB- out of the 15-some that are posted -RRB- that said the same thing and would n't you know . I opened the package , noticed the smell and after 3 washes I still can not get tights to a point where I would wear them . They are going in the trash . Too bad .
 1st , the cups were a bit small , & I know I gave the right size . Then , the strap broke ! It 's pretty , & they had my size , which is a small miracle in itself , but I would n't buy this again !
 This bra is not true to size it is smaller than the 34 G bra I was replacing . The faberic is very ichy and uncomfortable . A very disapointing purchase .
 I think the fit of the bra is great , but I can only wear it briefly because it is so uncomfortable . The fabric is stiff and itchy and the metal adjustments in the front poke me on both sides . I have washed it several times to try and soften the fabric ; did n't work . I would love to be able to wear it because it give such good support and shape , but I just ca n't .
 The size is wrong . I ordered my regular size and it 's much too small . Am returning for a larger . We 'll see .
 I normally wear a XXL T shirt , Dress shirt , causals etc. . Your XXL was more like a L/XL here . I believe you have to make some suggestions on sizes in your website . We here in the Mid-West are a bit bigger than most of the people there in Hawaii . Just a thought .

 I bought this for my daughter and she wo n't use it because it 's way too big . Great for hikers .
 Let me just start out by saying that Victorinox is a great company that makes fantastic knives ... sheaths on the other hand are not their strong suit . The sheath was barely as described , and I could barely fit my swisschamp plus into it . It 's supposed to be a `` large '' sheath , but was actually fairly small . Another thing to mention is that the material used was n't too great , but at least it works for now . If you can stand not buying a Victorinox sheath , then do n't do it . At least by another type of sheath from Victorinox because this one is n't worth your time .
 I took a chance buying this item thinking it would fit fine in my Swiss Army knife , even though there was no good info on the pouch size . So I was disappointed when I had to put on a serious effort to fit my `` oversized '' knife .
 I ordered 2 Swiss army knives and 2 pocketknife pouches that were displayed on the same screen and were marketed together . -LRB- People who bought the knife also bought ... etc. -RRB- The knives came from one source ; the pouches from another . The knives arrived as promised ; the pouches arrived the following week . The pouch did not fit the knife -LRB- knife too large or pouch too small -RRB- . Free delivery did not apply to the pouches which came from a source in New Hampshire - surprise !
 Swiss Army has great products , but I will NEVER do service with them online again !!! First I ordered this product , then after a month went by and it still was n't sent , I deleted my order . A couple weeks later , I received the product , even though I deleted my order . I just immediately returned it . It took over FIVE MONTHS for me to receive my refund ! ... and I received nastly e-mails from customer service accusing me of never returning the product . If you want to buy something from Swiss Army , I strongly advise going to a store to get it !!!
 Proof that you get what you pay for , these low-priced sweatshirts are thin and skimpy . Sweatshirts seem to have taken the same quality nosedive as jeans . Ribbing around collar is especially thin . I am still searching for the real thing .
 This is a very light weight sweatshirt which is available in many colors , but if you want a quality heavy weight sweatshirt this is not it .
 Updated Review
 I orderd this shirt for my boyfriend in Canada . I knew it would n't get there in time for Christmas , but I did n't know this company would deliver it to the wrong address ! Hell , they delivered it to the wrong country ! When I tried contacting them , they did n't even have to courtesy to reply to any of my emails . I will NEVER buy from them again and I would n't recommend anyone buying from them if you want your items delivered to the right place . I hope whoever recieved it enjoys it , because my boyfriend never will . Nothing like paying good money for nothing !!!!!!!
 paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon/this store - NEVER AGAIN !
 First , the shipping and packaging . Very poor for both . Shipping was far too long . I waited almost two weeks to get the four sweatshirts that I ordered . The packaging was in a plastic bag which was okay , however the sweatshirts were just stuffed into the bag . All of them were dirty and needed to be washed right away . They looked like they had been stored in someones garage or worse ... in the trunk of somebody 's car . I would be very surprised if I discovered Fashion Rack was a real store and not some roadside vendor.Second , I ordered XL and glad I did . I normally wear a large , but after receiving four dirt and dust covered sweatshirts and laundering them , they shrunk to just about a Large size . I 'm not sure what will happen with the next laundering . If they shrink more they will be too small and unwearable.The material is very light . This is fine with me . Others may not like a light sweatshirt . It wo n't keep you warm in very cold climates.All in all , I got what I paid for . A cheap sweatshirt .
 Problem is - I do not know how I like this product because I received sweatpants and a sweatshirt . Can you help me with the return ? There was no paperwork mailed in the package received
 I was trilled when I got this but sorely disappointed when I opened it and tried it on . I had stopped by at local one of the Halloween stores that always pop up around fall . They had this same costume there . I tried the large but it was kind of tight around the mid-section area . -LRB- We 've all had that problem T.T -RRB- Figured I get the x-large but could n't find it anywhere but here.Ordered Monday , did one-day shipping and after paying twice as much to get it before going on vacation over Halloween I got it on Weds.The biggest problem that I have with it is that it 's not of the same quality as the one I tried in the store . Even though its the same thing . The large in-store , had a zipper in the back and the material was quite soft and elastic.The X-large I got , has Velcro circles in the back . Not even a full strip to close the back but little white circles . I suggest NOT bending down to tie your shoes.The cheap Velcro comes apart to easy . This could be solved by some safety pins but still the material is itchy and not of the same quality and wrinkles very easy . And the adjustable Obi is kind of a joke.Take it as you well but I wish I was happier with this . More disappointed in that I wasted a lot of money on something that seems so cheap .
 I looks way better online than it does in person . You have to be a set height and plus it looks very torn . I may as well to send it back .

 bought for my wife to get me to reach super saver shipping threshold ... she never wears it
 first and foremost this is a t shirt and not a sweater . . its short even for a tee . . its sad . . no style ... short ... and crumples easily ... fades out with just one or 2 washes ... hate it
 I orderd this shirt for my boyfriend in Canada . I knew it would n't get there in time for Christmas , but I did n't know this company would deliver it to the wrong address ! Hell , they delivered it to the wrong country ! When I tried contacting them , they did n't even have to courtesy to reply to any of my emails . I will NEVER buy from them again and I would n't recommend anyone buying from them if you want your items delivered to the right place . I hope whoever recieved it enjoys it , because my boyfriend never will . Nothing like paying good money for nothing !!!!!!!
 paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon/this store - NEVER AGAIN !
 First , the shipping and packaging . Very poor for both . Shipping was far too long . I waited almost two weeks to get the four sweatshirts that I ordered . The packaging was in a plastic bag which was okay , however the sweatshirts were just stuffed into the bag . All of them were dirty and needed to be washed right away . They looked like they had been stored in someones garage or worse ... in the trunk of somebody 's car . I would be very surprised if I discovered Fashion Rack was a real store and not some roadside vendor.Second , I ordered XL and glad I did . I normally wear a large , but after receiving four dirt and dust covered sweatshirts and laundering them , they shrunk to just about a Large size . I 'm not sure what will happen with the next laundering . If they shrink more they will be too small and unwearable.The material is very light . This is fine with me . Others may not like a light sweatshirt . It wo n't keep you warm in very cold climates.All in all , I got what I paid for . A cheap sweatshirt .
 Problem is - I do not know how I like this product because I received sweatpants and a sweatshirt . Can you help me with the return ? There was no paperwork mailed in the package received
 This is a very light weight sweatshirt which is available in many colors , but if you want a quality heavy weight sweatshirt this is not it .

 Proof that you get what you pay for , these low-priced sweatshirts are thin and skimpy . Sweatshirts seem to have taken the same quality nosedive as jeans . Ribbing around collar is especially thin . I am still searching for the real thing .

 I normally wear a XXL T shirt , Dress shirt , causals etc. . Your XXL was more like a L/XL here . I believe you have to make some suggestions on sizes in your website . We here in the Mid-West are a bit bigger than most of the people there in Hawaii . Just a thought .
 Pulling the ribbon through the front of the costume does not prove to be easy . I finally figured out after fraying it repeatedly , to wrap tape around it similar to shoe laces . Wings were also difficult to ` wire ' . Still a cute costume , just not real smart for those in a hurry .

 I thought this would be a soft suede jacket . I was wrong . It is stiff and even looks stiff when you wear it . It has never softened even after wearing it . I wo n't order a jacket like this on line anymore . The color was nice but like I said , the jacket feels stiff and looks stiff , very cheap looking .
 gift for wife , she never wears it . IT got it me to get free shipping so it may become a rag next time goodwill donations are going out the door .
 Not a great sweater . Looks better in the picture . The material is n't too cheap and thin but the sizing is terribly incorrect . Medium seems to be a `` Large '' . It 's very loose and long . If you 're tall ... or pregnant , this might work for you . Petite figures beware -- it will drape like a circus tent .
 Since the sweater is made in Hong Kong the quality of material is very good . But it does not have a good style . My wife wears `` Medium '' all the time and this sweater looked too big . So I guess they do n't follow standard sizing .

 This fleece is great looking and feels great , BUT ... the big problem is the shrinkage . . WOW does it ever not only in the body and length but major shrinkage in the width of the arms . It defiantly is not a comfortable jersey to lounge around in ... CHOOSE SOMETHING DIFFERENT !!!!
 I am 6 ' 175 # , and they just do n't fit right . Baggy all over , and I prefer having a contoured front . but it is a well made product , delivered quickly , just not happy with how they fit me . I will be donating these to the GoodWill .
 Inexpensive but the fabric is not comforatable . I dont know what else to say since these are `` plain '' `` cheap '' boxer briefs .
 After my first workout they stretched and looked more like boxers . The quality of the material does n't look good either , so I do n't expect them to last long .
 Not a huge fan . I just do n't find them very comfortable , and they fit rather large I think . Someone suggested Merona , I think Champion is also a great brand . Hanes makes terrific shirts , do n't care much for these though .
 I used to buy the Hanes boxer briefs about every few months . The reason is because they 're great for the first couple months but after that , having gone through several washings and dryings they begin to thin out and develop holes in the crotch area . I found the solution and will share it with you . Go to Target , find some Merona brand boxer briefs and buy them . I 've had these things forever and they 're just as good and comfortable as the Hanes or Fruit of the Loom brand -LRB- which incidentally do the same crotch thinning thing -RRB- only the Merona brand never thins out or deveolps holes in the crotch area like those do .
 The elastic waistband rumples , the threads fray , and they generally fall apart . I love the Hanes premium ones -- and I guess their idea is to get you to waste your money on the cheap ones and then upgrade . Well , it worked ... but hopefully this review saves you from the waste-money part .
 Buy these boxer and really let me down , I buy boxer -LRB- Giordi or another brand -RRB- with a bag to hold the testicles , however I wanted to try the boxer who offered by Amazon , believing that at least this model had this feature but did not , are almost a vulgar shores , completely flat in front and after a few washings , they tend to stretch . In short , I will not mark the boxer , to buy again , I will put more attention to photos and comments.Compre estos b&oacute;xer y verdaderamente me defraudaron ; yo compro b&oacute;xer -LRB- Giordi u otra marca -RRB- con bolsa para sostener los test&iacute;culos , no obstante quise probar los b&oacute;xer que ofertan por Amazon , creyendo que al menos este modelo ten&iacute;an esta caracter&iacute;stica pero no fue as&iacute; , son pr&aacute;cticamente unos vulgares shores , totalmente plano al frente y despu&eacute;s de algunas lavadas , tienden a estirarse . En definitiva , no volver&eacute; a esta marca de b&oacute;xer ; de comprar nuevamente , pondr&eacute; m&aacute;s atenci&oacute;n a las fotos y comentarios .
 There is a 2XL sticker on the package I bought which is good because I wear 2XL boxers . The boxers however are all medium according to the wash tag and the size chart on the back of he package . Unfortunately I 'm not sure I can return them since I opened them tried them on and have been using a few of them as rags because I failed to notice they were the wrong size . I do n't blame amazon or the seller for that . Looks like a mistake made by Hanes mislabeling their product .
 We bought these because Hanes is a reputable company . The price was right and the picture looked like what he wanted.He tried them on when they arrived . They are much shorter than in the picture . In fact , it seems they used the same picture for several products both here on amazon and on the Hanes website . The hem of the legs turned up . I was n't impressed but he said they seemed to fit good and they would be fine.So , I washed them . No further problems . He wore them and this is where they got a single star . An hour or two into the day , the legs were stretched out so they resembled regular boxers.While the company I bought these from were very accommodating , I would have had to pay over $ 10 to ship them back which would not have been worth it . I hope Goodwill will make use of them.Ended up buying the Jockey GO Stretch Classic Midway Briefs . Much happier with those . See my review there.GO Stretch Classic Midway Brief - 2 pack
 This product looks good on picture . But actually I waisted my money . They are not comfortable at all . After two days of wearing them they turned into rags . They stretched and looked awful . I could n't believe that I spent my money on something like that . Usually I 'm pretty careful about what I buy but this are just awful . And one more thing . They are so thin that when they stretch on your body you can see through . Thanks
 I bought three of these in a couple different patterns for my children to use as bibs . Bumkins also makes sleeved bibs in the same material , so I thought they 'd be perfect for my kids who are still messy eaters , yet too big for the sleeved bibs.When I received them , I noticed some loose stitching around the binding and ties , but I figured they would be fine . Wrong . The printed fabric is really great , light and comfortable , but the white binding and ties started to fray and tear within the first 4 months of use . By the time they were 6 months old , each had lost at least one tie and they looked terrible . Now they are a year old , but I am still trying to use them by holding them on my kids with safety pins . The pockets are detaching from the main body of the bib , despite the fact that we have never used the pockets to hold anything.I hope to throw these out soon . I 'd never have purchased them had I realized the construction was so poor .
 This wallet is made of quality material and well put together . However , it is not usable for me because there is not even half the room for stuff as my old wallet . If more room is needed than for 3 or 4 cards and 3 or 4 currency bills it is completely inadequate .
 I am still awaiting my refund for this product . I would like to know how long it will take for me to receive my refund .
 I ordered this item in the middle of November for a holiday gift . Plenty of time right ? As of a few days before Christmas , it still had n't shipped so I had to cancel the item .

 Most flip-top gloves have a normal thumb . This model has a flip-top for the thumb . While a great idea in theory , it 's dumb in practice . When you flip the thumb cover over to completely cover your thumb , there 's still a giant hole that at best lets in cold air and at worst causes your thumb to constantly slip through into the outside world.The shoddy construction continues to the flip-top for your fingers . On better quality flip-top gloves , there 's a large overlap between the flip-top and the fingerless gloves . On this model , however , the flip-top barely covers the parts of your fingers that are n't covered by the fingerless gloves . The result , again , is exposure to the cold.Finally , the Thinsulate lining is shoddily sewn in . It 's easy for your fingers to miss it so that they 're covered only by the outer wool layer , with all the Thinsulate bunched up either above or below the fingers.I had a devil of a time finding flip-top gloves this season that were n't some awful shade of brown . I bought these because I wanted grey/black ones . Too bad everything but the color let me down .
 I looked specifically for Thinsulate brand gloves and thought I was ordering Thinsulate brand gloves . When they arrived , they were clearly NOT Thinsulate brand gloves.The velcro patches almost completely came off after the first usage and had to be sewn back on . Additionally , the inner lining started to come lose on one of them after only a few wears.Do not buy this product thinking you 're getting Thinsulate gloves . They AI N'T .
 When I ordered this hat I also emailed the company asking questions that not only never got answered , I never received the hat but at the same time was never charged thankfully . They should include the hat 's size in its description .
 I bought this bra based on the positive reviews that I read from various sites . The material , style and color are quite lovely . I was excited to try it on . Then my self-esteem fell through the floor
 Do n't waste your money on these . They are baggy ! There 's absolutely no elasticity to them . I also bought Capezio 's Child Ultra Soft Footed Tight - 1815C and they are perfect . Worth the $ 2 more .
 These tights are OLD product ... do not buy ... these have not been available from Capezio for over 5 years so if you buy them the product will have age and nylon does not age well ... beware
 The Timbuk 2 Classic Messenger Bag is a very roomy bag . The large can fit a ton of Stuff . Unfortunately the strap is very uncomfortable.The 2 '' wide strap cuts my shoulder when the bag is loaded . The strap is also sewn on to one end which prevented me from replacing it with something more comfortable . So it sits in the corner ; looks nice but not very functionable .
 I got a Large timbuk2 and from the rides i 've taken it on , it is n't very comfortable . I got a strap pad , hoping this would fix the problem but it still persists . When i bought the bag it did n't come with the strap pad or a cross strap but from carrying a chrome citizen messenger bag and this , the chrome definitely beats it in at area of comfortability . The one plus is that it definitely is very roomy .
 I have n't used it yet . Nice size . Going to Europe for couple of weeks and hopefully it holds up to baggage handling .
 The quality seems fine , they just do n't fit me very well . The rise on the waistband is not sufficient to make them comfortable . I wish the old George Forman boxer briefs were still around .
 This costume is very cute ... until you take it off . It is no longer cute . In fact , by the time you get home from whatever shin-dig you attend on Halloween ... this costume is no longer wearable . It falls apart . First the fluffy white fir around the sleeves & neckline start to peel off . Then the sleeves start to detach from the dress . Big disappointment . I ca n't even give this away or donate it or even wear it another year . I wo n't be purchasing costumes from this maker no longer ! As for the Seller ... I have no complaints . Very fast shipping , very good communication ... 5 stars for the seller .
 If you order the larger sizes as a 2-pack that is advertised , Freshpair will only send a single pair per order for larger sizes of Munsingwear boxer briefs . It turns out that the larger sizes are not available in a 2-pack even though it is advertised up to a 3X . So when you think you are getting a better deal you really are n't . It is not listed anywhere that larger sizes are sold in single pairs for the same price as 2 are for the smaller pairs -LRB- up to a Large -RRB- ... PLUS you already pay more for the extended size !! If you call about this they will send you the other pairs but they definitely think they are doing you a favor and certainly do n't see it as an advertising issue or in anyway their fault . I was actually encouraged by them to not use Amazon when ordering this product . I encouraged them to take responsibility for how the product is advertised.Anyway , apparently Munsingwear wants to give the skinny people 2 packs but larger people pay $ 3 more for extended sizes and are also only supposed to get one pair for the inflated price . Feels very unfair to me . Did I mention this was part of a gift that is totally messed up now ?? yeah .
 I bought many pairs over time and came to realize they were n't holding up well for long . Have since moved on to a similar style made of coolmax polyester that fit and work the same , feel as comfortable against the skin but last much longer that natural cotton fabric .
 I bought a pair by all the positive reviews I saw . Truth is they are not as supportive as advertised . It could be just me but I found that regular Hanes boxer briefs are more supportive and cheaper . I was disappointed with the fit but am gon na try to wash and really dry them a couple more times and maybe my opinion will change .
 One of the wheels on the largest piece of luggage collapsed on the third use . Good thing this is n't available - do n't make the same mistake I made and buy it . The bag had 40 pounds of items in it , and attached to the strap on top - meant to for that purpose , was a bag weighing 12 pounds . It was not over weighted.I will never buy this brand again .

 I was looking for a fun shirt for my husband for his birthday . He has 3 Uke 's now and plays all the time while watching sports on tv . I took a lot of time searching the internet for a shirt that would be whimsical/fun for him to wear . When it arrived I was very disappointed . The fabric was very stiff . I washed it on delicate , cold water & it got black splotches on it.Not only that , but it did not soften up with my Tide with Downy laundry detergent . He will never wear it , but he wont throw it away because I got it for him . A waste of money .
 In case you were hoping the other negative reviews were wrong -LRB- as I was -RRB- , prepare to be disappointed . These are not even close to the quality of the former Munsingwear underwear . I 've worn boxers with more support . If there is any vestige of the Munsingwear Company left , please let us know if you decide to get the quality of this product back to where it once was .
 I regret buying these , they 're too thin and alternately too loose or too tight within the same pack . Get the Jockey 3-pack , those are AWESOME . I 'm actually stocking up on them as we speak ...
 I purchased these briefs based on past experiences . Based on reviews I had read , I ordered one size smaller than I normally would have . It likely helped some , but still not happy with product . I will not buy this brand again . It 's to bad they chose to alter the quality of what was a very good brief .
 I wore Munsingwear briefs exclusively in the 1980 and 1990s , so I thought I 'd try them again . Bad decision . In 2011 I first ordered the full rise briefs and the pouch was too saggy . So then I ordered the mid rise briefs and the opening to the pouch was miniscule . The size was correct , but the utility of the briefs was abysmal . Good luck if you buy these.Jan 2013 , an addendum
 Years ago these were the best briefs you could buy . I ordered several packs . So far I have thrown away about one third of the briefs . Some fit perfectly . The ones I have thrown out have had the following problems . About three had the elastic in the leg section so tight I could hardly get them on . Four had the elastic stretch out within minutes like I was wearing bloomers . A couple seemed to be a smaller size than the rest.Apparently these are made without attention to consistent quality . Needless to say I wo n't be purchasing these again . I guess I 'll have to go back to buying Fruit of the Loom . I do n't throw as many of those out and they are much cheaper . If anyone knows of a good pouch brief out there please let me know .
 I bought these for my husband and the quality is very poor . Not all the seams were sewn . After the first wash they are already coming apart . Would not recommend this product .
 Munsingwear pouch type briefs of the 80 's and 90 's were great ! The reason for it more than anything else was the material . They used to be cotton and Kodafil polyester blend.That gave the brief some elasticity , allowed it to breath and was very lightweight yet not stretchy tight like Speedos etc.Great support and easy access when needed.Now no support and gee ... let it all hang out ! . My `` new '' ones have been cut up for used in the garage as rags.Kodak resins quit making Kodafil many years back and I believe that Munsingwear was bought out just afterward by who knows who.The current trend is for ALL 100 % cotton which means they will be baggy and if you add a pouch your wife will say something like
 I ordered these when the Jockey version became unavailable -LRB- thank goodness , I have since found the Jockeys -RRB- . I suppose that if you wear boxer shorts , you might find these comfortable , because the leg openings on the pair I received were vastly over-sized . This is despite the fact that I ordered a waist size one below the size of my trousers . Very disappointing .
 I 'VE BEEN BUYING MUNSINGWEAR POUCH BRIEFS FOR AT LEAST 5 YEARS AND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY HAPPY WITH THEM . THIS LATEST PURCHASE IS A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT FOR ME . THE BAND AROUND THE LEGS IS LOOSE WHERE IT USED TO BE SNUG . I DO N'T LIKE THIS BECAUSE IT ALLOWS EVERYTHING TO HANG OURSIDE THE BRIEFS RATHER THAN BEING CONTAINED . I ALSO NOTICED THAT THESE WERE MADE IN INDIA WHICH MY BE THE REASON FOR THE LOOSE FITTING . THE LEG BANDS SHOULD BE CONSISTANT WITH THE WAIST BAND SIZE , BUT IT 'S NOT . TAKE A LOOK AT THE IMAGE DISPLAYED . THEY DO N'T FIT LIKE IT SHOWS . I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN OR EXCHANGE THEM BUT DO N'T KNOW THAT I WOULD GET THE SAME RESULTS . : -LRB- I have returned these briefs and will no longer purchase them . Now worth the price .
 This product falls way too big ... more like `` bloomers '' for old men ... although I am big -LRB- 42 -RRB- , these would have fit a size `` 50 '' , imo , I had the whole family laughing about these ... I did not return them , but I will not re-order either ... lolin addition , the delivery caused me aggravation ... using the tracking # , i rec 'd a notice that the prouct was delivered on 2/16 , it was n't ... after complaining , they arrived about 5 days later ...
 I 'm a happy user of Munsingwear for 15 years now but was shocked to notice on my recent purchase that the stitches were coming off and the sizes are not standard -LRB- too big for a medium 32 &#34; compared to my old ones -RRB- . Some stitches already broke even before I started using them . This is ridiculous Munsingwear - wake up !
 Arggggg !!!!! Four - five years ago my wife got me a few pair of munsingwear and they fit perfectly once I got used to the horizontal opening . So , a few months ago when the original three pair had been reduced to a few random threads , I ordered more online . The midrise , size 36 , and given my prior experience , I went ahead and ordered four bags of 'em . Twelve undies , so I would n't have to do laundry but once a fortnight.Well , something changed . The old midrise sat about an inch below the navel . These new ones sit down around the pubes . Not a pretty sight when you 're in your early ' 60 's . I could live with that , but the pouch - the thing that made the munsingwear special - has changed . It shrunk ! And not just a little ! The boys - if you catch my drift - used to fit comfortably in the old pouch , snug , yet not constricted , warm , comfortable , happy . Not in the new ones . No siree . The new pouch is so small , and the slit is so far down the front of the things that ... how to describe it ... Picture if you will a golden retriever with it 's head and two front paws sticking up out of your car 's passenger window , tongue flapping in the breeze . that 's pretty much what it 's like . My manhood pops free just about every five minutes , and unless I head down to the washroom to adjust myself -LRB- by now people think I have a urinary tract infection -RRB- , it just rubs itself raw against the inside of my pants zipper . It hurts . You ever try to stick a bandage on down there ? Ca n't be done . DO N'T LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOU
 My husband has been wearing Munsingwear for many , many years . He has noted that each time we purchase them the quality and consistency of fit deteriorates . This last purchase was the final proverbial straw . The leg openings , fly opening and placement , and waist band varied greatly with each pair , so much so that there were some he just could n't wear at all ; they were so uncomfortable . We will not be purchasing Mun singwear again . Ever .
 I read the reviews an many brands , saw that recent reviews were not kind to this product but decided to give it a try based on older good reviews . Trust the new reviews . These underwear have started to come apart after just 5 washings . Many reviews have said that the quality of these briefs has declined now that manufacturing has moved away from our shores . I do n't know what these briefs were like when made here but they sure stink now . Do n't waste your money ! I got Dockers brifs too and love them .
 I bought this product for the first time two years ago and they were great . I re-ordered recently and was very disappointed . I never review products . If they are bad I just suck it up . But just had to say how bad this product had become . Shorts are very oversized . Fit as if they were four years old . I will not buy again .
 I used to buy Munsingwear underwear in the past and was always happy with them but switched to Jockey because I could n't find Munsingwear in department stores anymore . When I found this brand on Amazon I decided to try them again and have to say that I 'm not very happy with them . Maybe it 's just my body but the fit is really weird . They are too baggy in the front and the leg openings in the back are cut too high . The result is an `` insecure '' feeling that is very noticeable throughout the day . Even though they 're only about a month old I 'm ordering Jockeys today to replace them .
 When I first started buying this underwear many years ago it was made in the USA . Then , several years later , it was made in Canada . I never had any trouble with this underwear ; it was just fine . I bought 18 of these a few months ago and noticed they are now made in India , which might explain why this underwear has become a disappointment . The stitching on the waistband came loose on five , the stitching on the label came loose on one , on four the hem on the inside flap of the fly is wide and well stitched , but on the other 14 it is thin and cheaply stitched , and the leg openings on some are fine , but on others are too tight . Perhaps it goes without saying , but I wo n't be buying this brand again .
 I have been wearing this product for at least 25 years or more and never wore any other underwear . Recently purchased annual supply and was very disappointed . Just overall horrible fit-loose leg openings , garment stretched after one use , baggy pouch area and waist band that gave too much space . I might as well have been wearing nothing for all the support I got from this product . I ordered this same product from another vendor and the result was the same . I returned all of the garments to the vendors and sent a e-mail to the manufacturers of Munsingwear asking if they could offer any solutions or if they were having problems with the item . They have not responded and I will not buy this product again.RMNew Jersey
 For over 20 years , my husband has only worn Munsingwear briefs , which are carried by very few stores . We recently ordered two three-packs of briefs and for the first time , were very disappointed . The fit is bad , especially with too large leg openings . They are baggy almost as soon as put on .
 Bought 3 packs . First and only pack opened : Had variance of two inches in waistbands.Had unsymmetric stitching of `` pouch ; '' closer to leg-hole on one side.Seam down center of `` pouch '' added NO EXTRA FABRIC , thus IS NOT A POUCH.I wear pouch-style briefs to insure cotton between jewels and legs.Was distracted all day yesterday by lack thereof.The eight unworn items will go to our church for various programs.I will meekly return to Jockeys where I get what I pay for.Gustwillers delivered promptly and I have no problem with them , unless I find these were actually factory seconds and not advertised as such .
 The same great quality and comfort that I have come to expect from munsignwear kangaroo pouch underwear . Nothing else matches the fit .
 I was searching for comfortable briefs for my 78 year old husband.The Munsingwear brand was recommended by someone on line and I found them on Amazon ... and purchased a 3 pack.He really likes them ... very comfortable and he will buy them again .
 Munsingwear briefs are the only underwear I can remember wearing . It was probably diapers before that ... over 30 years with the same underwear . Well , not the `` exact '' same ones , they do wear out . For men of a certain build , these are the only briefs that are comfortable . Until now . The most recent pairs I bought were made in India , and something has gone completely wrong . QC is non-existent . Each pair is a different size , some leg openings are way too tight -LRB- and I have skinny legs -RRB- , shrinkage is extreme , and elastic is failing after only a few weeks of wash and wear . What the heck were they thinking when they added that banding across the inner flap of the fly ? We now have dual mode underwear . You can hang your junk above the banding and walk around like you got a gourd in your pants , or you can cram your uncomfortable junk below the band and strut around with your butt sticking out because of the pressure on your dangler.This company has been bought and sold many times over the years , and has been made in several countries , all of which , with a couple of errant pairs , have made quality , long lasting products . Now something has been totally lost in the translation , and I 'm forced to move on . Oh how I hate looking at other men 's bulges while shopping for briefs ! Could someone at Munsingwear please give me a call when you get it right ? My current supply is failing fast .
 Used to like Munsingwear pouch underwear-was the equal of Jockey , but recent purchases prove otherwise . The leg openings are too large and the waist band is too narrow making and not substantial making for a `` loose '' fit . They lack a secure feeling . Will not purchase again . Very disappointing .
 I was looking for a fun shirt for my husband for his birthday . He has 3 Uke 's now and plays all the time while watching sports on tv . I took a lot of time searching the internet for a shirt that would be whimsical/fun for him to wear . When it arrived I was very disappointed . The fabric was very stiff . I washed it on delicate , cold water & it got black splotches on it.Not only that , but it did not soften up with my Tide with Downy laundry detergent . He will never wear it , but he wont throw it away because I got it for him . A waste of money .
 After the third time in the wash the pants fell apart ! All the seams desolved!These underpants are so expensive , you would think they are of better quality . What a waste of my money .

 I bought this bra based on the positive reviews that I read from various sites . The material , style and color are quite lovely . I was excited to try it on . Then my self-esteem fell through the floor
 I was not happy with this Lilly Munster costume . The ribbon that was supposed to be on center was sewn on off to the right at the top and the whole length of the ribbon was n't even sewn to the dress . It looked stupid , so I took it to a seamstress to fix it . Needless to say , the costume then cost more than I wanted to pay for it .
 The item was not as pictured . I could not use the item , but it cost more to return than I paid . I would not order from this vendor again .
 I bought this halter piece as gift for my significant other and as soon as I opened the package the halter was falling apart ! It totally ruined my surprise . The thin mesh like material is barely sewn together . Do n't waste your time and money . I had to give it 1 star .
 When I ordered this product I was n't told until several days later that it was n't available . I used another company to complete my purchase of this product .
 Buying this product was a waste of money . If your travel is short it might make the cut as this product lasted for about three weeks but it has now stopped working . It gradually got worse and worse where I would have to spend a few minutes situating my plug just right so that the adapter would work . Now it does not work at all and I have had to buy a new adapter -LRB- that actually works -RRB- .
 I 've worn Munsingwear pouch briefs for many years . My most recent purchase was very dissapointing . The brief has been redesigned and the upper flap which is supposed to fit inside and close the pouch is now much shorter . As a result the pouch does n't stay closed . I purchased these from `` Gustwillers '' and they would not take them back since I 'd already worn them - I could n't know there was a problem until after I 'd worn them . New underwear is now in the garbage .
 pouch opening three inch on one side two and half on the other side from top band and leg opening big enough for a 500 lb person , realy bad baggy fit . Who ever designed this should be fired . worst fit ever . cheap price if you can wear them ????? the picture 's look a hole lot better then they fit believe me.Munsingwear Men 's Full-Rise Comfort Pouch Brief

 I bought this to use on a recent trip to Israel . While the pin configuration is indeed the correct one for Israel , every single outlet in the hotels I stayed at could n't accept this adapter because they used a circular recessed fitting that was not compatible with this adapter -LRB- this adapter has a large flat surface that exceeded the diameter of the recessed circle -RRB- . So , in other words I couldnt get it to work at the hotels I stayed -LRB- in Jerusalem , Tel Aviv and Haifa -RRB- . Someone suggested to me that this adapter fits the `` newer '' Israeli outlets , but if they exist they were not at any of the modern hotels I stayed at ... ?
 Not really as advertised . This bag is small . It 's not a messenger bag - it 's a purse . The material is t-shirt thin and very cheap . Mine came with several runs in the fabric . And , for salt in the wound , it was relatively expensive to ship . About 60 % of the price of the bag itself .
 You get what you pay for . Kinda flimsy bag , but it was cheap , so I 'm not sure I could expect much more than I got .
 I originally wrote a glowing review at about the 3 or 4 month mark . 6 months after owning it the wool began to shed around the cuffs really bad.I 've learned one thing . When searching for a shearling bomber do n't cheap out . Spend the extra cash and get one that will last half a lifetime.I recommend the Alpha Industries B3 sherpa over this thing . I 've had it 2 years now and it wears like iron and looks beautiful and could see it lasting a long long time .

 These are the jeans I used to love . They used to be rugged , well fit , well made . The last few purchases of these jeans have been very very sub-par . Very thin material . Weak seams . Generally unsuitable for my purposes . If Wrangler wants to maintain the `` Rugged '' label on these jeans , they need to re-think the lousy craftsmanship of recent versions . I know I am shopping around for better jeans .
 My jeans showed up labeled 34x34 - as I had ordered them - but the true length was closer to 36 . Other than that , I like the fit/style and the price is right .
 After one wash and a few days of wear , the rear pocket started to separate from the seat . The waist seemed a bit larger than stated - I have to wear a belt to keep them up , which is something I did n't expect when I ordered them . Otherwise , the fabric and fit is ok .
 This obviously is n't a rating of the product itself , but I do n't know any other way to do it . Never wore the pants cause they were at least 2 sizes smaller in the waist than labeled so had to send them back . I was very disappointed ; I guess mistakes happen , but ... No chance that I had wishful thinking about my waist size as I have two other Wrangler Jeans in this size and they fit fine , actually a little loose in the waist . The jeans seemed as advertised otherwise , but again , without actually wearing them , ca n't say much .

 I know the description did n't say these socks were for a horse , yet they were too thin for a mans leg and would have fit up to my husbands hip , should he have tried to put them on !

 This fleece is great looking and feels great , BUT ... the big problem is the shrinkage . . WOW does it ever not only in the body and length but major shrinkage in the width of the arms . It defiantly is not a comfortable jersey to lounge around in ... CHOOSE SOMETHING DIFFERENT !!!!
 XL 13-15 Shrinks , too tight fit for me on 13 foot , cuts down blood circulation . Might be what some customers want . Ca n't imagine getting it on a 15 foot after couple of washings . I did not use dryer . Wish they made a XXL 17-20 . That might work for my desired comfort .
 Nice to find a partly wool sock in sensible sizes . I wear size 6 Women 's shoe . DH purchased a 2-pack of these as a test for me . We got the smallest pair of these available . They fit right.Pros
 My previously ordered Wigwam Comfort Hiker socks all rated five stars . I 'm disappointed with these because they seem to have a less dense weave and do not produce the same cushioning effect as I have come to expect from this brand and type of sock .
 Part of buying a sock is so that you can wear it for a long period of time . These socks shrink . Nothing worse than a sock shrinking and you have to stretch it out before you wear it or it cuts the circulation off above the ankle.Thumbs down !
 The order was for an extra large , which is usually size 16 to 18 . This item was no larger than size 10 . I tried to return the dress , but had a difficult time finding where to send it . When we did find out , we were told that we could only get merchandise , and not our money back . We sent the item back and got a confirmation that they had received . They asked us what we wanted and we said we wanted our money back . no more communications from them.No where in all the literature was there any indication that we could n't get our money back . We have heard nothing . I am sure not only are we not going to get our money back , but also we probably wo n't get anything else . We are very unhappy with our experience . If this is normal for the Amazon merchants , you can be sure that we 'll never order anything else from Amazon .

 The shades left marks on my babies ' faces and the smaller strap was too small and the bigger strap too big . I have yet to use them since they are not comfortable and do not fit . I wish they were made with a softer plastic and more adjustable back . Oh well . You live you learn !
 not really what i was looking for . only holds a limited number of cards , and if you fill it up ... it is extrememly bulky
 Hat is made of thin cloth , definitely does NOT stay pointed up as in the photo image.Purse is made of thin cloth , unraveled almost instantly.Beware
 I am pretty sure it is Gandalf the Gray not Gandalf the Purple . It looks pretty cheesey and not very accurate .
 So , I do n't own it , but it sure does look like my Grandma 's lue Dress . I do n't recall the ruffles ... . The Fabric should be coarser , and NO ruffles ...

 When I first obtained this shirt I was , naturally , quite excited . I could n't wait to try it on . As soon as I did , I was pleased to find that my receding hairline had reversed itself , I lost 20 lbs of unsightly fat , and it cured my spastic colon . I spent the rest of the day bench pressing Volkswagens and feeling very pleased with myself.That night , though , is when the dreams started happening . Every night for a week I dreamed of the three wolves . Their muzzles drenched in blood and froth as they called to me and told me that I must meet my destiny and take my rightful place as ruler of this insignificant rock . I must , as they said , `` lay waste to all the lesser packs . `` I awoke every morning drenched in cold sweat to find the shirt sitting beside me on the bed . I tried desperately to escape its grasp . Even when I buried it in my backyard I found it the next day on my bed without a speck of dirt marring the lupine perfection of the design.Desperate for help , I called the tech support line . The woman on the other end was very understanding and told me it was a factory setting issue . When the shirt was made someone accidentally set the alignment setting from `` neutral '' to `` evil '' and had accidentally toggled it all the way up to world domination . I located the switch under the tag , which was cleverly disguised as a common thread , and switched it to `` Lawful Good . `` Well , truthfully , that turned out to be a mistake as well . Take my advice , leave it set to neutral . As soon as I did that my super enhanced hearing alerted me to a mugging taking place . The shirt sprang into action and the wolves leaped out of my third story window , dragging me with them , and we raced along the road dodging rush hour traffic as I bumped face first along the pavement . The wolves located a woman being attacked by two armed men . The men saw me being dragged along by my shirt and opened fire . Naturally the bullets were just deflected back at them and they were quickly overpowered by the wolves who kept the men pinned to the ground while I sat idly by and waited for the mystical healing powers to regenerate my mangled body from when I had been helplessly dragged for twenty three city blocks.While saving that first woman was sort of cool , now the city just sort of expects it from me . The Police Commissioner even installed that stupid `` Three Wolves Signal '' for whenever giant robots attack . So now I am still not getting any sleep as the wolves drag me along the rooftops at night doing nightly patrols and forcing me to stop crime whether I want to or not.Take it from me , mind that stupid switch . Oh , and be careful when reading celebrity gossip magazines when you are wearing this shirt . I am now facing my third paternity suite from celebrities I have never even met !
 I have the Four Cats Lightning Tee Shirt and have been asked on more dates than when I was wearing The Three Wolves Tee . Most of the women told me they were tired of the guys wearing Three Wolves Tees - it 's just like fashion folks . The Three Wolves Tee had a good run but it 's on to the next thing.The Four Cats Lightning Tee is washed with real feline urine to ensure the smell is permanent . The urine smell makes the women go crazy . The cats depicted on the shirt are wild stray cats . One is a tabbby , another siamese , and the other two must be their offspring because they are a mix . Did I mention how much more putang I get ?
 I actually work at The Mountain and I just had to say something.The Mountain shirts are not top quality , the dye wears shortly after washing and they seem to get small holes all over them as well.As to Mr. McGloins comments about The Mountain not caring about classes or race , he is right , they treat us all equally . . like slaves . Unless you are a favorite of Mr. Tirrell , then you receive higher than average raises and get to go to the bar with Mr. Tirrell who uses the company credit card to pay for it . If you are not one of his favorites he treats you like a piece of garbage , he seems to be on a power trip and enjoys making everyones lives miserable.Most of us are not fortunate enough to own a trailer , we live in small crappy apartments because The Mountain does not pay enough to live off of.Yes most of us shop at Wal-Mart , because that is all we can afford.But I suppose Mr. McGloin was speaking of himself and his well-to-do friends.It 's really to bad the economy is in a bad state otherwise many of us would leave The Mountain .
 My computer has a major virus , the kind that is impossible to remove it is so aggressive.The result is that my family is redirected to different webpages than we want to visit.This company selling the Mountain Wolf shirt is the biggest violator . This page pops up over and over and over.Honestly ? Using a computer virus to sell shirts ? Computer virus spreaders are among the lowest scum on earth . And this company is either responsible or is profiting from this virus.Thanks for listening .
 I purchased this shirt after reading all these reviews and sadly it does not posses a single power mentioned in any of them . I feel as though I have been tricked into buying this and want a refund .
 I have it on good information that this is all just a viral campaign to sell this shirt . The same company is coming out with a four wolf shirt in a month and they need to burn through this soon to be worthless stock . Seriously , if you really feel the pack , wait a bit , you will not be disappointed .
 I was going to buy this shirt after reading all the reviews . Particularly I wanted to achieve the sense of accomplishment and bonhomie that attaches to the acquirers of the shirt . That is , until the cocktail of booze , X , Crack and G wore off and , finding myself face down in a puddle of my own puke , I came to my senses . Now I wish I was as stupid and clueless as all the rest of the goobers who want ; nay need ; this shirt . Being a moron sure looks pretty cool from the outside ... I 'm glad I ran out of drugs before I could order this shirt .
 It 's a nice shirt if you have no originality . If you 're a frat boy with self esteem issues , this is the one . Stop sending me advertisements .
 I just have one advise for people thinking of buying this T-shirt for its majic powers
 I am well aware of the power of the three wolves moon t-shirt , which I was actually introduced to by my mother who said I should check this item out . It was a phenomena in itself , but I went from a rugged German-bearded man to a rugged German-bearded man who had attractive women attached to him all the time . I was a non-believer , but after this , I knew it was true . I even got to fly and I believe some women had some sort of magnetic properties because if I flew too low , they flew into me like bullets . That was n't the bad part though.I was out late one night , and managed to get some alone time . I was feeling mischievous , but I could n't tell you why . I managed to get some Tuscan Whole Milk -LRB- I had a few hours to fly the day before -RRB- and it was after midnight when I decided to `` spill '' some on my shirt . The results ... disastrous . I heard a weird sound , and naturally I thought it was a howl , I was wrong . It almost sounded like a baby seal getting clubbed in the head , but within 10 seconds I felt scratches on my back . Instinctively , I ripped off the shirt and threw it a safe distance , and in someway I could n't explain it to you , the shirt seemed to mutate into what looked like a a monster that was 50 % wolf , 50 % gremlin , and 50 % smegal from lord of the rings . Yes , it was 150 % of pure evil!I thought I was going to die right there , not having enough time to have my life flash before my eyes , but fortune was on my side that night . As the creature approached , a rock from a nearby dumpster began to glow . Now , it was n't kryptonite , I know that because it was blue , but it had nullifying effects on that strange demon . To save myself and take no chances , I ran to the rock , and chucked it at the creature , and it was amazing . In a blinding light , I felt a tremor , and the next thing I knew , the light sort of imploded taking the creature with it leaving my blue rock behind.SO YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED !!! Two things really . One-do not spill milk on the shirt after midnight , and the second one I figured out later is that there are strange magical rocks that can nullify the shirts power ! Sometimes , when I have a girl with me , I will bring the rock with me because ; not only do I know she 's safe with me , but I love the look of anyone who passes us who wears the shirt , the look on their face is dumbfounded.Given the circumstances , I would have rated this 5/5 , but I learned the dark secrets of the shirt and for that have to tell you that you could end up killing yourself if you buy it .
 I ordered the Wolf Moon T shirt sight unseen . A friend told me , `` Hey , Dude ! You 've got to order that Wolf Moon T shirt . '' So I did . But there 's a problem . They sent me a size Medium , but I 'm seven-feet tall and weigh 290 . Last Monday I put the shirt on . It took twenty minutes . It 's now Thursday and I have n't been able to get it off . Friends have tried to peal it away but it wo n't budge . Thank God I loaded up on Right Guard before Monday . But , I can tell the protection is wearing off ; the people I pass on the street say things like , `` My God ! That poor fellow ! `` As you might imagine , the stretching has altered the shapes in the artwork . It now looks like three anorexic wolves howling at a pear-shaped moon . Whatever.Swen Nater
 ok , so i try to make it so that ALL of my shirts are button-down collar shirts ! however , i do love this shirt and wish that it was n't JUST available in t-shirt form !!!! PLEASE ! SOMEONE HELP ME !!!! i do n't want to have to break the conformity of my collection !
 After reading over a thousand reviews I made the informed decision to order this shirt . Shortly after clicking the `` BUY '' button I noticed that the shirt had not only already arrived , but that I was wearing it with gusto . All seemed well until I took it out for a test spin.The awesome power of the wolves promptly drained me of my seed and clogged the kitchen sink . Any attempt I make to unclog the sink or contact a plumber causes the wolves to growl in such a way that I dare not continue . Although I was confident that I could control the power bestowed upon me , it was only a matter of days before I had shaved the tails of all the neighborhood cats and eaten all the first-born children in a ten mile radius.The wolves do not respond to logic or reason . I tried to remove the shirt , but the alpha male bit me and my flesh has since healed to the garment itself . I now have magnificent chest hair and engage in involuntary chanting which causes acid rain.I still feel that the pros outweigh the cons , but I now spend so much time carrying out the wishes of the Norse god king , Odin , that I can not in good conscious recommend this product .
 I bought this shirt to go along with my ironic mesh cap , and the name-on-breast mechanics jacket I bought at the consignment shop -LRB- worth every penny of that -LSB- ... -RSB- -RRB- . I figured it 'd be just the thing to consolidate my faux trailer trash look and attract all the hot pierced hipster ladies.However , apparently I 've gone too far , people no longer realize I 'm trying to ironically make fun of poor white people , they think I AM trailer trash . The hot indie girls do n't come up and talk to me at the bar , they just point and snicker.Maybe I should cut my mullet ? Or add a septum piercing ?
 I put this away with my other T-shirts and before you know it it had devoured my Three Sheep T-Shirt .
 The effect that this t-shirt has on women is pretty impressive . Unfortunately its natural healing powers reversed my vasectomy and I impregnated nine women in two weeks before I realized . They all had twin boys . Now I have 18 sons and spend most of my money on child support and condoms .
 After years of this shirt being on my Amazon wish list , my family finally got it for me for Christmas . The first thing I did , as I do with all new clothes , was wash it . HUGE mistake . This shirt does not like water , apparently , and now I have to rebuild my kitchen and laundry room .
 I 'm from a small trailer park in Alaska and live off the land ; hunting moose for food when I lose enough weight to see my feet and scrounging icicles off the back of pickups to drink when the coors runs out . Normally a shirt like this would be right up my alley . It shows people that I 'm a devilishly handsome looker that runs with a pack -LRB- I bought all my homies matching shirts -RRB- that has my back as long as they 're not passed out on the futon . This shirt , however , has severely impacted my subsistence lifestyle . Come hunting season I usually go out with my buddies , my remington 7mm , and as much coors as the boat has room for , and sail out to a little cabin -LRB- yes , it 's a sailboat until my mom decides to fix the motor -RRB- . My bros and I usually hang out , down a couple brewskis , and shoot at anything that moves . Normally I do n't get much -LRB- okay , I 've never actually got anything -RRB- but directly after donning the three wolf moon shirt , moose began approaching my cabin from all directions and dropping dead at my feet . Because of this , I 've been too busy butchering moose to slam down any coors and my bros -LRB- they do n't like work -RRB- left when the first moose fell . I write this , rendered helpless at my cabin -LRB- okay , my mom 's cabin -RRB- , to warn all TRUE hunters to beware the power of the three wolf moon shirt . This shirt ruins the hunting experience.With much grief , Tres lobo luna
 Apon seeing this t-shirt for sale I knew I just had to have one , but fearing that amazon might sell out I thought I would order a bulk load to be delivered to my home address , little did I know that this was the worst thing I could have done .2 boxes duly arrived the following day and with limited space to store them I piled them on top of each other in the corner of the spare room and thought no more about it untill later that night when I saw an eerie glow coming from upstairs.I ran upstairs and what I saw can only be described as some sort of nuclear meltdown , the pile of t-shirts were glowing red hot and starting to melt through the floor , my only guess being that the power of each t-shirt is magnified when brought into contact with another and with ordering 250 t-shirts this was enough to enter critical mass and trigger the meltdown.Well it 's been 2 days now and the t-shirts have long melted through the crust of the earth and I can only assume that they will appear on the other side of the earth at some point in a cloud of steam and smoke , so if you live in china and a pile of 3 wolf t-shirts melt through the floor of your house then they are mine and I would appreciate it if you could give me a call so I can come and collect them . Thanks ...
 Do n't buy this shirt ! I have it on good authority that the Wolves have received no royalties from the ever-growing sales . No wonder they are howling . Wolves , say hello to the Slumdog Millionaire kids .
 After I heard that Chuck Norris could be stopped by someone wearing the Three Wolf Moon shirt , I immediately bought one specifically to find him and , while wearing this shirt , defeat Chuck Norris . Upon wearing this shirt , it instantly guided me to Chuck Norris ' location . On my way to visit him , I was followed by a horde of beautiful women . Once I found him and as I was about to destroy him , I saw that he , too , was wearing the Three Wolf Moon shirt , and was awaiting my arrival . Chuck Norris ' powers have increased exponentially upon wearing of the shirt , and quickly disemboweled me . Luckily , due to the Three Wolf Moon 's natural healing properties , I escaped certain death and fled . Unfortunately , the swarm of women did not follow me back , but instead had their way with Chuck Norris .
 I was hoping to turn my coolness quotient up to 11 as I wore this shirt around places , Wal-mart , and stuff . Instead , I returned it because of its poor quality . The fabric is scratchy and thin . Worse , the neck hole is an inch off center , which makes the collar constantly ride up on one side . This would have worked if my neck was an inch off center , but it is n't . One star because of the quality issues ; one more star because it 's got three wolves . And a moon .
 I just wanted to send a message to the ladies out there who might be tempted by the overwhelming power of the three wolf moon shirt . Please , take my warning . That aroma is not actually the powerful musk scent of the wolves themselves , but of the heartbreaking and callous man wearing the wolf . Take it from me , I am not an unattractive woman , and I have been burned by the wolf more than 6 times.Each time , I can not stop myself from being drawn in by the magnificence of the three wolf moon shirt -LRB- and this is only for the three wolves , as I have been successful at dodging imposters wearing only one , or even two wolves -RRB- only to find that the wearer of the shirt is a heartless and cruel womanizer.I find that when I have approached the incredibly attractive men who are sporting the three wolf moon shirt , they have been without exception the most rude and dehumanizing people I have ever met . When I approached the first wolfman , I told him that I found his shirt very alluring and would like to get to know him better . At that point , he began shaking , apparently in disgust or alarm at my forward behavior , and did not speak for a solid 30 seconds . It put me in an incredibly awkward position , until he finally said , `` I have to go , my mom is picking me up out front , '' and walked away without even saying goodbye.This kind of rejection has happened on multiple occasions , with wolfmen ranging in age from mid-teens to middle age ignoring my advances and crushing self-esteem . Ladies , do NOT approach these men or they will just break your tender heart ! They will run away , they will flail their floppy arms around , they will refuse to make eye contact , they will make whatever excuse they can to get away from you . One man even went so far as to urinate on himself in an attempt to make me go away.I also know for a fact it is only attractive women who get this treatment from these ` men . ' I have seen men in the three wolf moon shirt talking to other men , and even an occasional unfortunately-proportioned woman , but every time I have witnessed an attractive woman make an attempt , the wolfmen show the above-mentioned signs of rejection.Attractive ladies , do NOT , under any circumstances , fall under the spell of the three wolf moon shirt ! The man inside is just waiting to embarrass and reject you !
 I , for one , was most disappointed in this product.While preparing for last year 's Star Trek convention in Las Vegas , it struck me that i had torn my uniform during bat ` leth practice and had not yet requisitioned a replacement . Since i was shopping forConversational Klingon -LRB- Audiofy Digital Audiobook Chips -RRB- anyway , i decided to give Amazon.com a try . I was pleased to find this listing and ordered a XXXL.Imagine my surprise and dismay when i unpacked the box in my room at the Las Vegas Hilton . Instead of the expected `` Three Worf Moon t-shirt '' , i had ... this . This is not even close to Federation or Empire standards . But , at the time , it was the only clean shirt i had , my other shirt having fallen victim to an especially sloppy drive thru meal at the nearby Taco Bell . So i put it on , and had an immediate craving for a Budweiser.I looked in the phone book to find the nearest comic book store , praying that they would have an acceptable substitute uniform to wear to the con . As soon as i parked the ol' Ford Festiva , throngs of women started migrating toward me from the parking lot of the Wal * mart next door . Having never spoken to a woman before , i was very nervous , but managed to explain to them that i needed to buy a new uniform because Klingons had messed up my other one . For some reason , they looked at me funny after i said that , but one of them said that my pants looked fine . -LRB- ? -RRB- I explained that my problem was more with the shirt . The same woman said she really liked the shirt . Then she asked me if i wanted to see the new trailer . I told her that i seen a sneak preview of the trailer , and i thought it looked like a cheap rip-off of the original . -LRB- I saw the movie on May 7th , and i stand by my original assessment . ONLY SHATNER can play Kirk !!!! 1 -RRB- At this point , the chattering women went quiet , and the one who had been speaking to me started slapping me silly ! And another one of them threw an empty beer can at my head before starting back to the Wal * Mart parking lot to find someone named `` Cletus '' . Well , it does n't take a Starfleet Academy graduate to know when to get the heck out of Dodge . I hopped back into the Festiva and high-tailed it back to the hotel . I wore this T-shirt ot the convention , and everyone laughed at me . Have you ever been laughed at by a whole bunch of Trekkers ? It hurts , man .
 After getting this shirt ... I was approached my so many women that I had to install a `` take a number '' dispenser on the crotch of my jeans . I have released so much of my seed into this world because of this shirt , I now suffer from a permanently low sperm count . I can no longer father children.THANKS for nothin 3 wolf moon t-shirt .
 I was told by the seller that the moon was painted with disappearing paint that faded in sunlight and that during the day the moon would disappear and the shirt would be transparent there , thereby giving off the awesome effect that the wolves would be howling at my bare peck and nipple.Needless to say , it was a lie . Neither were the wolves made of squishy material so they did n't even squeak/howl when I pushed on them.Double gyp.Also , they said the the shirt would be slimming on my robust frame , but instead it made the bottom wolf look like it had an enormous neck.Not really a gyp on the last one ... but it just looked weird.What might be cool is two wolves mating while the male wolf howls at the moon . I 'd buy that .
 Yeah , the shirt 's ok . But I would have preferred that it be made from actual wolf hair .
 Although this shirt comes in children sizes it is not intended for them . Children just do n't have the mind power to control the mystical powers of this shirt . Myself and my 5 kids wore our 3W & M shirts to a family reunion and after a three legged race did not go Jr 's way mayhem erupted . All I can say is that by the time animal control was called a better half of my family was gone and Hut 42 looked like a catchup factory had exploded on it . Nana still is n't talking to me , and pop pop seems to be holding a grudge about his missing leg . On the plus side the shirts arrived on time and blood washes right out of them .
 I do n't read so well , so I reck 'n thems were panthers . Not panthers ! Not happy !
 I was so excited to get this shirt , so excited . I mean , every guy I know has it . But when my package shows up , I get a shirt with one wolf and half a moon . What ? I call , I 'm on hold , guy finally picks up but he 's from tech support , no I do n't need you , I need my shirt , he switches me over , I 'm on hold , the music is torture , it 's that skinny yet alluring euro-trash guy from american idol . Finally I get somebody and they tell me the shirt is on backorder and that this is all I can get . I swear I 'm ready to cry . They just wo n't give it to me ! I know they have it ! What is this , a quest or something ? Why is being a guy so tough in this world . Fine , I 'll be the one dude in my town without this epic shirt , look at me like I 'm a looser all you want , but no more putting your hand on my bar stool when I sit down , cause it seems I did n't make it into your he-man club !
 I was overjoyed to stumble upon this t-shirt . I had always known that something was missing from my life and this is it . I quickly bought one for my wife and kids . But to my horror I discovered that I was n't able to get one small enough for my cat . Obviously with my family wearing these bad ass Three Wolf Moon shirts my cat is now afraid . When ever we walk into a room it cowers in fear and refuses to come out . Tibbles is a huge part of my life , possibly more than my wife , so seeing her -LRB- the cat , not my wife -RRB- so distraught when she sees me in my favourite t-shirt is heartbreaking . I want to make her feel part of the family again -LRB- again , not my wife -RRB- so I thought I could get her one of these epic tees too . To my abject horror I recently discovered that the xs size was too big for Tibbles . She climbed a tree festooned with her new wolf man shirt , but it snagged on a branch and now I dont know what to do . Why has this happened to me ? All I wanted was for my cat to feel the love she deserves .
 I find this shirt very offensive . I mean , why do people always depict wolves howling at the moon.Hi , I 'm a Werewolf , and it sickens me when people do n't take into account the other great things that we do . We are really good at marking our territory -LRB- trees and fire hydrants -RRB- , dig holes , bury our victims , scratch our head with our feet , and can survive anything save of coarse silver bullets.Personally , I would n't be so upset about this oversight is only there were shirts for us werewolves depicting humans doing what they do best ... tasting delicious . I 'm not sure how best to convey this ... oh , maybe a scratch and taste shirt ! Mmmm
 Do not purchase if you are planning on exiting the Earth 's atmosphere . The consequences will be catastrophic . Whatever you do , do not step foot on the moon while wearing this shirt .
 Upon wearing this shirt , several things occurred in short order :1 -RRB- My hair went gray and frizzy .2 -RRB- The black jersey fabric immediately became covered in dog fur . I do n't have a dog .3 -RRB- I bought VIP tickets to a Renaissance Fair.I 'm sending it back as soon as I can find the `` Returns '' tab .
 Simple math.This shirt summoned me to purchase it not but some time ago . Yonder . I wore the shirt for a day , felt good about it , and then placed said shirt in my closet overnight . I woke up the next day , and come to find out , the wolf shirt raped and murdered all my other shirts . This was a sign from the wolf god , Owayodata , to never forsake the shirt . Now Oway -LRB- I call him that for short b/c we tight -RRB- tells me what to do while I wear the shirt at all times including showers , baths and dumps.I will give you an example . The other day an old lady was crossing the street and I felt it was my duty as a shepherd of Owayodata to help her across . Oway says to me `` Think of the shirt '' . So instead of physically helping her across , I just keyed any car that dared interject . When the offending parties would leave their vehicles , I would simply howl at the moon , dig my nails deep into my neck until copious amounts of blood flowed profusely , and then excrete onto the street . The motorists would hastily retreat and go about their day.I have worn the shirt for a month straight now and it has merged with my skin . Hair grows through the shirt , and the shirt bleeds and possesses its own set of genitals . Soon I will be unable to function and will assimilate to the shirt 's wont . The shirt will infest my body at a genetic level , and will look to procreate with other three wolf shirts . The army assembled shall be ruthless . Resistance will be met with execution . The shirt will ravage our planet .
 Yes , it 's a beautifully designed shirt.However , wolves are harbingers of evil , and are creatures of Satan.I oppose this shirt .
 I bought this shirt 4 weeks ago . My life has been a living hell ever since . After reading all of the glowing reviews I had no choice but to get it ! I waited impatiently for about 4 days and then It ARRIVED ! I was so happy ! I knew that this shirt would help me score with the ladies . I slicked back my hair with some vaseline , dumped and entire bottle of Stetson cologne on the shirt and headed out for what I knew would be an unforgetable night at the Local Boot Scoot . When I got there I was immediatly attacked by women , they were all over me , danceing , rubbing , touching , It was truely amazing . Thats when Darla Mayberry approached me and asked me if I wanted to go out to her minivan . HELL YEAH i wanted to go ! We went outside under the full moon and that is the last thing I remember until the next morning and I woke up covered in blood with Darlas severed head on the pillow and her entire left arm in my mouth . I had obviously turned into a werewolf and devoured her . Thanks allot wolfshirt , now Im wanted by the FBI for questioning and have been on the run from the law for over 3 weeks . This shirt is dangerous , do not buy it !
 Who would buy this piece of trash?Because , if you had n't already noticed , it now comes in SLEEVELESS format.Sleeves are for wimps.Please , do yourself a favor and grow a pair and surf on over to the sleeveless offering now.Because in order to do TRUE collatoral damage , you must have the guns exposed.KAPOW !
 I purchased the Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt with the sole purpose of warding off the town bullies -LRB- almost everyone in my town in Jefferson , West Virginia , including girls , have either hit me , pushed me , thrown something at me , tripped me , laughed at me , or just verbally attacked me -RRB- . After reading all the reviews saying how this shirt will help me not only in attaining some kind of extra strength to fight people with but also how it will force women to be attracted to me , I decided to take the plunge and buy it . I splurged and ordered it Next Day Air so I could wear it immediately.The next day the box was delivered . Although I was extremely excited as I opened the box -LRB- I was visibly shaking and could hear my own teeth chatter -RRB- , I was also skeptical like FBI Agent Dana Scully from the X-Files . Slightly trembling I slid the shirt on . It fit snugly against me . Though it looked Awesome -LRB- amazing details on the wolves and the moon -RRB- , I felt nothing exceptional until I looked closely at the faces of the wolves , howling . I saw an intensity I had never before experienced , along with raw animal emotion and a oneness with the natural world , especially a oneness with the moon . I could start to feel something , a sense of self esteem I 'd never felt before in my life . I felt the spirit of not one but all three wolves enter my heart . I felt like a lone wolf . But with the power of three -LRB- which makes it three times better than the `` Breakthrough Wolf T-Shirt '' which I was about to buy before seeing the Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt . -RRB- I felt like an animal.Now it was time to take the Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt for a `` test drive '' around town.Immediately upon leaving the front door to mother 's barn some of the usual bullies I deal with on a daily basis were upon me -LRB- some of the neighborhood kids who use mother 's field as a baseball diamond after school -RRB- . One of them punched me in the stomach - hard . I toppled to the ground , out of breath , wheezing , then , finding the spirit of the three wolves within me I stood up , placed my forearms together in front of my face in standard spell incantation technique , breathing hard , and screamed with all of my might
 People were seen wandering aimlessly away from their homes after donning this shirt . Three days later , their heads fell off , and great gouts of flies emerged from their skulls.Eventually , the headless bodies tripped , and spent a few days writhing about on the ground , making walking motions.Then they were still .
 I think I got a defective shirt.When I opened the box it jumped out and bit me -LRB- hard -RRB- which is not what I was hoping for based the other customer 's experiences that I had read.I say it is defective because it is n't shaped like the shirt in the picture , it has four arms and a tail ... what am I supposed to do with a tail on a sweet shirt ? I figured that I could wash it to get it to stop barking and maybe shrink it up so I can look so good when I 'm polishing my Camaro but I ` ven been kinda dizy since first layin eyes on it -LRB- the town Doc says I got the rabies but i say I got the spirit of the Wolf in me ! -RRB- I ordered the Tiger shirt so I should be set until my wolf shirt replacement is in stock .
 I really do n't care for wolves , but I bought this shirt for the awesome moon image . To me it looks like the real thing and I thought it would bring me luck at my NASA astronaut interview . I got not one single comment about the awesomeness of the moon image , and I was not selected for this years astronaut corps . What a ripoff.Hopefully it will give me better luck at my Walmart greeter interview next week .
 As awesome as this shirt may be , I have had some encounters ranging from strange to all out evil ! For instance after wearing the shirt I have become absolutly nosedeaf to my own smell . Where once I smelled of Funjuns and Creamsicle Shasta , all i could smell is meat and pine needles.My sense of sound keeps me awake all night and i have an uncontrolable urge to go outside and mark my backyard as the basement is no longer and option . The shirt has caused great strain on my family as my mother has threatened to put me out on the street if i do n't stop leaving dead birds on the porch . She just bought a HD tv and I just bought Twilight bootleg from my buddy Stan , and it would suck if I could n't use the new tv . After many attempts to take it off it has now fused with my skin , and I swear it is talking to me in some Nordic-like language that i do n't fully understand ! The hair on my knuckles which is quite full as is , has gotten darker and itchy . This would n't be as bad if I were a man , but it 's really messing up my social life . I have a skin graft appointment next week and it is my only hope ! Please do n't buy this shirt , it is evil !!
 So after a week of anxiously awaiting the arrival of my wolf shirt could n't wait to try out its magical properties.So after putting on the shirt and admiring myself in the mirror for several hours I decided to head out the streets ... or as I like to call it `` Going on the Prowl `` After spotting my first target aka a `` Foxy '' Lady , I headed over to her and put this shirt to good use . While attempting put my wolf like moves on her , I got peppered sprayed in the eyes!What 's up with that ? I give it a one star for awesome shirt . But nothing more . Be warned this shirt has powers beyond my comprehension .
 I gave this shirt to my younger brother for his 30th birthday and his life was finally looking up ... or so it seemed . With this shirt 's help , he managed to quit smoking , lost weight , and got himself a girlfriend . He and those wolves became inseparable.His improved health and social life prompted him to go camping in the woods in Alaska . This was his great mis-step . Sarah Palin came out of no where and shot him in the chest three times from a helicopter -- one time per wolf . This event demonstrates the downside of the three-wolf t-shirt . One wolf shot he might have been able to survive , but with three wolves , well , he died on the spot.CONS
 The ` Three Wolf Moon ' T-Shirt is their replacement for the excellent ` Four Wolf Moon T-Shirt ' , which I owned until my washing machine broke . I ca n't imagine ever being more annoyed then when I saw the shirt was missing a wolf . I mean everyone knows it takes four wolves to have a official `` wolf party '' . Alos would it kill ya to add a little real blood on the t-shirt to add some realism?Let 's start with the bad :1 . They seem to have replaced the original moon with a fuzzy picture of the earth . While I have never looked down on the earth from outspace -LRB- except in a dream one time . In that dream my feet grew wings and my head was that of a caterpiller . -RRB- Anyway I would assume the picture you used is what mother earth would look like if you where on the moon looking down or in a room with wonderful heavy glue fumes with no venting .2 . They changed the cotton material on the newer version and it keeps getting hung on my mustache .3 . I ran into a witch at the mall today -LRB- I could tell she was a witch because she wore black & smelled of cats -RRB- and she told me that three wolves have no magical powers at all and that I was screwed if I did n't draw another wolf on myself -LRB- which I did with a black marker -RRB- . Now the shirt has some class .4 . No where on the label did it say `` possible skank magnetism '' because it really seems to attract them -LRB- which one more wolf would have solved that problem -RRB- .5 . Was the shirt suppose to come with a cigerette burn in it ? If so then kudos to you because that was unexpected and much appreciated .6 . Adding a `` turbo '' button in the next version would make it really awesome -LRB- times ten -RRB- .
 Since wearing this shirt , I have developed an intense craving for raw meat . I 've noticed that road kill intensifies this craving . Also , much to my dismay , I am spending a considerable amount of time cruising the meat section at my local supermarket , licking my lips and making low , gutteral noises . Raw steak does n't taste too bad.I threw the shirt away a week ago hoping my strange symptoms would go away . However , I had twice knocked over the garbage can and ripped through the contents hoping my shirt was still in there before I tracked the truck that hauled it away by following its scent , but my shirt is nowhere to be found . I growled and snapped at the driver , only to have him call the dog warden on me . What a chase that ended up to be.I dont recommened this shirt , but I do recommened steak tartar .
 As an eco-friendly animal rights activist , I am always looking for the latest thing to express my pride in being a good steward of mother earth and ALL of her creatures -LRB- Specieism is just as wrong as racism and sexism - NOBODY DENIES THIS -RRB- . Anyway , I thought I would order this shirt for my next trip to the Shambhala animal preserve -LRB- proud member of the Friends of Shambhala , thank you -RRB- , and was about to hit `` Add to Cart '' when I noticed the following in the description : `` Features a leather feel label so comfortable there is never a need to cut it out . `` This is UNACCEPTABLE . Even though the `` leather feel label '' is not actually leather , it 's just as exploitative . Imagine the outcry if some product sold on Amazon were advertised as made with `` cloth that feels like a skinned black man '' or was advertised as `` feels like a real woman 's vagina '' . Yet , here is a product which purports to give a true to life sensation of a butchered and skinned cow hide across your neck , and somehow this is supposed to be okay.This might as well be the Middle Ages . I embrace the coming apocalypse of man which will restore balance to the planet .
 After seeing great reviews of this shirt I decided I would save up the $ 9.94 over the next couple months to buy this amazing piece of clothing . I was very excited to receive it but after 24 hours had passed it still had n't come in the mail . I could n't believe the slow delivery time . After 5 whole days it finally came and I should have saved up the extra $ 1.23 for insurance because it came D.O.A. . That is right my three wolf moon was dead in the box . I picked it up and all I had has a black shirt with a tag hanging off it . NO WOLVES ... NO MOON ... NO POWER SHIRT !!!! I could n't believe it . When I called customer support to ship me the missing aforementioned wolves and moon I had to wait for three hours on hold while listening to soft rock over the phone . Finally after going through hours worth of automated services I finally reached a technical support member . I think I knew more about shirts , wolves , or even moons then this guy did . I am not even sure he was from this country . After describing my problem he said he had never heard of this issue before and called me and idiot . I could n't believe how rude tech support was . After troubleshooting step by step with no successful results he finally just said that I could ship it back and get it replaced for the price of shipping and handling . Well that the problem shipping and handling both ways cost more than what the shirt does . How am I supposed to afford that ?! Buyer Beware . Stay away from the Three Wolf Moon or any other products by Three Wolf Moon ! It 's cheap foreign garbage!PROS - Wolves are cool -LRB- that is if they actually make it on your shirt -RRB- , black background of the shirt , made from cotton.CONS - NO WOLVES ! NO MOON ! NO TECH SUPPORT!Afterthoughts - After having my mother wash the shirt a few months later She showed me that if I turned the shirt inside out there actually was in fact wolves and a moon on it . I do n't know why these silly foreigners would sew wolves on backwards in a shirt becuase you really need to show them off . I guess that is what happens when you have a backwards foreigner put backwards wolves on your shirt . I will probably be buying a second one though , maybe one with a cobra on it this time .
 After purchasing the Three Wolf Moon T-shirt for my boyfriend just yesterday , I have already gotten pregnant 3,255 times.Bad buy .
 I was disappointed that they do n't offer this shirt in my size . I was looking forward to howling at the moon with some ladies , but this shirt left me with a mid-drift that failed to help me attract any action at my family reunion . I 'm returning this and plan to go back to my Homer dress -- so much more comfortable !
 I have to say that after reading all about this magical shirt I decided to get one . Finally arrive on the mail and I started to use it . All the hype turn out to be true ... . I look so hot and strong that I almost ca n't believe it . The down side is that my IQ drop a 100 points when I wore it , but who needs the brains when you got the looks right?Anyway ... . the real problem start when one tragic day I decided that if I get all this power just by wearing the shirt what would happen if I some how consume it ? would I get all this power at once and turn into a god ? well is worth the shot I guess ... After some carefully consideration I choose to put the shirt into the blender with some Tuscan whole milk -LRB- of course -RRB- and then consume it like some kind of super natural magical smoothie . At first I did not feel too special but after a few minutes ... . OH MY GOD WHAT A RUSH !!! I get all this raw power and massive sex appeal !!! I now can shoot lightnings out of my behind , get all the lady 's , fly like an eagle , turn into a huge titan , last for days , and so on . My IQ is still down a 100 points but who cares ... I fell like some kind of god !!! a better god ... . a god that only cares for himself and his needs , not one of those given and merciful gods that everyone talks about.The down side is that all that came at a price ... . I 'm now a hopeless addict to the power of the shirt ... . since the effect disappear a couple hours later I have to consume a massive amount of shirts a week to feel this way all day . As a result my finances are bad ... . so bad that pretty soon I 'm gon na have to sell my house to be able to afford this dangerous but awesome vice.I try to summon the forces of the Three Wolf Moon Shirt to help me but they refuse since by now I have destroy so many shirts ... . Guess I 'm screw now : -LRB- My name is Luis and I 'm an shirtoholic !!!
 After reading all the phenom reviews I was expecting a super duper shirt , but all I got wearing this was howling wolf-poops . Glad I did n't buy the howling wolf pack shirt . Do n't buy this shirt
 I totally used to have this shirt but then I had to put it in a chest and bury it on a deserted isle because it was leaking radiation , causing a nuclear facility near me to be mistakenly shut down . Before I hid this mighty piece of apparel , I took it to a top nuclear research laboratory where I was told the leaking radiation was due to the glowing aura of awesomeness emanating from the shirt . Apparently , it was permeating the atomic structure of surrounding elements in the environment , and disintegrating the subatomic structures , thereby effectively causing a maelstrom of highly reactive positron and quark emissions . Perhaps God could have overcome this drawback if he had designed this shirt with less wolves .
 Nuts , I though this was 3 wolfs howling at Keith Moon - sort of an old Who reunion pic , cause Entwistle and Townshend used to look sort of wolfish . Turns out that big round thing is n't a drum - what the heck ?
 Yeah so I thought this shirt was going to be so sweet ... I bought this shirt and this shirt has nearly been the complete unraveling of my being . Since buying this shirt I have been spending too much time out with the ladies . Ladies can not get enough of this shirt thankfully I ordered it in quantity of 7 so that I could wear one everyday of the week . The ladies are always tearing at me and tackling me because of the magnetism that this shirt possesses . I can not sleep I can not eat I 've lost my job due to a lack of sleep ladies leave me along please .
 This shirt does not have a confederate flag on it . Everyone knows that wold shirts have to have a confederate flag on them . This one does n't . What does it have on it . A big round disc . What flag has a big round disc on it . The Japanese flag . WWII taught us not to trusst them . Dont wear this shirt with Japanese wolves on it.The south will rise again .
 My THREE WOLF MOON SHIRT ADULT SIZE M came without instructions and to date I have yet to see it do anything . I am very dissapointed and will not be buying any more software from this company .
 i made a critical error in my ordering of the three wolf moon shirt . i ordered two . no one can understand the power and havoc that they have wrecked . when i opened the box that they were shipped in i was knocked unconscious by a wave of energy that i can only describe as the two moons on the two shirts pulling the blood in my veins to opposite sides of my body like the ocean tides . i was knocked out cold . i woke up with no electricity in the house and was extremely dehydrated , thank goodness for my backup gallon of tuscon whole milk that i keep behind my collection of donny and marie osmond records . when my eyes adjusted to the darkness i felt ok and noticed the shirts were defective . one had only two wolves and the other had four . i started looking for a flashlight and when i returned to the shirts , one shirt had one wolf and the other had five . i crapped myself and passed out . when i woke up three days later i felt like a pack of wolves ran over my entire body with stiletto heels , and i threw up my milk . both shirts had three wolves . they have been separated . i am giving one to a friend and we will not wear them together . i hope i get a chance to feel the true power of the three wolf moon shirt when i get the courage .
 Please avoid this product ! I bought this shirt -LRB- large ... I used to fit into medium but then I married someone who is a great cook , especially her baked macaroni and cheese , which I ate twice a day -LSB- it 's not a good breakfast because it causes gas -RSB- for a year and a half , and I gained forty-five pounds , so now I have to get the large -RRB- and something came in the night and bit my chihuahua , Nancy , wait , no , it was my stepbrother , Jeff , and now he is out all night whenever there is a full moon and comes back with blood on his shirt -LRB- not a wolf shirt , just a regular t-shirt from Abercrombie and Fitch -RRB- . I think it 's because this shirt has a full moon on it . It 's just a coincidence that it also has wolves on it . So do n't buy this shirt unless you do n't like your dog or stepbrother . But I do recommend Tide for your washing machine . It works well on blood stains .
 Many of you have come here believing that the Three Wolf Moon Shirt would bring you unparallel success , riches beyond your wildest dreams , super human powers , women , and some who thought this shirt would fix impotence , hair loss , regrow missing teeth or cure gonorrhea , syphilis , and the like . You have been grossly misled . The inventor of this shirt has sold you a false bill of goods . I have first hand knowledge that all proceeds from the sales of Three Wolf Moon Shirts have been being invested in to the research and development of a super shirt the likes of which man kind has never seen . This super shirt is a combination of Three Wolf Moon Shirt , White Tiger Head , Eagle with Salmon in Talon , Panther on Branch , Wizard Holding Staff in one hand Crystal Ball in other while simultaneously being struck by lightning , Rattle Snake coiled with gaping mouth , and Single Wolf/American Flag shirt . The one who possesses this shirt has the power to unlock a portal to a parallel universe where Wal-Mart rules the world . Once the portal is unlocked the `` Wal-Martians '' will be able to make it through and destroy our planet . This shirt is only the first part of an intricate plot to destroy our planet !!! Do not purchase the Three Wolves Shirt and if you already have it must be destroyed !
 Do n't buy one of these shirts used . I picked one up at a church swap meet in Orange County just before last Thanksgiving without knowing the shirt had been donated by Pastor Rick Warren . Unlike the rest of you , for some reason I did n't get wolf powers . Instead , I 've become a fatuous , over-fed windbag .
 I was vacationing in Pueblo , Colorado , so of course I purchased this shirt for the trip so I could fit in with the natives - nothing worse than looking like an obvious tourist - never know when a one-eyed gypsy child might sneak up on you and try to steal your wallet , which is why I highly recommend aFabric Waist Pack Many Colors!since it offers far more protection from theft and provides lumbar back support as well.I decided to visit the Ancient Pueblo Cave Dwellings and I felt very confident that I was totally incognito and no gypsies would harass me . I was then able to focus on my main mission
 They need to make this shirt with a collar . How can I pop my collar when there is no collar to pop ?
 Ladies , Beware!My dear husband told me once that he thought wolves were cool so I thought this shirt would make an ideal gift for him.I should have read these reviews more carefully . I had no idea of the true power of the TWM.He of course loved it and I have to admit he looked very handsome , but then it turned weird . He refuses to take it off . He even started wearing it under his work uniform keeping it unbuttoned so that his wolves could be `` free '' < -- his words verbatim.I keep finding mysterious new purchases around our home such asSex Panther Cologne Anchorman 1.7 ozandChicken Soup for the NASCAR Soul.The new Burt Reynolds-esque mustache has me concerned for his safety . He works in Detroit and I fear that the combination of TWM , BR mustache and Sex Panther Cologne is a recipe for disaster.When he finally has to take it off I am going to burn it like I did his threadbare Bauhaus shirt years ago . Maybe he will be free then , but I fear that the effects may linger even after the shirt is destroyed . Or worse yet ... can it even be defeated ?
 Jean-Pierre and I LOVE to have our monthly Redneck Night . We put on our tight jeans , our silver-tipped cowboy boots , and our big David Allan Coe hats . We stock up on Marlboro 's , Red Man , lite pork rinds and Zima -LRB- longnecks , of course -RRB- . We even get Duchess and Fifi into the act with spiked pitbull collars . We strut our stuff into the Bubba Room and watch our favorite redneck movies
 I wanted to believe SO badly.I 'm a middle aged gay guy , and I 've long accepted that my best clubbing days were over . But then a straight friend told me about the great results he was getting with Three Wolf Moon . A lot of my younger gay friends are slightly feminine , and I would n't mind having them throw themselves at me . Plus my Grindr picture needed updating -LRB- it 's from 1992 -RRB- , so I figured `` What the heck '' . I was anxious to get my hands on the shirt so I sprung for next day shipping . But in my haste I did n't bother to research Three Wolf Moon . The next afternoon when UPS showed up with the box I eagerly carried it into the kitchen . I did n't want to open it in the living room as packing peanuts and cardboard shreds are difficult to get out of my antique Navajo rug . I always loved the contrast the ancient woven art provided with the limited edition modernist lithographs I had on the walls . But of course that was before Three Wolf Moon.When I opened the box and removed the shirt I was unimpressed . It certainly was n't my taste , but there have been occasions when Details has missed a trend and I did have straight friends claiming spectacular results . I decided to give it a try . I removed my Hugo Boss shirt and slipped on Three Wolf Moon.Immediately it just seemed ... wrong . It itched . It had neither the plush natural feel of my favorite pasture raised , hand massaged wool sweaters , nor the feel I was used to from manmade materials like Lycra . And it made my jeans feel strange . When I looked their label had even changed from Armani to something called `` Wrangler '' . I felt woozy . But I 'm nothing if not game , so I decided to head down to the local gay bar , Backpackers , to give my new shirt a whirl.On my way to the garage I noticed the Navajo rug had changed to some sort of avocado acrylic shag . And my paintings , my beloved `` Klees '' and `` de Groots '' , had all been replaced by a single poster of some band I 've never heard of . Van Hefflen , or Van Halen ... `` Van Something '' . I do n't know.By this time I was becoming upset and disoriented . But the worst was yet to come . My car keys were still hanging by the garage door but the keychain had changed . It now said `` Mopar '' , which is evidently a contraction of the words `` Motor '' and ` Parts '' . And when I opened the door , instead of my stylish Mercedes CLS350 I was confronted with something hideous . Something not of this world . It looked vaguely like the Dodge Omni a maid I once employed had driven . A maid I let go when I found she had been stealing sips from my Distillers Edition Dalwinnie when she should have been polishing the Baccarat . But it was an Omni bred in an unholy union with a low end Japanese pickup . Later I would find it 's something called a `` Dodge Rampage '' . But at the time I merely called it an `` abomination '' . I needed air so I decided to take the abomination and continue my trip to Backpackers . I figured that no matter how distraught I was over the inexplicable changes going on around me , I would at least be cheered by the adoration of a bar full of twinks . Oh sweet irony . How was I to know I had stumbled into a gay version of `` The Twilight Zone '' . All courtesy of Three Wolf Moon . For when I walked into the club I was indeed mobbed . But by LESBIANS ! And when I turned my head and looked into the mirror behind the bar I saw that my lovely coiffure , for which I had paid $ 200 to Stephan of Buckhead just days earlier , had been replaced by a MULLET!Three months have passed . That night I met my life partner , Stevie . She and I immediately moved into her mobile home 40 miles east of Gadsden . Now I live with 3 ferrets , a flock of chickens and more cats than I can count . I do n't get out much anymore , and it was only tonight that I was able to get the AOL dial up working so I could post this review . It 's too late for me but I 'm hoping I can reach some of my fellow gay men with my cautionary tale . If you 're taking a break from online porn and stumble on an offer for Three Wolf Moon , hit `` escape '' as quickly as you can type and head back to a chat room for anonymous sex . It 's so much safer .
 This shirt has done NOTHING for me ! Well , except for a damn tag in my face all day ! I have had no women all over my junk . I have not experienced any magical powers of any sort . Kind of tight on the front of my neck , but loose on the back , weird . I tried howling when I was wearing it , but just got looks . None of the good has come with this shirt except for the fits the girth well thing , that one was perfect . I will keep trying this shirt for a couple more weeks to see if my luck changes , but as of now no luck for me . I do sometimes get a quick look , but then it turns to confusion and they look away . Hmm ... ** UPDATE ** - So I have noticed something with this shirt ... My back muscles are getting huge ! I do n't know what it is , but more to come .
 When I first saw this three wolf moon shirt , I could feel my excitement growing . As I work for a wolf rescue organization called Loco for Lobos and had been trying to find a way to impress my boss and work up to asking her out . This was not your typical wolf shirt and I have seen them all . This was the one gift that would impress her enough to win her favor and get her to agree to go out with me.Once I had made the order , I could hardly wait until the moment I could place it in her lovely hands and see the appreciation on her face . Finally , it arrived . The next morning at work I went in early so I could leave it on her desk . It would be the first thing she would see as she began her day.She noticed the package immediately and proceeded to open it . My heart pounded with anticipation . I knew instantly by the look on her face that she too could see the exquisite beauty of this shirt . She was anxious to try it on.Within minutes she stepped out of her office proudly modeling her new shirt . It struck me at once how nicely she filled it out . I could n't take my eyes off of it . Suddenly , I noticed whispering and hushed giggles coming from the rest of the staff . At that point , I realized what was causing this reaction . One wolf head and the moon were awkwardly situated directly over each of her voluptuous bossoms.My plan was beginning to unravel . I had to do something quick . Not wanting her to be embarrassed , I feebly attempted to point out the problem . At which point , she became horrified , slapped my face and stormed back into her office.Needless to say , I was not satisfied with this purchase and am returning the slightly stretched shirt and looking for a new job .
 First , let me say that our dryer is new -LRB- bought two months ago -RRB- and has never acted strangely . After the first time washing this shirt , however , I noticed something unusual . All the other shirts and socks that had accompanied the wolves shirt during the drying process came out with mysterious bite markings . One shirt was deemed useless by the damage , and several socks looked more like waded hunks of frayed cotton . The only item left untouched was - well I wo n't even insult your intelligence ; I 'm sure you 've already guessed it . Anyway , be forewarned , the instructions may say `` use gentle cycle '' , but the wolves are quite rough , regardless ...
 I had the Mountain Two Wolf MoonT-shirt and everything was clean as a broke-dick dog . I heard the hype about tri-wolf so I ordered the upgrade . DONT DO IT ! I hosted a clambake and the shirt ruined the whole affair and my girl went awol for like a week . It turns out I do n't have the technical requirements to support three wolves and would have to start over from scratch to make this work . Do n't believe the hype . Three wold is n't for everyone .
 First of all , I got SICK and TIRED of sifting through all these reviews about how all of these men are receiving mystical powers from the one and only Three Wolf Moon shirt , only to find that not a single female has dared to try this on for size . I have n't gotten laid in over 10 years since my backside takes up nearly half of my double-wide , so I had little hope that this would work for me . hey , if you have n't gotten any in over a decade , would n't you give this a try out of desperation ? I 've ordered male prostitutes , and they all ran when they saw my green toenails and what 's left of my teeth and the fact that I have more chins than Chinatown.I was skeptical at first , but I figured I only get to live once , so I took the plunge last month , and ordered this in a 10XL with overnight shipping.The shirt arrived the very next morning , and my fat little sausage fingers were shaking so badly out of anticipation of what this shirt had in store for me as I tore the package open . I took the shirt and brushed one of the wolves against my arm , and felt an immense warmth and sensuality overcome me . I could barely stand it any longer , so I put it on and ... WOW ! Is all I can say.Still , it did n't feel girly enough , so I took some scissors and cut some fringes on the bottom and sleeves of the shirt , and got a bit creative with adding some plastic beads to some of the strands . All of a sudden , I felt this shirt get even larger on me , I was curious and I looked in the bathroom and gasped at how I suddenly lost 1,500 lbs . I sold my forklift that I used to get to and from Wal-mart , slicked my mullet back with a dab of Crisco shortening -LRB- Hey , I 'm poor OK ? -RRB- and put on some Lee press-on nails and headed down to my local truck stop.I immediately met my significant other , Elmer Cletus , and he took me in his truck and we , you know ... we also smoked a ton of crystal meth and stayed awake for days . Before I knew it , I was pregnant with triplets -LRB- coincidence ? -RRB- . Then one day , the magic disappeared when I got a stain on the moon from accidentally spitting out my SKOAL prematurely , and I decided to put it in the washing machine , which I learned is a huge no-no . All of a sudden , Elmer left me and I gained all of my weight back . I rushed to go on Amazon to buy another one , and saw they were temporarily out of stock . I 've ordered this shirt again a few weeks later , and nothing happened . The magic was lost on me . I had nothing else to live for , but I choose to remain alive so I can forever cherish my fond memories of Elmer and I , though I know he knocked up my two sisters and will never return.I 've decided to start drinking Tuscan Whole Milk , 1 Gallon , 128 fl oz in addition to eating a whole fresh rabbit daily and my new Crystal Meth habit , and am slowly gaining my confidence back . Wish me luck !
 When I received this product and opened the package , I was instantly awed by it 's majestic and wolfie awesomeness . I snuggled with it for several nights , unable to even think of possibly unleashing something this fabulous on the general public . A few days later , I broke down and did wear it out of the house while attending bingo . And , nothing . Nada . NOTHING HAPPENED.Come to find out , this shirt only works when paired with the Wolf Urine Lure - 32oz ! I ended up having to purchase that seperately adding additonal cost including shipping!That being said , once they are coupled together , the sheer magnificence of this combo truly does stand out . People have fainted , wolves howl , deer run in fear . There was n't one person at the D&D ; convention who did n't comment on how fantastic I looked.So , do yourself a favor and buy the combo right off the bat . You wo n't be disappointed !
 I could only afford three shirts with my Amazon gift card , so I bought this one , another Mountain shirt and a carton of Tuscan Whole Milk . Big fat mistake.First off , I 've been drinking Tuscan Whole Milk for months and it has given me the power of the Tuscan cows so I can fight crime and stuff . When the package arrived in the mail I found that the Tuscan Cows must 've stampeded or something and the three wolves were trampled to death . I do n't want a shirt with dead wolves on it . It 's gross . The mailman was even kinda leery of it as there was blood dripping from the box.Anyway , my Breakthrough Wolf tee held up and might 've drunk all the Tuscan Whole Milk , since it was spilled all over the shirt ...
 I must say the shirt is Awesome ! Unfortunately i could not harness its power and when i bought it after being lonely for some time , the babes started falling off trees , my penis grew 1 inch magically , and i got a promotion . Everything i touched seem to turn to gold . I was on top of the world . Unfotunately , unlike the wolf , i got greedy . My cup fillith over and i found myself with jealous bitches and genital herpes . The shirt that brought magic and charisma had been my downfall . I lay wondering , how such a magical weapon could lead me to such chaos . If you buy this shirt , please dont abuse the power of the wolf shirt . I beg of you , please dont .
 I did * not * buy this shirt for any purpose whatsoever . It was given to me by a passing backpacker at 13,000 in the Colorado San Juans after my high-priced North Face duds were chewed to shreds by a pack of marmots . I was little prepared for the consequences . Upon my descent into Telluride , I was set upon by an angry fellow in an ORV , waving a handgun in one hand and a bottle of chablis in the other . I was a `` wolf-lover '' and an `` econut '' and a `` left-liberal '' etc etc etc. . Fortunately , it turned out that the bottle of chablis was his third for that afternoon , so it was quite easy to get the gun away from him . Furthermore , he was not a Native Coloradoan , but a California transplant , immigrated for the purpose of speculating in real estate . This fellow did n't understand that the cultural associations of this shirt are * not * what he thought they were , and that he was * not * impressing any of the locals by threatening dudes who wore such stuff . The * good * thing about the whole story was that his girlfriend was heartily sick of him , was willing to jump ship to any guy who got him out of her way and took her back to California , and she was * not * the type of babe you usually associate with this shirt , i.e. not smelly and flabby with teeth missing , jabbering about Sex in the City etc but pretty much the original Grace Slick sort.The first thing she did was tear up the shirt . But of course , by that time it had done the trick .
 This tee shirt is simply a waste of money . If you dont find this at a thrift shop you are wasting obscene amounts of money .
 I got this shirt to hang on my wall . I thought it would be perfect for rolling or tripping . NEG ! It is wack and does not glow in the dark or fluorescen under black light . Now all I got is a t-shirt with 3 wolves on it .
 Since i first donned this shirt , I have been overwhelmed by a desire to urinate in all the corners of my home . And yesterday , I growled at my mom when she told me to stop licking my privates . Come to think of it , i 'm thinking of changing my rating to five stars .
 I too purchased the three wolves t-shirt to bask in it 's awesomeness , however I am unable to wear this shirt to my job because of some dress codes or some junk . Any way I decided to put the shirt into the blender and make a smoothie out of it . I did n't have any Tuscan milk to mix with it at the time so I just mixed in some `` Blackberry Ridge favor '' Boones Farm I had in the fridge . I assume that the power of the shirt was absorbed though the skin somehow and if I were to eat it the power would be inside me . The drink was n't quite as smooth as I expected but after gulping it down I noticed an immediate difference . Hairs grew out all over my body , even in places you 'd think hair could n't grow . Women are not magnetically attracted to me , however the neighbor dogs are . They follow me around as if I can help them case cats or something , as now I sometimes feel the urge to do . I ca n't fly like some of the other reviewers but I do gnaw at my crotch from time to time . Maybe if there were only one or two wolves on this shirt and my body could handle it but I think the three wolves and the full moon just took things over the edge.All I can say is that there should be some type of warning on the label that tells you not to eat this shirt or something . I 'm hoping when all of it finally comes out the other end my symptoms will go away and I get back to normal . For now I just keep a electric shaver handy and avoid going outside in the full moon .
 WARNING ! Do n't be fooled by the reviews raving about this shirts powers to attract women ... they are only telling half the truth . I was obviously excited when I saw this shirt . The ability to attract women has constantly eluded me despite my perfectly groomed mustache and slender physique . My first night on the town with my sexy , chest hugging 3 wolf shirt was a huge success . Women were flocking to me like a Blue Collar Comedy Tour . I could n't believe how many sexy ladies wanted my body , and most of them had teeth . But then things went terribly wrong . I had picked up this really nice lady I found walking on the street . Somehow she knew that I was looking for a good time and said I could make HER howl at the moon . We parked at the local make-out graveyard to tongue wrestle when it happened . Just when I had gotten down to my tighty whites something started banging on the car . IT WAS DEAD WOMEN !!! They wanted to get with me and my 3 Wolf T-Shirt ! No one warned me that EVERY woman is attracted to the shirt . This shirt brings dead women to life ! The stench of these women was horrible . It was all I could do to keep from gagging during our group make-out . And dead people are extremely violent . I still have bite marks in unfortunate places . Do not buy this shirt if you are going to be around dead women . Consider yourself warned .
 I bought this shirt because who does n't want to kiss a girl , right ? But guess I 'll just have to keep on waiting , except for online . I wore this shirt out to a bar and sat there for like four hours and no one even talked to me ! I tried to talk to this one girl who was pretty but she just gave me that look my dad used to give me before he left mom , and then would n't turn around even after I kept poking her . Then she just got up and left . There is a good chance she did n't get a good look at the shirt , though . But this other girl did . She was like , nice dress , and I mean I did order it in XXL which is really big on me , even bigger than mom 's clothes , but how could anyone think this was a dress ?? You could see my cargo shorts and even if they were camoflauge LOL . Whatever . Do n't expect anything great from this shirt . I put mine on the dog and he loves it . He runs and runs and it looks like a batman cape !
 I am a longtime wearer and fan of wolves and wolf shirts . i even named my team at work -LRB- i used to clerk part time at the va hospital in monte visto city , i now collect disability full time -RRB- the WOLFPACK becaues wolves are the ultimate team players , the power of the wolf is in the pack and the power of the pack is in the wolf . BUT i mist display my anger with this item . firstly three wolves is too many . i am a lone wolf and three wolfs is two to many wolves . also they are singing in concert and anyone who has any knowledge of the wolf knows that wolfs sing in tandem , like boyz 2 men -- NOT all 4 one . seconly this shirt is far too small for my . i am big like a caddilac and i need a wolf shirt that covers my hood AND my grill . the craftsmanship and art of the shirt is high quality , however , and the stirtching held up to the worst i could put it through -LRB- in my anger at this pos wolfshirt i tried to tear it apart , it would not tear . -RRB- i for one will not be buying wolfshirts from the mountain again anytime soon . just my two cents from THE LONE WOLF ! OW-OOOOOOOOH !
 I believe this shirt is responsible for the demise of Kennedy , Elvis and Archduke Franz Ferdinand -LRB- who has three names . -RRB- It 's all about threes . As we all know , wolves are evil -LRB- remember
 So I got this wolf shirt because of , you know , the sweet wolves on it.However , having owned this shirt for three weeks now and having tried it out in a variety of situations , both formal and informal , I 'm beginning to believe that some of the benefits -- as described by other reviewers -- are exaggerated . For example , not ONE supermodel has approached me . Some of you may be used to having supermodels approach you on a regular basis but , believe me , I am not
 I am very disappointed and borderline furious with this item . After reading all the reviews , I was expecting miraculous wolf-like powers . I have worn the T-shirt many times and have yet to exhibit any skill at bounding through the woods or sniffing . My growling abilities still suck too . I had taken time off work for a camping trip with my wife , Claire , which we 'll have to cancel now . What 's the point of going when my sole goal was to run with my lupine brothers . As a test run I tried to introduce myself to a doberman and -- well let 's just say that could have gone better.As an interesting side-bar , when I wear this T-shirt I do have the ability to fly through the air which leads me to believe there may have been a mistake at the warehouse . I 'm guessing that there is some poor soul out there with a `` three eagles and the sun '' T-shirt who is equally as dissatisfied as he howls at the moon and gnaws on freshly killed fawn . I will be exchanging this item soon for a T-shirt that works in the manner I was hoping for .
 We are outraged and appalled that the makers of this logoed t-shirt would opt to adorn a t-shirt with something as dark and evil as the 3 wolves!The wolf is our sworn enemy . . not only has he repeatedly attempted B & E with my brothers and me , he has destroyed my two brothers ' houses with a lupine gale of wind , and tried to get into my specific residence through the chimney . It was only by the hair of our chinny chin chins that we narrowly escaped slow torture and certain death . Death that would have been committed slowly on a grill ... With a full bottle of KC Masterpiece.We are outraged and haunted by the images presented on this T-shirt . Now , my brothers and I will have to rejoin our Post Traumatic Syndrome therapy group . . I will have to shoot an email to Little Red Riding Hood about this , warning her about this horrific garment . It is truly a shame . She was making so much progress in her re-establishing her relationship w / her Grandma.Please reconsider the impact this shirt will have on the ovine community.Sincerely , The Three Little Pigs
 I bought this shirt from this site without reading the reviews and now , my life is pretty much over . It 's just me and my disability check in this cozy trailer from now on.It was just , like , I saw the shirt when I was looking to buy my boyfriend a gift for his birthday . The wolves ... they , like , called to me from the webpage and I pushed the one click button immediately . And when it arrived and I was wrapping it for my man , I kept touching it thinking , `` he is going to look soooooooooooooooooo hot in this shirt . Look at all those HOWLING WOLVES ! One wolf would have been pretty sexy , but three of them ? That 's so triple of the sexy!He loved it , of course , and then he went and wore it to the bar . Three days later , he came back to our trailer , packed his bag , and left me for one of the many ladies that were drawn to him and the `` magical '' shirt . Magical for him , maybe ... but not to ME . I 'm so lost without him.I hate you , wolf shirt .
 I had heard about the advantages of Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt , Available in Various Sizes
 I 'm a lawyer and I am ordering a stop to the sale and manufacture of this particular 3 Wolves 1 Moon , or as it is more commonly refered to in a court of law , the 3W1M shirt . I represent clients on a daily basis who have sued successfully on the grounds that this shirt has destroyed marriages , ruined childhoods and caused more than one person to lose their job.Not that I do n't appreciate the clientele , but it has gotten to a point that I ca n't handle anymore cases , not to mention the heartbreak of hearing another wife and mother come to my office to tell me about how their husband wore the shirt and turned into someone they did not recognize . Children have been abandoned as these men have left to `` sow their wild oats '' and `` find their roots '' . Many an Alabama town has been all but vacated as the men have left to `` fulfill their destinys '' . It seems odd that a large population of married men who have beer guts and mullets and often backne , would have the energy or wherewithall to go out `` on the prowl '' . It seems however that those very same mullets and beer guts are expediating this process . Almost as if this shirt and these men `` need '' each other to survive . I know this sounds ridiculous , but I must get this message out to the rest of the populace before this epidemic spreads.Cease and desist . Do not talk about this shirt and for godsakes do not review it and spread the disease .
 After reading all these great reviews , how could I not buy this shirt ? I mean , if even ONE of the great things that you guys experienced happened to me , then the shirt would pretty much pay for itself , right ? I was n't even hoping for anything as big as some of you guys got -- I just maybe wanted to have my goiters shrink up a little , or maybe fewer ingrown hairs on my upper lip . So I order the shirt , based on YOUR recommendations . And I open it up and , first of all , when you see the picture in real life close up , it becomes pretty obvious that it 's not an actual photo . I was pretty mad , but I figured , okay , I already spent the money , might as well put the shirt on . AND DID I HAVE THE GREAT EXPERIENCE THAT YOU ALL PROMISED ME ? NO !!!! 111 In fact , my pinky nail , which was black from when I slammed it in the gate at the tow lot , completely fell off . THAT 'S the `` MAGIC '' that I experienced . Your reviews are misleading and you should all burn in eternal fire for what you have done to me . I am suing all of you , and you can expect to hear from my lawyer , Skeeter , very soon .
 When it arrived in the mail , nothing . No special powers . No hot women were mindlessly attracted to me . Women actually avoided me and said they would call the police if I even made eye contact . I put the shirt on and people starting snickering and calling me racial slurs of all kinds . Not a happy camper , not at all . At work , my boss punched me in the stomach and then said , `` that 's what you get ! '' I could n't take the ridicule and starting crying like a 12 year old school girl at Justin Bieber concert . I 've had such a horrible time wearing this shirt that I 'm about to take it off and ... FML ! I have it on inside-out .
 this wonderful shirt for me for Christmas . I love the wolves howling at the moon , because inside I was quietly howling at the moon . My wife is pretty demeaning to me . So I thought I could only howl on the inside . But with this shirt , I had the confidence to howl on the outside.With my inner howling released I bought a new sports car and headed out with my shirt , car , and no kids to meet a girl -LRB- only a friend ? -RRB- at a local bar . To make a long story short , this girl couldnt control herself around my me with my wolf shirt . We are now in love . But my wife found out and I think she is upset . I may end up losing much money and my kids because of this shirt.So I leave the one star as a warning . Be careful . This shirt can get you in trouble , sort of like aligators chewing on your rear end . I think I will give the shirt away ... Sincerely , Jon minus Kate and eight kids .
 Okay , so ... I read a lot of the reviews here , and was really interested in getting in on some of the lady-action the other reviewers described . So when my shirt showed up , I was positively trembling with anticipation by the time I put it on.It worked ... Sort of . I mean , yeah ... it attracted women , all right . But they were all sort of stocky , and most of them had mullets and flannel shirts on . At first , I figured this was no big deal . I 'm not usually attracted to women who do n't wear eye makeup , but hey . Beggars ca n't be choosers.At least so far this was in keeping with what a lot of the other reviewers had to say . But when I tried to put the patented , never-fail moves on 'em , I got completely rejected . A lot of 'em seemed into it at first , but at the moment of truth , I got shoved away . And I 'm sorry ... But if some chick is gon na go to all the trouble of taking my pants off for me , it 's not exactly considered the nicest thing in the world to stop once she sees how `` excited '' I am . And it 's even LESS nice to attempt to kick me in the places that have barely begun to come out and breathe besides.I have no idea what their problem was , but they all had the same one . What kind of chick acts like she 's all into it , but then wo n't even touch you once you cross the point of no return ? I even offered to leave the shirt on . Well , I USUALLY like to do it with a shirt on anyway . I 'm sorta self-conscious about my man-boobs , but that 's why I was glad the shirt was black in the first place.Whatever .
 So after reading grand and glorious reviews relating this shirt to divinity and righteousness , I quickly purchased it with my last few remaining rubles.It arrived poorly packaged with few outer markings on the box to indicate the importance of its contents . The box was very small , not allowing the shirt to lie flat , and requiring this gem of power to be folded in a sacrilegious manner.Upon donning this long forgotten symbol of el-camino 's and pabst blue ribbon , I immediately felt the need to strike my wife in her mouthy hole because she just would n't listen to what I demanded . The exchange was abruptly ended by the arrival of the township police officers resulting in both of us being charged with domestic violence/assault . Within 3 months we subsequently had 4 children , all with mild retardation and/or learning disabilities . I was fired from my job as an investment banker and had to accept that it resulted from having a back injury . I was forced to accept the gracious gift of a Social Security Income as compensation for my years of societal burden I was about to offer . I lost my 4 bedroom home , BMW , and 401k after tax problems . I moved into a Winnebago behind my in-laws farm house , but soon found that open sewage draining into their pool was an unwelcome fortune.During the trial of my criminal matters , I wore this shirt . After making it very clear the -LSB- ... -RSB- was lying on the stand , I was again escorted from the court room in handcuffs . This shirt had some magical overtaking of my person that few could explain or understand . I am currently on probation for the next 3 years and am required to submit random alcohol screenings to my probation officer.I have since rebounded and purchased my own mobile home , a 1987 Chevy S-10 with iroc wheels , grown my hair to a glorious spiked `` mullet '' , and am working under the table as a roofer . My worthless ex-wife has slapped child support payments on me for the 4 children . I have 4 warrants for child support reareage , which will likely be served on my next probation meeting . I intend on wearing this shirt in hopes that the probation officer will just shoot me in the head on sight.Thanks Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt . I lost everything , gained nothing , and have grown a large beer belly because of you . I ca n't even fit into you anymore !!! The cruel cold irony will surely be the death of me .
 I received my Three Wolf Moon T-shirt while it was still green . Imagine my disappointment when I opened the package and , instead of wolves , I found myself looking at a crying Elvis . Since I already have a crying Elvis T-shirt hanging next to my bullfighter T-shirt , I planned on sending the Three Wolf Moon T-shirt back . Fortunately , it was several days before I could get to UPS to ship the shirt back.On the first night of the full moon my shirt finally ripened . Just before midnight I heard horrific noises coming from my closet . With great trepidation , I opened my closet and was blessed with the vision of three ravenous wolves tearing Elvis limb from limb . I guess he finally has something to cry about ! It took almost an hour for the wolves to finish feasting on Elvis before they took their permanent places on the shirt . Doubtless , much of the wolves ' power comes from having consumed the King and absorbing his essence . Unfortunately , they also consumed Elvis from my other shirt so I 'll have to buy a new one.If you buy this shirt and have it shipped overnight , be prepared to give it time to ripen.Only two stars ` cause they ate my Elvis .
 I am a man who walked the earth and did so for the past 200 years , I have no recollection of my origins but know that the northern forests once were my home . I came across a wise man in the desert plains who offered this shirt as a token of friendship , I have worn it ever since.Now , I 'm a bussiness owner with a Malibu mansion and a fleet of 1950 's to 1969 model Ferraris , women who pay me in the high 4 figures to lay with me and a private aircraft to get into my Tahoe retreat.Yes , the shirt gives you the richess of the earth , but now I know , that the price was my soul , and that the desert man was the evil one incarnated.Why 2 stars ? ... The Ferraris are pretty cool !
 After reading the reviews i ordered a dozen of these hoping to either bring my wife back from the dead or at the very least meet the wolf god who took her . Neither of these happened . Nothing has happened . Nothing ever happens , and I do n't know why expect online purchases to plug the hole in my heart . Nothing has , nothing will , and certainly not some wolves howling at the moon .
 I bought this shirt because it looked pretty sweet . I had not read anything about it back then.However , I made the mistake of wearing it to work last Tuesday . I had a disagreement with one of my coworkers , and I started to get a bit angry . The wolves reacted to my anger . They suddenly burst forth from my shirt and tore him from limb to limb , slowly eating his entrails while he watched in pain . They then opened a spirit portal to his home , and did the same to his family , as he watched . Once they had their fill , they came back through the portal , bit into his neck and suffocated him while I watched . After this they decreed my new name was Abenaki Delaware of the tribe of the wolf , and they returned to my shirt . Police arrived shortly thereafter.I am now in a mental health facility.Pros
 One issue I have with this shirt is the total lack of lightning . I will take the flying eagle with a stormy background shirt over this one any day . If it had three eagles , even better .
 I bought this shirt a few months ago but had to return it last week due to tragic circumstances.I wore it out and was promptly descended on by myriads of supermodels
 I bought this supposedly `` great '' shirt for my ex boyfriend back when he was n't an ex yet . He Lovvvvvvvved it ! He wore it to the grocery store to get a loaf of bread . Ha ! He got bread alright . He got himself a new girlfriend with the shirt I bought for that low life ! Yeah , and she 's younger , prettier , blonder , -LSB- ... -RSB- , makes more money , drives a nicer car , owns a nicer house and does n't even have a drug problem ! Whatever . Everybody LOVVVES the 3 wolf shirt . But only because you never think about those of us who are really HURT by this terrible Tee ! Thanks for nuthin 3 Wolves . I want a refund and a new boyfriend !
 So I bought this shirt expecting all the sweetness of chicks and power of gods and here 's what happened : First the box was very difficult to open , who has the strength to open these things?Next I put on the shirt expecting something magnificent , turns out I 'm allergic to the dye used and my body blew up twice the size of the shirt and ca n't get it off , its stuck on.My arm pits wont stop secreting a weird milk smell.The only girls that seem to want to talk to me are very large and hostile.I think I 'm just gon na stick with the kitten shirts thank you .
 I bought this shirt as Joke between me and my friends . I did not believe that this shirt would actually give me powers . However when I put the shirt on I instantly gained a six pack and could bench 500 lbs . I was putting on the shirt in front of my friends and they were all instantly killed by just how powerful and awesome this shirt is . I soon found out I could not take the shirt off . I tried everything to remove it , but no matter what it would not budge . I eventually stop trying and accepted it and began enjoying the power . When I walked down the street the most beautiful women would flock to me and would want to make love to me right there . The only problem with this was that I was gay and because so many women would flock to me all the other gay men thought I was straight . I eventually developed a thirst for caribou blood . Caribou are now on the endangered species list and once they are gone my thirst will turn into human blood . As I am writing this I lust for more blood . I only hope and pray that Chuck Norris reads this and decides to put me out of my misery .
 This is perhaps the most defective product I 've bought in my entire life :1 . Although it 's called `` Three Wolf Moon , '' when you get the t-shirt you quickly realize that these are n't real wolves , and that 's not a real moon . How dumb do they think we are ? 2 . Looking closer , the wolf heads are larger than the moon . It 's been a long time since my science classes , but I 'm pretty sure the moon is larger than a wolf 's head , is n't it ? I tried to Google `` how many wolves ' heads are in a moon ? '' , but I just got sent to some very disturbing websites . None of which answered the question , I might add . I mean , there must be at least five or six wolves ' heads in a moon . I dunno , maybe even a dozen.Anyway , I digress . The point is either the moon should be VERY , VERY BIG , or the wolves ' heads should be VERY , VERY TINY . Maybe both -- I 'm not trying to be difficult here .3 . The wolf on the left is higher than the moon . Can wolves really jump that high ? Should n't we see it jumping ? If so , where are the wolf legs in action?OK , here 's what I think . The wolf on the left is n't jumping , and is n't higher than the moon . There 's another moon higher up that the wolf is howling at . But they are SO CHEAP that they did n't even give us the higher , second , unseen moon . Or maybe they just ran out of environmentally safe , water based ink.I wore this t-shirt at my Advanced Introduction to Art Class at my community college , and everyone laughed at me . And it was n't because it clashed with my beret or my Birkenstocks . This just is n't good art !
 I bought this shirt for my boss for his birthday . I wanted to see if the so-called `` power '' it wielded could turn my boss into an even bigger pompous tool than he already is . Well , suffice to say I no longer just make his coffee , I have to make it & sing Ave Maria as I pour it in his cup at promptly 7:59 am every morning . -LSB- ... -RSB- wolf shirt .
 I felt slightly ripped off when I received my tee shirt orderonly to discover that the wolf images portrayed on the shirt were actually Siberian Huskys ! WTF
 Unable to avoid the viral fascination with the three-wolf shirt , or resist its allure , I dug out my own three-wolf shirt . That 's right , I did n't buy it here -LRB- sorry Amazon , hope I can still review it -RRB- because I already HAD one , in a box labeled `` clothes that Mom bought me - do n't give to Goodwill until she passes on , or becomes too senile to know the difference . `` I brushed the velour crumbs off of it , and tried it on . It was a bit like stuffing a watermelon into a banana peel , because I 've put on a pound or two since then , but I was able to lower my arms eventually , and keep them down for several minutes before my hands began to tingle.I strolled down to the capitol with it , to see if it would repel lobbyists , as the mystics have long suggested it would . Maybe lobbyists are cut from a different cloth now -LRB- this SHIRT certainly is n't ... made of ANY kind of `` cloth '' that is ... at least not according to the rash it 's given me , and my now-battered nipples -RRB- but they did n't seem to be intimidated by the shirt at all . They continued to surge toward me , thrusting shrimp at me . Although the three-wolf shirt proved to be a dismal failure in repelling lobbyists , the dribbles of cocktail sauce have improved the thing dramatically , adding a grisly touch that really seems to take the thing to the next level.Once I figure out a way to preserve the spilled cocktail sauce , so it does n't turn brown and wind up looking like Chipotle Adobo sauce -LRB- which would be TOTALLY inappropriate , obviously -RRB- , I plan to frame the thing , and hang it in my office , to keep aliens away .
 I purchased the ` Three Wolves ' t-shirt for my fianc&eacute; Mary as a one year anniversary present to celebrate our vow of chastity leading up to our marriage.You can only imagine my surprise when she came to me only days later and told me that she was with child . She tearfully swore that she had not broken her vow . Apparently , she had worn the ` Three Wolves ' tshirt in bed . God appeared to her that night in the form of Kevin Costner and they laid together . Her story was borne out by our doctor , who described Mary 's conception as nothing sort of ` miraculous ' . I have given the shirt only two stars , as although I am blessed to soon become the father of the Son of God , saviour of mankind , this is a little more than I expected when I purchased the tshirt . Furthermore , it is a shame the tshirt does not have more wolves on the sleeves .
 Do n't buy this shirt ! My name is Eric , but whenever I wear this shirt people call me `` Epic '' . So annoying !!!
 These reviews are so unbelievably lame . I send my friends here to laugh at you idiots . The shirt is stupid .
 I went on vacation to New Zealand a few weeks ago . Why ? Because after watching Lord Of The Rings for the fiftieth time with my Dungeons and Dragons group , I decided to go see the place where Gandalf and Saruman dueled at Isengard . Or see the real Barad Dur and Mount Doom.Well , let me tell you . New Zealand was a total drag . There was no Barad Dur . No Isengard . No Minas Tirith . All those way-cool scenes were made by some computer geek . So , yeah , there were pretty mountains , but no orcs , hobbits , or anything else . I went to the local tavern and asked where all the cool places were from the film , and they started laughing at me . Damn . And here I wasted all the money on plane tickets when I could have bought a suit of chainmail from this guy I know.But there were sheep . Lots of sheep . In fact , New Zealand has forty sheep per person . I did n't think much about it , until I went to the Otago Sheep Shearing Festival -LRB- Yeah , that 's their idea of fun down there . Not a role-playing game in the entire worthless country . Just lots of hiking , boating , skiing and other boring stuff -RRB- . Without thinking , I pulled out the 3 Wolves t-shirt and put it on.Well , I got to the sheep shearing festival , and could n't understand what was happening . The sheep kept running away ! They were n't cooperating with the shearers . They were leaping over the pens , frantically trying to get away . Everywhere I went , it was just sheer terror from the sheep -- and sheep are n't exactly the bravest animals to begin with . The Otago Sheep Shearing Festival was a total bust , all because of me . And the 3 Wolf Shirt.I am now a hated man in New Zealand . The American consulate had to get me out of jail , reminding authorities that there was no law on the books there against wearing a t-shirt with three wolves on it . But now there is . And they confiscated my shirt .
 The `` Three Wolf Moon Tee-Shirt '' by `` The Mountain '' is terribly lacking in Wolves . The Wolf per Dollar ratio on this shirt is way too low . Save your money on this one my friends . Most people prefer the `` Five Wolves Run Through the Forest Tee-Shirt '' by `` Cool Grafixxx '' or the `` Four Wolves Devour a Dead Stag Sleeveless Tee-Shirt '' by `` Mooncity Madmen Tees '' . If you go for the classics , like myself , opt for the `` Six Wolves Playing Poker Hoodie '' by `` Big Yuks Tees & Things '' . Remember , nothing says `` classy '' like the classics . . . and also maybe Ninjas . Ninjas are sooooo sweet . How cool would a `` Seven Ninjas Riding Wolves Tee-Shirt '' be ? That would score the most . I 'm going to make one of those right now . Can I borrow a Sharpie , a glue gun , some sequins and a pack of Slim-Jims ?
 bought this shirt because of all the positive reviews . wore it to a club in vegas . i was way too underdressed and nobody complimented me , despite wolves . waste of money . i hate you all .
 I bought this shirt thinking it was a joke . You know , it will be really funny to wear around the house , show to my family as an inside joke , etc. . Little did I realize all these complaints were true!First my voice got a little deeper . Since I just turned 30 , I thought nothing of it . Maybe this is normal , you can not have your girly childhood voice forever . But then the next thing I knew my face got all dark under my nose and I started growing facial hair . It 's so bad now ! Even on my chest !! I have to shave like a man . My husband is completely grossed out.Even worse , I keep getting hit on by women . I have n't worn this d *** shirt in over 3 months WHY ARE WOMEN STILL HITTING ON ME ! Though this shirt makes me seem like the love child of Ryan Gossling and Taylor Lautner , I can assure that I AM NOT ! If I am standing outside and the wind catches me , all the women who get a whiff of my draft just start charging outside . It is ridiculous , I ca n't even take my dogs for a walk anymore!And who knew you could grow an Adam 's Apple . My legs are bigger , I can leap over fences , and I can bench press my husbands weights.LADIES ! If you do n't want to morph into a man , then do NOT use this product .
 After reading all of the reviews , I was convinced that getting the Wolf Shirt would hook me up with the ladies . Not only has my luck with the ladies gotten worse -LRB- if that is possible -RRB- , Ive been physically attacked , chased by a crazy homeless person and even had feces thrown at me . This shirt has the opposite effect for me as most of the glowing reviews here . One person even mentioned having a large frame . Im in pretty good shape and just needed that something extra from the closet that would help me out with the chicks . This definitely was not it.If youre looking for an automatic chick magnet , this is not for you . If you just want a kick a $ $ lookin shirt , then I would say go for it .
 The image is lovely but , c'mon , it 's SO photoshopped . There 's no way they could have gotten wolves to pose like that .
 After I wore this shirt , I began to notice that most of my neighbors in the trailer park began to admire me more . As a result , my neighbors also purchased this shirt and we started our own wolf pack.Our pack was gained nothing but praise in our town but true wolves do not wander idley in such a civilized area . True hunters of the land prey in the most dangerous parts of the world , which was why our pack moved into the woods . After a few days , we found a pack of wolves and because of the power our shirts possessed , the wolves recognized us as fellow hunters of the wild . Our packs became one but after several days , our shirts became bound to our skin and would later on transform us into the ultimate predator , the werewolf.The creatures of the wild became to trival compared to the power we gained , which was why we preyed on the most dangerous creature , man . Our hunt on mankind was enthralling until one day we found a child weeping over the bodies of his parnets . That day we discovered that the shirts my pack wore did n't transform us into the ultimate predator , it transformed us into an abomination . After this revalation , I and everyone of the werewolves in our pack ripped off their skin and tried to seperate ourselves from the shirt that became bound to us . After that , we returned into our human form and lived with man once again . In the end this shirt promises great power but the power will twist you .
 They must stop the production of this t-shirt !!! The powers are becoming too widely known among us powerful men . I hopped in my truck to the Home Depot . After arriving and getting out of my truck I could n't move !!! It was the craziest thing ever.And then I saw him . Standing there in front of the building not moving also . He was wearing the exact same shirt ! I thought to myself `` could it be ? ... . It could n't ! ... . It was !!!! '' My awesome force field of power was preventing me from combining powers with another lone wolf like on the shirt ! One must move in its own direction or the pack will be to strong and destroy itself from the inside out . I then proceeded to take my shirt off for the first time in many many moons . I felt myself grow weak and slow . But at the same time realized that the power bestowed to me for now having this shirt draped over my shoulder and the Wolfs facing behind me was causing a pile up in the parking lot of women fighting to get to my perfection . Needless to say I was then able to move forward and continue my mission of finding some wood to fix the hole in my mobile homes floor . . The shirts need to stop production before we all ca n't move .
 I would not recommend buying this shirt to anybody because , although the shirt that you see in the picture looks totally amazing , the shirt you actually receive is completely different . It looks pretty much the same , in terms of the wolves being inspiring symbols of untamed ferocious beauty , but I 've talked to lots of people and they all agree that what I received is actually the `` ironic version . '' This version has caused all sorts of odd problems for me . For example , I have always worn a trucker hat , since I make , sell , and drive trucks . However , on the very first day I wore this shirt , people started telling me that my hat was `` over . '' Likewise , I have always enjoyed drinking Pabst Blue Ribbon , because it is delicious . But now , when I go into a bar , they start pouring me one before I even request it ! Then , when I mention how delicious it is , everybody says weird things like , `` Right ? I know ! Completely drinkable ! Take that , microbrews ! '' WHO ARE THEY TALKING TO ? When I finally realized that the problem was my new shirt , I tried to explain the mistake , by saying things like , `` No , seriously , I really like wolves . '' When I 've said this before , I kind of got the feeling people were laughing at me , but not any more . Now they say , `` Exactly ! I think it 's totally cool to just be into wolves , and to , like , wear a wolf shirt . It 's would be so refreshing if everyone could just be themselves , and if you 're into wolves , that 's cool , and if you 're not , then that 's awesome , because it 's about whatever is real for you . '' But , first , why would n't you be into them ? And second , why does saying that cause people 's voices to go up four octaves?I do n't know the answer , and if you do n't want to find out , then heed my warning , fellow lovers of lupines !
 For years my mother told me a story . A story I did not understand until today . When I was four , a man came and murdered my father before me and my mother . It was dark and our one swinging light in the room danced the shadows about his form as he turned to us . It was then that I caught glimpses of three wolves howling at the moon . He left us , left us with my dead father who I buried . For the next 30 years of my life I killed every wolf I could find and pinned their bodies to trees . It was only weeks ago that I discovered this website . I recognized the shirt my father 's killer had worn , enraged I picked up my keyboard and threw it into a wall . Then I rammed my first through my computer screen . Showers of sparks filled my room and that 's when it happened . I heard whispers from time immortal . `` Harness your power ... '' they said . I removed my fist from the screen and in amazement clicked buy.When it arrived I took the box and threatened the UPS man with harm beyond the eternal realm . He left me in my solitude . I rammed my fist through the box and withdrew the shirt . I could hear it calling to me . I resisted . Then I cried for hours and ran to a nearby mountain where I engaged in a life and death struggle with the three spirits . I fell to the ground mortally wounded after weeks . Or so I thought . The wolf gods spoke to me and promised me infinite knowledge and imitation crab meat.I was weak ... I put the shirt on . They spoke with one voice and called me Ketenoka Abagi . They then howled and travelled back to their realm leaving me breathless on the mountaintop.Damn you wolf shirt . DAMN YOU .
 I am looking for Facebook . I ended up here . This does n't look like Facebook . I must have dialed the wrong number . I will try again , thanks . Sorry to bother you .
 I moved to Forks , WA about three years ago . My best friend Jacob is a Native American . He bought me this shirt for my birthday . I do n't know what it is , but this shirt really gives you good luck . In fact , one snowy afternoon , a runaway van in the school parking lot skidded on the ice and almost crushed me . Luckily , it was a near miss . Guess what - yep , I was wearing The Shirt . Another time , I was shopping in Gig Harbor and wound up in a dark alley . Some hooligans started following me but some guy pulled up in a Volvo and scared them away . Yep , I was wearing the same shirt . THEN , I took a trip down to Phoenix and went to visit my old dance studio . Some creepy vampire tried to attack me but a really cute vampire showed up and rescued me . Again , I just happened to be wearing The Shirt . Coincidence ?
 I purchased the Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt with the sole purpose of warding off the town bullies -LRB- almost everyone in my town in Jefferson , West Virginia , including girls , have either hit me , pushed me , thrown something at me , tripped me , laughed at me , or just verbally attacked me -RRB- . After reading all the reviews saying how this shirt will help me not only in attaining some kind of extra strength to fight people with but also how it will force women to be attracted to me , I decided to take the plunge and buy it . I splurged and ordered it Next Day Air so I could wear it immediately.The next day the box was delivered . Although I was extremely excited as I opened the box -LRB- I was visibly shaking and could hear my own teeth chatter -RRB- , I was also skeptical like FBI Agent Dana Scully from the X-Files . Slightly trembling I slid the shirt on . It fit snugly against me . Though it looked Awesome -LRB- amazing details on the wolves and the moon -RRB- , I felt nothing exceptional until I looked closely at the faces of the wolves , howling . I saw an intensity I had never before experienced , along with raw animal emotion and a oneness with the natural world , especially a oneness with the moon . I could start to feel something , a sense of self esteem I 'd never felt before in my life . I felt the spirit of not one but all three wolves enter my heart . I felt like a lone wolf . But with the power of three -LRB- which makes it three times better than the `` Breakthrough Wolf T-Shirt '' which I was about to buy before seeing the Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt . -RRB- I felt like an animal.Now it was time to take the Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt for a `` test drive '' around town.Immediately upon leaving the front door to mother 's barn some of the usual bullies I deal with on a daily basis were upon me -LRB- some of the neighborhood kids who use mother 's field as a baseball diamond after school -RRB- . One of them punched me in the stomach - hard . I toppled to the ground , out of breath , wheezing , then , finding the spirit of the three wolves within me I stood up , placed my forearms together in front of my face in standard spell incantation technique , breathing hard , and screamed with all of my might
 I ordered the XX-Large size Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt and was charged an extra $ 5.95 for shipping costs for this shirt . When the shirt arrived , it was packaged in an XX-Large size headless corpse . I was n't sure if this was the XX-Large size headless corpse that I had ordered that just happened to be wearing the Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt since , you know , it 's so popular . So I ordered another Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt , this time for size 2-4 years . Sure enough , I was once again charged an extra $ 5.95 for shipping costs when it arrived worn by a headless toddler , age approximately 2-4 years.Buyer beware ! If I wanted to order a headless corpse , I can get one for much cheaper than the $ 5.95 shipping cost ! Most free corpses come with free shipping !
 I usually buy a lot of stuff on Amazon , but I have to admit , Walmart and the local truck stop sell these for a little cheaper
 I do n't know yet since I gave it to my granddaughter , but she did ask for it . 3 3 3
 I must agree with the less positive reviews . I find the large amount of print area affects the texture of the shirt tremendously . This in turn , affects what I noted to be its absorbancy factor . Hence after a hard day of sweating and leaning on the front of my '68 Camaro , super-sweet except for the missing tires and missing engine block and the 2 foot wide rust hole in the roof , I find this does not dig out all the material adequately from where God did split me in the posterior parts . Not one , yeah not even 4 , wipes will work . It necessitates some serious digging , which does not work well with some of the skin irritation already looming down there and which my dermatologist -LRB- actually , cosmetologist , but she -LRB- well , actually ` he ' but as soon as the rest of the operation can be done when he/she gets the money it 'll be she -RRB- is fairly knowledgeable and experienced about rashes -RRB- says should be addressed with softer , gentler materials . I 'll wait for the ` three tiny wolves and tiny moon ' shirt . I 'm hoping perhaps it will attract some women who might then help with my crack hygiene .
 I ordered a Three Dog Night album.Not funny . It ruined an expensive turntable . Refund , please .
 My brother and I both got the shirt , one time he put on both of ours at the same time . He 's dead now .
 I 've owned and have been wearing this shirt for nine days straight now and as of this writing it has NOT reunited me with my estranged father , nor cured my insistent bed wetting as was promised on the tag.It DID get me the number to this SMOKIN ' HOT redhead that lives down the street , but I really do n't like redheads -LRB- more into blonds -RRB- , so even in that respect it does n't work that well ... What a complete bust . I ca n't believe I sold my eyes on the black market so I could outbid some smuck on eBay for this . What a waste of $ 1,765.43 and a perfectly good set of eyes !!! Oh , well -- live 'n learn.Shirt * is * machine washable .
 After reading all of the reviews , I decided I needed one of these shirts . After receiving it , I put it on and was I ever disappointed -- because unlike what happened to everyone else , nothing happened . In fact , more of nothing happened than ever did n't happen before . Returning shirt .
 Why is there no Asian wolf ? Clearly there is a Caucasian , African , and Mexican wolf , but ` conveniently ' any depiction of the Asian wolf was left out . I discovered this while wearing the shirt and it occurred to me that the Asian wolf may exist on the back of the shirt . I 've tried to see my back , but ca n't reach that far yet . I 'll keep trying , but first I need to lick my elbow .
 Do n't be fooled . This is not the same 3 wolves shirt . After buying numerous original 3 wolves shirts from the other listing , I needed to save some money , so when it came time to reorder , I choose this version instead . Sadly wearing this shirt did not produce the same lady mojo that I got from the originals . It really is the white trash version of the shirt.Don ' t be fooled , buy the original , not this one.Pros
 OK , Let 's be honest . All my life I 've been a big boy . Husky , Stout , Moo Moo , assorted terms because people would n't say fat . Well I 've learned to accept , more than accept , to embrace myself . Now I do n't mean the I 'm 13 and moms pounding on the bathroom door asking if your ok kind of embracing . Good wholesome self love . Well I bought this stupid shirt . I guess I ordered too small . When I put the shirt on I stretched the picture and it now looks like three manatees howling at a silver Kiwi . Not cool.I 've moved back with my mom and have begun to look for biblical references in old -LRB- we say vintage -RRB- Star Trek episodes . stupid shirt .
 I hate this shirt . I hate this company . They have ruined my life . I purchased this shirt for my son , because I was sick of watching Blues Clues and wanted him to skip age 2 and go right to age 34 . After all , two years is more than enough time for him to grow up and become a man already . Unfortunately , I made the mistake of looking at the moon for too long , and before I knew it I was wearing the shirt myself.At first it was great . I felt stronger , more powerful , people ACTUALLY respected me ! It was the greatest feeling I 'd ever had . Fast forward two weeks , and I had noticed my arms were bigger , my breast had turned into beautiful pectoral muscles that danced when I flexed them , my hair naturally slicked itself back into a glorious ponytail -LRB- not unlike that of Steven Seagal circa Above The Law -RRB- that had my husband and son worshiping the ground I walked on . I had grown a delightfully thick beard , that was so amazing , Chuck Norris sent me a letter conceding to its glory . All great things , that I am very proud of . This shirt seemed like the greatest thing I could have ever found . My life was perfect.That is , they were perfect . Perfect up until the moment I discovered I had a penis . Actually , it was when my husband discovered the penis that things really went downhill.At first he was envious of its majesty , but he learned to love it . Sex ... Amazing ! But it was a few days after the penis appeared before I left the house and discovered the true power of the Three Wolf Shirt.In fact , it was when I made my first trip out in public with the penis that my life was ruined . I was at the Atlanta Motor Speedway with my husband and son , when we were rushed by a pack of beautiful women . My son and husband were trampled during the excitement , and were killed instantly . The spiked heels of these NASCAR models were just too much for my husband and son 's fragile skulls.I now spend all of my time locked in an undisclosed location , trying to find a way to break this curse and bring back my family . Searching for something that can reverse this curse disguised as a blessing.Whatever you do , do not buy this item . It has a way of giving you everything you 've ever dreamed of , at the cost of everything you love . - Jason -LRB- formerly known as Jasmine -RRB-
 I got this shirt as a joke gift for Hanukkah . Several nights later I carelessly wore it to bed -LRB- I was out of clean pj tees -RRB- . DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID ! I woke up to find my circumcision had been inexplicably reversed and a flaming Viking skeleton warrior battle scene tattoo had been carved onto my chest , shoulders , stomach and back - everywhere that the shirt had been touching my skin . And to top it off , it was the 25th and Santa had visited and left me a crate of chewing tobacco , a case of Pabst Blue Ribbon and 4 lbs . of back bacon ... under a Christmas tree . Try explaining that one to the Rabbi ! The worst part of all this is now I have to get circumcised again .
 I ordered this shirt for my brother 's birthday and it only had TWO wolves on it . When I called Amazon customer service they informed me that the third wolf was on back order . They said the could ship me out another moon , but that would make for a ridiculous t-shirt . I recommend staying away from this one .
 I purchased the Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt with the sole purpose of warding off the town bullies -LRB- almost everyone in my town in Jefferson , West Virginia , including girls , have either hit me , pushed me , thrown something at me , tripped me , laughed at me , or just verbally attacked me -RRB- . After reading all the reviews saying how this shirt will help me not only in attaining some kind of extra strength to fight people with but also how it will force women to be attracted to me , I decided to take the plunge and buy it . I splurged and ordered it Next Day Air so I could wear it immediately.The next day the box was delivered . Although I was extremely excited as I opened the box -LRB- I was visibly shaking and could hear my own teeth chatter -RRB- , I was also skeptical like FBI Agent Dana Scully from the X-Files . Slightly trembling I slid the shirt on . It fit snugly against me . Though it looked Awesome -LRB- amazing details on the wolves and the moon -RRB- , I felt nothing exceptional until I looked closely at the faces of the wolves , howling . I saw an intensity I had never before experienced , along with raw animal emotion and a oneness with the natural world , especially a oneness with the moon . I could start to feel something , a sense of self esteem I 'd never felt before in my life . I felt the spirit of not one but all three wolves enter my heart . I felt like a lone wolf . But with the power of three -LRB- which makes it three times better than the `` Breakthrough Wolf T-Shirt '' which I was about to buy before seeing the Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt . -RRB- I felt like an animal.Now it was time to take the Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt for a `` test drive '' around town.Immediately upon leaving the front door to mother 's barn some of the usual bullies I deal with on a daily basis were upon me -LRB- some of the neighborhood kids who use mother 's field as a baseball diamond after school -RRB- . One of them punched me in the stomach - hard . I toppled to the ground , out of breath , wheezing , then , finding the spirit of the three wolves within me I stood up , placed my forearms together in front of my face in standard spell incantation technique , breathing hard , and screamed with all of my might
 I was so excited when I first stumbled upon the pleathery wolfey goodness of these fine garments and immediately ordered a double XL ` er so that they would look all majestic when I ran and the wolves would flap in the breeze . Unfortunately I ran into Stubby Jones the neighborhood bully and he had a shirt with tweleve wolves on it , NO JOKE !! 12 !!! After Stubby and his wolfpack completely beat the ever loving crap out of me and destroyed my new shirt and then attached an acient looking -LRB- but still very active -RRB- car battery to my nipples and shocked me until I was twiching and barely concious , I decided that this never would have happened if I had more than just these three wolves on my shirt , maybe some sort of flying creature may have helped , anyone know where I can score some Mothra gear ? ...
 Oh the misleading information in the form of comments posted here about this spectacular , near pious three-wolf shirt . Those who have made this purchase have left misguided ; malinformed.Though the majority of what was elegantly said is true , i.e. honor , wisdom , power and beautiful women are indeed achieved instantaneously by donning this godlike article of clothing , there is a story that must be recounted in order that future consumers will be fully informed a priori as to the positive and negative , or mayhap detrimental , consequences this shirt will effect in their lives . Though godlike , though near pious , alas it is not piety . It is not a god itself.It was a dark and foggy night , that fateful evening in North Phoenix . I had gone from Twin Falls , ID -LRB- where my three-wolf shirt has no equal -RRB- to visit some friends living in trailers , somewhat naturally parked in the back of Wal * Mart parking lot . After circling the store for an hour seeking a lady , much like a vulture circles it 's prey , waiting for the precise moment to swoop down and attack when its foe is at its weakest , and having little to no luck , I decided something must be amiss . In Twin Falls , my three wolves and I barely make it 5 minutes in the local Wal * Mart without getting swarmed by hordes of beautiful women , all worthy of their own three-wolf-and-moon shirt . You see , I have to turn many away . Observe its power , its honor . Nonetheless , during the night of which I speak , its honor was replaced by feelings of shame ; its power decrepit and deceased . I looked down , thinking `` Perhaps I wore the wrong shirt . '' But there they were , howling up at the moon in all their glory , reassuring me that I was indeed sporting my three-wolf shirt . There must be another reason . I must find it.And find it I did . Having left Wal * Mart still single , my wolves , the moon at which they so electrically howl , and I , accompanied by my buddies in their -LSB- ... -RSB- tiger shirts , decided to go to a nightclub . Upon arriving at the door , I noticed the bouncer was cowered over in a corner , hardly able to speak , let alone attempt to impede my powerful three wolves from entering . The vibes inside were directed towards one thing
 As someone who is easily swayed by popular trends , I purchased this shirt hoping to improve my stamina -LRB- both cardiovascular and sexual -RRB- , my creativity , and my personality . Typically , I only purchase products that are endorsed -LRB- through proper mediums such as Twitter -RRB- by experts like Paris Hilton , Lady Gaga , and Kim Kardashian . I erred when I stepped outside of my comfort zone and followed the advice of strangers on Amazon.When this shirt arrived , I opted to wear it out of the box prior to washing it . I decided to do a `` dry run , '' and simply wear the shirt around the house for a little while before trying it out around town . Upon putting it on , the shirt shrunk itself to fit my physique . Although I was startled , I did read that this product contained `` powers . '' I assumed the shirt 's bonding to my skin was what the other reviewers meant so I pushed the worry from my mind and sallied forth.I decided to go about my normal routine , assuming it would be the best way to assess the shirt 's benefits . I went to my refrigerator to prepare my breakfast but tore the door off when I tried to open the fridge . My Labrador trotted into the kitchen to investigate the commotion and , when I turned to face him , he urinated on the carpet and fell over while seizing . Naturally , I was quite panicked.I called my Mother -LRB- a Doctor of Vetrinary Medicine for assistance -RRB- . As soon as I said `` hello , '' she gasped and told me that she would have to call me back . When I asked why , my mother explained that she had just gotten her period in spite of having had a hysterectomy in 2007 . I looked back to my dog , worried out of my mind . He had stopped seizing and was furiously digging a hole into my kitchen wall , trying to eat his way out of my house , howling uncontrollably.The phone rang and when I frantically answered , I heard my mother on the other line screaming that she was pregnant . Slamming the phone down , I ran out my front door to call for help . My landscapers looked at me and immediately began attacking each other with weed whackers and post-hole diggers , swearing at each other in Spanish.My dog came running through the front door and joined a racing pack of neighborhood animals as they fled in a herd down the street . Completely disoriented , I ran in the same direction as the pack . When I passed my female neighbor , screaming for help , she doubled over in pain as she went into labor despite not having been pregnant -LRB- to my knowledge -RRB- . Fortunately -LRB- or so I thought -RRB- , there was a uniformed police officer ticketing cars along the street . As I ran to him , begging for assistance , he drew his weapon and began firing shots into the air before turning the gun on me.My body reacted and , unable to believe my own eyes , I tore his arm off at the socket and proceeded to beat him with his severed appendage . Frightened by my own display of ferocity and strength , I ran back toward my house , setting off car alarms as I streaked past the parked vehicles . When I reached my home , every female in my neighborhood was urinating on my lawn.I tried removing the shirt and , as I did , a loud clap of thunder sounded and lightening struck my house , setting it in flames.My dog is gone , my mother is pregnant and I have uncontrollably assaulted all four insurance claims adjusters who have come to assess the damage of my ruined house . I strongly recommend against purchasing this shirt .
 The people who made this shirt clearly did n't see the danger inherent in what they were doing.The issue is that the existence of successful one and two wolf shirt prototypes meant that this shirt 's creators did n't require any discipline to attain this achievement.They did n't earn the knowledge for yourselves , so they do n't take any responsibility for it . They stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as they could , and before they even knew what they had , they 've patented it , and packaged it , and begun to sell it.I attempted to wear this shirt , and immediately grew six inches , resulting in heinous bone deformities in my legs . I will never walk again.Furthermore , while navigating my school on a wheelchair , a group of women threw themselves at my feet . I was unable to stop my wheelchair in time and all of them were killed in the collision.Humanity is simply not ready for this kind of power .
 I simply can not condone the decapitation of animals for the purpose of selling t-shirts that attract stunningly attractive , amorous women . These poor animals were sacrificed in the name of mysogyny and I strongly urge all daughters of Lillith , PETA and Grizzly Mammas alike to unite , stand up and declare `` We 're not gon na take this ! No , we aint gon na take it ! ''
 Face it , in today 's world everyone and their mom has 3 Wolves and a Moon . This t-shirt is for posers only . The natural progression would be 4 Wolves and 2 , maybe even 3 Moons , but I suggest buying the t-shirt of a wolf riding a phoenix to the center of the moon , you 'll get laid more .
 Our customers -LSB- ... -RSB- frequently buy the product , fully expecting it to do something that the product does not do , and which the product description clearly indicates it does n't do . Naturally , therefore , I expected this Three Wolf Tee to magically arrive in a Baby Doll cut , with LOL Catz on the back . It was cut for middle aged fat guys , JUST LIKE IN THE PICTURE !!! and there was n't a single LOL Cat on the back at all ! When will you be adding LOL Catz to the back of my T Shirt , and when will you ship an upgrade for my shirt which refactors it into a baby doll cut ? IF YOU DO N'T PLAN TO DO THIS , LET ME KNOW BECAUSE I WANT MY MONEY BACK !!! This t-shirt does n't even RUN on my iPhone . I ca n't believe you developers . I 'm going to report you to Apple .
 So , I bought one of these shirts , and all I can say is it 's a pack of lies . My luck with the ladies did n't change at all , everything stayed the same . The other reviews are all lies , it does n't do what everyone says it would !!! Do n't buy one if that 's the reason you wanted to buy one !
 This product page uploads automatically into my browser without my having actively done anything . I do have no interests in t-shirts of any kind and especially this one . Very annoying .
 I have ordered a large T-Shirt with the wolves on . I received promptly and I looked at it . A T-Shirt is a T-Shirt is a T-Shirt right ? I noticed it was quite large so , I washed it in cold water . It has not shrunk at all . The T-Shirt goes down to my knees or almost . Are American blessed with a bigger/larger constitution than Canadians ? It is also hard to stuff are this extra material into my jeans . What can I do ? Can I return it ? But this is a hasstle which I do n't need . If I do n't get satisfaction , I will never order any kind of clothing thru Amazon or any other company . Thanks

 I purchased his shirt thinking the image was printed on a good quality shirt . However , I was very disappointed ti have received a low quality fabric and a poor quality picture print ... Do n't recommend this product . On the brgt side , I got it much earlier than expected .
 I wonder how many people actually bought this shirt that reviewed it . Its not a bad shirt , Ive seen better though .
 If you think this shirts going to do any thing for your love life you are stupid . I just saw a video on yahoo.com by ABC News that said this is one of the most popular shirts on the internet . The guy who first said it helped his love life said he just said it for no real reason and then the shirt just started selling like crazy . Do your self a favor and go get something nicer unless you really like wolfs .
 Ordered T shirt in Black , but appeared to be white tee dyed black . Looked kind of green tint . Expected better for the price .

 This morning , as usual , I was all excited for casual Fridays and getting to wear jeans to the office . But when I got into the office , this girl Kari W. was totally wearing the three wolves and the moon shirt -LRB- looks like someone took `` casual Friday '' a step too far ! -RRB- . At first I was like , `` Dang , that shirt is the shizzy ! '' But my moment of admiration quickly faded when I realized that it was Kari and her lame buttface who was wearing it . I mean seriously , she would take an awesome thing like thing this t-shirt and make it lame . I only recommend this product if you want to be as lame or as much of a buttface as my coworker KW .
 Do n't buy this shirt if you are planning on driving a car . You 'll get so distracted by your own shirt wolves , you 'll run your pick up straight into a pile of dirty leaves , which would n't be so much of a problem on its own except that you 'll leave the car running , which will ignite the leaves and eventually the truck . Buyer beware .
 Bought this as a ` cheer me up ' present for my second cousin after we lost the baby . She LOVED IT !!!!
 people will think you are a twilight fan . not a dwight impersonator . i was really sad . made me feel like a gay kid .
 Contrary to previous reviews , this Tshirt does not stop a 15-Ton-truck `` dead in it 's tracks . `` Sent from my iPhone at the ICU
 I do n't get all the reviews . I 've got mine on right now and it 's just a shirt ??? Wait a minute , how are these words appearing without me touching the keyboard ? Oh my God , I 'm typing with my mind .
 I purchased this shirt with the expectation that it would bless me with similar experiences as the other reviewers.It should have come with a warning label.Those of us unfamiliar with the power of this shirt may well regret the purchase.I have previously owned a single wolf shirt , as well as a wolf and eagle shirt , and a shirt with two wolves -LRB- though one on the front and one on the back -RRB- . I 've never owned a three wolf shirt before this . And frankly , I was n't ready for it.The story is complicated , and my lawyer has advised me that discussing it could compromise my legal position , but simply allow me to say that two broken arms and a bruised chest later , I wish that I had understood what it meant to get a THREE wolf shirt.If you have experience with three wolf shirts , I think this would be excellent . If , like me , you are wolf noob , you may want to start with a two wolf , or perhaps two wolves and cub shirt , to be sure you 're up to the task .
 After reading over a thousand reviews I made the informed decision to order this shirt . Shortly after clicking the `` BUY '' button I noticed that the shirt had not only already arrived , but that I was wearing it with gusto . All seemed well until I took it out for a test spin.The awesome power of the wolves promptly drained me of my seed and clogged the kitchen sink . Any attempt I make to unclog the sink or contact a plumber causes the wolves to growl in such a way that I dare not continue . Although I was confident that I could control the power bestowed upon me , it was only a matter of days before I had shaved the tails of all the neighborhood cats and eaten all the first-born children in a ten mile radius.The wolves do not respond to logic or reason . I tried to remove the shirt , but the alpha male bit me and my flesh has since healed to the garment itself . I now have magnificent chest hair and engage in involuntary chanting which causes acid rain.I still feel that the pros outweigh the cons , but I now spend so much time carrying out the wishes of the Norse god king , Odin , that I can not in good conscious recommend this product .
 I purchased this shirt because it reminded me of my family . However , I discovered upon my first donning of said garment that a wolf wearing a shirt with wolves on it was just way too postmodern . My packmates just did n't `` get it '' . I tried to explain the writings of the post-structuralist philosopher Jacques Derrida to justify my purchase , and they just stared at me blankly . I guess that 's what I get for being the only wolf in my pack who went to college.I 'm giving it one star , because this shirt made me realize that po-mo is a bunch of malarkey reserved for only pretentious canis lupuseseses .

 I bought this shirt for my hubby . He 's been kind of depressed since being unemployed , so I wanted to lift his spirits a little.My first clue as to how this shirt would change our lives was when I saw the package glowing . It lit up the whole trailer park , I 'm telling you . I carried the padded envelope inside very reverently , and handed it to my husband . His eyes widened , and he tore the package open . Without even bothering to strip off his old , stained Miller Lite shirt first , he pulled the 3W1M T on , and immediately , the spark between us -- a spark I thought was long dead -- rekindled . We fell to the floor and played passionate mattress tag for about two days.Unfortunately , I 've ended up having to sneak out the rare times he 's slept since , just so I can eat . This shirt is like Viagra to the nth power for him , and I 'm about worn out . I ca n't get him to take it off so we can have a little normalcy again.Should we maybe try moving to Utah ? I 'd be happy to share him with about 15 other sister wives.I 'm going to have to give the T-shirt one star , because that 's all the energy I have left to choose with .
 When I put on this T shirt I was a woman . Now I am a Man . Not cool .
 I have been looking for a shirt like this for a long time . The postal worker offered to purchase this shirt from me upon realizing what splendor the package contained . I cordially responded , `` Nay . '' I opened the package and `` Wind of Change '' by the Scorpions started playing out of the parcel . The inside of the package had bite marks all over the cardboard and oddly shaped runes drawn in ash from which I gathered the factory must have drawn suppress the force of the three wolves . Upon donning this majestic shirt my mother became instantaneously pregnant . Never mind that I am 30 years old and she is quadriplegic . The baby was coming . Minutes passed and my baby brother came into this world . He looked much like Benjamin button but was blind in his right eye . He spoke to me and told me his name was Odin , father of the Norse gods . He told me that I had found his missing wolves Geri , Freki and Fenrir . For this I was to be awarded with a penthouse suite in Valhalla , infinite mead and 30 virgin maids . Life is pretty good now . The maids ca n't resist this shirt . Shipping was fast . Amazon rules .
 While this shirt gets the chicks , long term , its a real problem . First , you have to wash it in warm water as the howls coming from the maching are deafing to the entire trailer park . Second , 3 wolfs are a lot to feed . I did n't mind them eating my soul - I was n't using it anyway - but then it ate the dogs under my porch so I ca n't hunt like I used to . Then one of girls that it lured home put it on as a night shirt and in the morning , all that was left was a few well-knawed bones . Since then , I 've had to troll political conventions to keep it fed , and we all know what kind of wonky chicks you find there.Great shirt , but the upkeep will kill ya .
 After reading all the glowing reviews for this howling wolves t-shirt , I figured it was worth risking a few dollars for . After all , how often to you come across a piece of apparel that blesses you with magical powers , especially at such a bargain price?I should have known better . If it sounds too good to be true , it probably is . And as it is with most mass-produced items , there with invariably be differences and inconsistencies from one copy of the item with another.Some have claimed that the t-shirt magically brought sultry women to their feet , other claimed healing properties . But the only magical qualities my version of this t-shirt has are of no use to me . Who the hell needs amplified flatulence powers ? Maybe some , but not me . I work in retail , for christsakes . I ca n't be farting around , stinking up the store , scaring off customers and fellow employees with the green vapors . Before you think that I 'm making a mountain out of a molehill , understand this - there are few things on this planet that are as foul smelling as a wolf fart . The intensity of the vapors goes beyond the capabilities of even the most vile fart of the human variety . These farts have caused involuntary vomiting , nose hairs to melt , excessive tearing of the eyes , and who knows what long term effects they may cause . Maybe it 'll cause brain damage or mutations in future generations . Maybe sterility . Who the hell knows.The effects of my new flatulence powers became so bad that I was fired , and now have to make my living by collecting aluminum cans . And to make matters worse , the t-shirt wont come off . It 's somehow bonded itself to me , much like that alien symbiote from those Spider-man comic books -LRB- whatitsname , Venom ? Carnage ? I forget . -RRB- and WILL NOT COME OFF . I tried using a belt sander to remove it but it did n't make a dent.I demand a refund , damages for lost income , compensation for medical bills , a means to remove said shirt from my body without suffering permanent damage and a formal apology from the manufacturers of this faulty item . And , if possible , a replacement for it , preferably one that has been field tested and guaranteed to have babe-attracting powers and NOT flatulence amplifying ones .
 After reading about the chick-magnet qualities of this Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt , I bought one so that my buddy Daryl could paint it on my van . Daryl 's real good at painting , but he ca n't make nothing up , he 's got to have something to look at . This one time , he tried to paint a picture of his wife Leucosia just by remembering what she looks like , and she came out looking all evil and snakey , which she is but she do n't look it , and you would n't want to let her know you think that , cause she 'd hurt you real bad . Which is what happened to Daryl when he painted that snakey picture on the concrete wall around their yard -- and on the outside , too . Daryl like to lit out for the territories right then , but there ai n't no escaping Leucosia anyhow . That was a real bad time . Anyway , I bought this here shirt for Daryl to paint it on my van , and somebody packed up the wrong dang shirt , and now my van says `` I 'm With Stupid '' on both sides , and wo n't nobody at all get in it , much less women .
 Like so many others here on Amazon , I was wooed by the attractive Wolves and Moon design on the front of this shirt but I never considered questioning the actual fabric that the shirt was made from . That could be the last mistake I ever make.When I first removed the shirt from the box , the hairs on my arms -LRB- of which there are many -RRB- all stood up and tingled as if I 'd just rubbed a big red balloon on my head and waved it over my arms . Not the sort of thing you expect from a 100 % cotton garment but I was seduced by the power of the three wolves/one moon emblem . As I forced the shirt on over my powerful pecs I began to feel a tingling sensation all over . Everywhere the shirt touched my body , my skin tingled with electricity . I now realize why so many similarly-designed shirts feature lightning on their designs . THIS SHIRT HAS LIGHTNING TOO BUT IT 'S WOVEN INTO THE VERY FABRIC OF ITS EXISTENCE !!! After wearing the shirt to our family beer-bust that evening , I cam home and flopped down on my bed . I reached up to remove the shirt and found it 's fibers had intertwined with my body hair making it impossible to remove ! I also noticed in the glimmer of real moonlight , the moon emblem sparkled and shown with the powerful aura of raw souls ! The shirt had harvested my family 's souls and was using me as it 's taxi cab to more more more !!! I am now on the run and am looking for someone who can reverse this curse for me . If you 're out there , please email me . I do n't have full time computer access in the RV but I stop at public libraries as often as I can . In the meantime , I say purchase this shirt at your own risk . It may end up owning you . It 's got a cool design , though .
 This shirt is a rip-off . You may be tempted by its promise of three wolves but do n't be fooled ! they 're actually just three big dogs passed off as wolves . I was down at Joad 's Bait & Tackle last week when my so-called `` friends '' pointed this out.Now I 'm the laughing stock at that bait shop and have to buy all my worms at the Walmart two towns over . I would 've returned the shirt , but I dribbled chew all over the front.TOTAL SCAM
 Three months ago I spotted this seminal design on Amazon while searching for the terms `` los lobos '' and `` power '' -- I did n't know what I was searching for , I was simply compelled through some strange desire . I assumed my best match search result would be an obscure album by a hit music group , but I was much , much more fortunate that day . When my eyes rested upon this cotton sheath , I became transfixed , as if some foreign power took hold of me . I also could hear distance drum rhythms.I checked that my preferred XXX-L size was available and quickly purchased the shirt.A month later , after admiring the shirt hanging on the hanger for some time , I finally slipped the shirt over my head and pulled it over my robust torso . I felt a strange sense of destiny -- a feeling I must choose my events for the day carefully . I decided to head to the nearest fine Mexican dining establishment , Chipotle for lunch . As I sat at the booth dining I felt a presence as if someone was standing over me . I looked up to find a powerful , solemn Native Indian gentleman looking down at me with piercing eyes -- at once calming and fiercely strong . He asked my name . I told him , shaking , as he responded simply , resolutely that he was The Mountain . Yes , the designer of my shirt The Mountain . He had also stopped into our local Chipotle for a quick bite that afternoon.He sat down with me and began to talk . I had so many questions . To be honest , I ca n't remember most of the conversation although I sat , transfixed in dialogue for hours . He told me that his design stemmed from an ancient tale involving three mythical young warriors and their dramatic transformation into Wolves during times of great anger . I believe he said the tale was simply known in Native communities as Teen Wolf . While one would think the skyrocketing success of the item as # 1 apparel item on Amazon.com would bring him great joy , but sadly , it only led to his alienation , and declining mores of humanity . He said that since the item became so widely available a number of pariahs , false teachers , and corrupt leaders have risen , using the Lobo power for evil activities , corrupt purposes , and selfish intents such as attracting women only for promiscuous sexual activities and emitting supernaturally amplified wolf calls . The true purposes of the shirt have been corrupted.If you look at the `` Customers who viewed this item also viewed ... '' feature , you will see the caliber of the dangerous crowd attracted to the unyielding power of the shirt
 They SAY it 's three wolves , but how do we know it 's not the same wolf from three different angles ? We can not assume they 'd be above airbrushing or the use of creative lighting just to save on wolves ...
 Sasquatch know these wolf . These wolf always howl not in tune . Buy shirt with wolf that in tune when howl instead .
 I was very disappointed by this product . I have been looking for some time for an appropriate t-shirt to attract the one woman -LRB- I think -RRB- in my advanced physics class and thought this t-shirt was a clever representation of Albert Einstein 's famous equation regarding relativity
 I just saved all your lives . This product has a curse on it that is activated if 42 people find this product to be unworthy of 3 stars but just better than 1 star . If left that way for more than a few days or weeks , the shirt 's powers will be amplified until we are all overwhelmed by it 's intense awesomeness , and Chuck Norris will be whipped into a frenzy of unstoppable roundhouse kicks until the world has learned to appreciate this shirt 's finer nuances and respect it and themselves enough to write more 2 star reviews for it . No need to thank me , though , I was only able to accomplish this feat because of wearing the 3 wolf moon short sleeve tee and being enlightened by it 's wisdom and counsel . You 're welcome .
 When I saw this shirt on Amazon I was totally had to have it . It has three wolves , and three is a magic goddess number . And a moon which calls up images of sexy vampiresses , menses , and of course evenings spent dancing skyclad around a bonfire with others of my ancient religion.SWEEEEEET right?Wrong . Sure , the t-shirt attracts women . Lots of women . Lots of drop-dead gorgeous women . Lots and lots of drop-dead gorgeous straight women . WTF ????
 Oh , how we laughed , my hubby and I , when first we came across the reviews for this shirt . We deemed them hilarious , and never dreamed there could be an ounce of truth the the outrageous claims of this garment 's powers . I thought I 'd get him one as a little `` joke gift '' for X-Mas , assuming he would wear it ironically , and infrequently . Were it not a tragedy of epic proportions , I 'd say it was funny how very wrong I was!From almost the very moment my sweet , lovable , but rather ordinary middle-aged husband donned this Tshirt , he began to change , and to more closely resemble a hot twenty five year old stud . At first , I was thrilled ! Not only did he look and act younger and sexier , but his prowess and stamina were immediately increased by an order of magnitude . We had some passionate nights , one after the other , until I was so exhausted I could barely function at work . I actually got to the point of begging him to give me a break , even just one night off . Furthermore , I begged him to take of the darn shirt so I could wash it . The musky masculine pheromones it caused him to emit were arousing not only me , but every female in the neighborhood , including -LRB- and especially -RRB- the canine pets . He refused , unable to resist being irresistible . I tried hiding it , even destroying it , but he just ordered several more from Amazon , and secreted them throughout the house , like any other addict with a hidden stash . Ultimately , I could not compete with all of the insanely hot babes throwing themselves at him , even offering to pay him just to let them touch his pectorals bulging beneath the howling wolves ... we are divorced now , and I am miserable . Oh , would that I had not doubted other reviewers !
 Mine had 3 cats playing with a ball of yarn on it . It has brought me crippling depression , I got fired and now have diabetes . If I had a girlfriend she 'd probably have left me too!I have since burned the shirt , buried the shirt , donated the shirt , ate the shirt and several other tactics to rid my self of this bane only to have it reappear on my persons.I have contacted customer service about my problem and they recommended the sweet release of death .
 I put this shirt on and nothing happened . I think all these posts are bull sh -- t. I want my money back .
 I do n't actually own this shirt , but I 'm pretty sure the guy who sorts through my recycling looking for returnables does . And his story is a sad one . Well , I do n't really know what his story is , but I digress.The other reviewers say this shirt will bring you fame , fortune , and women by the scores . And it will . For a while . But I liken the powers of this shirt to those of winning the lottery ; at first you seem to have it all , and everyone wants a piece . And they will get their piece , but soon there will be nothing left . You will be broke . Destitute . Depressed . Alone.You can continue to cruise the WalMarts , the county fairs , the truck stops , looking for some action . But the shirt 's powers will have all ready moved on the some other poor , unassuming soul . This shirt will ruin your life . Buyer beware .
 This shirt is so powerful , that by putting it on , I 've made it impossible to stop sexing myself up . It 's also made chicks who I know are only into dudes come tearing after me , desperate for a piece of my wolf-clad self.Women beware - buying this shirt might have undesirable consequences .
 For years now I was part of the circle of supermetropolitan life - I would lurk in my secret lair silhouetted high on Deathgouge Mountain , with a pall of sickly clouds hovering overhead . Regularly as clockwork , I would foment my diabolical schemes to inflict upon nearby Sapien City - a swarm of plague-carrying otters , a death ray that would instantly kill anyone with an ` R ' in their name , turning the water supply green so that the placebo effect would convince civilians that it was poisoned and keel over . And regularly as clockwork , my arch nemeses would appear - Bicep Man , Testosterzone and Sparkling Unicorn Girl to thwart my plans but never actually lock me up or impair my mysterious source of income , meaning I could try it again the following week.Then comes Three Wolf Moon - he 's not even a proper superhero , he was never bitten by a radioactive animal , or exposed to gamma rays or even born on a strange planet that happens to have a compatible atmosphere to Earth . Instead he spent fifteen dollars on an online shirt , and managed in one fell swoop to not only foil the most devious scheme yet -LRB- an army of sentient clouds who would follow people around , depriving them of natural sunlight and making them more susceptible to seasonal affective disorder -RRB- , but he had the gall to use the power of the shirt to infiltrate my hideout and bring me to what you fools laughingly call `` justice '' . Let me recap . It is a sick world in which we live where a simple shirt can give the wearer the power to teleport through time itself , appearing just inside the reinforced armourmantium double doors of my hideout and freezing all of my lackeys by flattening their time/space curve . How can a garment let one run at twice the speed of sound , shattering delicate instruments and camera lenses , whilst simultaneously being invisible to all known wavelengths ? What makes a 100 % cotton and hand-dyed piece of clothing grant the bearer the ability to turn into a Moon God Wolf Specter , able to pass through walls , grow to the size of a truck and summon hordes of other Moon God Wolf Specters to do their bidding ? And finally , how in the name of all that is dark and unholy can it let someone named Barry , who lives in his family 's basement and cites his favorite food group as `` snack '' , appear out of the very shadows in my throne room , split into four elemental beings and nullify my death field I always keep in my belt?Needless to say , it somewhat upset the status quo of the city - without a supervillain to oppose , Bicep Man and Sparkling Unicorn Girl left to fight crime elsewhere , depriving the coffers of Sapien City a massive injection of tourist funds , whereas Testosterzone took to petty vandalism and has now accounted for eighteen historic landmarks thrown into orbit due to boredom . The meddling fool who captured me -LRB- and also wrecked my lair , may I add , leading to the deaths of forty seven personnel , bankrupting several compensation companies for claims by their families , and leading to mass employment among the survivors -RRB- claimed he was `` just doing his job '' , and was given the -LRB- grudging , I would like to point out -RRB- thanks by the Mayor.Due to past services towards the tourism industry I have been given a suspended sentence and am currently in a rehabilitation project in order to ease my transition into society . However , this is less than ideal , as my bionic claw keeps crushing the basket when removing the fries , and although I try my best to avoid asking customers if they want `` anthrax with that '' , old habits die hard and I am on my final written warning . Damn you , Three Wolf Moon , and all who use your powers !
 I have this shirt and used to love it . In fact , I had just ordered a spare because my first one was beginning to wear out.Three weeks ago , I was inside Wal-Mart , proudly wearing my ` Wolves ' when I saw a little kid wearing one also . At first I was so excited to see a fellow wolfer and as I went up to him to say hello ... it started.You see , you can have a moon and three wolves , but if you have six wolves and two moons you throw the universe out of sync or something.As I was walking to the kid , he slipped on a wet spot on the floor and hurt his ankle . I helped him up and took him to his parents and that is where I thought it would end but it certainly did n't . I was walking out of Wal-Mart with my new HDTV and the shoplifting warning kept beeping . The greeter would n't let me leave . Eventually a county police officer showed up and checked my pockets and cavities for stolen items . Of course nothing was found and I got to leave ... 3 HOURS after I bought the TV.Ultimately , you can wear this shirt , but DO NOT LET YOUR SHIRT SEE ANOTHER THREE WOLF MOON SHIRT OR YOU WILL BE CURSED . The universe is at stake here people .
 Washed the shirt for the first time , the wolves bled thru the back side of the shirt . Disappointed in the fact that the shirt did not even last 1 wash .
 one star , I WANTED four wolves and a moon , I had to settle on three , and its just not the same -LRB- sigh -RRB-
 I bought this shirt , bc i read all the good things . . Have been wearing it for a week , everyday ... . Still nothing . . what am I doing wrong ? I see it working for everyone else ...
 Never received this item ... ordered it in May . I contacted them 2 wks after their shipping date . They 're reason for delay is they do n't know what happens after it enter usps , but we will reship the item . Another 2wks later contact them again after not receiving and it was the same exact email . It has to be autamated email . Finally just said forget it and filed complaint with amazon.com .
 Color is not even on the textile , its not even black but dark green and quality of color is not evenly applied . Cotton is also low quality
 I am so disappointed when open the box . The material is so bad and the shirt is not even black , dye is all over . I do n't think I can wear clothes using such a bad material .
 * Clears throat * Ok ... LAIK AMIGAWD WHEN I FIRST PUT ON THIS SHIRT I WON TEH LOTTERY DEN GOT FREE PIZZA FAW LIFE DEN I GOT ALL LIEK SUCSESSFUL WIT TEH WIMMINZ I NEVER TAKE THIS THING OFF LAWLZ CHUCK NORRIS CAME TO MY HAOUS TA CONGRATULATE ME CUZ I BR KEWL NAO JOIN THE PACK IT GOES GREAT WITH WHOLE MILK LAWLZ XD !!!!!!!
 This shirt is for losers who think they 're cool by wearing animals . Honestly , how silly are goths ? they 're so weird , they like wolves.ooh i 'm a werewolf so i 'm coooooool ; NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTTTTTTTTTTT!by the way , I 'm british , and like most British people , I like to kill jokes . I just killed my own joke , by admitting I 'm british .
 ... to believe in nonsense like this ? Wow there really must be a lot of truly pathetic fools out there for a market for idiocy like this to exist.Also Amazon needs to improve it 's blocking of pay-per-review services ...
 I wish I could give this shirt a better rating but the wolves are so magical two of them came to life , attached my dog and ran away . Now I only have one wolf left and I was forced to have my shirt destroyed by a local Apache tribe in fear of what may come !
 As is well known , women are in short supply up here in Alaska . As a resident , I was lonely and cold for too many years . But after stumbling upon the reviews for this shirt , I realized that simply wearing one would move me high up the list of eligible males for those snow bunnies who have their pick from all us manly men who populate this great last frontier , and who outnumber the ladies by more than seventeen to one.Upon receiving and donning this shirt , I immediately hopped in my Big , Big Truck and rolled on down toward Wasilla , where I have it on good word from my friend Levi that chicks with funny first names dig men in Three Wolf Moon t-shirts . As I drove down that long , lonesome , wilderness road , slowing periodically to shoot bears , moose , caribou , hares , hippies , liberals , squirrels , and anything else that moved , as well as any road signs still standing , I began to feel an urgent need to drain my bladder . So I stopped on a dark stretch of wilderness road , walked to the center line , unzipped my fly , and began to express my liberty as a freeborn Alaskan.Just as an overwhelming sense of relief overtook me and I began to relax , I suddenly heard the unmistakable sound of a helicopter , and before I could flee for cover in the woods , it swooped down on me and an agent for Fish and Game leaned out the passenger side and plugged all three wolves on my shirt with .357 bullets . I had been caught by agents killing wolves so that I , as a freeborn Alaskan , would have more of other types of animals to shoot , as is my God-given right . Oh , the irony.I fell to the ground , with my small intestine , inferior vena cava , and right lung all perforated . Fortunately , some kind members of a remote religious commune drove along just then and came to my aid . This was very lucky , because coming up the other lane was a another Real Alaska Man who was looking for road kill to gut and take home for supper . -LRB- He was wearing a Two Wolf Moon shirt , and thus only had two bullet scars . -RRB- I was taken to the commune , where I was tended back to health and invited to join . When I realized that by becoming a member I could have as many as seven frumpy-dressed , overweight wives , I realized I had been led astray by believing the false advertising on Amazon for this shirt which is produced by Satan 's minions in China and is used to draw men such as myself into temptation and sin.Today I am a wiser man . Accompanied by my wives , Deborah , Abigail , Esther , Mary , Rebekah , Rachel , and the lovely young lady I met who hails from a prominent Wasilla family , Mudflap , as well as our children -LRB- I stopped counting at twenty-seven -RRB- , I carve out a life in the wilderness , clad only in straight-cut suits and coats without collars , lapels or pockets . My life is complete , but the price I nearly paid because I was drawn in by this demonic Three Wolf Moon shirt leaves me trembling to this day.Pros
 I was so disappointed when I received my T-Shirt and it only had two wolves and a moon . I mean , the description clearly said Three Wolves and a Moon . So where is the third Wolf ? Is he out campaigning for the Tea Party or something ? Was he the victim of a Rendition for dubious behavior ? I do hope he is not facing the water board , oh dear . Anyway , I ca n't wear this shirt now ! Everyone I know has three wolves on their shirt and I only have two , they 'll all laugh at me It might as well not have the moon too . You ca n't have two wolves and a moon ; that 's just wrong . I mean , C'mon !
 The biggest shirt they had fit me horribly tightly , so much so that the wolves look that they 're howling in pain from being so tightly smashed and stretched against the boundaries of the shirt and my stomach . The moon looks warped and distorted from the sagging weight of my breast adding to the corrupt ambiance . Do not believe the reviews . Never trust the furries . Yiff Yiff Yiff Yiff Yiff Yiff
 WO N'T PLAY ON MY CD PLAYER & WHEN I EMAILED THE DUDE HE SAID I WAS A NUT . I `` M LIKE , WTF MAN EVERYONE ALWAYS SAYS THAT EVEN GRANDMA & MR CHRISTIE FROM UP THE STREET WHO LOOKS OVER THE FENCE BUT IT CAME WITH A PRETTY COOL SHIRT
 In the spring of 2011 I went a camping trip with my two friends Ace and Gary . We heard of a magical shirt that would get us laid in the woods so we went for it . On the first night of the trip we were attacked by three wolves -LRB- one a piece -RRB- . In the scuffle they managed to rip the sleeves off of our shirts and sever about two thirds of our jeans -LRB- actually all of Gary 's jeans were eaten -RRB- . By night two , our sleeveless , daisy duke asses were so cold we decided to each drink a case of natty light and huddle for warmth . I do n't want to talk about the rest of the trip but I will warn all purchasers of this product . Make sure women are around when camping with this shirt on , three friendships are ruined forever , and we will never fart the same . See the photo of Ace , Gary , and Pat from day two of our trip in the customer photo link .
 Dont waste your money on this product ! I am completely dissatisfied with my order even though my problems are partially my fault -LRB- I assumed that lightning bolts were an understood accessory to this theme , but no ! -RRB- because I didnt do enough proper research . Whenever amazon window shopping , one must always be cautious when stumbling onto a gem like the product mentioned . BEWARE ! Some products are not as great as they seem . The moon does NOT glow in the dark ! Ketchup stains will NOT wash out of it ! The only positive thing about this shirt is that my hot cousin , Casey Remington , didnt recognize me immediately and checked me out ! Id nail her if she wasnt my cousin .
 Be careful with this shirt . I decided to wear it to a Ted Nugent concert ... You know , looking for a little `` cat scratch fever '' in this studly shirt . Half way through his set during his wild hunter portion that sob shot me with a flamming arrow ! He saw those wolves and his 2nd Amendment Rights just took over ! Be careful !
 I like this shirt okay , but in the dark no one can see it so it loses some impact . I think it could be a better shirt if it glowed in the dark .
 I purchased the Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt with the sole purpose of warding off the town bullies -LRB- almost everyone in my town in Jefferson , West Virginia , including girls , have either hit me , pushed me , thrown something at me , tripped me , laughed at me , or just verbally attacked me -RRB- . After reading all the reviews saying how this shirt will help me not only in attaining some kind of extra strength to fight people with but also how it will force women to be attracted to me , I decided to take the plunge and buy it . I splurged and ordered it Next Day Air so I could wear it immediately.The next day the box was delivered . Although I was extremely excited as I opened the box -LRB- I was visibly shaking and could hear my own teeth chatter -RRB- , I was also skeptical like FBI Agent Dana Scully from the X-Files . Slightly trembling I slid the shirt on . It fit snugly against me . Though it looked Awesome -LRB- amazing details on the wolves and the moon -RRB- , I felt nothing exceptional until I looked closely at the faces of the wolves , howling . I saw an intensity I had never before experienced , along with raw animal emotion and a oneness with the natural world , especially a oneness with the moon . I could start to feel something , a sense of self esteem I 'd never felt before in my life . I felt the spirit of not one but all three wolves enter my heart . I felt like a lone wolf . But with the power of three -LRB- which makes it three times better than the `` Breakthrough Wolf T-Shirt '' which I was about to buy before seeing the Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt . -RRB- I felt like an animal.Now it was time to take the Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt for a `` test drive '' around town.Immediately upon leaving the front door to mother 's barn some of the usual bullies I deal with on a daily basis were upon me -LRB- some of the neighborhood kids who use mother 's field as a baseball diamond after school -RRB- . One of them punched me in the stomach - hard . I toppled to the ground , out of breath , wheezing , then , finding the spirit of the three wolves within me I stood up , placed my forearms together in front of my face in standard spell incantation technique , breathing hard , and screamed with all of my might
 I 'm just being a hater because at $ 16.49 it 's a bit pricey and not all us folks can afford such expensive threads . But then again , you pay for what you get so I guess it is worth not eating lunch for a week to sport this awesome shirt . I 'm trying to sell my burberry scarf and LV wallet just so I can get a few of these bad boys . Ca n't wait until that day comes so I can finally score with super models !
 After reading the tumultuous reviews about this shirt , I almost had no choice but to get one . Imagine my excitement as I opened the plain brown box ; knowing that soon I would be able to harness the power of the universe . My heartbeat hastened at the thought of the power I would soon have at my fingertips . Thoughts of women flocking to me from miles around danced joyfully in my optimistic mind . I knew I could n't wait . I had to put it on right away.After putting on the shirt for the first time , I admit , I felt my trousers getting a little tighter . Sheer excitement of the things to come made it almost unbearable to adorn . Although it was late , I wanted to visit the hot neighbor down the street to test the prowess of my newfound glory . I opted , instead , to try it on my household first - less risk of police involvement.Imagine my surprise when my 6 year old daughter , after gazing upon the awesomeness , described me as looking `` douchey '' . After asking where she heard that word and sending her to her room , I sought a second opinion . My wife , after she was able to stop laughing at me , began to chastise me for spending the money on what she said looked like , `` something Hank Hill would wear if he suffered a massive head injury and went blind . '' 0-2 so far , but my optimism remained.The next morning I stopped to put gas in my 1978 4X4 Chevy . As I sauntered up to the counter , I noticed a very attractive young woman waiting in line . When I arrived behind her in line , I thought to myself , `` Time to test the powers in the real world ! '' My only question was how bold I needed to be in order to get a true reading on the test . My philosophy is to go all the way.I reached out and gave her firm behind a light slap . When she turned around , I nodded towards the Three Wolf Moon , smiled a little , and gave her a wink.A few hours later I regained consciousness and was told by the clerk that the attractive women had intended to slap me , but instead cold-cocked me and then proceeded to kick me about the head , neck , and chest , once I was down . My body now ached , and I was late for work . 0-3 so far.When I arrived at work , I could n't wait to see if the first three encounter were just flukes . I am lucky enough to work with several stunningly gorgeous women who , ordinarily , only make polite conversation with me . I was eager to see if one , or even all of them , could resist the draw of the shirt.I decided to play it cool this time ; downplaying what was obviously going through my head . The first of the hotties I encountered in the hallway . We 'll call her `` Moomster '' . I gingerly walked up to her while she was chatting up another hottie -LRB- who we 'll call C-bag -RRB- and engaged in their conversation.They looked at me . Then looked at each other . Then back at me . Then back at each other . Surely they were figuring out how to posture themselves to be sure that they were the first to experience the wonderment that I now embodied . Desire is all that I could see in their eyes as inched closer and closer . That 's when it happened ... They into boisterous laughter while saying things like , '' I ca n't believe you actually wore it '' and something I could n't quite make out about being mentally retarded . For the first time , I began to doubt the 1800 + reviews I had read about this shirt and decided I had to make one last - ditch effort . I 'm 0-5 , now by the way.I collected my thoughts for a few hours and wandered down to the remaining to hotties that regularly occupy my personal spank bank . Let 's call them , Teth and Bara . As I perched myself triumphantly upon Teth 's desk , she would n't even pry her eyes away from her work . My doubt for the powers grew . I tried again and again to gain her attention with no luck . Finally , I had to ask her to look at my shirt . She and Bara looked at me in unison . For a breif moment , I thought there was going to be cat fight over who would claim their noble steed first . That moment , however , did n't last as I was again met with comments of , `` You actually wore that ? '' and yet another comment about Hank Hill . I 'm now 0-7 . I ca n't help but think that the majority of the reviews that I 've read on here are somewhat farcical , if not flat out lies . Since donning this shirt I 've been insulted , beaten up -LRB- by a chick -RRB- , made late for work -LRB- by the aforementioned butt kicking -RRB- , and have n't gotten as much as a second glance . Perhaps I 'm aiming too high and these particular women have immunity to the mystical powers . My next target will be the local trailer park / Wal-Mart -LRB- pretty much the same place in my town -RRB- to hopefully find women with less discriminating tastes .
 This shirt ruined my life!I bought it two months ago , not from Amazon , but from a small aged wise Japanese chap who owned a curiosity store in Lower Manhattan.My mother and girlfriend fell in love with the t-shirt immediately . The three of them began to have a special relationship that i am no longer part of.I wait outside restaurants to try and see my -LRB- now ex -RRB- girlfriend leaving with the wolves , but she and the hairy no good scoundrels blank me.I moved back in with my mother , but she has shunned me . I 've been dis-owned , and she changed the locks last night . When i call she laughs and i can hear the howls in the background.I now live in the park .
 Amazon does n't carry the shirt with the pixies anymore , so I bought this instead.Don ' t buy this shirt!It has no pocket for my I-Phone , it 's not waterproof and it has wolves , NOT pixies.If I knew this I would have bought the 500 piece Origami I-Phone case set instead ...
 The wolves graphic on this shirt are too realistic . I was shot by a hunter whilst peeing in the woods and wearing this shirt for the first time . I am now dead and writing this review .
 I used this shirt to go back in time and kill Hitler while he was still in Art school.I did n't seem to make much of a difference , however .
 She was so timid the whole time I 'd known her , which was the past 6 years . She patiently waited for me to get home from work and bring her dinner , and only occasionally barked orders at me . What 's a bread-winner to do ? I let her get her way most the time because I know how hard it is to sit around the house waiting all the time.I thought I 'd impress her by getting this shirt -LRB- 100 % cotton and thick fabric too ! -RRB- and wearing it home . I did n't even get a chance to get into the house . She attacked me in the garage with an animal 's ferocity I 've never known . I did n't know what hit me ! It had to be that the wolves -LRB- perhaps the full moon and leather tag too -RRB- had awakened some primal mechanism that made her want to jump on me and rip the shirt right off my chest . Luckily the price was only $ 9.14 , or I 'd think it a waste to have only worn the shirt once . I also got some peace of mind knowing that the shirt was screenprinted using environmentally safe , water based inks because I saw her lick the logo a few times during the whole ordeal.Once the `` attack '' was over , I stumbled into the house a little bloody and certainly flush with excitement . My wife could n't believe our Labradoodle , Sissy , would attack any one of the family after being so docile for the past six years . I assured her it had to be the shirt .
 I have ascended . All three wolf moon t-shirt wearers shall bow before me when I appear before you wearing my The Official Three Wolf Moon Pajamas 3 Wolf Moon Footed Pjs with Drop Seat . It could not last , mortals !
 My 97 year old aunt got me this shirt for Arbor day -LRB- she 's really tech-savvy and managed to beat Halo 3 on Legendary with one arm ! -RRB- , but seeing that it was an `` aunt gift '' I thought I 'd rather not be seen in public with a shirt my aunt got me.So I wore it as a pajama shirt . BIG MISTAKE.Once I fell asleep , my body became a vessel to Urk On ` landen , a demon of the Netherwolrds sealed within the threads of the shirt . The Dark Unwashed one used my sleeping form as a host to commit outrageous acts , some of which I do not fully remember . I do know he traveled back in time and fathered PeeWee Herman.My point is , if you wake up and find that someone stole your mailbox or filled in the crossword puzzle in your morning paper , that 's probably me . I 'm sorry .
 Where to start . I tried on my TWM shirt the day it arrived in the mail . I was pleasantly surprised at first . Instantly , my upper-body muscles swelled to enormous proportions . I decided to take her for a spin in the local gym . Where before I could bench 150 , now I could bench 500 . However , the trouble started after I left the gym and went to the local steakhouse for my after workout protein boost . As I was working on my fifth steak , a group of 20-something girls from the local state college caught sight of me . The seven of them leapt out of their booth and ran straight at me while tearing off their tops . I had to flee because there was no way I would be able to finish my 8 steaks in peace.I went home and took off the TMW shirt . To my dismay , my upper-body muscles shrunk back to their normal size . I was horrified ! Wondering what to do , I realized I might be able to turn the situation to my advantage by incorporating the TWM shirt into my night job as a hot-cop . How wrong I was ! I went wearing it to my gig the next day . It was a disaster ! The girls , instead of only watching as per company policy , pinned me to the ground in swarm . Possessing the godlike strength which the shirt imbued , I was easily able to resist , but I never got the girls to pay because they would n't stop trying to force themselves upon me.My manager did n't dare fire me because of how powerful the shirt had made me , but all my gigs were doomed to failure because the girls would never stop swarming me and pay . No thank you , TWM shirt , for destroying my career .
 I was extremely upset with the wolf tee-shirt . I entered a wet tee-shirt contest , and I wanted both of my nipples to make a statement . I am a B cup , so one of my nips successfully came out of the moon . However , my other nipple -- which I was told would come directly out of the wolf 's eye -- failed miserably . Instead , my nipple -- which is noticably lower than my left nipple -- came out of his mouth . WTF ? False advertising .
 My grandfather was always a bit of a joker so it came as no surprise that when he was faced with his own death , he dryly requested that he was to be buried in his wolf moon t-shirt with a glint of mischief in his eye . He always joshed with his grand children that the shirt had supernatural powers when they mocked the naff-ness of the garment over the years . But he had the last laugh . On his funeral day , he succumbed to post rigour erectus -LRB- no need to spell it out -RRB- and they could n't get the lid on the coffin . The only option left open was to cremate the body . A doubly embarrassed funeral director then had to inform the family that the corpse remained intact and seemingly untouched by the 1100 deg celsius cremation temperatures . Not only that , my grandfather seemed to take on the complexion of a younger man . Fortunately , the ` protrusion ' subsided and his body was removed to the coffin . When we finally lowered the coffin into the ground , we thought that as finally the end of it . We 've since been occasionally woken by the sounds of howling wolves at night . The thing is , the wolf became extinct in our country over 300 years ago!ok , I 'm not the most suprstitious but the t-shirt is naturally the focus of my suspicions . Buyer beware . I ca n't believe amazon are still fielding this item for sale .
 I from Russia and not read title . I feel rip off . I thought it was 3 Dog , Cheese Pizza shirt . Waste of money . Who want wolve and moon ? 3 Dog Cheese Pizza look better .
 After reading the reviews for the shirt , i knew i had to unlock the powers within me . I chose the 1 day shipping -LRB- as i 'm not so rich to choose the yesterday shipping option . -RRB- As it arrived , it leaped out of the package , bit the delivery guy and attached to me on a molecular level . The powers i 've recieved are n't as impressive as i thought . I kill all the women i mate with with the power waves of my hips , -LRB- but they do make good post-bone snacks . -RRB- Girl scouts wo n't sell me cookies , lest that another tornado hits and takes their troop away like the last one that tried . I ca n't even get into my trailer without ripping of my door ! I know it instantly mends itself using the golden thread of the Fates and every time i rip it off an evil badger dies , but it is slightly annoying . Sometimes i wonder if it was the right choice to get this . My family is afraid to say anything , but i know exactly what they are thinking . Darn psychic powers .
 This is so stupid and all of you are immature . Writing about how you all like some stupid T-shirt from the 80s . First off , none of you know anything about Wolves , or moons , or tshirts , or wolf moon tshirt fashion . This wolf shirt is n't even that good . The lowest wolf isnt howling in the same direction as the others . DO YOU GUYS KNOW NOTHING ? LOL , No self respecting woodsman would ever like this shirt , let alone support the people who killed the wolves so they could be on it . The newest shirts have real wolf hair on it and painted blood stains to make it gritty and on the edge . Yea , this wolf shirts okay ... for my little sister . I wouldnt wear this shirt for 50,000,000 dollars . Let me ask you this , where are the fangs ? If I saw you on the street with it on , i 'd probably punch you in the face and show you what a real wolf shirt looks like .
 I purchased the Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt with the sole purpose of warding off the town bullies -LRB- almost everyone in my town in Jefferson , West Virginia , including girls , have either hit me , pushed me , thrown something at me , tripped me , laughed at me , or just verbally attacked me -RRB- . After reading all the reviews saying how this shirt will help me not only in attaining some kind of extra strength to fight people with but also how it will force women to be attracted to me , I decided to take the plunge and buy it . I splurged and ordered it Next Day Air so I could wear it immediately.The next day the box was delivered . Although I was extremely excited as I opened the box -LRB- I was visibly shaking and could hear my own teeth chatter -RRB- , I was also skeptical like FBI Agent Dana Scully from the X-Files . Slightly trembling I slid the shirt on . It fit snugly against me . Though it looked Awesome -LRB- amazing details on the wolves and the moon -RRB- , I felt nothing exceptional until I looked closely at the faces of the wolves , howling . I saw an intensity I had never before experienced , along with raw animal emotion and a oneness with the natural world , especially a oneness with the moon . I could start to feel something , a sense of self esteem I 'd never felt before in my life . I felt the spirit of not one but all three wolves enter my heart . I felt like a lone wolf . But with the power of three -LRB- which makes it three times better than the `` Breakthrough Wolf T-Shirt '' which I was about to buy before seeing the Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt . -RRB- I felt like an animal.Now it was time to take the Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt for a `` test drive '' around town.Immediately upon leaving the front door to mother 's barn some of the usual bullies I deal with on a daily basis were upon me -LRB- some of the neighborhood kids who use mother 's field as a baseball diamond after school -RRB- . One of them punched me in the stomach - hard . I toppled to the ground , out of breath , wheezing , then , finding the spirit of the three wolves within me I stood up , placed my forearms together in front of my face in standard spell incantation technique , breathing hard , and screamed with all of my might
 Nothing says `` I like to spearfish for doo-doo sharks '' more than a Lone Wolf shirt with three man-wolves on it . Look at ` em ... they 're sitting there real close together , gazing at the moon , and the one on the left appears to have mounted the one in the middle . God only knows what 's going on with that one on the right . Good thing it ai n't a lone wolf dress , because , unless you like your garments to feature airbrushed wolf red rockets , you do not want to pan down and see what 's going on in the southern half of that picture.Think about it . If you were a Lone Wolf , would you be hanging out with 2 other man-wolves on a Saturday night ? If you answered ` yes ' and/or gave this shirt 5 stars , surf on over to -LSB- ... -RSB- . If you 're with me and you answered `` no '' , let 's straighten this mess out.If you 're like me , you like to party . You like ice cold chillies , but party so hard that you ca n't get drunk off beer no more . You like the ladies and demand a fresh , tasty helping of strange at least 6 nights a week . You like to rock out with your band . You like customized rigs
 When I bought this shirt , I was a sexy , curvaceous female . I was very feminine , the kind of girl who loved ruffles , pink high heels and collected Precious Moments statues . I thought it would be fun to wear this cute tee . A bad mistake . First , I noticed dark , thick hair sprouting on my chin . I went to my beauty shop but there was n't enough wax in the world to keep this beard from crawling over my face . My biceps started bulging like miniature mountain wolves themselves . I found I needed to go to the bathroom standing up , rather awkward in the corporate ladies room because I kept leaving the seat up . Then , I awoke one morning from uneasy dreams of wolves howling at the moon and found myself transformed in my bed into a monstrous MAN . But not just any man , a testosterone-drenched sex symbol stalked by hungry , sex-crazed hussies . Since deep in my psyche I 'm still a heterosexual female , this sickens me . Take your shirt back ! Return my estrogen to me !
 This shirt is a nice looking short , but it comes with no superpowers . I think mine is broken . Oh well , at least it looks pretty cool .
 I have always been a well mannered guy ... I eat my veggies , comb my hair every morning , work a 9-5 ... As with all well mannered guys , I have hobbies and obsessions ... one being wolves ... I was fascinated when i saw a wolf shirt on amazon . . and almost had a heart attack when i saw not One NOT TWO BUT Three Wolves ... AND a moon too !!!!! i ordered the shirt and that 's where the horror beganThe shirt has strong powers ... I found that every time I tried taking the shirt off , I could n't ... it was glued to me like a wolf bites its prey . . it was biting my body ... I began to smell from lack of showering ... contracted fleas even ... but the shirt would n't come off.but the crazy thing is that the women flocked to me !! at first this was awesome ... but being the well mannered guy I am I eventually had feelings of regret.another added side effect was the inhuman strength ... while nice at first , I noticed that I would bruise all of the women flocking to me . . which contributed to my regret.I give it one star for turning me from a well mannered young man into this horrible villainous creature !
 I have a rare blood condition
 i purchased this t-shirt on a whim but as it turns out , this XL 100 % cotton-weave would contain curses within it - near-mythical and powerful enchantments ! had i known such ill-attraction would be drawn to such a evil item , i would have , without hesitation , donated it to the good people of the salvation army . it would have been my hope that the power of the christmas red kettle would be able to contain the intoxicating sexual attraction of the 3 wolves howling at a full moon.unfortunately , i 've worn it several times to my local library and have been victim to continuous harassment by women no younger than 65 . the female geriatric community continually tempt me with their promises of a social security check in exchange for the snuggie-like warmth and companionship that can only be offered by 3 wolves in moonlight . but , i respectfully refuse only so that i may find my true love - the lone octogenarian with a futon bed and matching satin curtains.alas , i can no longer wait . i can not live with the terrible burden of wearing such a devilish item . i also can not continue to tease the prepubescent teens yearning for either a wink of the eye from me in this god-forsaken t-shirt like an acknowledging nod from one the jonas brothers or better yet , sponge bob in his ridiculous square pants.in the end , i am unable to recommend such an item for mass-purchase for fear of catastrophe of global consequences and the social unrest to follow . be wise , and may god bless us all ...
 I bought 16 of these shirts expecting to be swarmed by super models and celebrities , but instead I got diabetes ... And not just diabetes SUPERdiabetes ... These reviews are bloody awful and full of lies ! Nobody ever climbed mount everest with this wreteched diabetes shirt !!!!! And on top of that my girlfriend -LRB- now ex -RRB- went blind apon seeing this evil shirt ! She then promptly broke up with me after I tried to explain that the wolves would bring us money and fame ... THIS SHIRT IS A LIE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt , Available in Various SizesBefore purchasing this shirt I was doubtful about the claims that other reviews had made . But now that the truth has been reviled to me I have to warn as many people as I can about the dark 100 % cotton menace.The Journey began when I slipped this force of unnatural power over my God like body . At once I was taken to a world where I was hunting down small creatures , ending their lives and consuming their flesh . I thought it was truly `` wild , '' but the hunger grew inside of me . The shirt and I were one and together we had to find larger prey to satisfy this burning hunger for flesh.Oh yes what I tell you is the truth ... The first humans were only the homeless vagabonds that had no family that would miss them , but we moved on to consume my entire family and all of my friends . And the hunger still grows . This evil dark force has ruined my life . please listen to my warning and stay as far away from this thing as you can . It has ruined my life and it is sure to ruin yours !
 I am very skeptical about this product . There are lots of glowing reviews here on Amazon claiming that it endows the wearer with special powers -- sexual , magical , and otherwise . But I ca n't tell you how many pills I 've bought over the Internet that make the same claim , and have been disappointed in , over and over . Seriously , at best you get a slight itchy feeling from them , at worst ... well , without going into details that I 'm legally unable to share due to a court order , let 's just say they 've put a damper on my romantic activities , solo or otherwise.So while I do n't actually own this item , I just wanted to warn other customers who might buy the T-shirt based on these reviews ... beware . Not everything sold on the Internet is what it 's claimed to be . I learned this the hard way , many many times.I 'll probably buy the T-shirt anyway , just for the rocking picture though . That alone is worth the price .
 Despite the adulation from 145 other reviewers , I can not endorse this shirt . Clearly , it needs the legend `` Call of the Wild '' emblazoned on it . I would also settle for `` Spirit of the Wild '' , or perhaps an inspiring horse.Until they modify this otherwise fine product , I will have to stick with my `` End of the Trail '' shirt that I got at the flea market .
 I would have to disagree with the previous 270 -LRB- or so -RRB- reviewers . I bought this shirt , and expedited shipping because of the rave reviews and I had our annual toll-booth operators picnic , but really I do n't see what the hub-bub is about . OK , the illustration is nothing short of a masterpiece , but it did n't fit so well , and after 2 washes one of the wolves started to fade . I did n't not pay $ 30 for a 2 wolf shirt!Perhaps that is some of the magical power that some reviewers have referred to , but I just have n't seen it yet .
 The large graphics on the t-shirt is on the back . I thought it was on the front . My delivery was lost by my post man but when I contacted the seller he apologized and sent a replacement immediately . Overall very good customer service but the t-shirt was not what I had expected .

 I 've bought these socks from FootSmart over the past several years and loved them . Recently , I bought three more pairs of the socks from FootSmart and after one or two washings the tops of the cuffs started to unravel and get frayed . They continue to do so . FootSmart must have a different supplier . Would not buy again !
 The only complaint I have is that the belt that shipped was the wrong color . It was a dark royal blue and I had ordered the Columbia blue . It was labeled Columbia blue but that 's not what was in the package .
 A real bust . Not what was described at all . I completely wasted my money on this purchase . It was too cheap to justify the postage necessary to return it . Live and learn . I wo n't buy a belt like this online again . I needed the color we saw in the description , like the photo above , but received brown .
 No problems with the seller . The package arrived quickly and the price could not be beat.Unfortunately , the Cardinal Red belts I ordered , which should have been a bright vivid red , and which appear on the website as such , are hardly that color at all . The belts are dark , cranberry sauce red , which , unfortunately , does n't come any where near matching our true Cardinal Red uniforms . Oh well . They will be relegated to practice belts and I will keep searching .
 If you were expecting Gold to be yellow , as in uniform yellow , the base color axiomatic regular old sunflower safety tape yellow - look elsewhere . The belt is orange . I do n't know how they sell an orange color that could look more orange than this.Also , if you have dark pants , this belt 's inside lining shreds like toilet paper and it will get all over your pants each time you put it on.The buckle is exactly what you 'd expect for this price.But , tt holds up my pants and the elastic works just fine . It was cheap and functional . Two stars for that .

 I purchased this backpack in December . It was nice at first , but then stitching started coming loose and the inside pocket has a big hole in it -LRB- only lipstick went in that pocket -RRB- Due to Amazon 's return policy -LRB- 30 days -RRB- they were not able to help me with the bag . The Amazon Support was wonderful . They did help me find a number so I could call Prada.Prada would not honor their quality of the backpack because I bought it at Amazon . If I bought it in a store , they would fix it for me . The first person I spoke to at Prada Corp. was rude and condescending . The second person I spoke to was much nicer , but once she found out I bought the backpack on Amazon , she was a little bit condescending.The moral of the story is , I wo n't buy Prada from Amazon again due to being stuck with a substandard product and no way to ensure Prada will fix it .
 My fiance bought this bag for me . Within 2 weeks the straps/handles ripped off . Amazon would n't do anything -LRB- between purchase date and actually using it - it was past 30 days -RRB- . Prada also would not exchange or even fix it . Condescending staff . I had the bag fixed at a show cobbler . The interior lining also ripped very easily.Luxury good ? Not so much .
 I believe that these must be fake . Please take a look at the emblem on the inside lining . If the logo edges are not perfectly clear , then it is fake . Also in the genuine article , the nylon is thicker and more durable . The nylon does not wrinkle neat the leather trim . Also , the stitching is very durable .

 This was a bit to big in the bodice for me and the cups did not fit as I hoped . I am a natural 32DD/DDD and I need much more support . Had to return .
 This bustier made pretty good cleavage , but the boning was awkward . It pressed in just under the bust to push up for cleavage , but then the boning stuck out at the bottom . The boning that went over the `` love handles '' to enhance the natural waist definitely enhanced the natural waist , but the love handles grew . I have a long torso , and even I could n't sit comforatably -LRB- especially when the boning in the front got caught on my other clothing since it stuck out so far -RRB- . So if you have an average or short torso , do not buy . If you have a long torso with very little plumpness on your body , I 'm sure this product will be perfect for you because it enhances cleavage well .
 I bought it to go under a bridesmaid dress but I could n't even wear it because it was too bulky . By the time I realized it the time had passed and I could n't return it . Now I 'm stuck with something I ca n't use .
 I loved my first trager backpack . After many years of use it eventually came apart at the seams . I liked it so much , that I bought another . The same thing happened , the seams came apart , but this time it happened almost immediately . I contacted Trager and they asked me to send it in for repair or replacement . I did this . Then I NEVER heard back from them again . I have emailed , called and left VMs and tried everything . They have never responded to me . I now have to buy something else as I have been without the bag I was using every day . I will not buy another Trager product .
 I DID N'T KNOW THAT PARATROOPERS WORE SUCH BAGGY SHORTS ... OH WELL , THE WORD `` VINTAGE '' THREW ME OFF AGAIN
 I bought this bra based on the positive reviews that I read from various sites . The material , style and color are quite lovely . I was excited to try it on . Then my self-esteem fell through the floor
 These are the exact same shirts except with no pocket.The rave reviews are not warranted , as the material is a lotthinner than it used to be . See the reviews on the pocketed T.They are not as kind as these.I think the difference may be that those that like no pocket usethe T shirt for lounging , and not working.If you are going to use a T shirt for working in , you usually wanta pocket to carry notes/keys/parts , etc. and you want the T shirtthick .
 I specifically did a search for waterproof bags on Amazon and this came up . I purchased this for the purpose of storing toiletries in our suitcases for a flight to Florida . I wrapped plastic bottles with liquid in ziploc bags and put them inside the large tote . Well , one of the bottles containing Witch Hazel came out of the bottle , out of the ziploc and went RIGHT THROUGH this tote to the inside of the suitcase . I 'm glad it was just Witch Hazel and caused no damage . After that I put the Witch Hazel inside 2 ziplocs and it made it through the return trip without spilling out into the rest of the suitcase . I am upset that these totes were marketed as WATERPROOF when they ARE NOT !! These bags are not suitable for the purpose that I bought them , but I can use them as totes for other things . There are a nice large size .
 bought this bag from amazon and i got it dmaagedhad a tear on d base of d bag , and it smells awful
 `` Ordered this item to use as a carry on bag to get on a plane . 1st I did not get a shipping e-mail untill two days after the date when it was suppose to ship on amazon . Then after waiting for almost a week I get an e-mail saying this order has been cancelled by the merchant . So I have been waiting a week for nothing ! I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN ! THEY DO N'T EVEN DESERVE ONE STAR !! ''
 Buyer beware . Very cheap tote and can purchase one like it in the store for under $ 5 . I was so disappointed that I returned two and the shipping for 2 cost me over $ 8 -LRB- non-refundable . -RRB- Also I was not aware but returns are charged a 15 % restock charge.Hard to believe some of these 5 star reviews .
 Product much larger than it looks in the picture . Which for some would be considered a positive but , not for me . Way too big for what I need it for . My main issue is , in less than a week the zipper no longer worked . No matter which way I zip the bag is still open . Poor quality , understand it 's cheap but should last longer then a week .
 Ca n't understand why shipping was more than the price of the bag . This flimsy little bag could n't weigh over 3 or 4 ounces and could easily have been put in an envelope and mailed parcel post for just over a dollar . Guess that 's where the seller makes the profit . Was going to put things in the tote and give as a gift , but think I 'll just use a paper gift bag instead . The tote wo n't really add a lot . Color is pretty . That 's about all I can say that 's positive .
 This tote would be perfect for the beach or to keep in the car filled with lots of extras for the kids . I was looking for an inexpensive carry on bag and it 's really way too large for what I wanted . I should have paid more attention to the measurements since the tote was described ; instead , I purchased based on the picture and a few reviews . The tote is inexpensive , so I 'll find a use for it , but am still searching for that perfect carry on bag !!!

 My jeans showed up labeled 34x34 - as I had ordered them - but the true length was closer to 36 . Other than that , I like the fit/style and the price is right .
 This obviously is n't a rating of the product itself , but I do n't know any other way to do it . Never wore the pants cause they were at least 2 sizes smaller in the waist than labeled so had to send them back . I was very disappointed ; I guess mistakes happen , but ... No chance that I had wishful thinking about my waist size as I have two other Wrangler Jeans in this size and they fit fine , actually a little loose in the waist . The jeans seemed as advertised otherwise , but again , without actually wearing them , ca n't say much .
 These are the jeans I used to love . They used to be rugged , well fit , well made . The last few purchases of these jeans have been very very sub-par . Very thin material . Weak seams . Generally unsuitable for my purposes . If Wrangler wants to maintain the `` Rugged '' label on these jeans , they need to re-think the lousy craftsmanship of recent versions . I know I am shopping around for better jeans .
 After one wash and a few days of wear , the rear pocket started to separate from the seat . The waist seemed a bit larger than stated - I have to wear a belt to keep them up , which is something I did n't expect when I ordered them . Otherwise , the fabric and fit is ok .
 The Timbuk 2 Classic Messenger Bag is a very roomy bag . The large can fit a ton of Stuff . Unfortunately the strap is very uncomfortable.The 2 '' wide strap cuts my shoulder when the bag is loaded . The strap is also sewn on to one end which prevented me from replacing it with something more comfortable . So it sits in the corner ; looks nice but not very functionable .
 I got a Large timbuk2 and from the rides i 've taken it on , it is n't very comfortable . I got a strap pad , hoping this would fix the problem but it still persists . When i bought the bag it did n't come with the strap pad or a cross strap but from carrying a chrome citizen messenger bag and this , the chrome definitely beats it in at area of comfortability . The one plus is that it definitely is very roomy .

 I searched high and low for a large trunk organizer with a closing lid for my car . I discovered 99 % of all trunk organizers are without closing lids . After seeing this one and reading the reviews , I decided to order it . What a big mistake I made . The materials are very flimsy especially on the top . In fact , one side of the top of the tote by the zipper was partially ripped when I received it . Now you would think seeing the rip would have made me immediately return the item . Instead , I made a bigger mistake by procrastinating and now too much time has passed for me to return the tote . So , please save yourself time and expense by not ordering this item .

 Do not buy anything from this seller I bought a simple keychain an never got it but the seller made sure he took my money I tried messaging the seller an he never got back go me , so I then contacted amazon and I finally got my money back . I would never buy from this seller again !!
 Disappointing . The handle broke off . Their warranty is useless as you have to had remembered to save receipt and warranty paperwork . Sheezz ... My cheap-o 10yr old carry ons are still going stronger than this 3yr old one !
 I just received this bag in the mail . I was most unhappy as it was hideously scratched front and back . The item scratches easily and looks unsturdy
 The pull handle on the 20 in carry on will not extend ! Only used five or six times ... sometimes also very difficult to retract handle .
 We purchased a piece of your large Heys luggage from a retailer in preparation for our honeymoon . The second day into our honeymoon in Italy , the wheel 's rubber tread started to rip and the wheel also broke off its axle . When weighed at the airport , the large piece weighed in at 48lbs , so it should have stood up to the weight . Soon enough within 5 more days ' time , the second wheel was nearly bare and we had two non-functioning wheels . Since we were dragging the luggage on broken wheels the upper handle also broke.We researched multiple retailers , and thought we found a good sturdy piece of luggage that would last our 2.5 weeks trip . We spent $ 79.99 on this piece for the largest sized Heys Luggage.We still had the receipt in our hands , and tags and pictures to send to the company.Their resolution was to send the luggage to them and they will fix it . Well , the luggage was not usable and was in the garbage ! Their second solution = I BUY ANOTHER LUGGAGE AT WHOLESALE PRICE FOR $ 75 ! If I have to spend the same amount of money to replace a defective item , be very sure that I would not buy another HEYS ! I would never wish this horrible experience on anyone ! DO NOT BUY HEYS PRODUCTS ! NOT MADE WELL !
 I bought this luggage because of the `` lifetime warranty '' . After my 1st flight , the supposedly hard case luggage came back to me with a 6 inch crack in the side . Heys does not cover any damage sustained during travel , and does not take responsibility for selling a flimsy , weak `` hard `` case luggage . I will never buy Heys again .
 Yes it 's light but at a price . We have 4 pieces of Hey 's luggage and over the course of 3 flights in one year 3 out of the 4 pieces have broken . We wrote off the first incident as rough handling on behalf of the airline . The retracting handle was bent , kinked and unable to retract . Second incident was a huge dent in the corner , and a crack . Now just having returned from another trip , our third piece has had the retracting handle broken . The polycarbonate around the handle shattered , and the mechanism in the handle broken . And yes the polycarbonate looks sharp but is very susceptible to scuffs , scratches and marking so do n't expect your shiny new luggage to look that way for long.If you really need ultra lightweight luggage this may be the way to go but the trade off is too large for me , what 's the point of lightweight if it can not stand up to the rigors of travel ? 3/4 over 3 trips is just too high of a fail rate .
 I have had to replace both my sets of Heys luggage ... more than once . The single handle bar is not strong enough to take the stress of more than 30 pounds of luggage . The handle will break . The suitcases crush in when handled by airlines . The stitching will rip apart . The knob used to depress the handle will stop working . And Heys will tell you that the damage is not covered by their 5-year replacement warranty , after you have driven 40 minutes to one of their authorized repair centers . Then they will offer to wholesale you a new suitcase , which would be a waste of money , considering that this luggage is designed to break . When the company actually did replace on of my six suitcases purchased from them , they sent me the most hideous bright orange case , to clash with my pink and blue sets . This company is a nightmare to deal with . Buyer beware .
 The costume itself is okay , but the mask is just cheap plastic with a rubber band to hold in on your head . . it broke after my son wore it twice ... no its a costume with no mask . Nowhere did this say mask was plastic or I would not have bought it . . made it seem like it was fabric like the rest of the costume . This was a big waste of money .
 I bought a pair of NYDJ -LRB- Not Your Daughter 's Jeans -RRB- after reading a very complimentary article about them in Reader 's Digest . I ordered a petite size , as I usually wear petite jeans . They were too long and I had to shorten them . The thighs are nicely snug , not too tight , but the torso is so loose I can pull them on and off with the zipper and button closed . This is certainly not what I expected from $ 94.00 jeans ! My Lee Riders from Walmart at about $ 20 fit me better . What a disappointment !
 I love these jeans and wanted another pair . I tracked down the exact size and style number on Amazon and bought them . Even though all the numbers were correct , the pants were too small and I had to return them . Deducted from my refund was shipping and handling . I 'll not buy jeans again without trying them on in person before purchase
 I purchased a pair of size 6p Bootleg `` Not your daughter 's jeans '' . I have a pair already and they are a perfect fit . They arrived , and I tried them on but they were a bit tight . On further examination of the Jeans , the stitching around the `` Not your daughter 's jeans '' label was a bit untidy and , underneath that label was another label showing size to be 4p , not the 6p ordered.It makes me think the jeans are not authentic . I think the store should send me the correct authentic sixe 6p as ordered at their expense and have the others uplifted , again at their expense . Very unhappy , and am still waiting for a response from the store with their comments .
 My wife says she was expecting at least a nice pair of jeans for $ 99 . This is a quote from her
 The durability of this product was not very good . The lining tore within two months . Cute but not durable .

 Due to a problem with the order , it was never received -LRB- but paid for ! -RRB- . I contacted the vendor in good faith to resolve this manner and get my order . To date , they have failed resolve this and have since proven unconcerned , unhelpful and downright unwilling to help fix the problem . Bottom line
 We were very disappointed ! Half the clown costume was not included - the hat and shoes ! We were going to use the costume for a school play - luckily Nana made a new costume . This was $ 40 wasted !! Do n't waste your money on this costume or the supplier that sent it to Amazon !
 My daughter wore this one day for a school play . It came VERY wrinkled , and all the edges immediately began to fray . One of the pompoms on the front disintegrated halfway through the day , and the elastic bottom came off one of the shoes . Luckily , it looked cute from a distance while she was on stage , but my hopes of her wearing it for Halloween are gone ... it just was n't made to hold up well .
 This product cost $ 1 , but when I bought it , I found out that shipping for the product was $ 8 ! So I 'm not particularly happy about a $ 9 ditty bag.And it is n't really a ditty bag , it 's one of those cutsie bags with little segments of rope on the sides that function as shoulder straps for cute , popular , teenage girls .
 I orded 5XL , and most of the time thay are too big . These were a very snug fix .

 This set of four luggage looked great when we purchased them , and they served us great for a car trip up the West Coast of the US . However , on our first flight -LRB- an international one -RRB- , we discovered the fatal flaw to these suitcases

 Im 6 ' 1 '' and after the first wash , these shirts became too short for me to wear . I ordered 3 packs and 2 were Harbor Bay , 1 was George Foreman . The George Foreman shirts held up a LOT better than the other ones .
 Due to a problem with the order , it was never received -LRB- but paid for ! -RRB- . I contacted the vendor in good faith to resolve this manner and get my order . To date , they have failed resolve this and have since proven unconcerned , unhelpful and downright unwilling to help fix the problem . Bottom line
 All the pants were ordered size large . What I recieved were three different sizes with lables indicating large . two of the pants were so small I had to give them away . Do n't order this item you will get the shaft .
 The product did NOT fit . I have Orderd Head wraps from Other on line Merchants and they fit with room to spare . This was inferior workmanship ! But what can you expectwhen sellers order their products from CHINA , And do n't inspect them !!!! OR give a darn about quaility . But I guess ill take the blame . I went for the cheaper price . That will teach me !!!

 This umbrella is much heavier than other similarly sized automatics . Also , after you close it you have to mess with 2 straps to wind around the umbrella . Just kind of a pain .
 This umbrella seemed to withstand wind gusts , but after four uses the automatic open function stopped working . Worse is that it would no longer lock open , even if I pushed it open manually.I tried taking it out in the rain anyway with the canopy open but unlocked , and after taking two steps the canopy automatically collapsed , because it is designed to fold-up when unlocked . That part still worked . So now the umbrella is completely useless unless I want to use one hand to hold the handle , and one hand above my head to hold the canopy open.I was skeptical of an umbrella that opens and closes automatically with a push of the same button . My next one will be fully manual .
 I bought 3 of these umbrellas because they are small and handy . One broke the first time I opened it , the other two broke after just a couple of uses.What is breaking is the auto open/close mechanism . It has a plastic connector that breaks off within the first couple of times using the umbrella . Then not only is the automatic feature broken , but also you can not lock the umbrella open . Making it useless.I was going to return the first umbrella for a replacement , but when the other two broke right away , then I see that it is a problem with the design , so a replacement does me no good . They will all break the same way.I 'm looking for a different umbrella .
 I got this umbrella for Christmas . The company mistakenly sent two so I gave the second away . Big mistake . My umbrella lasted only 3 uses and then got stuck in the open position . I took advantage of the lifetime warranty , sent it back and received a similar London Fog umbrella as a replacement . This one lasted for 4 uses and then got stuck in the closed position . An incredible disappointment . I 've heard that Windbrella makes better windproof umbrellas .
 I was dissappointed with this product . It says automatic open BUT it is not totally automatic . After you press the button , it does pop up BUT you have to lock it in place manually . When you are also carrying packages , laptops or whatever this is a pain in the neck . But it is pretty small and pretty cheap so it 's not such a bad deal . But be warned , it is not 100 % auto open !
 I purchased 2 Rainkist Razor Automatic Open & Close Windefyer umbrellas as gifts . Both were defective and did not open or close .
 This umbrella broke the second time that I used it . The umbrella will not stay open and I believe that there is a broken spring in the central shaft of the umbrella.Futai is the company that manufactures this umbrella and the umbrella has a lifetime warranty . However , I just spoke with Stephanie at Futai 732-225-0416 , and she said to send her a check for $ 10.00 . A lifetime warranty where one has to pay 2/3 of the purchase price to get the product repaired is not really a lifetime warranty . It is more like a lifetime service program with a $ 10.00 repair fee.I will definitely avoid purchasing any Futai products in the future.I hope that this review helps someone .
 The closing mechanism failed after one year of very light use . Manufacturer offers `` Unconditional Lifetime Warranty '' which I have not tried . But the point is , the auto open/close mechanism should not fail so quickly . I am not alone , you will notice there are so many other customers facing the same problem with this product .
 First of all , do n't buy from Zaftique !!! I returned this -LRB- unworn , with tags still on -RRB- and they would n't give me my $ back ! Amazon had to give me a credit . Zaftique is super shady !!! Second , this dress is so bad
 It was okay - pretty cheaply made but looked acceptible and the price is cheap so you get what you pay for
 The workmanship in the sweatshirt was quite bad with an improperly cut pocket -LRB- left and right sides were a asymetrical -RRB- . The emblem was also inproperly centered . I returned it and the company was great about processing my return .
 This was the biggest piece of crap I 've ever purchased from Amazon . We had it for less then 1 hour and it broke , the prongs feel apart . We were leaving for Ireland in 2 days and had to scramble to find something local to purchase . DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS COMPANY OR THIS PRODUCT , YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED ! I would not recommend to anyone anytime .
 I bought these blaze orange bandanas for my dogs to wear during hunting season . They were starchy stiff when new -LRB- the dogs did n't complain though -RRB- and started to fall apart and , most importantly , FADE after washing . If you 're looking for lasting visibility for your pups I would recommend spending a little more on a blaze doggie vest with reflective tape .
 I got this for my seven year old and she ca n't walk with them ! , the plastic it 's too hard and it breaks easily . . since the plastic wo n't bend she looks like a robot trying to walk . . not a good item for children
 Do people care if it 's patchwork leather ? Absolutely . Most are n't rude enough to mention it because they 're not the ones who have to wear the thing . When I received mine , the patchwork was a rude surprise not mentioned in the advertisement . It looks as if pieces of scrap have been sewn together . That 's exactly what has been done . I 'm not against scraps , but I do n't enjoy my patchwork quilts in leather either thank you . The coat fit terribly and smelled absolutely atrocious . The new leather smell is n't very attractive to begin with , but I believe some excess sent must have been poured onto this coat . It was unbearable . I have never had that issue before . I donated the coat to the local high school drama department the next day . Given the price , I should n't have been such a fool and at least it was leather . I would still give it one star for that , even if zero were an option . This coat is baggy , ugly , and cheap looking , but You get what you pay for .
 I foolishly purchased 2 of these so-called `` leather '' trench coats on eBay in December 2011 ; same manufacturer lable -LRB- i.e. , Giovanni Navarre -RRB- except these were size 3XL . After paying about $ 90 in tailor 's fees , when I picked up the coat , the tailor told me that this was not a leather coat , but rather a Chinese imitation of leather . What each purchaser will find out , is that after wearing these coats for 2-3 weeks , and perhaps folding the coat , that the black finish of the coat will start to crack , particularly in the areas of the coat that are bent the most while wearing it -LRB- e.g. , the arm-shoulder area , the elbows -RRB- , and will then break/peel off exposing a white , heavy woven-fabric substrate beneath . The slightly elastic , black `` leather '' coating applied to the woven-fabric substrate appears to be some sort of polymeric finish . After reading one of he earlier 3-star reviews , I asked my tailor why this coat had so much stitching on it so as to make it appear to be made from sewn-together pieces of leather . His response was that this specifically was done to stabilize each sewn coated area from excess movement so as to keep the polymeric finish on the coat . Said he , `` If you know leather like I do , you can tell just from the feel of this garment that it is NOT leather . '' I 've been using a balck magic marker to stain the peeled-off coat areas black again and the coat looks horrible .
 Hello Amazon shopper . I am talking directly to you . You must decide if you are ready to learn about the Matrix . As a sign of your determination you will purchase this coat and change your name to Morpheus .
 This costume was not worth the money . Very flimsy construction . The concept was cute but the top half is horrible .
 First time I wore these socks , I got blisters on the achilles of my both feet , because the back part of these socks is way too short . Had to finish my training with my shoes off and send the socks right to trash bin after that first use
 they 're not the usual good adidas product , they 're a `` whatever '' socks with the adidas brand printed on them , better buy another type with these money . In Marshall I got the wonderful clima-cool sport for 6 $ two pairs
 I do n't understand the purpose of these socks , they are ankle high so you wo n't use them in the winter but they are very thick so you ca n't use them in the summer as your feet will feel on fire .
 Do n't waste your money , these socks are too thick and do n't breathe at all . I use them for rags now .
 I bought this bra based on the positive reviews that I read from various sites . The material , style and color are quite lovely . I was excited to try it on . Then my self-esteem fell through the floor
 ordered it , sent me a complete different hat ... cheap too , had all these holes in it . . sorta like a jersey , very dissapointed but opened and didnt want to go through all the hassle for a return . . womp
 This product does not keep your ears warm and falls apart easily . Do n't waste your money .

 The girl is wearing the kimono incorrectly . The left goes over the right . She is wearing it as a dead person right now . If you are going to do kimono , please do it right with respect to the Japanese origins of it .
 Have n't worn product yet , but the quality of the socks was not what I expected . They look as if they will stretch out .
 I might buy them if I knew what size they are !

 The sizing chart listed was not accurate . Hence , the shorts ordered were about 5 sizes too big .
 These are very cheaply made socks . The material is thin and they are not at all comfortable . They have n't washed well .
 Bought these pants in a 30w 30l for my boyfriend . We have purchased Ben Davis brand items before , ie . work apron , vest . The quality is excellent but the fit on the pants was extremely too large . He looked like he was swimming in them , even after ordering his correct size . These pants must be made for larger individuals . We are disappointed that they are n't true to size because they are really nice pants .
 The item I received was n't good . . quality was n't great . . The merchant will not respond to my emails requesting a return label . . I will never buy from this company again . .
 First off they are pretty good looking shorts , but at $ 33.95 we want more . The problem is one of my pet peeves typically found in cheap shorts , the pockets are extremely shallow . When sitting stuff falls out . You may lose your pocket knife and keys and phone and other valuable stuff . . every time you get comfy . Secondly , the cinch rope at the waist is short ! I guess it would be a perfect length on shorts with a 32 inch waist , but on my 42 '' it 's a joke . Rope is cheap adding several inches to the shorts so the thing can function would cost almost nothing . Also the overall length of the shorts is very long . On my 6 ' 1 '' frame they hang to several inches below my knee . Almost capri length . So . . in my opinion keep shopping .
 I testify that these socks are tooooo big . I bought a 7-pack . Man , I usually wear size 9 or 91/2 sized shoes , but these socks areat least one inch larger . They are stupid to make such huge socks.If you wear shoes with size 12 or above , these may be good deals
 need to say what the size isneed to offer more colors
 I might buy them if I knew what size they are ! I would like to thank the reviewer that gives the approximate size , I 'm glad I did n't buy them they would have been to big . Amazon needs to wake up , you 're slipping fast !
 Item was all scratched up when it arrived ... Contacted seller and received no response ... Do not trust this seller ...

 I would consider this more of a &#34; windbreaker &#34; than the warm jacket that other reviews had implied . Had to return it .
 I was expecting something remotely similar to the picture but they were n't at all what I thought . They do n't stay up at all and the rhinestones -LRB- not shown in the pciture -RRB- were stuck to eachother and almost ripped the nylon apart completely I guess you get what you pay for here . NOTE

 This terry cloth wrap was pretty flimsy for the price , plus it said `` medium '' but the waist is way too big for me , and I am always a medium .
 When you use this bag in the messenger position -LRB- pictured -RRB- , you can not put anything in the bag becuase it is full of itself . The only way you can acually use it to carry anything is to open it up and carry it like a shopping bag . I was disappointed . But , on the plus side , it is light weight and small and you can throw it in your suitcase and in case your possesions `` grow '' on your trip , you 'll have an extra bag for them !
 It 's kind of flimsy and too small for travel . Might be OK for carrying around groceries . I ended up returning it .

 so thin , when it rains it may be a good choice if u do n't have a raincoat .
 plz do smth . . i have not yet received the packet ... its been too long ...
 This short has an underwear liner that feels rather strange . I am going to return these .
 Im 6 ' 1 '' and after the first wash , these shirts became too short for me to wear . I ordered 3 packs and 2 were Harbor Bay , 1 was George Foreman . The George Foreman shirts held up a LOT better than the other ones .
 I have a flip flop necklace from years ago from Avon , ive been trying to find one like it since . Came across this one . Ordered the white , but it has a yellowish tint to it . Does not look white . And the chain is very short . meant for kids . And I have to break the chain to get the fip flop off to put it on another chain . I wont buy another one again .
 THE GOOD THING IS THAT IT FITS , OTHER THEN THAT T IS STIFF AND UNCOMFORTABLE . NOT HOW THEY USED TO MAKE EM .
 This brief is cut way to short and should not be advertised as Big & Tall as it is neither . Howver , I was able to retunr them without any problem .
 If I knew that I was going to get a cheap tee with iron on letters , I would have made it myself
 they cancelled my order less than a week before halloween ! They are totally unprofessional . They also did not answer my inquiries regarding my order . I would NOT recommend ordering from zoogster .
 I did n't have high expectations for the price , but this costume is REALLY cheap looking . It is different from what is pictured on the site and the packaging it arrived in . Instead of a shirt and black pants , it is a one-piece tan jumpsuit with a sash - goofy . Was told by seller that manufacturer must have changed the design ?? To say the fabric is flimsy would be generous . Yoda mask was squashed out of shape . Unfortunately , it arrived so late from seller , I can only make the best of it .
 I own a pair of Men 's Rockport Waterproof Moc-toe Chukkas Dark Brown , they are so not waterproof ... Rockport proved to be useless against rain . My feet got wet after I took a walk down the street in the rain , and I thought they are supposed to be `` waterproof ? '' I am very disappointed . Maybe they should be labeled `` water repellent '' instead of `` waterproof '' !!!!
 This is a very light weight sweatshirt which is available in many colors , but if you want a quality heavy weight sweatshirt this is not it .
 Updated Review
 Proof that you get what you pay for , these low-priced sweatshirts are thin and skimpy . Sweatshirts seem to have taken the same quality nosedive as jeans . Ribbing around collar is especially thin . I am still searching for the real thing .
 I orderd this shirt for my boyfriend in Canada . I knew it would n't get there in time for Christmas , but I did n't know this company would deliver it to the wrong address ! Hell , they delivered it to the wrong country ! When I tried contacting them , they did n't even have to courtesy to reply to any of my emails . I will NEVER buy from them again and I would n't recommend anyone buying from them if you want your items delivered to the right place . I hope whoever recieved it enjoys it , because my boyfriend never will . Nothing like paying good money for nothing !!!!!!!
 paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon/this store - NEVER AGAIN !
 First , the shipping and packaging . Very poor for both . Shipping was far too long . I waited almost two weeks to get the four sweatshirts that I ordered . The packaging was in a plastic bag which was okay , however the sweatshirts were just stuffed into the bag . All of them were dirty and needed to be washed right away . They looked like they had been stored in someones garage or worse ... in the trunk of somebody 's car . I would be very surprised if I discovered Fashion Rack was a real store and not some roadside vendor.Second , I ordered XL and glad I did . I normally wear a large , but after receiving four dirt and dust covered sweatshirts and laundering them , they shrunk to just about a Large size . I 'm not sure what will happen with the next laundering . If they shrink more they will be too small and unwearable.The material is very light . This is fine with me . Others may not like a light sweatshirt . It wo n't keep you warm in very cold climates.All in all , I got what I paid for . A cheap sweatshirt .
 Problem is - I do not know how I like this product because I received sweatpants and a sweatshirt . Can you help me with the return ? There was no paperwork mailed in the package received
 If the bag dimensions were correct , five stars . Received two X000CUW2CN -LRB- Authentic-1904-Smoke-OS by Featured Apparel , Inc. -RRB- bags in four days . Seller RSS . The Amazon.com advertised bag dimensions were , and still are six days after Amazon.com was informed of the discrepancy , `` 18 1/4 '' W x 15 '' H x 10 1/4 '' D. '' Bag heights are about right . Pulling the bag tops tight , W+D = 21.5 '' on one bag , 21.25 '' on the other ; W+D should have been 28.5 '' , so the bag is much smaller than advertised . Outside-pocket has inside dimensions 7.5 '' D x 7 '' W. Zippered lighter-weight-fabric inside-pocket , opposite side from outside-pocket , has inside dimensions 4 '' D x 6 '' W and zipper fully open is 5 '' ; a hundred pack of 3x5 index cards will rotate into the pocket . Snap hardware , centered under the handles , is mounted on 0.75 '' webbing 2.25 '' L after sewed horizontally to bag -LRB- loose in the middle at snap h/w -RRB- ; nicely done . Handles are 1.5 '' webbing , 9 '' center-to-center , 21 '' loop above bag , i.e. , 10.5 '' to apex . Quality zipper and snap . Sewing excellent . Color correct .
 The bag looks cheap . The company did not inform me that the one I ordered was out of stock . After waiting almost a month I emailed them , that is when I was informed . I was given the option to pick another bag , that one arrived in about a week . It was quite a disappointment .
 I ordered the Tote bag and received a messenger bag with a small tear on the handle . I am very disappointed with the bag that I received , if I wanted a messenger bag I would have order one .
 Does n't look as nice as the one pictured here . My first thought when I saw it was , oh , it 's kind of ugly .
 I ordered it and was informed several weeks later it was no longer in stock
 When you order this product you will get a harbor bay product . It 's not the same ! George Foreman is not availabe via causale male even though this web site says that the product is `` in stock '' .
 Unfortunately , this jacket had a slit in the back . Because I am handicap , I was unable to take it to the post office to be returned . I think I 'll stick with movies , cd 's and books from Amazon . Wo n't buy clothing again .
 This bra did not live up my wife 's expectations . The write-up was good but did not fit or enhance as expected .
 I have 34dd breasts and I usually buy from victorias secret because I find their bras most comfortable but I was looking for a cheaper option and this had such great reviews . I do n't know how anyone would like this bra . The fabric is cheap and very scratchy , the straps do n't have much room to adjust , and it was very unflattering when I tried it on . I am only 21 so my boobs are still quite perky but this bra just squished them down and did not lift at all .
 Not comfortable at all . Cheap material . Bad looking.Don ' t buy , even it 's cheap , but still not worth.Don ' t waste money .
 Fit poorly and made me feel like Madonna in her cone bra ! sent this one back !
 THIS BRA CAME AT THE SAME TIME AS A VANITY FAIR . IT IS EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE AND I DO N'T LIKE IT .
 I am a 38 DDD , when I put this on in the store I thought `` Great ! Its fits and it 's affordable ! '' Then I wore it for an hour ... these underwires have NO cushion at all , the wire is thin gauge and it just jams you right on the ribs ... aweful !!! For big girls , Wacoal is worth the $ 65 !!
 They actually had my size and the bra fits correctly . but it 's incredibly scratchy . I already pulled off the tags , so I doubt I can send it back .
 While I love Bali Bras for fit and comfort , I find the underwires do not last long and tend to break after a year or less . When they do break the underwire metal is dangerously sharp and breaks thru the fabric . I hope the company can improve on this otherwise comfortable bra .
 I will be returning this item to the vendor . I rec 'd . this skirt for my daughter and thought it had a colorful embroidery . Instead I find the word BASKE in a mirrored embroidered image . Not sure what BASKE stands for . I guess it 's their idea of ` short for Basketball ' . WHATEVER ! You ca n't see the pic clearly . I 'm out the shipping cost on this one . What a bummer !

 the lens was kinda too big . . even thought I bought the small version ... and the ear piece was totally flat so it would have to be heated and moulded - but should n't it fit right away ? especially for the price of them !! . . they totally slid off my face . . sigh . . I returned them . . but got charged a 15 % restocking fee ... buy sunglasses only if you have tried them on before hand !!!

 This bodysuit does not do what it claims . Does not hold anything in at all . This was a total waste of nearly $ 100 because it is not returnable . It is comfortable if you are wanting a liner for your clothing but do n't order it if you are wanting any control at all . Wish I had ordered something different .
 This does not hold in anything . It is far too stretchy and too expensive . The only use is as expensive long johns

 I did like the bust support and the control on this camisole . However the bottom ROLLS up - a lot . So it may control but now you have a ROLL around your waist - which is really uncomfortable ! It should be shorter - it wants to go all the way down to the bottom of your butt - but if I need control down there I would buy bottoms . I am tempted to cut it to make it shorter so it wo n't ROLL up on my -LRB- and when I say roll - I mean you get a roll of material around your waist unless you secure it with your underwear - and even that does n't work all the time -RRB- . Like the initial concept but wo n't buy this again .
 they cancelled my order less than a week before halloween ! They are totally unprofessional . They also did not answer my inquiries regarding my order . I would NOT recommend ordering from zoogster .
 I 'm so disappointed in this product . I searched for a thong bodysuit for ages with the intent of wearing it under all types of clothing including jeans and summer dresses . The bottom of this is fine but the bra part has such thin coverage that it 's of no use . I could only wear this with very heavy shirts or sweaters -- no t-shirts or thin tops unless I want the outline of everything showing . For $ 75 it 's a major disappointment . If it were half that I might keep it to wear very occasionally . As it is , it 's going back .
 Squeezes all over , gives you a wedgie , does n't flatter the bust , husband said it looked like something for an old lady , Not Hot !
 I still did n't get my order till now , I sent out an email , no one get back to me , Im about to call my bank to get my refunds , its been almost a month now .

 I bought these for my 8 yr . old daughter to use with her Halloween costume . They didnt even make it through a full wear before they started to pull apart at the seams . I do not recommend this product !

 Royal/Black/White shirt . Of the semi-affordable rash guard shirts available through Amazon this was the best I could find -LRB- without motifs like skulls -RRB- . After receiving it I compared it to a similarly priced Quicksilver -LRB- purchased elsewhere -RRB- and returned the Body Glove shirt to Amazon . The Quicksilver shirt fit better -LRB- both mediums -RRB- and looked better . The Body Glove shirt looks like it 's from the nineties while the Quicksilver shirt is modern and well-designed . You may want to look elsewhere for good rash guard shirts , Amazon does n't have this area covered .
 Great looking shirt but very very small . I ordered 2 sizes up and still had to return it . Great speedy service both in receiving the order and return .

 Okay , so maybe 50 pounds is a slight exageration but these jeans definately made me look chunky and figure-less . They did nothing for me at all . I am 5 ' 9 '' , have a 34.5 inseam , a short torso and generally wear a size 8-10 . I took the advice of other reviewers and ordered a size smaller because they are super duper stretchy -LRB- which I do n't like -- a little stretch is good -RRB- but it did n't help . I have a curvy figure and these jeans actually made my butt look flat ! Not Good . I 'm sending them back because even though they were $ 14 , they 're still not worth the price .
 If you take a size 8 get a 6 MINIMUM ... they run BIGNot my `` cup of tea '' -

 These are paper thin cotton and feel rough . They may soften if washed a few times but the fabric is so thin they may also disintegrate ! A big thumbs down from me and I 'm usually a CK underwear fan .

 I ordered this dress and when I received it , I thought that it was very pretty . When I put the dress on , it was completely see through . You could see my bandaid on my thigh . I would not suggest this dress for anyone based soley on the material.It 's a shame because they dress is very flattering and also comfortable.It would also be impossible to wear anything under this dress -LRB- including pasties -RRB- because it seemed to show everything !
 this dress and company are HORRIBLE . the material is ridiculously cheap and see through . i returned the dress and the company said they would refund my money immediately . i sent the dress back and a month went by before i called HotFash . they told me they refunded my money and they NEVER had . i was on the phone for over an hour with amazon and with hotfash to get my refund . it was a nightmare .
 These are paper thin cotton and feel rough . They may soften if washed a few times but the fabric is so thin they may also disintegrate ! A big thumbs down from me and I 'm usually a CK underwear fan .
 These pants are definitely not Carhearts . I guess you get what you pay for . Mine came with a small thread tear in mine and it looks like that is the spot where it is going to open up and form a hole . Also the fit is off . They hang way too low from the crotch and look like the pants my father used to wear 40 years ago.I will not be wearing these very often . Definitely not for work.Bill
 These jeans ripped the first day I had them , I sewed them up to make them last at least a little while and the freaking zipper broke . Total garbage , what happened to the good clothing manufacturing .
 These have 9 heavy duty belt loops . The size and length are accurate . The material is a little stiff - towards canvas - only washed once tho . Very little shrinkage . Not as soft as old blue jeans , but feels armored . Much more rugged . I am buying another pair - different color.UPDATE
 It just looks like a cheap tee . The graphics are n't impressive . My husband is a big fan of Metallica but he 's owned this shirt for two months and has never worn it . The shirt itself is n't thin or see thru so I think it 'll wash up well . It 's just the graphic itself that I 'm not thrilled about .
 I recently purchased this product and when i put it on it felt really soft then i checked the brand and it said hanes , very disapinted to be honest it still looks cool but im not sure if its gon na last long
 Shirt received promptly , but the shirt neck hole was way too small . I snagged on my adams apple and I choked . After I was able to squeeze my head through , the shirt felt like sand paper -LRB- all parts -RRB- . Do yourself a favor and buy a true Master t-shirt . And sorry Goodwill , this shirt is coming your way !
 this is a cheap after market shirt . aweful thick fabric , some brand called allstyle . THIS IS NOT A BRAVADO SHIRT ! we have 3 others that have the bravado logo printed in the inside . everything is printed in thick plastic screen . So very disappointing . will not buy a tshirt from old glory via amazon .
 I was very disappointed with this product . Not only was the sizing way off but the Dodgers emblem on the front of the shirt was placed on the stomach area rather than on the upper chest like most emblems are on a shirt . In addition , the emblem started to peel off after only 1-2 washes . Very disappointed .

 It should be Papa `` J '' for junk.I 've had a pair of VZ Papa G sunglasses -LRB- black frame , grey lens -RRB- for about six weeks now that I purchased locally and the lens coating that they had put on the inside part of the lens is already starting to rub/peel off badly . I take very good care of my sunglasses and this should not happen.I 've never owned a pair of Von Zipper sunglasses before this and I can tell you that I doubt I 'll be buying one of these cheaply made sunglasses ever again.I do like the way these sunglasses look and the tint is very easy on the eyes , but if I wanted to buy junk , I could go down to my local drugstore and get a cheap pair of sunglasses for twelve bucks instead of the hundred or so dollars that VZ sunglasses sell for.Stick with Maui Jim or Revo and , for the money , RayBan is excellent as well .
 The dress looks extremely cheap !!!! I would n't sell it at a yard sell , much less give it away !!! I wo n't buy from that site again.Signed , Highly disappointed : -LRB-

 This product was fine , however it was meant for a Halloween costume . I ordered a week and a half from Halloween along with several other pieces of my costume . All of them arrived with plenty of time to spare except for this . It finally arrived almost a week after Halloween .
 Proof that you get what you pay for , these low-priced sweatshirts are thin and skimpy . Sweatshirts seem to have taken the same quality nosedive as jeans . Ribbing around collar is especially thin . I am still searching for the real thing .
 This is a very light weight sweatshirt which is available in many colors , but if you want a quality heavy weight sweatshirt this is not it .

 First , the shipping and packaging . Very poor for both . Shipping was far too long . I waited almost two weeks to get the four sweatshirts that I ordered . The packaging was in a plastic bag which was okay , however the sweatshirts were just stuffed into the bag . All of them were dirty and needed to be washed right away . They looked like they had been stored in someones garage or worse ... in the trunk of somebody 's car . I would be very surprised if I discovered Fashion Rack was a real store and not some roadside vendor.Second , I ordered XL and glad I did . I normally wear a large , but after receiving four dirt and dust covered sweatshirts and laundering them , they shrunk to just about a Large size . I 'm not sure what will happen with the next laundering . If they shrink more they will be too small and unwearable.The material is very light . This is fine with me . Others may not like a light sweatshirt . It wo n't keep you warm in very cold climates.All in all , I got what I paid for . A cheap sweatshirt .
 Problem is - I do not know how I like this product because I received sweatpants and a sweatshirt . Can you help me with the return ? There was no paperwork mailed in the package received
 I orderd this shirt for my boyfriend in Canada . I knew it would n't get there in time for Christmas , but I did n't know this company would deliver it to the wrong address ! Hell , they delivered it to the wrong country ! When I tried contacting them , they did n't even have to courtesy to reply to any of my emails . I will NEVER buy from them again and I would n't recommend anyone buying from them if you want your items delivered to the right place . I hope whoever recieved it enjoys it , because my boyfriend never will . Nothing like paying good money for nothing !!!!!!!
 paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon/this store - NEVER AGAIN !

 I was so tempted ! And I did it ! Do n't do it ! The quality of the fabric is not what you are hoping for ! The hems rolls incessantly ! I really like this company , have ordered from them for years , but this product really , really bit the dust !!! It did n't turn out AT ALL like pictured ! Very sloppy product . The fabric is horrid . Talk about `` panties in a bunch ... ''

 The belt is made out of foam , the top is beyond cheap fake leather , I did not order the XS but it is what I recieved . I ordered a M/L , but suprisingly the XS skirt fit me , the bra is TINY , so I had to send back anyways .

 My daughter needed a Statue of Liberty costume for a school project , so I bought this . The elastic strap on the crown broke on both sides in the 1 1/2 hours she wore it . The costume was cute , but not durable at all . Would not recommend it to anyone .
 This item is a different color than what was pictured ; it is a bright green costume as opposed to the copper colored torch .
 The size was way off very thin -LRB- cheap -RRB- material for the price.over priced priced their should not be a word number required .
 It looks very cheap . I bought it for my grandson 's christmas present . I wanted to return it , but there was about an $ 8 shipping cost and a r 20 % restocking fee . I felt I already had too much money in an inferior product .

 We ordered the 5 piece tote twice and both times it arrived at our house with pieces broken off of the largest suitcase . If this suitcase can not even survive shipping from the manufacturer inside of a box with bubble wrap , then I doubt it will hold up on any airline baggage conveyor belt ! I also suspect -LRB- but can not prove -RRB- that after I returned the first set of luggage due to damage and requested a replacement set , that the same set was shipped back to me again because the broken piece was in the same area ! For the second return I just requested a refund .

 I purchased a white one and it looked great.However , the only pro was looks and there were more cons.The hoodie is very thin and is n't worth wearing for fall nor winter.The inside cotton gets stuck onto clothing . It is not a smart idea to wear dark colors underneath it especially black.It 's a nice brand , not worth the price and there are better ones out there .

 This pouch is too big for a single pair of glasses but made of the right material to protect them . I liked the idea of the carabiner_type hook attachment but the piece of metal -LRB- metal spring -RRB- that closes the mouth of the hook comes off when you try and detach the pouch from the loop of your pants . You also need to reinstall it a certain way or it does n't work as a spring . Something needs to be done to keep that piece of metal in place , without that this case is pretty worthless as far as I 'm concerned .
 This case is a lot bigger than an average pair of sunglasses ; too big and bulky . the metal piece on the clip is constantly coming off and breaking loose under normal pressure to release clasp . Do n't like this , I would return it if I had the original packaging .
 The case is too big for carrying around attached to a belt.Best for storing items in a luggage.It is big enough for 2 glasses or other items .
 I do not recommend buying anything from this company . My order from Civilian Labs arrived later than promised and only after I contacted the company to complain . And still , I did n't get everything I ordered from this place . I 'm now trying to get my money back . I do n't know about you , but I 've had mostly great experiences through Amazon and I do n't know why they deal with yahoos like Civilian Labs . They have very poor customer service . Do n't get stuck dealing with a company like this -- Order from a reputable business .
 Case itself is great , like Oakley case plus some cool attachment design . But the snap closure on the MOLLE strap is completely useless ! It does not close at all , when the package arrived from Amazon , it was wide open , and they just do n't stay closed ! Wow , what a deal breaker that is , because I was going to attach this to my third line gear to keep my eyepro safe . Total failure Civilian Lab .

 I 've already washed and aired these cubes out multiple times and the strong chemical smell still wo n't come out . As another reviewer described it smells like `` burned plastic and grease . `` Really unhappy as I purchased these right before I moved overseas .
 Pros - Seems to be well built and fold to a compact size . They are just the right size for carryon luggagecons - STRONG smell , like gasoline . Hopefully airing them outside will remove this smell . definately not usable out of the bag . If not they will be returned . Airing them out did no good.I returned the item to Altman Luggage and was issued a refund . So I 'm out the return postage and nothing to show .
 When I first received these I thought they would be great because they are a little more spacious than most other brands . After using them I would not recommend buying these packing cubes . My clothing stuck to the solid surface and it transferred black color to my light colored clothing ruining them . The black would not wash out .
 Bought these for a trip and while the design was nice the Cubes all had a very strong chemical/petroleum smell which I assume is from the material used in manufacturing . Let them air out for a week and they still stink and will be returned to Amazon . There is no way I would pack my vacation clothes in these .
 Mesh ripped apart upon first use . We 've used our Eagle Creek packing cubes since 2003 , when we took them on our backpacking trip through Spain and Portugal , then all over the U.S. over the past 9 years , and not one piece of mesh has ripped on the Eagle Creek cubes . These are inferior and I would return them , except the time to return has elapsed.I would NOT recommend these cubes to anyone for any purpose .
 I was pretty excited when I ordered these thinking that well finally I can keep my stuff organized while travelling.When they finally came , I was pretty disappointed with what I received.I quality of these packing cubes is really not good , they are made up of very poor material , almost flimsy.Even the zipper was bad quality and was getting struck from the start.Had to return it .
 First thing is first : * These packing cubes have the most AWFUL stench . They reek of plastic & grease . * They are flimsy , do not hold shape . * They are hand wash only and it is impossible to wash this stench away , thus leaving me with stinky clothes . : / I am very unhappy . * My boyfriend has one Eagle Creek brand packing cube which is machine washable , keeps its shape , and has NO odor . AMAZING!STAY AWAY FROM THESE AGHHH THEY ARE TERRIBLE !
 The stitching is very cheap , the zippers snag easily and the mesh ripped on my first trip . By contrast , on the same trip , my Kiva packing cubes held up wonderfully . That is why I downgraded to two stars . The direct comparison .
 Since they had Rick Stevens name on this I expected more . You can go to any department store and get the same thing a lot cheaper at the same quality . So small the largest one will only hold two folded shirts .
 I bought these right before leaving on a trip to Europe . I 'm now back from Europe , two months later , and two of the three bags have tears in the mesh -LRB- interestingly , at the same place , along the seam -RRB- . That 's ridiculous after one trip , to one city and back . I 've bought similar bags from ebags before , the things have lasted me years , they 're fabulous , and if you compare the quality , these Rick Steves bags do n't even come close - all you have to do is feel both to see the difference -LRB- I 'm still using the ebags , I just needed more , so figured I 'd buy these and get them shipped quickly with Prime -RRB- . I 'm really annoyed about this . I bought these assuming that with Rick Steves ' name on it , I could pretty much guarantee these would be a good buy . Wrong . I 'm sorry , but buy these at your own peril - these are not high quality . Anyway , feel free to click through and read my profile , I 'm not some guy working for the competition . Just a guy seriously annoyed at how cheap -LRB- in quality -RRB- a lot of things are becoming nowadays . I 'm glad that a lot of folks seem to like these bags - I did too , before my flight . Buy them are your own peril . I told ya so.PS I actually found a phone number for Amazon , and they gave me the phone for the Rick Steves people , you have to return it to them .
 I bought both the Rick Steves Cubes and the ebags cubes , and although both are good to keep your luggage organize , the zippers on Rick Steves Cubes get stuck all the time . The ebags are much better quality , easier to use and their sizes are much better . The small size of the Steves cube are not good for clothes , there are too small . It is worth to pay a little more and buy the ebags cube .

 Though this backpack is large enough to hold a couple of suits , towel , fins , goggles , cap and pull buoy , the materials do n't seem strong enough to support a full pack.The main compartment is made of a mid-grade , water-resistant canvas . The mesh pockets , though , are the pack 's weakest point . They are made not of nylon , but of cheap plastic , which breaks over time , making them unusuable . The pockets are essential for storing wet suits , so once they 're broken , the pack is useless to swimmers . My first pack had holes in the mesh pockets within a few months ; I foolishly exchanged it for a second and now it too has holes in the mesh pocket.Furthermore , when the pack is full , the weight is poorly distributed and strains the middle back and shoulders . For the price , one can do much , much better .
 I have never seen such cheap manufacturing practice as in this product . I liked the feel and the color of these sweats but the ankle was a little tight so I decided to make them straight leg . Upon opening up the seam I found a rubber band on both legs . What happened to elastic ribbing ? About a week later the draw string came unstitched in the back and came out making me more irritated . I tossed these sweats . I remember Russell having good quality back in the 90s ! What happened ?
 Not correct size . I have several pairs of these sweats . Gave to friend . Will not order items from this store again , because they may be selling rejects . Do n't know for sure .
 I really wrestled with whether to make my son 's costume this year or to purchase it . Although I 've made costumes in the past , the unfortunate truth is that it 's much cheaper to buy a ready-made than to spend money on materials . It 's tough to compete with `` Made in China ! '' However , I know that I can -LRB- usually -RRB- make a better-quality costume , but this year we were also moving , and I was worried about how much time I 'd have to sew . I ordered this costume and was so disappointed when it came . I almost sent it back , but thought better of it because of time constraints . My son , however , loves it . He is n't worried about the quality like I am . The fabric is very thin and snags easily . Due to the way the costume was packaged , a Velcro closure caught on an outer part of the costume and snagged it , even before we tried it on . I am spending a little extra money and time to embellish the costume to make it look a little better
 I ordered this costume for my 6 year old and he could barely move in it . The head piece was so small it had to be for an infant . The only good thing about this costume is that it looks like the picture .
 As others have said , the hat is way too small . Called the company -LRB- rubies -RRB- and they were not helpful at all , buyer beware !
 This was the worst costume I have ever seen in person . It looks nothing like the photo and the material is sooooo horrible . The strings to tie the neck even arrived broken . Do n't bother with this tin man costume .
 We do a family theme every year for Halloween , this year it will be Wizard of Oz . Received this costume for my oldest son -LRB- age 10 -RRB- today , we have been very anxious to receive . I opened it up and while the body part of the costume is amazing , the head part of the costume will not even fit on my 3 year olds head . Think there has been some sort of mix up on this .
 This tin man suit came significantly larger than the size indicated -LRB- I ordered the 12-14 -RRB- and the tin man hat was too small for an infant to wear -- it would have barely fit a small poodle . Very poor quality . If I could give it a negative number of stars , I would

 Good idea in theory , but it is too short to span any area much to work . They might think about selling it longer -LRB- charging more of course -RRB- . You could always tie a knot in it to then adjust it . Maybe two together would work ? Velcro at ends good idea . Did not work well for us .
 This thing is exactly what it says it is , and does what it says it does , if you can find the right place to use it . In 2 of the 3 hotels I stayed in while I was in the Philippines , I could not find two suitable end points close enough to each other to attach it to . In the third , I was able to find several end points to attach it to , but none were strong enough to stretch it from one to the other without risking damage to the things I attached it to . -LRB- When stretched the distance needed there was upwards of 50 to 150 pounds of force on the line , which was enough to pull the endpoints out of the wall if I were to have used them . The picture of the item is a little out dated since there are also Velcro straps on the ends . Those Velcro straps help you attach the line to larger things like wide posts but often by cinching the Velcro strap around the line itself , cutting down on the available length.I ended up leaving this behind with my host family in the Philippines . -LRB- I do n't know what they will do with it , because their home construction certainly is n't strong enough to attach the line either . -RRB- One of the younger girls was using it alternately as a jump rope or as a leash for her younger cousin . Ha-ha ! I think that the line could be useful if it were maybe 2 or 3 times longer . You could always tie off the extra length if needed .
 I have personally `` backpacked '' all over the world on several different continents and have over a year of travel time logged.A clothes line is a good idea to have for when you need to dry clothes in your hotel/hostel/camping . Here are my issues with this product .1 . It SMELLS ! strongly of latex . Think condoms or surgical gloves . I suspect that if left close to cloth items in your pack that it would give your clothes and thus you a latexy smell .2 . It 's too large wrapped up . This is mainly caused by the fact that it is three strands woven together vs. one , which is promoted as a way to hang clothes `` without clothes pins '' in reality you can simply drape your clothes over a line . When drying indoors they wo n't blow away , so why use clothes pins anyways ? 3 . The Velcro loop ends do n't seem like an effective way of attaching the line to objects . Too bulky , and simple hooks would have worked better .4 . When stretched out to `` 7 feet '' -LRB- Note , on the actual product it only claims a 6 foot capacity -RRB- it feels dangerous . Picture a giant rubber band stretched taught , ready to snap , or at minimum , attempting to pull apart whatever the chord ends are attached to .5 . This is just a personal annoyance , which for me amplifies all of this product 's defects . It 's too gimmicky with the whole `` Rick Steve 's Travel Gear BS '' As if Rick Steve 's is constantly hand washing his laundry while traveling deep in foreign countries ! LolAlright , so here is what I DO recommend . It 's called `` 550 Chord '' . If you do n't know what this is , just search for it here on Amazon . Here 's how 550 chord blasts away this product for this use .1 . It 's much cheaper . You can get 50 ' for about $ 8 here on Amazon .2 . It DOES N'T smell !! 3 . It 's much stronger , the `` 550 '' stands for five hundred and fifty pounds of tensile strength .4 . You can get it in any color imaginable so it can match the rest of your gear .5 . It 's lighter and takes up less space per foot ! 6 . It 's easy to tie and knot , so you do n't need hooks or silly Velcro loops to attach your clothes line ends to things found in a hotel room .7 . It is n't `` stretchy '' so it does n't threaten to recoil back and mess up whatever you 've attached the ends to .8 . And probably best of all there are HUNDREDS of other uses that 550 chord can be utilized for . Just google it.So upon receipt and inspection of this product I went through the return process with Amazon which was amazingly simple and easy -LRB- as is usual with Amazon -RRB- . They even gave me an instant refund to an Amazon gift card , I 'm sure you can imagine what I 'll be purchasing with the money ! : - -RRB-
 Overall , out of the box this product worked great . After 1 month use , the bands disintegrated -LRB- crumbled into bits -RRB- . I had it placed under a pagoda -LRB- partially shaded -RRB- . It was occasionally used - so I am sure that the failure was n't due to abuse . It appeared that the portion of the bands that failed most severely had more frequent exposure to sun . I live a few blocks from the beach in San Diego , so maybe salt air was a factor ? Only my cycling clothes were hung on the line -LRB- no heavy towels or rags with chemicals -RRB- . If the band material was more UV-resistant , this would be a great product .
 I wanted a line that would suction to the walls . I 'm not sure if the error is mine or yours . What can I do about it .
 I left this outside in winter for a few days and the rubber thoroughly cracked and disintegrated leaving it unusable . For warm weather only . I expect better durability from a simple clothesline.Edit
 This clothesline was terribly disappointing . No matter how hard we tried we could not stretch it past 3 feet.It was pretty much a waste of time and money . Perhaps mine was defective ?
 Too short , no hooks and/or suction cups at the ends . The loops were not helpful in setting up . Most importantly , it was just too short . We brought one other line which we ended up using becuase it was better constructed -LRB- longer , suction cups AND clips -RRB- . I would not recommend this item .
 I read the amazing reviews for this clothesline and purchased it to use on my month long European adventure.Sadly , this clothesline was terrible and did n't do anything it was supposed to do . I could hardly hang 2 small garments on it and they would fall off within 10 minutes even though I 'd spend 10 minutes trying to secure the garment to the crevices in the clothesline.I just did n't find this a quality or useful product . And for more than 10 bucks ... I do n't think so .

 I have never seen such cheap manufacturing practice as in this product . I liked the feel and the color of these sweats but the ankle was a little tight so I decided to make them straight leg . Upon opening up the seam I found a rubber band on both legs . What happened to elastic ribbing ? About a week later the draw string came unstitched in the back and came out making me more irritated . I tossed these sweats . I remember Russell having good quality back in the 90s ! What happened ?

 Looked like a nice shirt , but comes out wrinkled from the dryer.I do n't recommend this shirt unless you want to iron polos .
 I 've been wearing XLs from all the other retailers for years , but this last order - they literally choked ! Not good at all , had to discard the two I bought .

 I wish I had read the reviews . Cheap plastic like leather , a ` coin ' holder that is bent plastic and a usable and a teeny pocket described to hold cash could n't hold the fortune from a fortune cookie . THIS IS TERRIBLE !!!
 This is the most poorly made thing i 've ever gotten on amazon . i know when you buy from other sellers on amazon you are taking a chance , but i never expected this . not at all worth the money . you can barely fit more than one coin per slot . getting them out seems fine , but putting them in is a hassle . waste of $ 12 .
 Convinient to count/pick up coins.But easy to drop some of coins .

 I 've heard so many good things about this product from friends and even celebrities . Sorry to say it did n't do wonders for me , maybe because the seller sent me the wrong size . I asked for one size and they sent a smaller size . I have decided never to order any clothing off the internet again . It was a total waste of money . I was so hurt . They could n't even get the order right . I tried to fit into it as I had an affair to attend that night and sadly to say it ripped in half ! I will never order any clothing from the internet again especially hosiery ! Thanks alot to the idiot who sent me the wrong size !

 I ordered this for my father since he likes air force planes , was very dissapointed to receive a shirt totally different from the one pictured
 This arrived missing all the parts despite previous reviwers having pointed this out so do n't rely on Amazon getting this right either . Quality of the jumpsuit is poor and is probably good for single use -LRB- we are yet to find out pending the very troublesome process of getting this replaced -RRB- . Given these problems , I can only say this is overpriced and recommend you steer clear to avoid disappointment , especially if you have an excited child you 'll let down . What a shameful display .
 This costume ripped and fell apart within a few minutes of my son putting it on ... and no . . my kid is n't a fattie .
 This costume was of very poor quality . This would n't have lasted 15 minutes with my 4 year old . The plastic was very flimsy plastic .
 Very cheap looking . Was not what I had expected . It was for a birthday party and the boys were n't very excited about it .
 My 4 year old loves this costume but the quality is terrible . It began falling apart on the first wear and now its in shreds .
 I purchased this costume for my 4 and a half year-old son and he loved it the minute he saw it.HOWEVER , the minute he put on the mask he had a scratch under his eye and his chin from the CHEAPLY made mask.The edges are dangerously sharp , so please warn your child when they play with it.I had to take some clear tape and smooth out the eye holes and the chin and nose of the mask to make it less dangerous.The costume itself is super thin and it is already unraveling.I was hoping it would last until the 31st of October , but there is no way it will.It is poorly made and my son dresses up in it all the time.CAUTION : If you decide to purchase this costume for your child , examine the mask for sharp edges around the eye , nose , and mouth/chin opening.My son loves it . However , I would NEVER buy this again , nor would I recommend that anyone buys it . It is not worth the price .
 We bought this for our son for Halloween . It is so cheap . The first time he wore it ripped under the arm . The material is so thin and the plastic pieces are sharp on the edges and cheap . I ca n't believe it cost $ 65 dollars . Trust me if you want to purchase this , it 's not worth the money !
 Received costume minus the mask and chest plate . the 4 year old I bought it for is n't very happy . I have not contacted Amazon or the seller to inquire - just found out last night that not everything was included with the order . It was a gift so when I received it I wrapped it - gave it to the boy yesterday . Not much fun to have tears go along with a gift .
 the plastic is cheap and can be cut with scissors or ripped . Last year we bought darth vadar - I was expecting the same quality of mask & chest plate as that - this costume is a rip off for the price - you 'd be better off to get the transformer with the big piece of foam built in - cheesy & pricey for what you get - we sent it back !!
 Product incomplete and quality very poor , the chest and arm pieces didnt came with the product and seeing the quality of the ironhide costume i assume that they are the same bad quality
 I thought this costume had a full arm gun and shielded chest piece !!! Nope there 's cheap plastic that covers your arm and an even cheaper piece of plastic that wraps around your neck !!!! Do n't buy ... . Equivalent to the 10 dollar Kmart costume . Mine came with cheap mask ripped in half , we could n't use this for halloween

 I ordered a large and it fit more like a medium . The material was n't very comfortable either . I would not order the shirt again .

 This is a very light weight sweatshirt which is available in many colors , but if you want a quality heavy weight sweatshirt this is not it .
 Updated Review
 Proof that you get what you pay for , these low-priced sweatshirts are thin and skimpy . Sweatshirts seem to have taken the same quality nosedive as jeans . Ribbing around collar is especially thin . I am still searching for the real thing .
 First , the shipping and packaging . Very poor for both . Shipping was far too long . I waited almost two weeks to get the four sweatshirts that I ordered . The packaging was in a plastic bag which was okay , however the sweatshirts were just stuffed into the bag . All of them were dirty and needed to be washed right away . They looked like they had been stored in someones garage or worse ... in the trunk of somebody 's car . I would be very surprised if I discovered Fashion Rack was a real store and not some roadside vendor.Second , I ordered XL and glad I did . I normally wear a large , but after receiving four dirt and dust covered sweatshirts and laundering them , they shrunk to just about a Large size . I 'm not sure what will happen with the next laundering . If they shrink more they will be too small and unwearable.The material is very light . This is fine with me . Others may not like a light sweatshirt . It wo n't keep you warm in very cold climates.All in all , I got what I paid for . A cheap sweatshirt .
 Problem is - I do not know how I like this product because I received sweatpants and a sweatshirt . Can you help me with the return ? There was no paperwork mailed in the package received
 I orderd this shirt for my boyfriend in Canada . I knew it would n't get there in time for Christmas , but I did n't know this company would deliver it to the wrong address ! Hell , they delivered it to the wrong country ! When I tried contacting them , they did n't even have to courtesy to reply to any of my emails . I will NEVER buy from them again and I would n't recommend anyone buying from them if you want your items delivered to the right place . I hope whoever recieved it enjoys it , because my boyfriend never will . Nothing like paying good money for nothing !!!!!!!
 paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon/this store - NEVER AGAIN !

 I was fairly disappointed in this shirt . The sleeves run shorter than I prefer , plus it shrunk and did not hold up well after the first wash . The price is good , but you get what you pay for . I do n't recommend this one .
 I was very disappointed with these shirts . The fabric was very thin , the first time my husband wore one he had a red fleece jacket on and the shirt absorbed the red color and stained it permanently , and after the first washing the stitching on one of the sleeves unraveled and it came out of the wash with a long `` string '' hanging from it . I will not purchase these shirts again .

 beware ... this product does not rflect what you are getting ... you get a net and a bunch of string ... you are suppose to put all this together ... how , is a guess ... you get about a thousand strings of different colors and you have to attached them to the net -LRB- size of an hankershift -RRB- . so do n't buy this product.cost me more to send back .
 This is a do-it-yourself ghillie suit -- it comes with some netting and string and you have to tie it on yourself . This was n't exactly what we 'd expected , but after some manual labor , it turned out pretty well . The picture depicts something much different than what you 'll receive , so be forewarned .
 first off , amazon does a horrible job of describing this item . I purchased small which is suppose to fit me and when I got it and measured it myself it was more like a large on their size charts -LRB- even though the tag said Small -RRB- also the quality was not as good as I expected because there were buttons falling off and strings coming out of every which direction . I ended up returning it for a refund because I could not wear it and it did not look very good at all even on someone who fit the jacket well -LRB- I tried to give it away at first -RRB- .

 The customer service with this seller was fantastic but the bra itself has little to be desired . Yes it 's comfy but that straps loosen and fall , I have to keep readjusting myself and I have verified it 's the correct size . I wo n't return it just wo n't order another one .
 This would have been a very comfortable bra except for the poor fit . Not supportive enough . Liked the design though . Sent it back .
 I purchased this bra in May at a big chain retail store . I 'd never heard of the brand but thought I would try it as they actually had my size , which is hard to find and there is a liner inside the cups behind the lace . -LRB- Lace drives me nuts , it 's scratchy and itchy . -RRB- In August the elastic started to come out of the straps in little strings . In September the left underwire broke , while I was at work , making for an extremely uncomfortable day . And a very sore spot that evening.This bra did n't even last me 5 months . And I paid quite a bit for it ! Does anyone know if there is a Vanity Fair website where I can complain straight to them?In the meantime , do n't waste your money . Stick with other better brands .
 Sure the shirt is good , but if I was n't a big fatty , I could get 6 or more Fruit of The Loom pocket T 's for the price of one big fatty T . But it 's like trying to buy a drink at a movie theater - they can charge what they want because you 're stuck .
 Shirts are probably fine but took stupid amazon two and half months to get them in , kept giving me the run around , and I still do n't have them . do n't count on a refund either as long as they are `` on the way '' what a joke .
 I hardly ever leave reviews unless I think a product is really good , or as in this case other shoppers need to beware . Now ... Since I already own some Russell Athletic T-shirts like the one pictured for this product , I went ahead and purchased two . I did n't recieve what was shown on the website or described in the product description . The shirts I recieved were of much lighter fabric and holes quickly developed on the bottom of the pockets . The fit is okay , but I 'm still not real satisfied with the purchase . I should have been sent what was shown in the picture and not something cheaper and of less quality . Amazon needs to monitor their sellers a little better !!
 Russell Athletic Men 's Big & Tall Basic Short Sleeve Solid Crew Neck T-Shirt With Chest PocketI purchased 4 shirts . When I received them the material was puckered along the seams under the arms . Looked like a high school home economic class did the sewing . The seam joints were misaligned also.I subsequently bought shirts from another supplier made in the same country and the workmanship was excellent . This may have been a problem with one assembly organization .
 Ordered two of the XXL tall Russell t-shirts and after one wash the red one shrunk and can not be worn again . The red one was made in Pakistan and the black one we ordered was made in China . The black one did not shrink . Would not order these again .
 I 've worn Russell tees for about 30 years now . I 'm 6 ' 2 '' tall , and used to weigh 260 - 270 pounds ; they used to fit , not shrink , and have neck room.I 'm down to 230 pounds , but as soon as I wash the shirt , it shrinks - even in cold water wash , and delicate dry . The neck size is more like for someone that wears a medium.I had to `` stretch '' / pull the shirt to be able to wear it ; upon the 2nd washing I noticed that the stitching is falling apart.Only the Russell Premium has held up -LRB- although the neck size is smaller than XL -RRB- . All tee shirts are becoming like this - I too think it 's due to poor craftsmanship & sizes running smaller - due to being made outside of U.S. , with no real quality control in place.Gary
 i bought 5x 's . and they fit like they are 3x 's . i was very dissapointed in this tee shirt . i would not recomend them to any one
 every piece of clothing is under going repairs from the first day . how about american made products .
 I could not recommend this product unless changes are made . I purchased several of these shirts not long ago and they were great . However , I recently purchased two and they lost at least two sizes after the first washing . The lengths were almost four inches shorter . I just wear them around the house now . The previous shirts had a label printed on the inner collar . The newer ones have a label attached to the inner collar . So , they are obviously different and probably manufactured at different locations . Not very good product quality control . I have ordered more shirts , but from a different manufacturer .
 Florida flats fisherman rejected this large billed flap hat because it was just that -- too wide brimmed and without tie-downs for flaps . Moving in a boat at high speed renders this hat useless . Probably excellent for birdwatchers .
 You get what you pay for . If quality does n't matter to you , or you do n't care if this hat blows away , then it 's serviceable and probably right up your alley . If you do n't want to pay any more for a sun hat for one season , then this will do . If you have n't seen some of the ones costing about $ 10 more , you 'll probably find this acceptable . It 's considerably heavier than the Sunday Afternoon hat which is polyester , nor can you reshape the visor which is where most of the weight is . One size fits most which is usually men 's hat sizing . My opinion ? It 's just ok .
 Looking for sturdy shorts , you found em.The fabric is so tough , it will barely bend . More like canvas than cloth.The length is good and long - past the knee.The reason these got sent back is old-man waist - they fasten above the bellybutton .
 I 've ordered these shorts 4 days ago and they still ca n't seem to get it shipped out of their warehouse . Do n't bother with this buy them from your local store . Who knows when I will receive them .
 I have never had a problem ordering clothes online but these shorts are ridiculous . They are a full four and a half inches narrower than advertised , which goes way beyond what is acceptable for a clothing company . Now I know that some clothing companies tend to `` trim '' the patterns a little short and I should n't expect anything less from this particular company , however , I am actually insulted that dickies gets away with such a high level of cheap , scammy bull % # ^ * .
 Stiff , hash material . Poorly fitting . Not worth buying . I got better shorts at a local target for less than half the price .
 Dickies Men 's 13 Inch Inseam Work Short With Multi Use Pocket , Khaki , 36 is my worst buying experience through Amazon . The price is normal but the cloth is so though -LRB- like a plastic table cloth -RRB- that you feel as if you are touching a sand paper . And the style of it ? My wife and my sohn started laughing as I first tried it on . How they produce and sell something like this ? I returned the item right away .
 I have used Dickies mens work pants for the restaurants I have worked at for many years and their sizing is always wrong . I have worn 34 '' waist in them for awhile like all my other shorts/pants but when ordering the red shorts it was like I was trying to fit into pants i wore in H.S. and that was 15 years ago at a 30 '' waist . Also when they say a 13 '' inseem , ya if itis measured 13 '' below ur crotch . the dude in the pic for the shorts must be 8 ' tall !!!!!
 Dickie pants and shorts made in Mexico were comfortable and fit properly . My most recent puchases were made in Nicaragua and were horrible . The cut was wrong , waistline was wrong , the fabric was terrible . I 'll never buy Dickies again .
 I like a little bagginess in my shorts , so I ordered these in a larger size than I usually wear . Apparently , I did n't go large enough . I literally own pants supposedly two sizes smaller than these , and they fit me fine . These should have been quite big on me - and I ca n't even get the zipper up half way . I 'm not returning them because , for what I paid and what I 'd have to pay to ship them back , I just do n't think it 's worth it . I do n't recommend purchasing shorts from this company unless you can try them on - I certainly wo n't be buying from them again . I feel like I got ripped off .
 This item arrived messy and tangled . It is also not green and yellow , but green and white . I can use it for my purpose with a little fix up , but if you are looking for something green and yellow , this is NOT the item for you .

 The color was not the same and it didnt fit ... . it fits my 6year old im not the type of person that returns items its just going to be there just there in my daughters toy box . im also not the kind that complains but this was behond
 I purchased this camisole to wear under lower cut summer tops to help provide support for my mid section but with a quick try on , I could tell there was absolutely no support so I returned it .
 I bought two of these camisoles . I wanted to have something to wear under slinky spring/summer shirts . I was very dissapointed . I am a plus size , and it did very little to smooth or slim . It is very tight across the chest , way too short and is cut too big under the arms . It is so short that it rides up with every movement . You spend all day trying to find a way to discretely pull it back down . In my opinion , it is going to be too short on anyone who is over 5 ' 3 . I am 5 ' 6 and it barely reaches my waist.For the cost of the item , I expected a whole lot more . It is definitely not worth the money . If you are shorter and have very little to slim or smooth , it might work okay . This product is no miracle worker .

 I received the package on time and in great condition.Problem , I was sent two right hand gloves . I tried wearing them and turning the glove backwards , it was not possible to wear . Gloves need a sticker with right hand and left hand so distinguish the difference when shipping to the customer.Haydee
 I purchased this item for my wife for Christmas . When she opened them , I noticed that she received two different sizes of gloves . The larger glove fit but the other did not . I will be sending this item back . I hope that you will make it right .
 So I was looking for an inexpensive pair of `` throw away '' gloves for some temporary light outside work ... but I did n't expect them to fall apart before I even got the chance to wear them !! lol.I wear a size medium and they were a snug fit . They kinda look like a pretty pair of work gloves . Nice looking from far away I guess . Like maybe what a female construction worker might wear to not look too mannish , lol.When I put them on they fit snug but comfortable ... except my index finger on the right hand was so tight it was barely bendable !! lol . The sewing on that finger looked really off , too -- the seam ran in a different place than the other fingers . I kept opening and closing my hand and flexing to see if it would stretch out a bit and it did ... and the seam across the backside of my hand also pulled apart . It 's still holding but if I put them on I can see a white lining under the sewing . Looks terrible . If I do any work with them I 'm sure it will just completely break open.Guess I 'm sending these back and keeping the expensive pair I ordered instead ... ya get what ya pay for , I guess ... though I suspect I coulda had a completely different experience with another pair , lol . I doubt quality is consistent in something this cheap . Just random . If they were n't defective I 'd of been happy and got what I pretty much expected.Update
 I was really excited when the I read all the reviews , but am sad to say I 'm disappointed . The gloves are really warm and soft inside and out , but it 's not what I expected . I must have extremely small hands as the gloves are too big for me . I also find them bulky for leather gloves . They are n't very feminine , so if you 're looking for a pair of gloves that are purely utilitarian then it 's a great deal for leather gloves .

 The customer service with this seller was fantastic but the bra itself has little to be desired . Yes it 's comfy but that straps loosen and fall , I have to keep readjusting myself and I have verified it 's the correct size . I wo n't return it just wo n't order another one .
 This would have been a very comfortable bra except for the poor fit . Not supportive enough . Liked the design though . Sent it back .
 I purchased this bra in May at a big chain retail store . I 'd never heard of the brand but thought I would try it as they actually had my size , which is hard to find and there is a liner inside the cups behind the lace . -LRB- Lace drives me nuts , it 's scratchy and itchy . -RRB- In August the elastic started to come out of the straps in little strings . In September the left underwire broke , while I was at work , making for an extremely uncomfortable day . And a very sore spot that evening.This bra did n't even last me 5 months . And I paid quite a bit for it ! Does anyone know if there is a Vanity Fair website where I can complain straight to them?In the meantime , do n't waste your money . Stick with other better brands .

 It 's a nice hat , but sized smaller than indicated on the seller 's chart . A Medium/Large was too small for a 7 3/8 - probably OK for a 7 1/8 , but that 's a big variance . Sure wish they had an Extra Large ! Seller accepted return , but I had to pay postage both ways , so I think I lost money on the deal ...
 After ordering the Los Angeles Angels T-shirt , Amazon delivered a Texas Rangers t-shirt . They still show the picture for the Texas Rangers shirt , yet the description is the Los Angeles Angels . Amazon even charged me the shipping cost , even though I returned the product and requested a new one.Very unhappy customer
 I purchased one of this bikinis a couple of years ago and it lasted about 4 years before it turned into a transparent suit.I ordered 2 suits through amazon.com , but to my surprise the size 34 that I ordered in reallity is a size 28 , which makes it very unconfortable to wear . So becareful when ordering . Look at the manufacturer 's sizing list -LRB- VERY SMALL LETTERS -RRB- to find the right size . By the way , I had to pay to return these items because I did not read the manufaturer 's sizing chart . Not a happy camper .
 These sun protective gloves are great and I highly recommend them . Very breathable material made of nylon and spandex . Inseams look sturdy , however I 'll probably hand wash them . I ordered these sun protection gloves for driving and walking to stop further development of age spots on the backs of my hands . I ordered S/M size and they are snug . They fit easily into a pocket or purse .
 Bought this item for my niece but the quality is very cheap . Not at all what i expected to purchase . Glad this was only for playing dress-up .

 I am not an actual belly dancer , but I have been doing it since i was very young . I saw the price and i thought it was a good deal , when i got the thing home and tied it on , to show the rest of my family , my mom asked me were those beads rolling across the floor part of my scarf . The scarf says it is 60 ' long . but if you have forty inch or more hips like me , it wont work for you .

 I purchased in size 8 and 10 because no sizing chart , both were off , no details in description and fit was n't what it looked like in picture , should have been listed as a juniors items , not a misses item , fit is not a regular misses fit , a 10 in misses is always more than big enough , that 's why I also ordered size 8 , did n't send back , trying to find someone to buy them off me .

 Shirt was way too small . Arm hole loops seemed almost so short that a child could n't even wear this . I do n't even think a large would fit a petite woman . like the logo . had to return the shirt , unusable .
 when i bought this kit i thought it would be great but when i found out that it only had the helmet the cape and the sword i was dissapointed.I was expecting it all to be in it but no and now to be darth vader i had to pay ALOT of money just because this only was an acsessory kit.I say ... DO NOT BUY !!!!!!!!!!!!
 I was fairly disappointed in this shirt . The sleeves run shorter than I prefer , plus it shrunk and did not hold up well after the first wash . The price is good , but you get what you pay for . I do n't recommend this one .
 I was very disappointed with these shirts . The fabric was very thin , the first time my husband wore one he had a red fleece jacket on and the shirt absorbed the red color and stained it permanently , and after the first washing the stitching on one of the sleeves unraveled and it came out of the wash with a long `` string '' hanging from it . I will not purchase these shirts again .
 I was dissapointed with the polos

 I got this product thinking it would be great . But it unzips while inside the washer . Then I got a safety pin for it . Well now its just catches a lot of lent which then after I have to pick off my bra . I bought a different kind and brand which works much better .
 I ordered a Spanx product and 2 bra 's . I specified in my email that I absolutely needed it on 4/10/09 . They sent an email that it had been dropped off to UPS on 4/9 .09 . As of 4/13/09 I do not have the package . The wedding is over . I tried sending emails - no replies . I talked to a very unfriendly woman this afternoon . Even AMEX understood that NOT delivering a wedding item in time for a wedding is inappropriate and they have placed a STOP on the charge.I refuse their products based on their lousy customer service .
 I love a mesh wash bag -LRB- not like this -RRB- . Great for bras . Just throw in washer and then take them out and hang to dry . If they get lint you just pull it off after it drys . . shipping labels are great for that.I would not buy ANYTHING else ever again from bare necessities , though.I do n't think they care what they sell ... it 's not like they are experts ... You might think so , but not me.I bought a number of items from Bare necessities including Mansilk silk boxers . They shredded the first time I wore them ... the fabric was paper thin and just shredded along the fabric bias . . just pulled apart . . I was horrified . . I 've never seen anything like it.I BOUGHT FROM BARE NECESSITIES . . Bare Necessities sells substandard products and then only accepts returns for unused items new in package . Return postage is on your dime.Sounds fair , but what if the item is defective and the fabric shreds the first time you wear it ??? Tough toodles . . this is the response I got : Dear XXX , Thank you for your feedback . We value our customer 's opinions , so weappreciate you writing to us . Your e-mail will be distributed amongst thecompany and to the buyer for further consideration.If you have any additional questions or concerns , please do not hesitate toask.No one from Bare Necessities got back to me -LRB- other than the above -RRB- . I spent nearly $ 100 and they say they will pass my email around.That is not great customer service in my book . The product had whisper thin material that separated the very first time I wore it ... AND I bought the same type of product from a number of other firms , Intimo , Jockey , Stafford . . and they were fine even after several washings.You know it could be they just got a lot of substandard product . . but Bare Necessities does not have great customers service ... I wont buy from them again and neither should you . I am posting this on all Bare Necessities products so you can be warned . Not a good firm .
 I did not like it since the picture looked of a better quality . I got one Santa hat for my son before and it was very well constructed . This one is just a piece of felt and nothing else . In addition , my 16 month old son 's head did not fit well in it . It was smaller .
 The Santa hat you get is nothing like the one pictured . It is just felt and a cotton ball , not plush . There is absolutely no way the hat I got would fit the 3-year-old girl in the photo . My son is one year old and it is too small . I am very dissapointed and will have to buy another hat elsewhere .

 I can not rate the product as bad because I never did receive the product to give it any rating at all . The company did not even inform me that the product was no longer available .
 Do n't waste your money . Helmet is too small . Sword bent after 5 minutes of play . Poor quality overall , would not buy it again
 When i read the reviews i was hoping to see something strongly made and fun to play . But what i saw was literally 99 cent toy selling for 16 buks . Cheaply made :-LRB- Dont even bother to buy .
 My child had been asking for this toy set for months . I finally purchased it and was disappointed with the quality of the product . I could have purchased each item at the Dollar Tree around Halloween .
 I ordered a shirt the last of Sept. . It is now the first of Nov. and i still have n't recieved it or heard from my package . I did n't even get a refund .
 Washed the shirt one time and it shrunk to an unwearable size . I paid for a shirt I will never get to wear . I got taken .

 Since I had my say about Champion 's Cotton workout pant ... tell you my thoughts on these . I love them , BUT ... if you work out alot -LRB- and not just when you 're sweaty -RRB- you will leave a damp spot that takes 20-30 seconds to evaporate ... in the exact dimensions of your bottom equipment . Guess because they do n't absorb dampness , just transfer it . As a shirt...Dri-Power ca n't be beat .
 The fabric is great but the pants are too long -LRB- ca n't hem length since zippers on leg -RRB- and the waist tie rope is too short -LRB- or maybe I 'm too fat -RRB- .
 I returned this item because it was just too thin on the head piece and my dark hair showed through . It was also way too long and the ends were getting frizzy just by pulling it out of the package and trying it on . I got another wig that worked out much better .
 I am not really happy with these covers . My daughter can wear them for about an hour and a half until she soaks right through her pants ! I think the cheap vinyl pants work better .
 I got five of these diaper covers -LRB- after having another brand that worked fine -RRB- and I was surprised to discover that they are not waterproof at all ... my son 's bed is wet after an hour nap !!!
 Be careful with your order . I read some reviews here and ordered the wrong size based on one someone had written about theirs being too small when they ordered according to the size chart . I got the xl size thinking if they were running small I 'd be ok . . Did n't work out so well . The one I received was way too big . Of course I did n't know how big it was until I opened the package and unfurled the garment to look at it . That was a mistake on my part because this company will not accept undergarment returns if they 've been opened . . So basically I paid for something that I can not use . . unless I want to cut it up and use it for a dust cloth . Just saying . . be careful and make sure you 're getting the correct size .
 Purchased this Union Suit 30 day 's ago ... Already has a hole on the leg seam ... I is just too bad nothing is made in the USA anymore ... I am so tired of purchasing Garbage from China , Bangladesh , and all the other country 's that produce Garbage with there slave labor ...
 These are nice underwear but not really what you would call thermal . The reason for the low rating is the lack of a rear flap . They just put a vertical slit with 1 button . Very uncomfortable to use if you have to sit down and do your thing
 sizes are very misleading . If you order them get two sizes smaller . Just because im bigger around does n't mean im 8 feet tall . So thin you can actually see through them . will not order again .
 Product is Chinese made of light , tee shirt material and not suitable for ` mastering ' the cold weather , as advertised . Also Labelled with a generic industrial brand name -LRB- ROTHCO -RRB- and not ` Indera Mills ` Threads were loose and pulling from the seams out of the package and buttons popped when i tried it on.Junk . Junk . Junk
 My son was so excited to wear these ... The first hour they kept coming unbutton up & down the length of the union suit ... Basically the buttons were too small for the button holes ... Even a button came off the rear end ... Very disappointed ... Even paid extra for tall size ... Sending them back ; -LRB-
 Washed the shirt one time and it shrunk to an unwearable size . I paid for a shirt I will never get to wear . I got taken .
 One thing i do love about the bra is that it has great side support but thats it . the lace in front is bulky and shows through most shirts , it also gives the ` torpedo ' effect . Worse of all its a ` final sale item ' and you ca n't return it . Idk when i 'll wear it . Maybe in winter under a very thick sweater
 Although marked as a XL it was at best a M. Fortunately my daughter could wear it and like it - so we kept it . But I will not buy from this company ever again .
 i got these because i was tired of the cheap Gerber brand plastic pants . the only draw back is that they are so expensive ! i paid almost $ 12 for one pair -LRB- including S&H ;-RRB- . for me i 'd rather just get the ones that might break faster but are three times cheaper . and by the way you can put duck tape over the breaks -LRB- on either side -RRB- and they will be as good as new . it does n't come off and you can still use them.this is me editing/add to what i wrote eariler ... on top of being way to expensive , they do n't hold very much at all before leaking out the sides . because they are so loose -LRB- not around the openings -RRB- all the pee just pools at the bottom , well until the child sits down , then it all goes out the leg hole ! not desirable!once I put a single cloth diaper on my 1.5 yr old and these pants over it . i happened to be sitting on the floor and she was standing in front of me so i could see -LRB- these are relatively clear -RRB- when she peed because all of a sudden there was a little pool of pee in the bottom ! this may be due to the single cloth diaper but i doubt it has everything to do with it because the gerber vinyl pants that i recommend are tight enough so the pee does n't pool . they push against the cloth so it absorbs the liquids better.also i noticed once after i put these over a doubled cloth diaper that they started to feel wet , on the outside !! so i checked and sure enough they were a little damp . so i looked and the material happens to be different feeling on both sides . like on side is more water resistant than the other side . anyway i turned them inside-out and they seemed to hold the moisture a lot better.one last thing ... these run VERY large . I got a Medium -LRB- 15-30lbs -RRB- however my daughter is now at least 25lbs and still they are very loose around the legs and waist . i 'm not sure how they justify putting 15lbs on there ! a medium is more like 30-45lbs ! i sometimes use them for over her cloth potty training pants since they are comfy and easy for her to take off and put on.and another great thing is they are not hand wash , like the gerbers .
 I bought these for my 12lb infant and found that they did not breath or fit very well and leaked right away . They were too big and did not hold the cloth diaper at all . The cloth diaper fell apart under the cover even with the use of snappies holding them on . Also the legs holes seemed to be cut too low compared to the rise and my infant has chunky thighs and the elastic leg holes pinched his skin too much . I do not recommend these and would recommend a fitted diaper cover with velcro so it can conform to your babies shape .
 this shirt came out of the dryer fit for a barbie doll : - -LRB-
 Before purchase I contacted company about correct size of `` cap '' . Was told that `` they '' do not accept returns . I had to guess about correct size . Upon arrival cap was too small . Company would not accept return for size larger cap . Will not order from this company again !!
 They ripped within and hour of putting them on ! They were cute but after that first half hour started to unravel .
 I was very surpised at the poor quality of these stockings . I have purchased Leg Avenue before and found them to be excellent , however these were like fifty cent bought off the back of someone 's truck brand . As a matter of fact I 've bought better fifty cent off the back of the truck stockings!Leg Avenue is now off my list ! Of course , if they priced them three for a dollar , now that might be worth the price !
 Admittedly , I run into this a lot with all kinds of stockings and pantyhose . I was hoping for an inexpensive pair for one occasion , but they did n't fit my thighs at all . I know I have large thighs , that 's why I ordered plus size , but it needs more stretch at the top to actually work . Ca n't speak to the quality of the actual stockings as I was unable to actually wear them .
 I put these on and they ripped right away ... the material is cheaper than the free stockings they give when trying on shoes at a store .
 I think these are really low quality ... they are wear once type of stockings . if you are extremely careful with them ... you might get away with wearing them twice . I kind of knew these would be cheap , but I 'm a sucker for a deal . If you are going to buy them -- and you 've got long legs and are at all thick in the thighs -- I mean at all - ... they are going to be short-low on the thigh . The seam is nice , but they really are thin and cheap .
 I was sooooo disappointed with the hair wrap as I felt led to believe that there was a swim suit that I was purchasing with a matching hairwrap .
 I was trying unsuccessfully to replace a really nice white Columbia fleece jacket that I bought some years ago which resisted stains amazingly , looks really nice on me , and goes with everything . This is not it . This -LRB- Benton Springs Style Number 209 WL 6114 -RRB- is a cheap imitation of my old fleece Columbia jacket -LRB- style number 207 WL6114 -RRB- . I bought three Benton Springs jackets on 1-27-2010 at Sports Authority and I 'm returning at least the two white ones , where the difference in quality is really noticable . I 'm going to keep a navy blue one where the inferior cut , styling , workmanship , and quality control is not as noticable . In white , mine look cheap and slightly flawed , workmanship wise . I have another white fleece jacket from Walmart with the same problem that came as a liner with a -LRB- cheap -RRB- white raincoat.Another difference is that the new ones are fuzzier , softer and thicker and the white is pinker . That would be fine if it hung and fit nicely like it 's predessor.It 's so hard to replace women 's clothes when they wear out , even in classic styles . Often I have to go to another brand to get the same thing since it 's `` out of style '' in the brand I start with . Are they assuming it never wears out ? The zipper eventually broke on my original Columbia fleece jacket , not before I got a lot of wear out of it , and a white jacket can not stay stain free forever even though this fabric was very stain resistant .
 I ordered this item through Amazon from The Fashion Rack on December 8 , 2010 and never recieved it . I have ordered many things from Amazon and have always received them , but did not recieve my order from The Fashion Rack or a response from The Fashion Rack . I watched the USPS tracking as it came to my state then went to a totally different state . I emailed The Fashion Rack through Amazon and never got a response to my email . I have emailed a second time still waiting to hear something .
 I ordered this columbia fleece in a size small . I received it today and it was a medium . The tag on the inside of the jacket says medium , and the sticker on the bag it was packaged it said medium , but the price tag said it was a small . The jacket is way too big for me , and I would like to return it . I am hesitant though , because I 'm worried that if I return it and order from this seller again I will receive another jacket in the wrong size . Has anyone else had this problem ?
 I ordered This almost 20 Days Ago And still Havent recieved it.So Im Completely Done With this seller.If you Expect it a Certin Time Dont Bother .
 I owned a similar Columbia jacket years ago -LRB- not sure exact style -RRB- but I know that even then I would n't have spend an arm and a leg on it , so I figured it was reasonable to compare the two . This jacket feels incredibly cheap ! It 's ok , keeps me warm . A nice light fleece , but I was expecting something a little heavier and more durable . Hanging this over the back of my chair , I was worried that the posts on the chair were going to pop a hole through ! They are n't pointy and are a good size , at least an inch , and this was n't by exerting any sort of force on the jacket.The seller shipped me the wrong color anyway , and I 'm supposed to be getting a full refund . Otherwise , I 'd likely return it and fork some money out for something worthwhile .
 Although I ordered the size I usually wear , the sleeves were much too long and it was n't large enough around the bust even though it was advertised as being loose fitting . Apparently this item was designed for tall , slender women with long arms . The advertising is misleading .
 I bought these in several different colors but I should n't have because these stockings are so thin that the color was barely visible . In addition , they all developed a run right out the package . Maybe my thighs are thick though because I found that they held up on their own .
 Do n't throw your money away on these stockings . They do n't fit well , run fast and sag at the ankles . I was extremely disappointed in the purchase of this product . Spend a bit more money on a higher end stocking as you will have to throw these away after one or two times you wear them .
 These stockings were to small at the band . They do n't have elastic so they do n't streach out . The color was too light and overall the material is too rough ... is not soft like the other stockings . Bad purchase . !
 I got a run in these the first time I wore them , they are definitely a cheap material and not made to last . I did n't think they would be , but I had hoped to get more than one wear out of them !
 The quality is very poor , I was n't expecting much for the price , but they are absolutely useless , look very ugly , so you can only wear them under long trousers , and they feel very uncomfortable , too worm .
 They are VERY soft and feel amazing BUT one was longer than the other and after two steps the `` hold ups '' were at my knees
 I was a bit disappointed that the stockings did n't stay up . I 'd recommend buying a garter belt with these .
 These were deff . cute ! But I was dissapointed because I only got to wear them once before the tore . But they were very cheap .
 -LSB- Note
 There was nothing wrong with the thigh highs themselves but they are clearly made for women with much skinnier thighs . I think it just may be the lace top that made them so tight up top . I 'm ordering the cuban style ones without lace top now .
 they are strong material , but they slip and roll at the top which is very uncomfortable while wearing them.the seam at the toes is nice but i ca n't wear these for very long because they 're very uncomfortable when they roll up slide down my thighs , they are tight on me and I have very nice legs _ mrs. bot
 I bought Leg Avenue Sheer Thigh Highs with Lace Top , and when I received them and put them on I noticed that there was a hole in the top part of the lace . It looked like it had not been sewed on right . I also noticed that there was a snag on the top part of the lace as well , I would not buy from this company again !
 I put my finger through the stockings the first time I put them on : -LRB- So I never was able to utilize the thigh highs . !
 i got these for my girlfriend and she was shocked to find out that as soon as she open them up the stockings were ripped
 They 're very cute , of course , but when you put them on and move or walk at all , they come rolling down . Not worth the money !
 Bought these for my fianc&eacute; and within the first ten minutes there was a rip on the heel . She soldiered on and another one occurred on the shin . Needless to say these leave you with something desired
 The material is not great quality , very thin and do not feel like nylons . Pay a little more for better tigh highs
 I should have read the reviews before this purchase . I orders a black one and a white one . I tried on the black one and it ripped before I even put it on entirely . Pretty disappointing . Now , I 'm too scared to try on the white one . They do look great , however . Went wonderfully with my corset and garter belt .
 I 'm really glad I only bought three of these ! They were so highly rated that I even bought the matching cover , but I did not like them at all . After only a couple of hours the diaper was soaked through and I mean through ! The cover had to be washed as well since the diaper was so thoroughly soaked . That was n't the worst , though , because I would n't mind changing her more often , but the wet was held against her skin all throughout the diaper , even above her legs at the snaps ! No wicking at all and I know she was really uncomfortable . Plus at 10 lbs this diaper already seemed too small for her , or very soon would be . Do n't waste your money - go for the Bum Genius with the free Super Saver Shipping - it 's worth the extra $ by far .
 These diapers smell the absolute worst of all of the cloth diapers we have tried . After our newborn pees , the entire diaper soakes and it does n't wick away the urine , it just soaks it so she sits in her urine . We are very attentive and change her all of the time , checking her to make sure she does n't get any rashes . We do n't like using these . ALSO - a note about `` THANKSMAMA '' - it says you receive a coral , yellow and purple diaper in this set in the description on Amazon . I did not receive three different colors , only 3 white ones . I was upset about this , and wrote to them . They offered to replace them with the correct colors if I sent them back . Well , it is Winter , snowing all of the time , and I have a newborn - not so easy to get to the post office to send back 3 diapers just because the color was wrong . I am disappointed in this as well .
 The glasses arrived with the round size `` L '' label on one lens . Love the shade of the glasses , but I require a small size vice the large size being sold . I hope my wife can use them as she has large wide lenses . The size should be clearly stated and not in the form of millimeter dimensions solely ... like the bright yellow version also sold by Amazon . An additional comment I must also add
 I ordered a size 32 -LRB- my regular size is 31 -RRB- and they felt like a 28 when I tried them out so I had to return them . Just ensure you ordered several sizes bigger . I wish they had more accurate sizing .
 The size advertised -LRB- `` 36 '' -RRB- , and delivered -LRB- 36 '' -RRB- as evidenced by the label , did not match the actual small waist size of the product -LRB- approximately 30-32 '' -RRB- . Was this the reason this product was so inexpensive - improper labeling at the factory ?
 Bathing suit is good quality . Using the bathing suit every day at an indoor pool , the suit requires a through rincing because evenutally the colrene in the pool causes fading of the material and snaging .
 other reviewers mentioned the poor fit . i had to return the bathing suit , too . i wear size 30 slacks and size 32 underwear , but this size 32 bathing suit fit like a tourniquet . it was way too tight ! that said , it was high quality .
 How lame ... 30 days later , no shipment , no delivery.Very disgusted.Information about shipmentShip Method
 I am a regular swimmer and I have been buying that same reference from Speedo for several year -LRB- 70800 -RRB- . Usually they are lasting 6 to 7 months , 3 swims a week , clear water rinsing and air dried.Last July I bought several suits of that reference here and I immediatly noticed a change in the construction of the suit . I started to use one in September and after only 2 months the suit is falling apart.The impression at reception was confirmed . Some savings are made by Speedo in their manufacturing process but they did not warn the customer or change the item reference .

I started to use one in September and after only 2 months the suit is falling apart.The impression at reception was confirmed . Some savings are made by Speedo in their manufacturing process but they did not warn the customer or change the item reference .
 How lame ... 30 days later , no shipment , no delivery.Very disgusted.Information about shipmentShip Method

 I ordered a size 32 -LRB- my regular size is 31 -RRB- and they felt like a 28 when I tried them out so I had to return them . Just ensure you ordered several sizes bigger . I wish they had more accurate sizing .
 The size advertised -LRB- `` 36 '' -RRB- , and delivered -LRB- 36 '' -RRB- as evidenced by the label , did not match the actual small waist size of the product -LRB- approximately 30-32 '' -RRB- . Was this the reason this product was so inexpensive - improper labeling at the factory ?
 Bathing suit is good quality . Using the bathing suit every day at an indoor pool , the suit requires a through rincing because evenutally the colrene in the pool causes fading of the material and snaging .
 other reviewers mentioned the poor fit . i had to return the bathing suit , too . i wear size 30 slacks and size 32 underwear , but this size 32 bathing suit fit like a tourniquet . it was way too tight ! that said , it was high quality .
 I have never seen such cheap manufacturing practice as in this product . I liked the feel and the color of these sweats but the ankle was a little tight so I decided to make them straight leg . Upon opening up the seam I found a rubber band on both legs . What happened to elastic ribbing ? About a week later the draw string came unstitched in the back and came out making me more irritated . I tossed these sweats . I remember Russell having good quality back in the 90s ! What happened ?
 Not correct size . I have several pairs of these sweats . Gave to friend . Will not order items from this store again , because they may be selling rejects . Do n't know for sure .
 This is product is advertised as `` one size '' but mine came as a plus size/Q size . Which I am not . So I ca n't use it . Not really worth returning since it cost under 5 dollars , but still annoying ! The actual stocking look good though !
 They did not even last 2 seconds as they crumbled apart while my wife put them on . Not worth the postage to return . Skip this product and support vendors that sell quality products .
 I bought these hats for my daughter 's 8th birthday party but when they arrived they were way too small . They must be meant for a toddler but are n't listed that way . I hope this is helpful .

 The sizing is WAY OFF ! I am size 9 & I ordered the appropriate size for me . IT WAS WAY TOO SMALL ! If you are a small size , do your self a favor & buy a MUCH BIGGER SIZE !!!
 This product was nothing like it appeared to be . The sizing is very inacurate as well .
