 Was n't what I expected . I had purchased this to replace my usable , yet wearing down Timex Ironman . It does n't have half the functionality of my Ironman , and costs about 20-30 dollars more . Unless you like fancy watches , or only use a watch to tell time -LRB- Yeah , I know how it sounds . -RRB- , I suggest getting something else . I use my watch for a lot more than just the time , so that 's mostly why I gave this a bad review . Returned and am still using my Timex Ironman .

 Based off the picture and description , I was under the impression that these would be good quality ponchos . Do not be fooled ! They are the cheap see-through yellow ones you can only use a couple of times . I am so mad they charged so much for the cheapest kind of ponchos you can get . Do NOT buy this product , it 's a waste of money !
 it was damaged when arrived . its basically a trash bag which cost 5 bucks . took forever to arrive too . WASTE !

 First the good . the intensity is as advertised - it 's loud . The installation is relatively straightforward as well , and the compact size makes finding a mounting location simple.Now the bad . While the decibel level is high , the frequency of the horn blast sounds like an amplified honker you 'd find on a 10 year old 's huffy . There are 2 horns built into the unit - one at 530 Hz and one at 680 Hz . If you 're looking for a relatively deep , low-sounding air horn this is not the one you want . I did n't expect a thunderous rumble from a compact unit like this , but the high tone was disappointing . After installation and hearing the sound produced , I wired the factory horn in as well just to offset the high , tinny tone of the air horn.So to summarize , if you 're looking for a relatively loud horn with that distinct air horn warble , then the price and ease of installation make this worth while . If you 're looking for the `` Big Rig BLAST , '' you 're never going to get it out of a compact unit like this .

 It arrived used - dents , scratches , chips , scuffs , and all . This one fell through the cracks . It took a while to track down the customer service number to call to ensure that I would not be charged return shipping . Overall , it was for the best because I was not impressed with the quality of the balls or storage bag . I opted for a refund and took a chance on a different set .
 I actually returned the item . Description called for a `` molded carry case '' but the set came with this very flimsy vinyl bag that was already ripped open from a mis-sewn seam . I was amazed it got send out with the top of bag open like that . The actually set looked nice , though but I did n't want to have to go and find/buy a small bag to accomodate it .
 I ordered this set for my husband for Christmas . When we put the balls into the bag , the shoulder strap literally broke off ! I have emailed them asking for a new bag several times - with absolutely no response !! Poor customer service ! Would not order from this vendor again !
 I have never written an online review like this but we just received these bocce balls and are quite disappointed in their quality so I felt compelled to.The coloring on the balls is cloudy , uneven and has other blemishes . They were dusty and the etching into the resin is poorly done . The nylon carrying case -LRB- not a hard case as mentioned in other reviews -RRB- would be ok except that if you take out the cheap thick cardboard box , there 's nothing to hold it upright . It 's all made in China and poorly in my opinion.Not going to return them because it 's not worth all the hassle . But wanted to provide this info to others .
 I had expectations that I was ordering a `` nicer , middle of the road '' set when I ordered this one . Especially considering the reviews seemed fair for this one - 4/5ish at the time . When I opened it was initially pleased with the weight and hefty-ness of the balls , but quickly became concerned by discoloration on all of the balls . I spent a few minutes trying to buff it out with no success . Each ball was legitimately discolored with various white blotchy spots . And as I was examining the color splotches I realized they were covered with blemishes and surface imperfections , and I noticed one of the balls had a hole in it - about the size of a pen tip . That was enough.I instantly put it back in the packaging and did the 1-2-3 easy return process Amazon has and the delivery guy should be back tomorrow to pick it up . I expect that my refund will come fairly quickly . I 'm glad the return process is so easy - I 've never had to use it before , all my previous purchases on Amazon have been great.Overall I 'm clearly disappointed with this set - I thought to go for an exchange at first , thinking maybe I just got a `` bad '' set , but they 've lost my business . It 's a poor made set from China so what can you really expect . I did n't really want to spend in the $ 100 + range for some of the nicer sets like thePerfetta Club Pro Bocce Ball Set-solid color - Made in Italy -RRB- or theEPCO Tournament Bocce Set - Several Sizes to Choose Fromlooks well made too ... but seems like it 's worth spending the extra $ 50 - $ 60 for some good quality .
 I needed a bocce ball set , but did n't want a expensive one . After reading all the negative reviews , my desire to save money won over my skepticism.First of all , the decorative cardboard wrapping around the case was torn making a bad first impression . Removing that , next impression is a bag that has a lot of little loose ends sticking out from the seams , obviously poorly made . Immediately I start to think I should have listened to the reviews ... Opening the bag is a cardboard box lining the bag . I thought it was going to be like a cardboard wine box with separators for the balls , nope . Putting the bocce balls back in the case they all fall around loosely making zipping the case together again difficult . The zipper may be the cheapest zipper I 've ever seen , no joke . I just got this and I can tell it will break soon ; trying to re-zip the bag was hard and it got stuck several times and this is the FIRST time I opened it!ALL of the balls have dents or smudges on them . Not most , all . Some are minor and others are ugly inch long marks . I either got a used , returned set or they 're all made this awfully . The balls themselves are pretty good . I 've only played with them once , so I do n't know if they 'll stand the test of time . If you do n't care about visual aesthetics , then these will be fine to you.This is the most disappointing thing I 've ever bought on Amazon . I have n't decided whether I 'll return it and the only reason why I 'd keep it is to save me the hassle of returning it . Trust me and all the other negative reviews , do n't buy this cheaply made set !
 With delivery , One of the bocce balls has a large crack/indentation which is damaged before use . Additionally the bag which contains the set has a broken/ripped zipper.Not what you would expect for a mid range priced product . Immediately on it 's way back to Amazon.Damaged before use goes along with what other posters have commented on . Just not good quality ! I took a chance hoping for a decent product but now I would recommend avoiding !
 I 've had a set from another manufacturer for 12 years . I decided to get another set for the cabin , but the very first time we used the set 2 balls broke wide open . We were just playing on a course that had a few spots of river rock and we were not tossing the balls out of control . We 've played the same course with the old set with damage what so ever .

 I disliked this product because the size is very bigI love Columbia clothes but the size is not correct in this product
 I ordered this shirt based on Columbia 's reputation and style . I ordered a medium and it seemed like an extra large . It was so big that I 'm not even sure that a small would fit me . What 's with this ? Ca n't Columbia get their sizing right ? Is it that hard ?
 Good friend I am of venezuela . I write to him because I did to him a purchase of two shirts Columbias it pinches short colors red and purple . You me sending a mail saying that already they were sent but it did not give to me the number of sending . I am translating since I do not speak Englishman . I wait for his prompt response porfavor .
 estimados amigos nunca recibi el producto , y aparece que fue entregado , lastimosamente nunca me llego a mis manos ... espero tener alguan respuesta si logran saber algo , , , gracias
 Good afternoom . i never recived the product so i will apreciate your help giving me all the tracking information.I will appreciate your soon answer.best regards
 my standard measure is XL but XL in this shirt equal XXL ... so you have to show that , the measures is not standard
 Columbia has yet to let me down in the quality of their clothes , durability and materials used . This shirt , is no exception . The only problem with this shirt , and it 's a big one , is that the size is waaayyyy off . I would venture to say 2 sizes off . I ordered a large , as I am a large in every other brand including other Columbia product lines , but this shirt was so big I could fully loaded ruck sack underneath it !! Seriously , it is at least one size larger than labeled but I would venture to say it might even be 2 sizes too large . I 'm going to give it to my dad who typically wears a XXL and see if it fits him . Bottom line , do not order this shirt online unless you have confirmed your size in a store first .
 Not happy with what is considered a large . I bought a columbia shirt out of a store several weeks ago . The large size fit me perfectly . I then ordered a Columbia Bonehead shirt -LRB- size large -RRB- from here . Its huge . Way too big for me and i 'm 6 ' 3 '' . Guess i 'll start studying sizing charts .
 The product arrived in good condition and is a great shirt , just with a little delay for new year season.Columbia mens shirts.They are a completes size . for next buy i have to order a size less.AND THE COLOR IS NOT CORRECT AS MY ORDER .
 If you expect a button to come off every single time you clean these shirts , this shirt is for you . They are comfortable , but not worth the effort of finding and sewing buttons back on all the time . I do not recommend these shirts .
 I really wanted to get this shirt for my son . However , after reading 50 reviews that say that the shirt size is way off -LRB- by one or two sizes -RRB- , I had to pass it by . One wonders why the seller would not correct the size , or be more helpful on which size to order .
 Good afternoon receive a warm greeting from me ! pleased with the purchases I have made so far with the company amazon , I address you on this occasion to inform the dissatisfaction that I have about the Order Columbia Men 's Bonehead Short Sleeve Shirt , Lemon Whip , XL , because they also come with a different size -LRB- bigger -RRB- I noticed that the goods came with altered labels , ie labels to hide labels on the original size and thus suggest the size indicated q was then sent descriptions of these labels :1 - Bottom Label and original
 hinotify them that I can not make any observation of the goods , because I have not received . I have tried to contact the selling but the site does not give me the option.I am grateful to report that the claim via
 I am not sure exactly how much my mountain bike weighs , but it is reasonably light . No matter how tight I made the top rack , it slide down . Very frustrating - it maywork if you have feather weight bike !
 I have this and thought it would be easier and would store my bikes well ... but it did n't . It is very dificult to take the bikes off the hooks and it does not look nice like the picture would lead you to believe . I would not recommend this .
 Despite all the great reviews for this product , I 'm very disappointed with the design . The hangers `` fasten '' to the center pole using an adjustable clamp made of plastic . Your bike is being kept in the air by the friction between the plastic clamp tightening around the slippery metal pole . If you own a heavier bike , such as most mountain bikes , you will find your bike sliding/twisting down the column no matter how tight you make the clamp , since there is nothing locking the clamp to the pole.Also , the product description fails to mention the maximum weight limit for the rack , which is 30lbs for the upper hanger and 45lbs for the lower hanger . Personally , I would rate the weights at about 20lbs/35lbs . Beware of this product if your bike has any weight to it .
 Got this pole to maximize my bicycle storage in my garage . I read mixed reviews but for the price , decided to try it anyway . The garage ceiling is 9 ' so this one should be fine , but it 's a bit wobbly . Plus , all the reviews stating that the upper , smaller diameter shaft is too small for the clamp are correct . I have a women 's small mountain bike on the bottom and a women 's small road bike on the top . So that 's definitely not exceeding the weight limit but the top clamp violently slid down with my bike in the cradle after only 2-3 minutes mounted . I had to wrap a small-gage line around the smaller diameter shaft for the upper clamp to sit on . Plus the whole system seems to rotate over time , which makes me worry that I might catch one of the wheels sticking out when I 'm backing in the garage in my truck . I would not buy this product again , but I 'm gon na give it a try . Might work for a low-traffic 7 ' ceiling but not for a high-traffic garage area with a high ceiling .
 We assembled this item on a Wednesday and by Sunday the net had already broken in several places . My kid had not even used the net before it frayed .
 We just bought this item for our 10 year old son , who loves to play soccer . It was pretty easy to set up with clear directions , and everything was as described in the listing . However , after my 10 year old , my 8 year and I were playing with it for a few hours having a great time , one of my sons pointed out that that the net was already torn . Upon further inspection , I realized he was right and that the net appeared to be very low quality.I later contacted Franklin about a warranty claim , but they were n't taking calls . I emailed my claim a few days ago per their instructions , but I have yet to hear anything back . I called today , but did n't reach a live person - I left a message . Someone called me back and apologized that I did n't get a confirmation , but I should be receiving the replacement net in a week or so . So that part of customer service was very good.Hopefully the new net holds out better .
 After reviewing several products , I ordered this one from Amazon . It took me half an hour to assemble and I realized the net is too small for the frame . The soccer ball can go through gaps between the net and frame . A big disappointment . I will contact the manufacturer to send me the replacement net before I return the product .
 I bought this knife and tried many configurations to be able to use it and I hate it . They have this funky strap arrangement that was no fun at all and it has what they claim is a quick clip it 's not quick at all.I tried to use the BC mounting attachment instead . The holes are too small for the screw and are crooked.The blade is in a handle that allows you to take it apart for cleaning , nice feature but the blade is loose in the handle and feels like it will fall out.It does not feel solid at all and I do n't feel comfortable having to rely on this product . I would have returned it but I live overseas so it would cost too much to send back.I 've been diving over 30 years and have tried lots of gear , a knife is a simple item and this one well lets say it 's not coming diving any time soon . I 've given up and tossed it in the tool box maybe it will be good to pry open a can of paint .
 Simply put , the bottom areas where the bag chords tie up to it get ripped open due to the constant pull of using as you go to the gym or anywhere else . The cloth around begins to rip and you are left looking for another bag , eventually . This probably lasted me a year . . but not forever . .
 They did not fit my head , they where way to big , and i have a medium-large head . Also not very comfortable .
 This is one of the better engineered bike seats made in China and it is comfortable EXCEPT FOR ONE BIG FLAW . I KNOW the Chinese did this on purpose , LOL . If you look close at the picture of the seat , you will see the cover is sewn in two pieces onto it to make it fit well . The lower edge -LRB- about two inches wide -RRB- that goes all the way around the bottom edge of this seat is ROUGH RUBBER ! OUCH , you talk about rub burns !!!! I ride everyday about 20 miles at a time and when I got this seat , the first time I used it , I stop swearing under my breath about my butt hurting . This seat is comfortable and substantially reduces the pressure pain , BUT that rubber cover edge makes your shorts and underwear ride up like someone is giving you a weggie !!! ... TOO BAD I like this otherwise ... its got to go back unless I can figure how to cover it with spandex .
 This is still better than the stock seat that came with my mountain bike but it still hurts . It 's not soft at all . I have a bony butt hence it is important that my posterior hip bones do n't dig in the seat to hard . This seat did not do it one bit . I am very disappointed in it . 20 minutes into the ride my butt hurts almost as bad as the stock seat .
 bike was ok . lots of cheap plastic parts . bike needs professional to assemble . rear gear cluster is loose on mine , dont want to waste time getting a `` warrenty '' will ride until it breaks .
 My recommendation is to avoid this product because of poor quality control , turning what could be an excellent bike into a junky , problematic one . The greatest positive of this bike is that it 's attractive in a low-key fashion , however , even that positive was marred by scratches in the pearly-white finish of the fork crown and a blistereddecorative decal on the downtube , from friction from the brake handle during shipping , because of inadequate packaging . Another reviewer hasreported the same damage on the downtube of her women 's version of theSierra Madre.I will add more detail to this review as I can make time available . In the meantime beware of Kent bicycles , as I have in the meantime purchased another bicycle by Kent and discovered even greater junkiness .
 This bike has so much potential . It is relatively good in terms of price and function . However , the people at Kent really needs to make sure the bikes they send out is tuned correctly . I really wanted to like to this bike . Too bad it 's just not possible.Let me point out the pros :1 . It really is a comfort bike . Unless you have a huge behind , I would say the seat is decent . The shocks work pretty well . It rides smoothly , even on rough terrains .2 . The 18 '' frame size is well suited for shorter people . Being 5 ' 4 '' , I had no problem riding the bike.cons : I only have one real con for this bike . To me , it 's a pretty big one . The people at Kent did a horrible job on the bike derailleur 's adjustment . I actually had to send the 1st one back because the chains would constantly fall off of the gears . To make it worst , it would n't shift into 2nd gear on the front derailleur . Trash ... The 2nd bike -LRB- the replacement -RRB- was a bit better but was still not in good working form . Shifting gears was a nightmare . Sometimes it would shift ; while other times it would not . The chains would derail , too . Trash ... Adjusting the derailleurs is no easy task . It takes time to learn how to properly adjust them . I spent a good 2 hours trying to tune the bike but could n't do it . It had to be professionally done . However , the local shop around here charges $ 50 - $ 75 for a complete tune of the bike . That 's way too expensive to spend on this bike . In the end , it had to go back . Thankfully , Amazon 's return policy is completely hassle free .
 This is not a review of this bicycle in particular but of Kent Bicycles in general.This was supposed to be a great Christmas gift for my son . I will condense the story so not to bore anyone . Took bike out of the box and began minor assembly -LRB- petals , handle bar , front tire -RRB- no big deal except there was a missing nut for the front wheel -LRB- now a big deal as the weather is beautiful and my son wants his new bike -RRB- -LRB- who wouldnt !?!?! -RRB- . Wait a week . Received incorrect parts -LRB- seriously ???? -RRB- . Installed a matching nut from a friends old bike -LRB- problem solved -RRB- . We took the bike outside , aired-up the tires and let him go -LRB- HOOORAY !!! -RRB- . He rode approximately 50 ft and shifted down to 1st gear to climb back up a small hill and a horrible crunching sound was heard . The derailer -LRB- sp ? -RRB- -LRB- the thing that changes gears on the rear wheel -RRB- caught on the spokes an now is twisted sideways and is lodged in the spokes . Called the manufacturer again . They said they would be happy to replace the damaged parts . I 'm not a mechanic no do I intend to learn to be one . I can handle some assembly but if the factory ca n't handle proper derailer installation , what makes you think I can ????? I told them this was not acceptable and I would like to return this bike for a replacement . The person on the phone said someone would call me back `` right away '' . They have my phone number and address and they have made no attempt to contact me as of this note -LRB- I have waited a week -RRB- . To sum it up , DONT BUY THIS BIKE !!! - DONT BUY ANY `` KENT '' BIKE unless you 're a mechanic and do n't mind fixing manufacturing problems .
 I ordered the same size I all ready had . When they came they were way toosmall . The shipping was good price was good but they were sized wrong Iregifted then as a gift to my son .
 I tried to purchase warm heavy sweat pants on the web ... When they arrived , they were very light weight . Too light to take camping in spring or fall . I was dissapointed . Carl-Russell power Propel pants .
 According to my husband , the net is not secured enough to withstand a `` true '' drive . It was a great price but I think he suffered for my great bargain !! I will have to buy him one that is better quality.It was a good try , though .
 Holes in the net after first hit . Would return but too far away to ship . I would not recommend this
 I recently purchased this net and installed over the weekend . As soon as I opened the the box I knew the poles were not going to be able to withstand a full shot -LRB- not even a half shot -RRB- . The poles are not one piece but 3 separate pieces connected by two plastic holders . The net is held up by ropes and stakes but its not enough . After two hits the stakes were coming out of the ground . I should have known better since the price was so low but I read the other reviews about it being good enough to hit full shots.I returned the product -LRB- easy Amazon return system -RRB- but I wasted about 3 hours ordering , installing , testing , and returning . If you want a real practice net , I would recommend you save yourself some time and try something else . I ordered this to replace my old Callaway net -LRB- lasted about 2 years but was around $ 175 -RRB- . With that net I could hit full driver shots no prob .
 I would not recommend this product . The first time setting it up out of the box and one of the joints broke . Its got these little plastic pieces that join the pole pieces together and one of them broke in half over the stress of the net .
 If I could give this item a half star or less I would . I was happy and satisfied with this product for all of about 5 hits . It appears that the saying `` you get what you pay for '' is justifiable in this circumstance . Therefore , I recommend the company that manufactures this product to either a -RRB- put a caution tag saying that only toddlers with swing speed less than 20mph use this product or b -RRB- they make the awful excuse for plastic rods reinforced . After about the 6th hit or so with my irons the net successfully rebounded the ball back , I looked down at the ball , looked back up at the net to be disappointed with the sight at hand , the plastic pole was literally snapped in half . Do n't buy this product unless you want about three and a half minutes joy .
 pole broke the first time the ball hit the pole . used one day , total waste of money !! i would not recommend to anyone
 I 'm happy with the quality of the net . The quality of the poles that hold the whole thing up on the other hand could use some work . The poles a somewhat flimsy in even a slight breeze , the only way to fix this is to stretch the support string and net very tight . End result ... . The net becomes like a tennis raquet and if you try to drive the ball into it it flys back at you at extreme speed and you end up with a black eye and near broken nose like I did , even while standing back the recommended 10-12 ft. The only good thing that came from it was my wife whom I was teaching to golf got it all on tape , so while I 'm not much for suing maybe I can win a few bucks on Americas funniest home videos
 I am disappointed with the fit of this cover . Perhaps if the bed was not fully inflated it would fit better ; mine does not stay secured at the corners and is not properly wide and long enough for top/side coverage . It would be better if it were generally a little larger .
 The belt is very light weight and not a solid good belt for professionals . I would not buy this item again and have no use for it .
 Do not be fooled . This belt is rubbish and was useless after one training session . Would barely serve as a decoration .
 The dimensions of 14L x 8.8 W given for this product are completely untrue . This product measures 11L X 8W . I bought it for a Townie Electra Bike Seat which is 10L x 10W . It did not fit . I does fit my husband 's bike seat which measures 10L x 6W . Otherwise I would be sending it back .
 It arrived before the bike and I suspect it is comfortable but I will never get to find out . It IS the recommended seat cover for the Convenience Foldable Stow Away Exercise Bike . It does n't fit - not even close .
 So sad that manufacturers now days have to fib about there product to make a sale . It seems to be about that almighty dollar rather than just selling an honestly described product . It is so frustrating to check and then double check and check again to make sure it is the correct one and find out the manufacture is NOT HONEST in the description in the first place . The cushion is a great deal with the one exception . IT IS NOT THE STATED MEASUREMENTS AND WILL NOT FIT . The manufacturer states the product dimensions as
 I take a spin class and think the seats on those bikes are the most uncomfortable seats ever.When I saw this seat cover I thought my prayers had been answered well , I was very wrong . They feel like they would make a big difference but they do n't . I do n't even use it .
 So Amazon paired this seat cover with the Confidence Stow Away Bike but it does NOT fit it ! The stock seat on the exercise bike is too wide and a long to fit .
 Recommended for and purchased with Confidence Foldable Stow Away Exercise Bike.This seat is softer than the seat on the stationary bike that I bought it for , but it did n't really make anything more comfortable . It is actually smaller than the seat on the bike , even though it was recommended for the bike . I had to sort of stretch it and rip a few stitches to fit it . Not really worth it in the end .
 Good job , Amazon . You 'll probably hassle me about the return , too , since it 's already opened .
 The item seemed of good quality , however , it does n't fit all bike seats . At least it did n't mine .
 I measured the bike seat I have and compared it to the description of the one I bought from you . It is far too small and so worthless to me . I wish your measurements had been more accurate .
 I bought this seat cover for the Confidence Foldable Stow Away Exercise Bike which I also purchased here on Amazon . In fact , this seat cover was `` paired '' with the exercise bike by Amazon when they try to upsell you with the `` other customers also bought this '' message . So I did . When it arrived it was too small to fit on the exercise bike . I kept it to use on my regular bicycle , but it annoyed me that it would be `` recommended '' but not fit the item it was recommended for .
 As a prospective buyer of this product can observe by just skimming the reviews on Amazon.com , there are a lot of bicycles this seat cover just does n't fit . Mine -LRB- a Confidence Foldable Stow Away Exercise Bike - I really like it ! -RRB- is no exception.So be careful to check the seat measurements before you order , and do n't just take the manufacturer 's or seller 's word for it that it 's going to be okay . It seems to me that a lot of people are being ripped off . Not fair!By the way , if you are one of the lucky ones and the seat does fit your bicyle , it does seem very nice . Sturdy , and lots of gel in it.If only !
 I 'm sure it 's very comfortable , but I will never get to find out . It IS the recommended seat cover for the Convenience Foldable Stow Away Exercise Bike . BUT it does NOT FIT . Unfortunately , I missed the previous reviews indicating the same disappointment . This is the 1st time Amazon has steered me wrong .
 THE LA-Z-BOY TRIPLE GEL BICYCLE SEAT COVER WAS RECOMMENDED BY AMAZON TO BE USED COMPATIBLY WITH THE STATIONARY BICYCLE `` CONFIDENCE USA '' . THE SAD FACT IS THAT THE LA-Z-BOY SEAT COVER IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH CONFIDENCE USA BICYCLE BECAUSE IT DOES NOT FIT . IT WAS RECOMMENDED ERRONEOUSLY .
 Another waste of money . It did n't fit the stationary bike I ordered at the same time .
 dimensions are not as stated , actual 8x11x2 . Stated dimentions include underside fabric . waste of my time and money to have to make trip to post office and pay to return item .
 The gel inside the seat cover split during the first week I had it and it was n't at all comfortable . I had to readjust it every time I rode because the seat cover shifted to the side .
 Looks and feels like a good seat cover ; however , it was too small for my bike so I had to return it .
 There is a design defect in this product . Almost all of these valves will fail and not hold back water from leaking . The design engineer needs to go back to the drawing board and come up with a new design that will not leak . Merchants beware , you will get customer complaints on this product . Do not stock this item . Igloo makes a faucet that will not leak . Check it out .
 This is a beautiful bottle and easy to fill but it leaks and that is completely unacceptable . I see that numerous other buyers have had this same experience leading me to wonder how long the manufacturer is going to wait until they retool this part . I 'm going to send mine back and see if I get a better one . If I do , I 'll report back with 5 stars .
 The faucet I bought here leaks . not on the seal area but inside the faucet . when in the closed position , it leaks .
 I ordered 4 of these for some beverage decanters I fabricated for a local Palm Springs desert resort hotel . Within a week I was called by my customer to let me know that all four of them were leaking ... not from the place where they go through the wall of the decanter but from where the fluid is normally dispensed.Now I suppose I know why they were so inexpensive : -LRB-
 Very disappointed . The seal is of poor quality and it leaks . Was n't even able to use it .
 Do not be fooled . This belt is rubbish and was useless after one training session . Would barely serve as a decoration .
 The belt is very light weight and not a solid good belt for professionals . I would not buy this item again and have no use for it .
 The description of this product -LRB- from the seller `` toomanydiscs00 '' -RRB- says 10 ounce -LRB- 284 grams -RRB- and costs $ 9.48 with shipping.I received a can of 13 fluid ounce , which is only 6.76 ounce -LRB- 192 grams -RRB- . I could have bought a 5.82 ounce -LRB- 165 grams -RRB- can of Ronson for $ 4.99 at my local Ace Hardware.I consider it a bad deal . The wrong description may be an honest mistake . I will find out if the seller will issue a proportionate credit that I requested.In addition , the description states `` this item is flammible -LRB- sic -RRB- and can not ship via USPS '' but mine came via USPS .
 just says his and her set , nothing about kid size , my 5 year old can wear it but is too small for my 11 year old , unless it is meant to cover the top 2 inches of your head would be great for kids about 3-5
 After ordering the Los Angeles Angels T-shirt , Amazon delivered a Texas Rangers t-shirt . They still show the picture for the Texas Rangers shirt , yet the description is the Los Angeles Angels . Amazon even charged me the shipping cost , even though I returned the product and requested a new one.Very unhappy customer

 These wraps arrived looking like they 've already been worn and stretched out . They are constructed VERY poorly , and not small enough for kids . The elastic is all worn out and the wraps appear ruffled because of it . I tried to return product to the seller but they were going to deduct me the cost of shipping , which is garbage . They want me to pay to look at a pair of worn out , cheaply made wraps ? Not even going to bother sending them back - going to toss them in the garbage because that 's what they are . DO NOT BUY THESE ! I do n't recommend buying from MMA One Stop Shop either , because they wo n't back their products for free . You 'll get a crap product and pay to send it back , and the cost of shipping it to you will be deducted from the refund .

 This looks like something great in the photo but when you receive it you 'll be extremely shocked at how cheap and crappy it is . The felt was barely glued to the plastic ball collector ... an it 's not steep enough to return the ball . I probably could have made something better and waaaay cheaper than this . I do n't even want to give this as a Christmas gift anymore . Such a waste .
 Looks like a good item , BUT the ramp is not steep enough to return your ball , so you have to walk up and retrieve it every time .
 I know I should n't have high expectations or anything but this product totally missed on all accounts ! I bought this for my boyfriend and it was bent when it came in ! The carped was raggedy and just not at all what was expected ! BUYER BEWARE !

 The SRAM shifter was received in the original packaging but the part does not match the picture or the installation instructions . The picture shows an adjustment screw for the cable but this shifter does not come with one . Even SRAM 's Website shows and describes the screw . Had to return for a refund . Otherwise the part seemed to be well made for the price and probably would have functioned well if you do n't need the adjustment at this end .
 The jacket is cut undersized , typical of foreign makes with poor quality control . The lining in the sleeve keeps coming ot at the wrist which interferes with activity . Exterior shell has nice feel , but overall , a poor piece of work .

 You sent me a field tripod instead of the scope mounts I ordered and I emailed you with no response , not happy with amazon and will not purchase anything in the future , I had no scope on my rifle the whole month of November , because I live in the sticks , was not able to purchase one at the local walmart .

 I am usually satisfied when buying from Amazon , but I overlooked the No Return policy on compasses . My Silva Guide Compass arrived with a large air bubble in the chamber . It probably works OK , but likely would eventually leak its internal fluid . I 've sent it to the manufacturer - I do n't know if they will provide a refund or replacement.My advice - pay a few more bucks and see what you 're buying when shopping for a compass .
 I ordered the product for a specific job , the shipping was delayed twice past the date I needed it . I treid to cancel but it turned into a hassle so I have 2 compasses . This one is honest barely better than the $ 4 walmart one I ran out to purchase in a pinch . Very dissapointed with amazon on this one .
 I ordered this item largely because the picture clearly shows that the compass was made in Finland . When it showed up I was very disappointed to see that mine was made not in Finland , but in Indonesia . If I would 've known that it was made in Indo-China I would n't have paid more than $ 5 for it , or bought it at all for that matter . This is a cheap plastic compass and the quality is very much what you 'd expect from a MADE IN CHINA piece . In short , I got ripped off by this ad with their deceptive misleading picture . FALSE ADVERTISING !!!
 This compass is junk do n't buy when it arrived it had a big bubble in it and this is not a Silva from the Swiss company it is cheaply made in India
 I wanted a light weight sighting compass for backpacking and decided to try out the Silva Guide 426 . It is light weight but also has a very flimsy plastic hinge on the mirrored door . I mean totally plastic ! You ca n't really make it out in the picture . If I had seen that I definitely would not have ordered this compass . I 'm sure the hinge will be the first thing to fail . Beware since this item CAN NOT BE RETURNED ! Consider any other sighting compass with a clear base and stay clear of this piece of junk .
 I was really disappointed in the quality of this compass . Furthermore , there was an air bubble in the glass and the inside of the package was wet . I assume it leaked . Do n't waste your money on this item . Even if it were not defective or damaged , I do not believe it is worth more than three or four dollars .
 Very unhappy , the product I recieved did not have the items promised in the product description . It was supposed to have the ricon-alpha-9 flashlight worth over 500.00 $ , instead they gave me a 10.00 $ cheap maglight and when I called them on it they refused to make it right . Instead told me I could either live with it or send it back , but they would not make it right so I will now go talk with my lawyer to resolve this matter . VERY UNHAPPY !
 it 's better just to get a rap4 marker -LRB- which is magazine fed and what the swat and special millitary units use for training -RRB- then spend that much money just to outfit a tippmann a5 with stuff
 I guess I misread the description , but I thought I was ordering a dozen childrens `` magic gloves '' for $ 5.63 but this was actually 1 pair of little knit gloves for this price . I did get a return authorization , buthad the expense to return them also.I guess I will read descriptions more carfully next time
 When I saw that Amazon carried my favorite breeches , I jumped in and ordered 4 pairs . I love the Sigma cotton breeches with a zipper pocket . But , what I received was Tuffrider Pull On breeches with no zipper pocket , in light weight fabric -LRB- I hate pull on breeches ! -RRB- When I called Equestrian Collection to inform them that I had not received what I ordered , the person just kept going around in circles telling me this is what I ordered . I 'm sending them a copy of the Amazon page to show them what I ordered ...
 I finally got to try this thing out after having it for two months.Hiked four miles into a lake using my new PN-40se gps , spent the night and the next morning I plugged the gps in to charge it , everything looked to be going well so I let it charge for about 15 minutes and re-checked it only to find the screen blank -LRB- as it was on when I started -RRB- so I unplugged and tried to turn it on , and nothing . Very unhappy ! . When I got back to the truck I found the gps still worked if I put regular battery 's in it , so it ruined my brand new rechargeable batts.Be warned -LRB- check it out before you go ! -RRB-
 The picture is not what you will receive . what you will get is a wire grill . There is not any black metal casing surrounding it .
 Picture shows a thicker `` Heavy Duty '' grill , this is just a cheap steel wire grill . If you want the thick one search `` heavy duty grill ''

 This looks like a nice item . However , I would n't know personally because I never received it from Fogdog . I ordered it 3 weeks before it was needed for my son 's birthday , then received a message saying that it was on backorder but I would be informed when it was shipped . A few days before I needed it , I received a message telling me that they canceled my order !!! I will never order anything offered by Fogdog again !

 Bought this halter because the headline said `` Yearling '' halter . NOT MINI YEARLING which is how it arrived . I 'm so angry they need to be very specific with their advertising whether these are actual HORSE size or miniature horse size .
 We have a baby -LRB- 3 year old -RRB- shire who keeps breaking out of his halters , and any replacements we find are all too small ... I was pleasantly surprised that this piece was too big for our little guy - we made a new hole for the buckle under the chin , and have no complaints . Even though the description says 1100 + pounds , it 'll fit your 1600 + Draft with no problems . : -RRB- Edit

 After putting the unit on my 00 Toyota Solara for the first time and after placing my bike into the cradle , I proceeded to strap the bike 's frame . Naturally one would want to fasten this securely . The plastic piece that the threading loops through immediately snapped . I put reasonable pressure on the thread as I pulled it through . This raises serious red flags on the integrity of this product over all . I 'm going to attempt rigging it with bungee cable to see if I can create a much safer and secure method for transporting my bikes.Just be aware that these cables are useless . If it does n't break when you get your bike secured in the cradle , then when ? On the freeway , putting peoples lives at risk ?
 This bike rack gave out the second time I used it . The first time it was used it was easy to put together and felt solid . The second time I used it one of the buckles -LRB- plastic -RRB- gave out . The teeth of the buckle stopped holding the strap -LRB- one of the top two -RRB- and the bike swung free while I was driving down the highway . I had to quickly pull over before the whole bike fell off the back of the car.Side note
 I purchased the 102S model based on -LRB- i -RRB- the Company 's reputation and -LRB- ii -RRB- the reviews from Amazon customers . This looked good when the product arrived , it was properly packaged and free from damage . This a very intuitive product and this is necessary as the instructions packed with the product are marginal at best . Things went well until I went to adjust the top strap - the lever on the clamp broke off with just the slightest pressure . This of course made any adjustment impossible.Upon examination it was evident that the quality of the metal used in the clamp was not sufficient for the purpose intended . The quality of the metal reminded me of that used in some of the cheap products that were imported after WWII . This problem was apparently not unexpected as I saw that one other customer reported it and when I called Allen they treated it without any expression of surprise an in fact they sent me two of the clamps an indication that I should expect a repeat of this problem.The rack itself shows evidence of good engineering and reasonable workmanship which is a credit to the founder Dick Allen . My contact at the company was Alex Allen would is apparently in charge and frankly was not impressive . I suspect that this product has , and continues to undergo a `` cost reduction '' analysis that has resulted in the inferior clamps that can break at any time . One has to wonder what will be next ? When a product breaks `` out of the box '' and the replacement part is no better than the one that broke it does not instill confidence.This was a good product at a fair price IF the quality of the parts are not diminished . I am concerned that the current product does not represent a good value as a result of what I see as a deterioration in quality - Buyer BewareAllen 102S Premium 2-Bike Trunk Mount Rack
 Bought the Allen 102S bike rack to carry two bikes to the beach on the back of my BMW 325xi . After spending an hour trying to get the thing mounted and bikes attached , I ended up pulling the whole thing off and returning it.Here 's why I returned it . The only thing holding this bike rack to the car are the nylon straps . Without the straps , the whole unit falls to the ground . If one strap fails , the same result . It 's basically a friction mount held in place by the strap tension . The top bar rests on the trunk and the lower bar presses against the license plate -LRB- bending it inward -RRB- . Granted the bars are coated with foam , but I could see the trunk flexing under the weight of the bikes which will surely leave a dent . The top two straps are secured to the trunk lip by metal clips . The bottom straps are secured in a similar fashion . The problem is when the top straps are cinched tight , the clips angle upwards and pinch against the rear window glass . One or two good bumps and the rear window would have cracked for sure -LRB- to be fair , this is due to the way the BMW is designed , other cars may not experience this issue -RRB- . Once I got everything tight and bikes installed , I was VERY worried that one of the straps would pop loose sending the rack -LRB- and bikes -RRB- onto the road behind me . It was not very secure by any stretch of the imagination , IMHO . Between the trunk flexing , the licence plate bending , and the whole thing wriggling around , I was n't left with any confidence that this thing would stay put and not destroy my car . Off it came , and back it went.I ended up buying a class 1 trailer hitch -LRB- 30 minutes to install -RRB- and a receiver mounted bike rack and was VERY happy with the result . Made a 300 mile round trip to the beach and back and the bikes never moved an inch.The trunk mount rack is clearly a quick and dirty way of attaching bikes to your car . My philosophy is do the job right and not cut corners . If you do n't have a trailer hitch , install one . They 're available for practically any car . And the receiver-mounted racks are so much more stable .
 It is cheaper at walmart . They also have a promotion going on right now for the same item.Not sure if the comment will be removed though .
 I bought this bike rack as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend and decided to spend the extra bucks to get him a better quality one than he had previously . When he opened it and tried to attach it to the car , it was completely put together wrong and did n't even resemble the picture on the box . Luckily he is handy and is going to take it apart and put it together properly . What a disappointment when we wanted to go for our first trek of the spring and had this to deal with beforehand . I do n't know what went wrong , but the assembly person must have been stoned .
 Second time I used this thing it dented my car . I only drove about 50 miles on city roads and my trunk is now completely ruined . Stay away from this thing , it 's GARBAGE ! Thanks for ruining my car Allen sports .
 I am very unhappy with the product . It broke the first time I used it . I put it on the car , loaded the bike and then traveled 25 miles . The bike was secure , but that was not the problem . When I got home and started taking the rack off the release on the top strap clamp broke . The only way that I could get it off was to undo all the other straps and then slide the strap off after the others were loose . I am going to contact the company and hopefully they will send me a replacement part . The company promptly sent me a replacement part for the broken clasp . Great service and hopefully this one will not break .
 I thought this product was fine for occasional use . I used in once to cart my bike about 15 miles locally - no problems . Threw out the packaging because I decided it was a keeper . Then today , after driving on the interstate for 700 miles this week , we got back into town , went over a speed bump at about 25 mph , and both plastic buckles holding my bike onto the rack broke and it flew off . My rear wheel is bent beyond repair , and I had just had it in for a major tune-up .
 Got sold this product by a local retailer -LRB- who is apparently one of Allen 's larger re-sellers according to Allen 's customer service rep -RRB- . The re-seller installed the rack for me and I went on my merry way . Went on a road trip to upstate New England -LRB- the rack performed OK - kept sagging and had to pull over every so often to tighten up -RRB- . Got back and finally cleaned my car and found 2 big strap marks etched into the paintwork of my trunk.Spoke to customer service on the phone -LRB- girl was very pleasant -RRB- and was advised to send details/pictures by email . Guy/girl on the other end of the email was a jerk ! Told me that the rack was n't installed correctly at all -LRB- even though it was installed by their large authorized re-seller and I was given no instructions beyond the re-sellers installation demonstration -RRB- and said it had nothing to do with them . The person then got sarcastic via email as I re-emphasized the fact that it was their re-seller that mis-sold their product ... s/he did n't care.Obviously I 'm a bit bitter at this point , but its these customer service interactions that can either make or break a customer relationship . Needless to say I 'll never be going back to Allen 's products out of principle.Admittedly this is a customer service rant rather than a product review , but I still think it can help to form a purchase decision . As I said , the product itself did not perform great - the straps kept getting slightly loose and I could see the bikes sag lower and lower in my review which was unnerving . And obviously the damaged paintwork speaks for itself.Not a happy customer .
 Even though the manufacturer 's website states that the bike rack would fit my 2002 Volvo C70 , it rubbed against the rear spoiler . I chose to return it rather than risk damaging my car . Amazon 's return center was gracious and extremely helpful in making sure that I was satisfied .
 I fell on the floor because one of the legs slipped all the way down when I sat on it.Had double checked it to be sure it was stable , and this happened . Now , when I useit I am very tentative about it because I do n't want to hurt myself . It is not a hardy piecewhere one can just open it and sit on it . Maybe I just received a lemon and the others are ok . Do n't know . There are other brands out there that cost a lot more but the thing is they are stable . The price is right , but there is risk to it . Do n't really recommend it , unless having a leg go down when you sit on it does n't bother you .
 On first trip a pad came off one of the legs . I tried to contact them and they would n't respond to my emails .
 I bought this chair for a motorcycle camping trip because of its packable size . My initial thoughts on the chair were that it looked solid and well built . I sat in the chair for about an hour before one of the steel legs start stabbing through the foot . The ground was a little sandy , but solid . I am close to the weight limit they state in the description , but this looks like the plastic was too soft for the sharp ends of the steel tubing . The remainder of the chair seems well built . Item returned .
 everybody sat on this for a short period of time , good size , portability , just not much of a seat , get a blue max
 the seat is to low to the ground , and too small do n't move the wrong way or males may have catastrophy .
 I chose this item because the chair was advertised with the ability to handle a certain weight level . Plus
 These things are heavy -LRB- steel -RRB- ; not something you want to carry.I did n't see `` made of steel '' -LRB- NOT Aluminum -RRB- on this ad.Why are aluminum versions of this so ___ expensive?You want a folding stool like this so you CARRY IT ! -LRB- the thing even has `` travel '' in its very name ! -RRB- Is that so hard to figure out ? For the weight of this thing I could have a chaize lounge .
 This Chair is uncomfortable and Dangerous ! When I tried to use the chair , the target was so small my rear end missed the chair and I found myself on the floor . I was just off by a few inches but the chair is unforgiving , it slipped out from under me and Kaboom I was on the floor.The chair looks like it would be fine for children , 6 to 12 , but it is dangerous for any one over 17 . It is definitely not for Seniors .
 I ordered this stool with the intention of bringing it backpacking . It 's just too big to bring with me , the claim that it is smaller than a rolled up newspaper is true of diameter , but not true on height at all . I 'd say it 's probably about 25-27 inches long when folded . The weight also comes in play here , it 's a little over 30 ounces when other comparable products -LRB- both style and price -RRB- weigh-in at 18 ounces.I knew about the warning label -LRB- thanks to other reviewers -RRB- before I ordered , and certainly was n't thrilled about it , but certainly plays a factor in my review.On the plus side for the chair , it 's built in strap is a plus , if you are planning on bringing this to an amusement park or the beach I think it would do rather well . the feet are angled which will help with stability.Shorten the chair , make the legs aluminum , remove the cancer chemicals , and I 'm sold , but for today , this is a returned product .
 The ring in the middle of the legs has three screws in it , each holding a leg into its hole in the ring . These screws are loosened every time the chair is opened and closed . After only a week of use , one of the screws fell out despite my constant re-tightening of it , and now the leg that screw belonged to moves freely in the center ring . Meaning the chair just tips over when you sit on it . Very disappointed in this one , and since I was out of the country with the military when using it , by the time I was able to return home and get a refund the return window had closed . Now it 's in the trash.Very , very poorly designed .
 Do n't waste your time ordering this chair unless you a magician or you are a pole sitter . Instead just take 3 twigs and try to balance your body on them . If you weigh over 100 lbs select another product .
 In the closet . I weigh only 110 # and I was afraid when I sat on this stool . Not comfortable at all . Looks like it has a back for support in the picture , but it really does n't . What a waste of money .
 The tripod configuration and seat size renders this travel chair painfully uncomfortable for anyone owning male genitalia or weighing more than 120 pounds . On the other hand , since the chair seems to be rather durable , it should be quite acceptable for smaller women and children .
 It didnt last for one round of disc golf on the limestone terrain here in central Texas . This chair is great for the backyard or as a backup/emergency chair only . Small seat , good for a small person or child . Shipped on time and in great condition , just didnt last . Male
 We bought two of these for the kids at Christmas . The height of this chair is good - it 's taller than most similar chairs , and is lightweight and easy to carry with the strap . However , the plastic feet fell off pretty much immediately . We did glue them back on , but the ones we 'd bought from REI just seem to be better made . I think I 'll probably end up using this when we camp due to the height . The chair is usable , but it was kind of a shocker when it was &#34; broken &#34; out of the bag .
 I had this stool for a couple of months and I loved it , it was so handy . . until it broke . Now I 'm not a heavy person and having the pole tear through the cloth was rather disheartening . I do love the idea of this stool , but the company should make it stronger .
 I bought this little chair in March of this year -LRB- 2012 -RRB- . One of the things I found attractive about it was the weight limit . I 'm a big guy
 I bought this BalTogs black nylon spandex catsuit in ' 98 . It was one of my favorite things to wear when I was in the mood for it . But now I 've found better.I can find this similar product but with all types of custom sizing and options for the head , hands , feet and the zipper . The BalTogs only has the back zipper which goes to one 's mid-back while the new custom ones I have access to allow full access to the `` plumbing '' without having to take it all off.Even better is that I now can get this made in by far more numerous colors and for a forth of the price too . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 I ordered a Large top - I received a Small Petite !!! I had ordered it for my son who is in the military . He gets really cold under his uniform and I can not afford to spend a lot of money . This was on sale - it was back ordered - which I was okay with . But , when I received it a month later , it was the wrong size . What was the point of sending one ? My son was home on leave and I had hoped to be able to send him off with a warm top to wear under his uniform . That did not happen .
 Bought this halter because the headline said `` Yearling '' halter . NOT MINI YEARLING which is how it arrived . I 'm so angry they need to be very specific with their advertising whether these are actual HORSE size or miniature horse size .
 We have a baby -LRB- 3 year old -RRB- shire who keeps breaking out of his halters , and any replacements we find are all too small ... I was pleasantly surprised that this piece was too big for our little guy - we made a new hole for the buckle under the chin , and have no complaints . Even though the description says 1100 + pounds , it 'll fit your 1600 + Draft with no problems . : -RRB- Edit
 My old cateye Halogen headlight -LRB- HL-500 -RRB- was legendary in its toughness , 10 years with routine drops and spills . I ca n't say the same for the new OptiCube LED models . I 've had both the HL-EL500 and the newer HL-EL530 LED lights stop working after falling only once from handlebar heights -LRB- just about 3.5 ft -RRB- . Nothing visibly broken or cracked , no loose parts , just a $ 45 - $ 55 paper weight . The problem is limited to the reflector/bulb housing unit , for which Cateye does not sell replacements , so once it breaks you have to replace the whole thing . No complaints about the brightness when it worked , but a bike-light needs to be tough and should withstand small drops at least as well as your average cell-phone . MagLite can make nearly indestructable and waterproof flashlights that sell for under $ 35 , why ca n't CatEye ? It 's about time we stopped getting ripped off by bike light manufacturers .
 This light is decent if you want to be seen at night . If you expect to be able to see anything with it , you 'll be sorely disappointed.If you want to actually go down dark trails in pitch black darkness , see trust me , spend the extra money and buy a P7-C -LRB- Google it -RRB- . For just a few bucks more , the difference is unbelievable .
 I 'm disappointed with this product because of
 The battery connectors and housing are flimsy and poorly designed . Works great until it breaks or an electrical connection sticks open or closed .
 The light works fine , but the attachment bracket is weak and wont last . Mine broke after about 6months of use.I was moving the light from one bike to another . I am disappointed . Not a good buy.Look at the picture and you can see there is a flexible plastic strap with threads . Well , after a while the plastic is not so flexible . and snap . Your bike light just turned into a flash light.You can buy a replacement strap for 5 $ . Or spend your money on a different light , many Cateye lights have this attachment method though , so look closely at the picture .
 Putting this together was dangerous due to the very sharp edges . I did all the exercises once and immediately took it apart to return it -LRB- I got a full refund but I was out the cost of shipping and the cost of return shipping ~ $ 80 -RRB- . This machine is useless . Allow me to demonstrate why
 First off once and if the bands break were are you suppose to order repalcements ? In addition the leg attatchment I had would not fit on the frame like it should ! After getting tired of fooling with this machine I threw it in the garbage .
 I bought this rack based on some of the good reviews I read . I own a VW Golf 07 -LRB- hatchback -RRB- which according to Allen 's manual fit right with the 103S rack . However , as soon as I installed this rack in my car and drove very few miles , I noticed that the bikes were coming off . I tightened-up the belts twice and re-read the instructions flier just to make sure . Then after 2-3 miles ... I hit a pothole , the rack got lose and the bikes almost fell off to the pavement -- I had to pull over.Results
 I fought with this bike rack several times , and almost lost a bike to the road . It attaches easily , but it 's not really made for three bikes . I like the locking cable and will use that again , but I 've replaced this rack . I think I would use it for just two bikes , but that 's not my situation .
 The first time I opened a buckle , the buckle tab broke off and the spring below it put a gash in my thumb.The buckle is extremely cheap . I took the 1 '' x 1/2 '' tab that broke off and I was able to break it in half again , using very little effort.This is one the buckles that holds the rack to the car . If these fail , the rack will fall off your car and onto the freeway.I am returning it .
 one of the latch which secures the band broke after half a year of use , 2 mountain bike and 1 road bike . I 'm using a wire tie to fix it now , does not want to depend on the other latch , it might broke at anytime . This product is otherwise a good product but the latch made from some mix of plastic material , it should be made from metal which is much more durable .
 I owned it for one year and a half.I used it for one adult bike and a child bike . it was O ` K.Today I used a third bike , After two miles of drive , The rack broke .
 I got this product couple weeks ago , and at installing it for the first time , some metal part breaks on my . I 'm giving it a second try just because the product is really easy to use .
 When I saw that Amazon carried my favorite breeches , I jumped in and ordered 4 pairs . I love the Sigma cotton breeches with a zipper pocket . But , what I received was Tuffrider Pull On breeches with no zipper pocket , in light weight fabric -LRB- I hate pull on breeches ! -RRB- When I called Equestrian Collection to inform them that I had not received what I ordered , the person just kept going around in circles telling me this is what I ordered . I 'm sending them a copy of the Amazon page to show them what I ordered ...

 A beautiful watch for sure , but very , very large and very , very heavy . For my wrist , it was a nonstarter .

 The Ugly Stick name let me down on this one . The basic rod is ok . The problem is that the reel mount just uses the friction of the handle to hold the rear reel mount in place . The rod is missing the Ugly Stick twist lock . Even a basic backing nut would work to secure the reel . As it is , you have to constantly keep securing the reel to keep if from falling off .

 Well made and nice bag but my new Omer Rekord fins fit so tightly in the bag that the edges get compressed by this bag which was made TOO SMALL ! If it was just an inch or so longer this would be a great fin bag . I ended up using my old worn out generic fin bag and my new fins fit perfect . The Omer bag is basically useless since I 'm afraid it will damage my expensive carbon fiber fin blades by compressing and bending them .

 Potential buyers should be aware that these are REPRINTS . There is not even one Mantle card that would sell for this amount of money . Forget 10 in mint condition.Do not waste your money!The seller is being incredibly disingenuous by offering these cards without noting that they are REPRINTS .
 This knife looks and feels CHEAP . The handle is plastic -LRB- excuse me Zytal -RRB- and the spot where the plastic -LRB- er , Zytel -RRB- was joined at the factory was n't even smoothed off . The blade -LRB- though it is stamped surgical steel -RRB- is boldly also stamped `` CHINA '' Nuff said ! Oh , and if you decide you do n't like your cheap feeling/looking knife the company will NOT take it back ! I know because I 'm stuck with one .

 Used as directed in two portable boat motor gas tanks . Mixture would not work in a 1970 's 70HP Johnson boat motor . Had to dispose of 9 gallons of gas because of this product . The motor worked OK before this product and after we made up another tank without it , 50-1 gas/oil motor .
 Although the shirt is -LRB- was -RRB- comfortable and I did like it , the shirt did NOT like chlorine . I wore it in my aqua aerobics class and after a couple months it stretched out completely . Not long after that , tiny holes started appearing all over like it was disintegrating ! It may be fine for oceans and lakes but I would not recommend pools . I ended up tossing it . : -LRB-

 Bought this knife to use on my BC -LRB- Knighthawk -RRB- and never did find a place to attach it , part to blame on ScubaPro . However when it comes to the knife , it was very dull from the factory , couldnt cut fishing line , and the scabard made for it seemed very generic . .
 I was disappointed with this light . I used it for six months on a daily five mile round trip commute . The light beam , battery life and handlebar mount were all very good but the construction of the light itself is very flimsy . The top cover over the batteries does not seal tightly allowing water to seep in and it is easily lost . The clear front part containing the bulbs and circuit board eventually broke off just by normal handling . I could not reattach it since the very thin wires also broke away from their solder joints . The switch on the back of the light does not have a positive `` click '' and can be easily activated unintentionally.This light is good for only occasional use in a dry environment . I bought aPlanet Bike Beamer 3for a couple dollars more and it seems like it is much better made and water resistant .
 The little tab broke off of the light . Now it is useless without an improvised `` fix '' , which I have n't been able to figure out yet . Unfortunately , I think the best answer is to search for a new front light . I do not recall how the tab broke off . I only remember hitting a street bump/pothole and the light flew off , never to snap into place again . The light was satisfactory and reliable before then . I used it for almost two years before the tab broke . I think the invention to fasten the light 's base to the handlebars / frame is great .
 Bought one last night during a ride because my rechargeable was drained and I wanted at least to be seen.Directs so much light upward , into the eyes -LRB- like looking right into an LED flashlight -RRB- , that night vision is spoiled and does not throw nearly enough light forward to see anything useful about the road . The pivot on the bracket is a non-locked Philips screw that allows the light to rotate at the slightest bump . This lamp is so badly designed that I will avoid any Cateye products in the future because they obviously have no respect for their customers or regard for their safety.It might be a temptation to put this on a child 's bike because it is cheap but only if you want to get rid of the child .
 I bought one of these from a bike shop . Indeed , the batteries last a very long time and it is `` bright enough '' , but frankly I can not understand the positive reviews here . Almost since I bought it , sometimes the light would not turn on -LRB- or would be very dim -RRB- , and it would not respond to the push button . When this happened , the only way to turn it on or off would be to bang on it . Finally , I banged on it so hard that it broke , and upon seeing the insides , I understood the cause of the problem
 I purchased this light from a bike shop . I liked how clean and simple it looked . Was happy at first - installation was easy . It was not intuitive how to quick-release the light to remove it and eventually I popped it off and popped it back . What I did n't realize was that in doing so , I broke a very delicate tiny plastic tab that prevents the light from sliding off of the bracket . -LRB- another reviewer did the same - so its not just me -RRB- I went on my first test-ride . Went over a bump and the light flew off the bracket and onto the street , breaking into 4 pieces plus 2 batteries . Spent 15 minutes under the streetlights searching for the parts - eventually found them and somehow was able to put the thing back together . One of the batteries was a bit crushed . Wedged a piece of aluminum foil into the bracket to get the thing to stay in place . Used the light a few times on my commute . Performance was not so good - pretty dim-even for riding under city lights.A month later the light would n't work and I realized that the crushed battery had leaked acid all over the inside of the product , corroding it and destroying it.Well , that was the end of my story - a bad experienced cause by an unintuitive and delicate quick-release tab.I would n't recommend this light .
 This light works perfectly well under fading light conditions or at any time you want oncoming traffic to see you . The mistake I made was assuming that it projected sufficient light to enable me to see a reasonable distance ahead in total darkness . The LED light is certainly bright enough , particularly in flashing mode , for others to see you but does not extend much beyond two or three feet.If you 're looking for an affordable and functional bike light to be noticed , then this one fits the bill . If you want a light that lights up the night , go with something with at least 250 lumens or more .
 Mag would n't fit in it 's slot and allow the belt to feed through . Thin cheap leather , poor quality product . Slot made for very narrow belt .
 I too had problems with this compass locking up . The first time it happened another diver showed me how to wack it on it 's side to free it up ... that worked a few times but it eventually froze up for good . After getting lost on my last dive I was literally beating it with a rock to try and get the dial inside to turn . I would not recommend this compass .
 I work at a Dive store and this is our best selling compass by far since it fits the Suunto/Aqualung modules . However it frequently locks up , and then even hard blows will not allow the needle to turn . This is the second unit I have tried and both locked up . If you enjoy being lost underwater with a non-functional compass then this one is for you . Shame on Suunto !
 I ordered this rapier because it does n't look anything like the standard Musketeer rapier . What did they send me ? The standard Musketeer rapier : Trademark 00-7X53 Musketeer Rapier Sword - 44 inches - scabbard includedWhat can I say ? The scabbard is nice ? However , it 's not what I ordered and now I get to go through the hastle of trying to return it .
 I 've only had this computer for a couple of years and I 've had nothing but problems with it . First the hose leaked ... within a couple months of buying it and I had to shell out more money to get it replaced because I was on a dive trip at the time and did n't want to miss out on diving . I just got back from a week and a half vacation to Cancun and I jumped in the water day one and was surprised to see I was already at 426 ft. Day 2 I was at 26ft standing in the lobby of my hotel and when I got in the water and dove to 95 ft I was still at 0 ft according to my `` reliable '' computer .

 problems , problems ... I am having just problems with the cardiosport heart-rate meter -LRB- limit classic , with a strap -RRB- , and wish i had never seen it .
 Did n't ship with any hardware , but then again , most marine products do n't . I 'd recommend making sure you have a solid through-bolt to secure them , they are a little flimsy and a self tapping screw will strip out .
 This is a neat item but so very very small . It has only the capacity for maybe banknotes and a credit card but it can not accommodate a modern car key - the ones with the remote functions for the central locking and security system - precisely the item most in need of keeping dry .
 It was smaller than I wanted . My big complaint was the description did not contain the dementions . It was not big enough to hold my fitbit .

 I bought the TravelJohn-Disposable Urinals thinking they were a portable toilet , especially for # 2 since Urinal is Latin for Urinus , the Roman god of fertilizer . Well , they 're strictly for # 1 , this I found out while I was in the museum with no toilets.First of all , who needs a Disposable Urinal for # 1 ? We have nature or back alleys for that so it 's not hard to find a place for # 1 . Secondly , my Urinal pack did n't come with instructions so I had no idea how to use it . It 's some snorkleing bag .
 Great product for smaller capacity bladders . But I can quickly fill this to the rim and then some ... -LRB- too much info ? -RRB- Well , you should know . So unless your body has a quick shut off ability - you 're heading for trouble if you 're a big water drinker during the day .
 I am female and I travel a long distance to work everyday andI thought it would be great to use whenever I am stuck intraffic . Well , I tried it yesterday and I was notable to get it unfolded enough and I was never able toget any urine in the bag . Needless to say I was smartenough to put plastic on my car seat , because I definitelywet my pants . As confused as I was the first time , I hadto go again while still stuck in traffic , so I tried anotherbag and once again I got wet all over . I guess it requirespractice , but I am not a fan at this time .

 It would have been nice to know that the Fathead decal does not stick to any walls with the slightest texture . Our wall is very lightly textured . We spent 10 minutes removing air pockets and in 5 minutes it was peeling off . This was a waste of $ 100.00 . We have replaced the decal back on the original paper and rolled it back up in the box it came in . We are hoping to send it back or sell it to someone with smooth walls , assuming it will stick to smooth walls .

 Looked Great . Priced Great . Nice View.But ... Bought mine new from a Dive shop in Cheboygan , Mi . on 7/13/12 . The Tempered glass shattered in my hands as I rinsed it out in my pool at home , I tried to get satisfaction from a local service center , as it was purchased on vacation hundreds of miles from home . Warranty from Genesis is useless ... All I hear are excuses , its Now 7/17/12 . I expected better from a manufacturer like Genesis / Sherwood.Contact me if you can help ! This item was not abused , it was defective.MikeBadmask@doctorslime.com
 The Post for this set is very weak and can break in just one game . I have to buy and make my own to fix the problem . The racket for badminton handle is not really a good quality and the handle cover will easily peel off in just a game or two.Not a good buy for this product .
 Quality appears OK . After final assembly and then installation of the net , the net was found to have been previously repaired in six places . Somewhat of a disappointing birthday gift.Not sure how my comment once merited 3 stars , but I do not recommend this product nor this company . I would have returned the product had the kit been assembled reasonably soon after gifted and if I had been promptly appraised of its damage.To knowingly send a previously used and damaged product is egregious and merits no star .
 This let me down on the trail . I got this so I could use non-threaded CO2 cartridges ; however , on a recent trip riding ATV 's I had to repair a tire , what a pain to use this unit , you have to push in to get the inflation going and it leaks while doing so . I went through 6 cartridges and could only put appx 1 pount of air in my ATV tire . I 'll go back to using the threaded cartridges with old valve setup .

 I thought that this would be useful to at least try . The box arrived with opposite ends torn off - so there was no way to even return it . I borrowed an air pump only to realize that there is no seal in the large blue disc.So I have a useless plastic disc until I get assistance from Amazon to rectify the situation.This seller refused to respond to my e-mail .
 We used this canopy twice for our sons soccer games . The second time we used it there was a slight breeze , the canopy blew over bending the leg and breaking the support bar . I expected it to last longer than this !!
 The shade structure was easy to put up , and the fabric top section is very nice . However , it folded/crashed in the lightest of breezes ; seems to be a design or manufacturing defect . The frame itself is strong enough , but the joints are just flattened pieces of plastic with no washers or reinforcing , and the littlest breeze causes them to bend , the screws/fasteners pull right through , and the whole thing collapses . It collapsed twice within a few hours ; did n't even get us through our backyard BBQ . With the help of some duct tape , we got through the BBQ with a modicum of shade , but we have since returned the item .
 I 've had this canopy for just over a year . When I first got it I thought it was great . I had it up through a few heavy rainfalls and it held up great making me think it was quite sturdy . Then while at a car show that was mildly windy the weakness in the design became readily apparent . The sides of the canopy 's structure has no lateral strength , this caused the small vertical area of the canopy to fold inwards at the slightest amount of wind . Once this bent in the whole canopy looses its strength . This canopy has been reduced to pretty much junk after one breezy day . I 've seen other designs that have significantly thicker joints to provide better lateral support . This particular unit is not worth even buying .
 The product itself is okay , but I must warn about the condition it came in . The box was completely damaged . It had been taped up so that it could hold itself together . When we opened the box , the tent comes inside a case and the case itself was damaged . The fabric is ripped and the bottom foot is broken off . So much for giving it as a present ! I could have gone to Walmart and gotten one in much better condition for the same price !
 DO NOT PURCHASE !!! NOT worth the money or the headache that came with it . The only good experience was how easy it was to return to Amazon :-RRB- The welds on the top were broken when we openned the box and not knowing that we opened the box and followed the directions to open the unit and more of the welds broke just pulling it open from the box so seeing that we put it back in the box and sent it back not even getting to use it . I think they need a better joint for the top as these do n't look like they would make it even in traveling to install at your destination . Waste of time and money !

 it works . period . but it is like wearing a plastic bag ... no breathing at all . You get very sweaty when it is closed up ... it is only good for heavy rain protection , but nothing else . Better to spend a few more dollars and get a material that is both waterproof and breathes .
 The good thing about this parka ? It is waterproof . Do n't buy this parka if you plan to active . It does not breathe and it retains moisture . Sizing is not true to size . Buy one size smaller if you are still considering a purchase .
 This rain jacket is not breathable . They say it is because they have two small holes under something on the front of the jacket . Right where my backpack shoulder straps go . I think you would stay drier without the jacket in the rain . I put it on and I was drenched inside . This is a jacket you throw on if your running to the store . Absolutely not for any serious outdoor activity like hiking .

 Not much of a `` portable '' table at this weight . Also , it does n't exactly pop up quickly ; we would n't be able to pack it up and pop it back out night after night during camping . There just are n't a lot of choices in travel tables , unfortunately .
 My Aunt bought this 1 year ago of which she only used once then she passed it on to me . I use it for the local Craft Fair at the Long Beach Farmer 's Market . When you visit the site for `` Quik Shade '' you see under `` marketplace '' that there is a guy who is hanging items from the cross bars . Yeah , right ... My 3rd time using it resulted in a snapped arm . It literally snapped while setting up . I called Quik Shade and thank goodness the gal that answered the phone was my neighbors best friend * which I did n't know until the end of the discussion * and she hooked me up with extra arms and even had her boyfriend bring it to me . If it had n't been her offering to bring me the pieces , even though they are around the corner from my house , I would not have received the parts until 2 weeks down the road from time of order placed ! Why ? Read below ... Recently , the plastic pieces that hold the unit up in the corner snap elements -LRB- the ones that push the canopy up with a diagonal bar -RRB- broke . Yep , snapped in 3 places ... on all but one . There are a total of 4 . Then , because I hang my items from the cross bars like the image of the marketplace , the middle `` plastic pieces '' that join the ` x ' bars bolted and the ` end joints ' for each end of the bar after the joined section ... are breaking and stretched out . I ordered the pieces back on July 29th , 2008 ... it is now August 9th , 2008 ... do I have the parts ? No ... will I get the parts before I go and do my show tomorrow ? Most likely NOT ... will I buy another piece of S ** T from this company ever again ? Most definitely not ... The company , when you call in , has you on hold for over 1 1/2 hours ... that tells you something right off the bat for the warranty department ... do YOU have 1 1/2 hours to sit and wait for their call ? Never mind sending them an e-mail , they never EVER respond . As for leaving a `` call back number '' , you are better off going and buying a lotto ticket , you might have a better chance at winning the lotto ! This company , is utterly unprofessional and do n't take their job seriously . They sell you 's ** t ' and do n't answer the phones in hopes you 'll be dumb enough to go and buy another one.Save your money or pay additional for the Caravan 's . The center supports are amazing . I know ... I hang from my neighbors to test it out and I will tell you this right now ... Caravans cost more BECAUSE they PRIDE themselves in their products . They really are `` Easy Ups '' ... you slightly open the tent , crawl inside and PUSH UP on the center support and the unit `` snaps '' right in place ... versus the Marketplace which requires 2 people to set up or find something to put the leg on while you pull the opposite direction ... which causes the arms to ` snap ' ... joy ... duct tape anyone ? Go and buy a caravan ... seriously ... Customer service ... less than no star ... think negative numbersProduct ... 2 stars is too much * however , it does provide shade so hence the 2 stars ... * Life expectancy ... 2 months of constant use * which in MY case is every Sunday . . that 's it ... 1 x week ... for 9 hours ... Worth the money ... NOUpgrade to Caravan . . YES!Those are my thoughts ...
 It was May 3rd that I first got the opportunity to use the Bravo 10x10 marketplace canopy . It was at the New England Regional Chili Cook Off in Somer 's , CT. . When attempting to erect this canopy a small dent/ding was detected in one of the legs . This did not seem to effect the raising of the legs . However , as we attempted to raise the roof section one of the roof arms seemed to want to go in an odd direction . As we slowly attempted to continue the support arm continued to bend . We stopped and attempted to very gently straight the arm . The arm instantly broke due to the super thin tube aluminum design . Fortunately we found another chili team that had a roll of duct tape . We were able to make a temporary field repair to get us through the day . We have more experience erecting easy open canopies than any of us want to admit too . This extremely thin wall aluminum tubing use in the making of this produce seems to be a design flaw . I am hoping that I can get a replacement arm or figure a way to repair it . Because of the poor quality I would most definitely NOT recommend this produce . About the best thing that can be said is it is a pretty shade of blue ... ! A very dissatisfied customer .
 This thing is a piece of junk . Not knowing anything about yoga mats , I made the mistake of being lazy and grabbing this at the local sporting goods store figuring all mats are created equal . It began falling apart after 3 uses ! Chunks of it are coming out and it 's basically disintegrating after each use .
 Even after wiping down the mat , it is hard to work on because it is so slippery . After 3-4 classes , the mat is wearing down and has holes in places . I got this as a gift and will be upgrading to a higher quality mat as I am an advanced yogi .

 I use Rocky Mountain Ironhead 100gr broadheads and they do not fit in this box . They are too short to reach the support stands so this box is worthless to me . I even tried screwing inserts on to the broadheads to add some length and they still dont reach . The distance between the support stands is exactly 2-1/16 '' so if your broadhead is n't LONGER than that you will be in the same boat . Also , the support for the front of the broadhead is the same design as the one for the back of the broadhead which I guess isnt a problem as long as the tip of your broadhead is round just like the back part that screws into your insert . Of course the front of my broadhead is a blade which is anything but round so there is no way its going to stay inside the support . I have posted a closeup picture of the supports so you can decide for yourself if it will work in your circumstance . Also , I was not impressed by the box itself . The clip on the front is a basic friction fit where the latch snaps over a ridge to hold it shut . There is no proper hinge on the box . If it just plastic that flexes and you know what happens to plastic after you bend it back and forth a while -- especially if its cold !
 A week ago , an order was placed . The item still has n't been shipped out . This item gets a bad review , because the processing company has n't shipped item , Tempress 6 '' Desk Place . Perhaps I should get a ` Backordered ' or some notification .

 They developed holes way too quickly.Don ' t bother.Nice red though .
 I have purchased online through Fogdog in the past ; however , the description on Amazon is incorrect . This is NOT a 3 pair pack , it is only one pair of socks for $ 13.99 plus shipping . What a rip-off . I am deeply disappointed.Pro Feet Mens Acrylic Multi-Sport Tube Sock - 3 Pair Pack

 I wanted to review this set as I have the same issues as the other 1 star reviewer . Since the rods screw together there is a sharp edge where the three rods come together . I can hear and feel it scrape along the inside of the barrel and it comes out with fine aluminum shavings . At least the rod is soft aluminum but it still ca n't be good . Also , you ca n't go in only one direction -LRB- breech to muzzle as recommended -RRB- so you end up really just pushing stuff inside the barrel back and forth . I wasted my money so you do n't have to . Going to buy a snake style kit now . In the youtube video by Ruger showing how to clean a 10/22 the guy uses a snake .
 I did my first cleaning on my new Ruger 10 22 Rifle on 01-02-2012 . I do n't want to use the aluminum rods anymore ... they are scraping against the barrel and leaving aluminum shavings behind . I 'm going for a boresnake instead . Where are the instructions for the plastic adapter components ? What is the purpose of these adapters ? Also , where is the brush that will allow me to clean the other components ? I would not recommend this kit to anyone ... pay the extra money and get a good set .
 I hate these sunglasses . They do not fit well at all and hurt your ears .

 I bought this item . I packaged my firearm in it . I checked the firearm case with the airline . I flew from Oahu , Hawaii , to Texas . Simple right ? When I went to claim my baggage , the case was in TWO PIECES ! One of the sides , that are held on by a VERY cheap adhesive , had come almost all of the way off . It was being held on by a very small amount of adhesive . The foam of inside of the case was exposed . If someone wanted to take my firearm , they could have with ease . The case is a very cheap price for a reason , my advice is do not purchase it , unless you want a product that will break from using it only once , on an airline .

 I was looking for a taillight that would mount to my carrier . The Cateye TL-LD500-R was advertised as being carrier ready . It was not . The screw to mount it to the carrier was at least 1/4 inch too long and the mounting materials did not come with washers or some other way to fill the gap . I ended up putting the light on my saddle post ; however , if I wear a long coat or put my briefcase on the carrier , the light will be hidden . Furthermore , if I had intended to mount it on the saddle post , I would have bought the much brighter Planet Bike taillight .
 Firstly , the light is bright and uses the easier-to-find-and-replace AAA batteries . But ` replace ' is the operative word here . The very exposed and touchy power button was an awful idea . I ca n't tell you how many times I 've opened my backpack or duffel bag to find my gear illuminated with a creepy red glow . A slider or switch would have been much simpler . Other than that it 's a really good light , but the backpack-bump-parity-counting feature is unnecessary and frustrating .

 So-So packaging - arrived with slight damage . Combination locks did n't work - the locks are made VERY poorly considering the price .
 The case itself is sturdy and does what it is designed for . However , the locks on this case are cheaply made and leave much to be desired . Too bad , with better locks this would be a 5 star case .

 Cheap price but you get what you pay for.Brakes are the antique caliper style that can be upgraded to side pull cantilevers with a little work.Gears are generic gripshifter style but nothing close to the Shimano 105 standard.Bike is all aluminium and is quite heavy.Also the front cogs are small , good for hill climbing but not great on the flats.The handlebars ca n't be raised any higher also . They are fixed.I would not buy this bike if you are taking road biking seriously but it 's OK for a cheap introduction to the sport before you get serious and upgrade with a new bike !
 Pros : - It 's an inexpensive bike to buy new , so it 's great if you 're a student on a budget who gets an Amazon gift certificate.Cons : - The build quality of the bike is shoddy.-The placement of the gear shifters is awkward.-The gears do n't shift well ; the chain falls off easily.-The teeth of the gears are n't very strong ; I 've had the bike three months and some of the teeth are completely worn down.-The wheels are n't strong ; last week I bent the front wheel so the bike is now wobbly.Bottom line
 I bought this bike as a beginning road cyclist that cycled as a form of transportation . This bike has been little more than trouble for me since I received it . At first , I was excited that the bike was quicker and rode more smoothly than the moutain bike I was used to . However , After about a month 's worth of use , it started giving me problems . At first , I noticed that the numbers on the gear shifters did not match up with the actual gears . I was able to deal with this by making a mental note that if I put the shifter for my large gear halfway between one and two , I would be on the second gear , whereas if I put the shifter on `` 2 '' , I would be in 3rd gear . However , it only got worse.The tires do little to protect the tubes within them . I had a flat tube within two weeks of use . I can understand that things like that happen from time to time , but it only got worse . Now , two months later , I have gone through three different tubes.I have also had problems with the wheels . Last week two of my spokes began to fall off . Then , I found today that my wheel has started to bend . After two months of use , I already have a bent wheel . The structure of the wheels is so weak that they do n't do much prevent bends and warps . I would say that if you are going to buy a road bike , you should pay a little extra and not get a bike made by a car company that probably just wants you to drive in a car in the first place . I will never buy a bike from a dealer that is not a reputable dealer again .
 I have had 7 spokes break , replacing them as they break and checking to make sure they were all fine before rides and yet they still broke . Its cheap , looks good , but the quality of bike is horrid . I bought it because i liked the look and it was cheap and not i wish i would have spent a lot more and gotten a good name brand , i recommend you do the same . The paint starts to chip after awhile too and you need a tune-up literally every month ... which would make it more expensive that a good name brand in the long run . hope you read this before you buy .

 I got it for my 7 year-old as a Christmas gift -LRB- from Santa ! -RRB- She was so excited when she opened the package , and went to play in the snow.When she tried to make a ball for the first time , the scooper broke!It broke into two pieces . The plastic just broke at the center where the pieces meet.Unbelievalbly poor make.I can not recommend this product .
 I 'm disappointed to report that the handle snapped in half at the pin upon attempting to make the very first snowball . I 'd send it back , but I have a feeling that it would cost more to ship it back than I paid for it . So , at least that 's the upside . I 'm not out that much money . It was a huge disappointment though since my son had been looking forward to using it ever since I got it for him .
 The website says that the product is a `` Flexible Flyer Snowball Maker . '' What I received was some off-brand that was a similar product , but did not have the hand grips that the Flexible Flyer has , and the grips -LRB- and the quality brand -RRB- were the reason I was willing to pay more to order these products . I would NOT order from this company again because they made a product substitution without asking if that was acceptable to me .
 Makes great snowballs , but broke after a half hour of use , right where the screw is . Very disappointing . I thought maybe it was bad luck and I would just replace it since it does n't cost much , but I looked at the second one I bought and noticed it looked stressed too . I supposed if you do n't apply too much pressure it will last a long time but try telling a 4 and 7 year old that .
 Item was cute , but within the plastic wrap , the item had scratches and smelled like a smoker . not sure why .

 This product was designed well and would have been exactly what I needed . UNFORTUNATELY , It was shipped already damaged from Amazon . This was not damaged during shipping , but BEFORE it was packed . I can not believe that someone would pack this away in this condition . It was the last one that they had in that model ... I wonder why?But , Amazon did make good by issuing a full refund promptly and sent me my second choice from Plano , a different manufacturer . I wish the first one was n't broken . It would have better served my needs as I do n't really like the new one .
 This item is way to heavy with nothing in it . It is very large as well . If loaded to capacity , would be difficult to move . Sending back .
 This item was purchased for my seven year-old grandson with the purpose of encouraging him to hang up his clothes daily . Unfortunately the clothes rack fell over almost immediately after assembly and was broken rendering it unusable . I do n't know what the problem was but suspect that the top team emblem is too heavy for the slender rack to support . A cute idea that did not work!MargaretFan of the San Diego Padres
 I purchased this bag for use during the 2010 Baseball season . Within 3 weeks , the seams started showing wear & coming unsewn . I contacted Easton & was told they would replace it since I was one day outside of the Amazon return window . Long story short , I ended up having a `` courtesy refund '' issued by Amazon . Easton & Amazon both had me going in circles from one to the other . Thankfully though , Amazon at least came through & refunded my money on this bag . The hard plastic bottom did great -LRB- was our main selling feature -RRB- , but the material itself was no better than any other bat bag we 've purchased . In fact , it lasted less time than any previously purchased brand of bag . Huge disappointment .
 zipper stitching is very bad , first bag I return because it was already borken , I used it once and the zipper came off from the bag , the stitching part , asked for a replace and the new bag was the same thing , I dont have time to send back the second one , cuz I need it , so I used duck tape to join the zipper to the bag , I hope this make it fine in the airport . other than that great quality and desing , Easton just miss in this little but big mistake .

 Bought this as a Christmas present for my 7 yr old son . Less than 2 months after purchase , the thing broke in half !

I purchased softer bushings -LRB- $ 8.00 -RRB- for my 40 lb . son and the board turned much easier . The board was shipped to me missing a part for one of the trucks . I have not heard back from the seller so I stole the part from an older board -LRB- bummer if you do n't have one -RRB- .
 Everybody seems to be happy with it , but i am not . The lower display line -LRB- with the distance -RRB- is too hard to read -LRB- think of riding in rain or in darkness , or of people with impaired vision -RRB- ; that 's a major drawback when following a route sheet and depending on the precise distances . And the worst
 The box was missing a part -LRB- the mount to attach the computer to the handle bar -RRB- . I improvised something , but the computer quit working after 10 days . Try some other brand is my advice .
 I have , or rather had , two different Cateye strada bike computers . One was on my commuting bike , the other on my for-fun road bike . I bought them at separate times and both experienced the same problem . Rain made them highly unreliable . They would stop working in the rain and would work intermittently for several days after getting rained on . It was very frustrating for me . Additionally , they were unreliable in temperatures below 30F . I 've since replaced these computers with a similarly priced computer by PlanetBike.I strongly recommend against purchasing the Cateye Strada . It just is n't a robust bike accessory .
 I bought this a few months ago and have been pretty happy with it . I guess ignorance is bliss . I have recently noticed that the speed goes to zero some times . I 'm not sure how often this happens , but it is enough for me to lose faith in this product.Today , I drove past my turn around last week . Last week , the odometer said 8.90 miles ; this week it said 9.3 miles . There were some `` zeroed out '' times last week , I guess I just did n't realize how much.I do n't look down at it that often , but it is disconcerting to be going 15 mph one moment and zero the next - at least according to the speedometer.Today , it cut out again . 10.24 miles out . 10.08 back on the same route . I know it cut out on the way back ; it might have cut out on the way out as well.The route time was off as well ... Updated 8/7/11
 I 've had two of these . The first one worked good for about 2 months . Then the speedometer would start to go to zero , then would start reading after you 'd press on the face several times . Since the first one was so new , i just returned it and got another . The second has lasted two years and it has started doing the exact same thing . I replaced the battery , placed the magnet super close to the pickup -LRB- now it hits when I pedal hard -RRB- reset everything , checked the wires , nothing has helped . I 've talked to others who have not had this problem . Surely this has happened to others . Buyer beware .
 I know that this product has its positives but personally , I really did not like this cyclocomputer . First and foremost , the wire that connects the device to the sensor on the fork snapped from the device almost immediately and the sensor itself was far below what I expected from a device with such good reviews . That 's the other thing , when I bought this , the page did not explicitly say -LRB- or I could n't find where -RRB- if the device was wireless or not . That 's a pretty important feature ... Maybe there are a couple bad apples in every bunch - I ended up spending a bit more after this one broke -LRB- c'est la vie -RRB- and buying the wireless one - but I 'd have to say wired products on a bicycle is more things looking to be broken and/or tangled up.As a cyclist who carries a lot on his bike - I 'm currently going to university - I carry a lot on my bike and it is imperative that I not have more on there than I need . As it is , my backpack is quite heavy and my route is 17 miles round trip . So , a waste of 30 dollars but I did find an alternative .
 I have had a Cateye before and they seem to be pretty accurate . I bought this one to replace a Schwinn with a bad cable . I ran into the same problems that others reported with the reset button . It is very frustrating and the instructions are a little vague.I bought it from Nashbar so it will not be going back . I will probably buy a Schwinn next time . They are much easier to reset and change the wheel size . The link to the Velo 8 manual is here :[ ... -RSB-
 I have a Sigma on the other bike and wish that a second Sigma hadbeen my choice this time ... Cat Eye is OK , but the reset is a small buttonon the rear side that has to be pushed in with a pin , and then it getsstuck under the case and you have to pry it loose ... would NOT buy another.Did install easily .
 I 'm so disappointed in this item . The instructions are horrible . You 're left to guess between miniscule letters and bad diagrams exactly what to do . Even if you do work it out , reset is a joke . You have to take the unit off the holder , find a small pin to push in the button and then good luck . My unit wo n't allow me to switch to miles . Yes , I can convert in my head , but that 's not the point . I WANT MILES.Save your money and find a better unit .
 Cateye CC-VL810 Velo 8-Function Bicycle ComputerThe instalation manual is rather pathetic ! Basicaly just pictures . The set up on changing to MPH from KPH did ` nt work . Skipped that , did not know how to set tire size . That info buried down further in the scant instructions . So , one can not set up the product by A then B and finally C.Whatever , the information is enough to enable one to attach the computer to ones bike . It took me about twenty minutes . Took the bike for a ride and every thing seemed OK . Except the readings were in Kilometers . Removed computer from setting and tried once more to set to MPH . Follwed instructions and got a screen not mentioned in instructions . Removed battery and waited 10 minutes thinking computer would reset . No way , that did ` nt work . Same old garbage screen . Back to Amazon.From now on before buying anything I intend to go to the manufactures web site and view the installation manual and if i am not happy with it I will not purchase .
 The product description on Amazon did not include how complicated the set up is for this item . To make matters worse the directions are illustrated but not described step by step . Did n't have the patience so back it went .
 it works . period . but it is like wearing a plastic bag ... no breathing at all . You get very sweaty when it is closed up ... it is only good for heavy rain protection , but nothing else . Better to spend a few more dollars and get a material that is both waterproof and breathes .
 The good thing about this parka ? It is waterproof . Do n't buy this parka if you plan to active . It does not breathe and it retains moisture . Sizing is not true to size . Buy one size smaller if you are still considering a purchase .
 This rain jacket is not breathable . They say it is because they have two small holes under something on the front of the jacket . Right where my backpack shoulder straps go . I think you would stay drier without the jacket in the rain . I put it on and I was drenched inside . This is a jacket you throw on if your running to the store . Absolutely not for any serious outdoor activity like hiking .
 This item was purchased for my seven year-old grandson with the purpose of encouraging him to hang up his clothes daily . Unfortunately the clothes rack fell over almost immediately after assembly and was broken rendering it unusable . I do n't know what the problem was but suspect that the top team emblem is too heavy for the slender rack to support . A cute idea that did not work!MargaretFan of the San Diego Padres
 When I saw that Amazon carried my favorite breeches , I jumped in and ordered 4 pairs . I love the Sigma cotton breeches with a zipper pocket . But , what I received was Tuffrider Pull On breeches with no zipper pocket , in light weight fabric -LRB- I hate pull on breeches ! -RRB- When I called Equestrian Collection to inform them that I had not received what I ordered , the person just kept going around in circles telling me this is what I ordered . I 'm sending them a copy of the Amazon page to show them what I ordered ...

 BOUGHT THIS TO REPLACE A 15 YEAR OLD SEARS CHARGER THAT I USED TO CHARGE MY BASS BOAT BATTERIES . IT WORKED FINE FOR ABOUT TWO MONTHS AND THEN DIED . DID N'T WANT TO TAKE A CHANCE ON A SECOND ONE SO I PURCHASED SCHUMACHER SHIP N SHORE . I 'VE HAD MINN KOTA TROLLING MOTORS IN THE PAST THAT WORKED JUST FINE SO I WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN THIS CHARGER DIED SO QUICKLY .
 I bought this charger from Amazon thinking this had the capacity to charge two different batteries simultaneously -LRB- based upon the product photo -RRB- . The actual MK-105P has only one set of clamps and can only charge one battery . Amazon made a `` mistake '' by substituting a picture of a different model . Now I have to send it back . Not to sound paranoid , but this is the second time this has happened to me in three weeks with trying to buy boat items from Amazon . I 'm going to my local marine store from now on , as the price difference is n't significant once you factor in the shipping from Amazon . Sloppy work Amazon ...

 I just spent a half an hour trying to figure out how to set the wheel size . The instructions included with the product are no help whatsoever ... how do you do it ? I have no idea . Useless .
 The functions seemed very nice . Too bad the instructions are just the opposite . The instructions are printed on onionskin paper - thin , like toilet paper , and in teeny 2-point typeface . Very hard to read ! Also , the text is minimal , as the manufacturer chose to use illustrations instead , somewhat like an inexpensive plastic model airplane . If you want one , take your time studying the instructions and do n't expect installation to be intuitive or quick . Now the bad news . I was pleased at the way it worked for a year , until it failed . No , a new battery did n't help . I will replace it with a Sigma .
 The clock was difficult for me to get out of military time . In fact , I never figured it out . The little button that you push to set the clock broke when I pushed it in . I had a second odomoter that I attempted to set the time with and still could not figure it out . Also , the odometer attaches to the bike with sticky adhesive . The adhesive came off in the first five minutes . I ended up returning this item , both I had ordered . It was not worth the hassle !
 The instruction is very lousy . In order to set a selection , one has to use a pin to poke into a small hole at the back of the unit . And please be very careful , if you poke a bit hard you will destroy the little rubber reset button -LRB- and no where in the instruction one can find such a warning -RRB- . My boy -LRB- 15 -RRB- destroyed the unit in the first attempt , and I help him to install the second unit , that we exchanged from the store . I gave it one star .
 yeah it works . Yes it 's easy to install.But it does n't tell you much . No ride time , no average speed.If you do any type of tracking for training or fitness , spend more and get more .
 bought one of these at a local bicycle shop . it stoped worked after the third ride on bicycle . this product is nothing but crap ! do not waist you money on this trash it will stop working after only a few rides .
 This product certainly did not work out for me . It is complicated and the tiny hole on the back , where one needs to insert an ink pen for the settings , broke when I inserted a pen . Actually , it seemed like a piece of rubber that broke apart . I had to return it .
 I 've ordered two CC-VL510 Velo 5 Bicycle Computer and one came without sensors and cables , so it is useless . AMAZON dso n't geve me choices regarding partially refund for missing parts inside an order . I 've placed several ordes with AMAZON and this is the first time this kind of problem happens .
 Hi -- I have a few Cateye products that work fine . I got the Velo 5 and quickly noticed that there was no real mounting bracket supplied with mine . The instructions showed one , but mine just had an adhesive pad -- that 's it.I contact Cateye customer service , sent a polite email , and received no response . It was pretty disappointing to not hear from them since this probably could have been fixed pretty easily . I would urge you to seek a different company .
 I work in production and we 're required to wear boots with safety toes and met protectors . Wearing these boots that weigh four pounds each is exhausting when you 're on your feet all day at work . These boots protect your feet well , but I was never so glad as when the year with these boots was up and the company would reimburse me for buying another pair and I bought the lightest weight HyTest brand boots I could find . Work is exhausting enough without your boots sapping you further .
 My CatEye Enduro 8 was stolen along with my bike a couple of weeks ago . I have just spent the past hour trying to figure out how to program the same model of computer , thinking that I must have been drinking way too much the past year and a half , if I ca n't figure out how to program this thing , even with instructions . Fortunately for me , I found the instructions that I got 2 years ago with my original computer . It actually tells you how to set the computer to count miles instead of kilometers . So if you are frustrated by the new directions , try clearing the computer by pushing the Mode , Start/Stop , and Set buttons all at the same time . This is when you select your measurement unit , by pushing the Mode button . If you want to input the reading of the currently used odometer , keep pressing the Mode button for two seconds and input the reading . If you want to start the odometer from zero , push the Start/Stop button . Why did they change their directions ? I , too , was ready to take the Enduro 8 back to the bike shop and have them install it for me , for $ 20 . Could this be the motivation for the terrible new instructions ? I hope not .
 Like many cyclists we use a rear wheel bicycle trainer extensively when the winter weather makes training outdoors dangerous . When we were researching cyclometers we looked for any information that stated `` For front wheel use only '' ; or , `` Does not fit for rear wheel '' . We even went to the Cateye website and looked at their chart to see if there was any information or category stating `` front wheel only '' for the Enduro 8 . Only after doing this research did we then order the Enduro . GUESS WHAT !! The wire length is too short for a rear wheel setup on a standard size bicycle . Thus useless for a rear wheel trainer -LRB- unless you have a minibike -RRB- . Rating of 2 stars is for not providing crucial information for prospective buyers . Update March 28 2007 . Cateye was prompt and helpful with my problem . I ordered their extra long kit -LRB- more money of course -RRB- . The Enduro works just fine . I 've upgraded the rating to 3 stars .
 PROs : The unit - simple . This is a good thing because too often we find ourselves with a technological marvel and we do not even come close to use all of a devices options.The pickup wire is more than long enough for my bike -LRB- 2011 Specialized Sport Disk 29 ` er -RRB- . The wire , pickup , and unit mount is very secure and well built - not overly cheap plastic.CONs : In the instructions , it says the magnet has to be mounted with 5mm of the pickup device . First - what is 5mm in regular measurements ? I checked online and it says it has to be mounted within 3/16 of an inch . Much of the American bike industry centers around a mountain bike configuration . The closest I could mount the pick up to the spoke magnet was 1/2 '' - more than twice the minimum distance required . I think that road bike forks are closer to the wheel spokes.Second , it advertised a 24 hour time format - not entirely true . While it does support a 24 hour clock , this function is only available using European measuring -LRB- metric -RRB- . If you use regular measurements , the 12 hour clock is your only option.The instruction alludes to a specific measurement between the axle hub and the pick up device . This specific measurement is no where within the instructions . Typical of a European marketed device , the instructions have vague pictures - no setup text so you will have to decipher the almost hieroglyphic quality of the installation instructions.The screen is incredibly tiny . My blackberry has a screen twice the size of the display on the unit . And my Blackberry is not 3 feet away from my face when I am using it . Nor do I try to read my Blackberry while going over rough terrain . * I can only guess that this would be true because I was unable to take it out on a ride because the setup does not take into account a 29 '' wheel . The instructions did actually have a conversion table from European to American measurements - so if you have a 26 '' wheel , you would be able to set the unit to your tires via the chart .
 It came with a dead battery , I got a fresh one , it checks at 3v with a DC voltmeter , but only parts of the digits turn on . Since I am in the Philippines now , returning it is economically impossible . BUT I can get some satisfaction by removing the battery and smashing the computer with a hammer !!!
 Do n't bother buying this ! Mine failed to work after 2 weeks . Definitely buy something else !

 This Seller 's images lie!They provide only white , black , heather grey , and oatmeal colored socks .
 I reviewed this item a while ago and was very pleased with this product , but ... . These socks are not cheap -LRB- price wise -RRB- but I wanted the quality so I pay . I ordered the `` deluxe '' slouch sock so I would get the thicker ones that do not wear out or get holes after a few months . I got the same ones that were being sold as a cheaper version , are very thin and not as good . So basically I got ripped off . Last order for you Barry .
 I bought this camera as it said `` Action Cam '' in its title/description . My original intent was to mount it on my motorcycle or car . As my first attempt , I mounted it on my car -LRB- stable compared to motorcycle -RRB- with full resolution and 30fps option . Here is what came out :1 . Choppy video . Unacceptable for something thats named as Action Cam . All the `` action '' is missing from the video . My 3-yr old $ 100 Canon Digital Still Cam shot a similar looking video , if not better .2 . The video was way too bright .3 . I did n't expect the mic to work , and I was more than right . Its just static `` action '' noise.I did try mounting on motorcycle , the video looked like flushing a 100-dollar bill down the toilet.If you 're looking for a decent action/helmet camera , get the Sony Bullet Cam with DVR for a $ 100 more than wasting your money on this.This might be a good toy for the kids to mount on their R/C cars -LRB- thats where mine ended up -RRB- . The packaging looked good with all the `` action '' pictures on it . The built is sturdy and comes with good mounting accessories . Thats where the `` action cam '' feel ends.Hope I saved someones $ $ $ .
 I wish I could give better feedback for this camera , but the one I bought stopped working after just a few months . A year or so later I tried it again and it seemed to be functioning , but when I tried to recover the video it was empty and never turned on again . I wish I could recommend this , but it seems like it was just a waste of money .
 This is my second Oregon Camera . First 2 were the ATC1000 -LRB- their first camera -RRB- . I have used those 2 cameras for many years on my motorcycles -LRB- Honda ST1100 and ST1300 -RRB- ... I mean ... for almost 3 years . Now I decided to upgrade and went for the ATC2K , but I notice that this camera does a lot of wobble ... a lot!I have the same bike ... the same mounted place ... I ride the same roads , but the footage I get for this new camera is horrible ... not worthed to watch or edit ... What happened ? ... is this an error or broken camera or you Oregon Scientific guys did n't improve your product?Their advertise that this is a `` play hard , record everythig '' camera , but I ca n't imagine doing any of the sports they mention if a simple riding my touring bike is not working well.They used to have a great product with the ATC1000 ... but this one is ready to go to the trash can .
 I received this camera as a merit prize from work . Since I got it it has been nothing but frustrating . After creating a short test video , the camera now shows there is no time left even when I delete all the files . I am unable to take any movies . I called tech support twice and they were not able to help . They offered for me to ship the camera back at my own expense and then replace it . I am not even sure if it is worth it since the gift was supposed to be free to begin with . I have a flip and a Sony cam corder and never have problems with them . My experience with this product and company have been negative every step of the way . I believe the quality is extremely poor , and the customer service was poor and their polices were not fair . I would not recommend buying this or any other product from Oregon Scientific .
 I recently purchased this camera on a whim -LRB- called a 1 day sale at Amazon for $ 50 -RRB- , not with super high expectations , given the price ; however , it 's going back to Amazon.I went to the beach yesterday with it . The day was a nice and bright sunny day in Galveston , TX . I set the video to the highest quality
 I wish I would have listened to a few of the reviews that said to save up for a better option . This thing is REALLY bad in low lighting . The videos I have in low lighting are very pixelated and not even worth while . And when I say low lighting , I mean not a super sunny clear day . If it 's as dark as a lit room of your house you will not get quality shots . I have yet to use this on a nice sunny day , but so far I 'm a bit disappointed . I could n't imagine using it for trail riding going from light to dark . I realize it was only $ 90 or so , but it 's still very worth while to save up and spend an extra chunk of cash.The only redeeming qualities of this thing is that it seems to stand up to shocks decently .
 Decent price . OTOH what you get is a USB1 .1 device . It is not quite easy to find how to attach it to bike helmet and get the right picture that is focus to your way and make it fixed so it is not weaving all the time . Usability of controls is not very exciting too.You can take some videos with this and learn what you will expect from your next camera .
 THIS CAM IS A GREAT IDEA , BUT IT 's FRAMES PER SECOND ARE TO SLOW . THE VIDEO STOPS AND GOES WAY TO MUCH . I HAVE TRIED THE 30 FRAMES PER SECOND AND ALSO THE FIFTEEN FPS . NOTHING SEEMS TO HELP . I WOULD NOT BUY THIS AGAIN AND WOULD PAY MORE FOR BETTER QUALITY .
 I bought this because I have been looking for a water resistant video camera and was n't finding one on my budget . For a camera under $ 100 this would be fairly good except for the fact that it does not have a lense to look thru or a screen to show what you are taping.If you want it to mount on your helmet or car and just let it shoot whatever happens then is a good choice . I has good audio and video quality with enough light and is easy to use.However , if like me , you would like to capture specific situations , like friends surfing for example , good luck getting the picture in the frame with absolutely no guidance from this camera .
 For the price -LRB- about $ 80 -RRB- the video quality is okay . With a 2GB SD card which you can get for less than $ 20 you get 1 hour of video at 640x480 and 30fps , or over 3 hours of video at the next lower resolution at 15 FPS . Video was not as smooth as I expected but still ok for the price . However , the sound is horrible . You can barely hear conversations at normal speaking levels . Yet it picks up every little noise when something touches the camera . It appears that they put the mic inside the sealed case so that it only picks up loud sounds from outside the case . If you need to have sound in your videos , such as people talking , forget about using this camera . I am returning mine . I probably would have kept it if the sound quality was better . The LCD menu screen is hard to see and not intuitive to use . Fortunately , once you have it all set up you do n't need to navigate very often throught the hard to see miniature icons behind the thick plastic window that distorts the little icons behind it . Finally , it seems like they could have designed the unit a bit smaller . It is also on the bulky side . The camera itself is about 6 1/2 ounces . It would not have taken very much effort to have made this into a great action camera but the engineers at Oregon Scientific do n't seem to have what it takes to figure that out . On the plus side , it does seem to be pretty rugged , and if you need a camera for action videos where you anticipate the camera to get wet and banged around , this may be fine for you . But remember that the sound will be very muffled and voices hard to hear and video quality is not comparable to a standard video camera or even the video quality you get on many of the newer standard digital photos cameras . But thise cameras typically are not rugged or waterproof . So bottom line is I would only recommend this camera where extreme conditions are anticipated and sound quality is not important .
 I would not recommend this camera based on several design flaws :1 -RRB- The picture quality is very grainy , and at the highest resolution settings and in bright sunlight it gets no better . It also does not record 30 fps at the 30 fps setting , but something more like 20 fps .2 -RRB- The lens angle is a medium length focal length , which means that you will not capture much of the scene but rather a narrow view , which , as it is a longer focal length will be quite jumpy even with slight camera movement .3 -RRB- The biggest issue ... the camera 's SD card slot has no way of securing the SD card , so with moderate vibration such as on a bicycle or motorcycl handlebar , the SD card will shake out of its slot resulting in the camera stopping its recording.I like the idea of the camera , and its design seems very rugged . The incuded mounts are also very thorough . I 'm returning the camera and will look towards something else - completely dissatisfied in the ATC2K .
 I have owned this camera for over a year now and will stop using it from now on . The poor video quality is just not worth the time and effort . At first I thought it would be good enough for YouTube but the bad quality video you shot to begin with then gets reduced further by YouTube making the end result simply terrible . The camera deals especially bad in darker , poor lit places , such as riding your bike in and out of tree shadows.The sound is completely unusable , just walking with it will sound like you 're in the middle of a tornado.The only good thing I can say about this action cam is the amount of ways you can attach this camera to whatever it is you 're into . It comes with a load of straps and mounts . BUT for an action cam I 'm now looking elsewhere .
 I bought this to strap on mike bike and motorcycle . It worked OK but after a couple of motorcycle rides the sound went out . Too much vibration maybe ? Now I ca n't even get it to turn on . Not very durable and not worth the money for the amount of use I got from it .
 I buy one for use in the practice of MTB , but I lost my money , the video is bad , and the audio also is bad . I put it in the trash .
 The only good thing about this camra is the video quality . for 80 dollars it actuly has decent image quality . the sound is horable . when the camra is sitting still you ca n't hear your self talking if your more than a foot or two away from it . but even when you are close upto it , it sounds like you whispering . when the camra is moving it make this really loud noise on the video that amlost sound like something grinding . i have use this camra on my mountainbike , mopeds , and even my Jeep , and it makes the same noise . also this camra eats up batteries like it noones buisness . if the battery gets low it will cut off and if you were recoding when it cuts off you lose the whole file , it dos n't just stop recoarding . overall this camra is not worth 80 $ in fact i probly would be skeptible about buying it if it was for only 20 $ . Do n't buy this or the tony hawk cam , if you really want a decent hemlet cam just save you money and buy a real one , you 'll be disapointed if you buy this
 Hard to use and seller did not include the cords . Do not like it much .
 Have not received product due to company and DHL error . Have not received any response to the explinations sent . Now Amazon and company are threatening to charge for shipping and restocking fee for items not received . Still not resolved and it is more than 1 month later .
 Who would n't love a camcorder that is small , durable and shoots good quality video ? Unfortunately the ATC 2K is not the solution . Checkout the videos on YouTube that were made with the ATC 2K before you buy it -LRB- search atc 2k -RRB- . It seems to work OK when there is minimal movement but when the camera is moving the video is very grainy and jumpy . I found the following mountain biking video -LSB- ... -RSB- be particularly useful since it looks like the photographer did everything correctly , yet the quality is still poor.Kudos to Oregon Scientific for the idea . Keep working on it .
 I had this little DVR mounted on my left handlebar for a 2-week , 4000 mile bike trip from Tennessee to New England and back , and came home with about 20 hours of nice video , which I was able to edit in iMovie on my Mac . I ca n't believe the value of this thing !
 The quality is what you 'd expect from something of this caliber . It does feel solid and tough but the mounting is a pain in the neck and very limited . When mounted on my helmet when I go mountain biking , all I can see are trees . The angle is difficult to correct due to its very limited mounting options . One time , I took it with me rafting and all I could gather from the video was our very happy voices and the clear blue sky . If I showed it to anyone , they would think I was in my backyard playing and splashing happily with the garden hose.Also when you 're on a shaky run , the video looks liquidy and fluid . And since it does n't have any high tech features such as stabilized optics , most of the clips come out useless . Right now , I just have it sitting in my drawer . The two stars are for its solid build and cheap price . But I could do this over again , I would have spent a few extra bucks and bought a shock proof point and shoot camera that 's also waterproof . The menus would be easier to navigate and as for mounting , all I have to do is buy a bendy tripod and zip tie it to my helmet .
 Beware , you 're limited to only 2 gig cards , which will probably be enough for most people . Also , the image/sound quality stinks . Objects like trees will be total silhouettes , while tints and tones will usually be overdone . If you 're black , or dark skinned , you 'll also be a silhouette ; if you 're white , you 're going to be white ... literally . There do n't seem to be any midrange scales to this camera . Underwater shots can be creative , but , like I said , image is crappy , contrast is crappy and sound is crappy . It 's a good toy for kids and a mediocre way to take videos from your bike or helmet . Do n't expect much out of it . Look on YouTube for video results .
 I could n't get it to work right out of the box . Tried different sets of new battaries and outside of a brief flicker in the menu screen , nothing . The camera looked substantial and would have been perfect for what I wanted it for ... to mount on a boat grab rail ... but since it did n't work right out of the box I sent it back.Maybe I just got a bad one . All of them ca n't be non functional right out of the box . At least Amazon was quick in taking it back and crediting my account .
 No video stabilization . That means all of your videos come out shaky ... very very shaky . I tried this Snowboarding and it was completely useless . I 'm guessing it would n't be any better mounted on a bike or an ATV.Also , the max card you can use is 2gb . MAKE SURE YOU PURCHASE 2GB IF YOU BUY THIS CAMERA -LRB- I bought 4 4gb cards that were useless -RRB- . This also means that the max recording time is 1 hour at the cameras maximum resolution , which is about VHS quality.I will probably end up using this to perform elaborate pranks on my co-workers by mounting it on their cube . I ca n't really see much else of a use for it.Go buy a camcorder and mount it to your helmet with duct tape , you 'll have better results .
 The resolution of this `` camera '' is so poor as to relagate it to the statis of a kid 's toy . Granted , it 's cheap , waterproof , and nearly immune to shock . Usable videos ? Only a distant `` sort of '' ... and that 's IF you 're sufficiently skilled to actually get it pointed at that which you wish to capture . No view finder = take a guess .
 i used this to record my trackdays on my motorcycle . It 's biggest negative is it has this splitting effect on the video . Even with the pad on the back the battery cover would jar loose and next thing you know it shuts down and loses what it recorded.I 'd say on 10 track sessions , i 'd have 1 , that 's right 1 video that was actually recorded.dont ' buy it , pay the extra $ and get the go pro .
 I got this camera as a gift from work . It has been nothing but frustrating since the time I got it . I was able to create one short test file with the camera and then from there it never worked again . Th camera shows I have no time remaining , but there are not files stored . All have been deleted . I called tech support several times but they could not resolve the problem . They offered for me to ship the product back to them at my expense and they would send me a new one . Since it was already free , I am not even sure if I have enough faith that the next camera they send me will work . I could not be more dissapointed with the camera or the company and would not recommend getting this camera or any other form this company . I have a flip and it works great much easier to use and more reliable .
 The sound on this helmet cam is not very good . The mic . picks up way too much of background noise . A small piece of tape on mic . helps a little , actually definitely worth the under $ 100 price tag , but would recommend waiting for ATC 3K .
 The video quality is decent and acceptable for $ 100 unit . The sound quality is worthless.However this review is n't about video or sound . Not many have posted on the technical aspect of importing video and this is the Camcorder 's biggest flaw.As a Macintosh user this camcorder is impossible to use once connected up properly , as it corrupts the Mini SD cards during data transfers.So I tried it on a PC . It worked , but in the end the SD Card ended up getting corrupted . At first it shot my 2 GB card to 1 GB , then proceeded to completely destroy it.I made a decent video with it , but ca n't keep up with the nasty habit it has of destroying expensive SD Cards . Not worth any price if you ca n't retrieve the data . ** NOTE
 This camera is cheap as far as PoV cameras go but it is for a reason . The video and sound quality are awful . The camera takes forever to adjust to various light conditions and even once adjusted is low quality . The reason that this product was not rated a 1 star was the quality of the build and the physical camera itself.It is tough and very waterproof with better buttons than the goPro and it is easier to tell when it is recording -LRB- loud beep -RRB- . It came with a nice case , and mounts although i did not like the mounts to much . The handlebar mount is the only one that i like because the helmet mounts do n't work whatsoever . Overall , i was disappointed with this camera and have just ordered a drift stealth . If you are going to buy a PoV camera , do n't buy this one . Buy a goPro , Contour , Drift or even the latest atc9k but Oregon Scientific 's first camera was a complete screw up . -LRB- written by a skier/mountain biker -RRB-
 They make great faux security cameras if you 're trying to keep folks away from your stuff.Other than that , they are complete crap . I 've got a bunch of helmet cameras , one of the original HelmetCamera -LRB- Sony CCD in aluminum mount that I connected to a Sony HCR40 -RRB- , a ChaseCam PDR100 , a no-name Chinese recorder , an ATC1K and two ATC2Ks.The displays are completely unreadable , even with bifocals and especially in bright sun . The icons are miniscule and make no sense . The button sequences are too long to memorize and the buttons themselves too vague to even know if you 've activated whatever it is you 're trying to activate.The first unit never worked right from when I first got it , but it would never fail in any one way consistently such that I could open a tech support incident . It would crash and freeze , simply stop recording , shut down for no apparent reason while navigating the frustrating menus , fail to respond to button presses until batteries removed and reinstalled and other variations on flakiness . I was never able to use it for more than ~ 10 minutes at a time.The second unit -LRB- I bought two based on a reviews ... sigh -RRB- records and generally is reliable but the video it records is n't worth keeping . It 's really bad , the colors are completely unnatural , there is some sort of slow rolling/tearing on the video that resembles what you see when you record a TV screen with a camcorder . The image is more distorted than anything I 've tried so far . They 're relatively heavy , they eat batteries pretty quickly , they ca n't be operated with gloves on.For my purposes -LRB- recording fairly aggressive dual-sport and off-road motorcycle rides -RRB- they were completely useless.The one good thing I 'll say about them - the mounts are really good . I mounted one on the crash bars on my BMW 1200GS Adventure and it withstood everything . I never had to worry about vibration , getting repeatedly whacked by sagebrush and vegetation or anything . It was a very good mount -LRB- until I dropped the 600 pound bike in some rocks and crushed the mount -LRB- camera was n't on the mount at the time because they 've lived in a drawer after about 4 weeks of frustrating attempts to get usable video out of them failed miserably -RRB- These were definitely the worst of any/all the cameras I 've tried . The no-name Chinese MP4 recorder combined with the HelmetCamera/Sony CCD using a composite connection actually gave me the best overall results . The PDR100 would be great for use in a car but far too many wires , too large and generates too much heat to be used in a tank bag on a motorcycle.The most important feature on a helmet camera is loop-mode recording where it just continuously overwrites the last hour or so of action unless you tell it otherwise . If you do n't have something with loop mode then you 'll end up like me ... ~ 500GB of un-edited video and absolutely no desire to sit through hours and hours and hours of boring video just to find the few really good bits . If you have loop mode -LRB- like the PDR100 does -RRB- then after you get some footage of interest you set it to using a new file . When you get home , the `` good parts '' are always right at the end of each of the 1hr long files and editing can be done in a matter of minutes rather than hours .
 Oregon Scientific ! ! Please , keep working on it . This is a good idea who loves action but it 's very poor video quality
 the worst thing about this camera is simply the audio ... it claims to be an action camera ... try riding a downhill bike or a motorcycle . . all wind noise . . I cant hear a thing other than wind noise.this is even with foam I put inside the audio plate to try to limit the noise -LSB- ... -RSB-
 Poor product . Display screen is too small to see what `` mode '' you have selected . Sound recording is awful . Basic idea of a helmet camera is flawed . Once you use one you will find out that people adjust their eyes to view subjects . Your head is rarely properly aligned to capture subjects on film . Buy a FLIP recorder instead .
 The bike and other mounts are useless , the picture was unwatchable and the unit picked up every vibration making the sound something awful and screechy . And I was on smooth concrete the entire way.Underwater the picture is good from 3-5 feet , that 's it . The sound is still a mess , since it seems to rely on vibrations , and even the water overwhelmed it , every dunk was thunder.Overall , a piece of junk barely worth $ 30 , if that . I bought mine FOR water , so I can still use it , but I should 've researched it better .
 I 've downloaded the massive k-lite codec packs for both 32 bit and 64 bit and I ca n't get my video editing programs to let me play with this file type . I have to use a video capture card to get the video on to my computer in a usable format . Mono sound .
 The buttons are too small and too hard to push reliably and too close together and the markings are very hard to make out . This ` camcorder ' is nothing but a piece of junk . Good thing it only cost me under $ 50 . I put it away in a drawer as a poor example of 21st century technology .
 The video is awful , the sound is overwhelming , and most important - something that is not mentioned in other reviews is that when this is mounted on your helmet - there is not way to know if it is on or off !!! The interface button are amazing hard to push . . impossible with gloves.Spend more $ and get something that you can count on . .
 Sound recorded indoors is unusable . Video quality is OK with decent light . Definitely reminiscent of the ` aliens ' helmet cam from James Cameroon 's movie . If you are expecting to use the audio you will be severely disappointed . The video has a definite grainy look to it . Could be useful for some shots . Probably worth $ 49 I do n't know about $ 80 ! tech observer
 This product only is compatible with Windows Vista and lower . It 's in very fine print lower in the description . Windows 7 has been available for almost four years , which makes me wonder about the company 's competence and the viability of this product . I returned it without using it .
 Although I commend Oregon Scientific for attempting to make an affordable all-in-one action cam , this one just does n't cut it . It does well in most areas except for handling the action part . The video becomes very wobbly when the camera gets moved around . Add a bike and dirt road and you can forget it , the picture becomes totally wavy and wobbly.Sound is also quite horrible . The mic is not isolated from the camera body , so even the slightest vibration becomes a hideous white noise , and when the video is reviewed later this will most often overpower the actual sound you wanted to capture . Wind noise is also picked up , but this can be reduced by taping a piece of soft foam over the mic opening.The unit is also quite large , and mounting is effectively limited to what they include in the box without some modification.Don ' t believe me , search youtube for ATC-2K video . You 'll see .

 Not happy at all with the product.The camera sensor came from the factory with dust particles , which you can see clearly on the image . There are at least 5 big speckles and there is no way to clean the sensor -LRB- other than sending the unit back -RRB- . Poor quality control is my guess.Otherwise works as advertised .
 I received this for Christmas . Here are my observations.It is very heavy . I would never mount this to my helmet and ride with it . It does n't come with an SD card -LRB- ?! -RRB- Luckily I had one for some other electronics that I have . I loaded it in and recorded some video and audio from my living room . I then extracted the SD card and loaded it into my Mac . The video shows up as a . avi file . Good ! I tried playing it back and found the video poor and grainy . There was basically no audio at all . I heard some clicking , and my voice was very , very quiet . Basically no audio at all . Okay , time to read the manual . The menu system is very VERY poor . I ca n't believe this got through their quality control ! The audio control is either ON or OFF . No volume control at all , although it is hinted at in the manual . Hmmm ... It will be easier and give much MUCH better performance to carry my Fuji camera around and use that when I want to record something . It even weighs less than this helmet cam!There is an addendum stuck in here . It says the `` ATC-2K supports the FAT16 format of the SD card ONLY '' . What ?!?? This shows a severe lack of trying on the software developer ! I 'm not going to format my SD card to FAT16 to support this piece of junk.Yuck . Finally , it came in one of those wrappers that must be torn to shreds to open . I wonder if I can return it ? My wife ordered it from Oregon Scientific . I ca n't believe they produced something this bad .
 This is a good idea , but the product does not stand up to its appraisals .
 When I saw that Amazon carried my favorite breeches , I jumped in and ordered 4 pairs . I love the Sigma cotton breeches with a zipper pocket . But , what I received was Tuffrider Pull On breeches with no zipper pocket , in light weight fabric -LRB- I hate pull on breeches ! -RRB- When I called Equestrian Collection to inform them that I had not received what I ordered , the person just kept going around in circles telling me this is what I ordered . I 'm sending them a copy of the Amazon page to show them what I ordered ...
 These plates are good for the price and pretty solid but fairly large , which can be a plus for some or a drawback for others.It depends what you are looking for , and how much other stuff you pack in your bag ... but what can you tell from THE 7 WORDS IN TOTAL THE SELLER HAD THE GENEROSITY TO USE IN THE TWO DESCRIPTION SECTIONS PROVIDED BY AMAZON !!!! I just ca n't understand these people ... Anyway , back to the product review

 it works . period . but it is like wearing a plastic bag ... no breathing at all . You get very sweaty when it is closed up ... it is only good for heavy rain protection , but nothing else . Better to spend a few more dollars and get a material that is both waterproof and breathes .
 The good thing about this parka ? It is waterproof . Do n't buy this parka if you plan to active . It does not breathe and it retains moisture . Sizing is not true to size . Buy one size smaller if you are still considering a purchase .
 This rain jacket is not breathable . They say it is because they have two small holes under something on the front of the jacket . Right where my backpack shoulder straps go . I think you would stay drier without the jacket in the rain . I put it on and I was drenched inside . This is a jacket you throw on if your running to the store . Absolutely not for any serious outdoor activity like hiking .
 This item was purchased for my seven year-old grandson with the purpose of encouraging him to hang up his clothes daily . Unfortunately the clothes rack fell over almost immediately after assembly and was broken rendering it unusable . I do n't know what the problem was but suspect that the top team emblem is too heavy for the slender rack to support . A cute idea that did not work!MargaretFan of the San Diego Padres
 The image shows 4 hooks . But the package is only for 2 . You 'll have to read the product description carefully to realize you only get 2 for your money instead of four shown on the image .
 I bought my wife two of these Dyna purses for Christmas last year , one brown and one black.The inside of these purses are not at all quality finished.Both purses continue to shed leather particles which get all over everything that is in the bag.I contacted Galco twice about this problem and all they say is that `` they 've never heard of this problem before '' . In addition their customer service rep had an attitude and had poor customer service skills.They will not take the purses back nor will they provide any means to alleviate the shedding issue.My wife refuses to use these purses anymore -LRB- ca n't blame her ... -RRB- . Although they look good from the outside , the expensive prices for these purses do n't reflect the quality.I 'm using one of these bags as a tool pouch . The other was sold .
 I 'm glad to know I 'm not the only one who found this thing impossible to program . I spent a few hours with it , then left it in a drawer for about 6 months before trying again . I at least got the `` daily '' program to work - counting steps and km , but do n't dare try anything else for fear of resetting the whole thing . And even if you do figure it out , it 's so totally unintuitive you 'll forget it the next time you need to set something . DEFinitely , but something else !
 The unit is absolutely awful to program and the manual is just BS!Looks like it was built by a sadist or mentally troubled engineer.Do not waste your money and look for another brand/model .
 I dropped this item on a carpeted floor from about 3 feet . Cracked the display . Called the company . No love . Ridiculous .
 I would like to apologize to the previous reviewer for ordering this item , disregarding their negative review of the programming on this pedometer . The programming is ridiculously complicated , and the instructions are not really much help , since they are written for four different pedometer units.Product arrived quickly , and was packed well ; however , this item simply did n't work when it arrived . The buttons were hard to press and sometimes activated on their own , and I ended up having to cycle menus several different times to get to the setting I wanted . I tried everything to get the pulse meter to read , to no avail . Even when I could clearly feel a pulse on my own , the pulse meter could n't read . I 'd be better off with a stopwatch.The unit is attractive and has features and a price that I like ; however , I am returning it for a refund -LRB- rather than exchange -RRB- because I am simply not willing to go through the programming ordeal -LRB- which is required every time you change the battery -RRB- all over again .
 I have yet to clip this to my belt and start using it . Still trying to set it up with printed instructions that fall far short of clear ! The various buttons are hard to read . The instruction manual is written for four different models . Some technical person wrote them , forgetting about the poor clueless consumer . Very frustrating . If I can get the hang of all these settings -LRB- just tell me how to reset the thing every day , PLEASE ! -RRB- , then perhaps I 'll change my mind . Right now , I simply want to throw this thing in a drawer and forget it .
 Maybe none of these type of devices work very well , but this one is no exception . The user interface is very cumbersome to use , configuration is complicated . All we really wanted to do is count steps and occasionally check heartrate . But this device seems to discourage that . The buttons are not very positive acting either , you ca n't tell if you 've pushed them or not . But if you really deliberately test it , it will count steps . I 'm afraid it will also count a few hundred steps sitting on the table over night . We are about ready to throw this gem away .
 I bought this in a store because of all the functions it had . I have n't used it in awhile and just got it back out of my drawer and ca n't figure out how to work it . I looked for the manual and had to download a PDF file from Oregon Scientific 's website . I then spent 45 minutes trying to get it to work . The directions are not complete because when I do what they say to do it does n't work . I resorted to just pushing buttons to see what happens . The battery is fine ; but no matter what I do it wo n't count at all . Nothing.The menus are just too complicated for such a little device , and I do n't consider myself to be technologically challenged , either . Another reviewer mentioned that the buttons are not clear -- that is , you ca n't easily tell when you 've pressed them . I agree.All I want is a plain pedometer to count steps . I 've given up on the calorie count and timer functions . I 'm looking to replace this with something less fussy , and I just want something with two or three buttons , not menu systems .
 This thing was n't designed well . Maybe they tried to do too much with it . The programming is very complex and impossible without the instructions -LRB- and the instructions are not written well either -RRB- . Now after my final use before I return it , the battery and holder slide out as I run and resets the program , and erases everything I was trying to track.The disappointment with this unit will definitely affect my decision to buy anything from Oregon Scientific.Conclusion
 As everyone has said total rubbish as almost impossible to programme and work as intendedOregon Scientific PE826 Pedometer with Pulse Meter
 This is a youth arrow . The description does not say that anywhere -LRB- as of when I made my purchase at least -RRB- . Arrows are 28 inches , way to short for my draw . I was under the impression that these were full size arrows that could be cut to size . Nope . I 'll send them back now ...

 Do not buy this pedometer ! Not only does it not work , but the design is horrible . There is absolutely nothing intuitive about how to operate the many functions that sound so great , but are completely hidden behind weird button combinations such as
 The comsupmtion rate of the battery life is too fast . Would prefer a lighter and smaller pedometer .
 Impossible instructions . Had 3 people try . Two most important buttons are non-funcitoning . Thought the great sounding features were too good to be true . Waste of money
 These gloves may work wonders in the `` deadliest catch '' series but they leave a lot to be desired in the way of warm gloves IMHO .
 I did n't find these to be warm at all , will be returning them . Used them inside my garage and my hands were warmer without them on , might be good for some , but not for me .
 Very disappointed with these gloves . I used these gloves for the 2nd time today , both times my hands were cold . A previous review mentioned extra cotton gloves inside helped ; I tried that today but my fingertips were still cold to the point of numbness . Today 's temperature was in the teens and I was outside operating the snow blower for 4 hours.I would not recommend them .

 The photo of this item shows a complete set of vinal weights . It did not give the purchaser the option to select two individual weights . Therefore , the advertisement implied that the purchaser would receive a complete set . However , only 2 weights arrived rather than a full set . If this was truthfully advertised , I would have made another selection which would have represented much better value . I 'm very disappointed !
 We purchased this wireless foot pedal to use with our SP Riptide . The unit works anywhere in our 17 ' boat . We only use our bow mount intermittently as we drift along the river 's edge . The position of the on-off switch in the upper right corner of unit makes it very awkward when compared to the corded foot pedals we had on other Minn Kota 's . With those , the motor would stop when we released our foot . Likely we will go back to a corded foot pedal . We probably would not have purchased it to start with if the web pictures had shown descriptions of each button 's function .

 When I ordered this item , I was initially very happy to have found a small stepper that I could keep in my bedroom and slide under my bed when it was not in use . However , I found that it was not easy to use with my feet placed in the centers of the step platforms because they are so close together . I ended up putting my feet on the outer edges of the step platforms so that I would have better balance and be able to move my legs more easily . Also , the sensor that detects when a step is made was not very sensitive , so the readout on the digital monitor never reflected the amount of time of the workout or the number of steps that I had made - I ended up just timing myself with a clock.Most critically , the cable that runs under the stepper and through a pulley wore through and broke after only a few months of using the stepper once or twice a week . This is the cable that pulls one step up when the other is pushed down , so without it the stepper will not work . There was no warning that the cable was being worn through - it just suddenly broke . I am not a particularly heavy adult and was using the stepper mostly for improving cardiovascular fitness , so I do n't think I put an undue strain on the cable.I am NOT planning to replace this product with a similar mini stepper .
 I bought this because I wanted a stepper that I could use and then easily put away . It worked pretty well for about two months . I was using it three or four days a week for about 20 minutes each time . Today , I was using it as usual and the cable that makes the steps go up and down suddenly snapped . I 'm an average sized woman and way below the suggested maximum weight for it . I 'm really disappointed in this stepper . I may contact the company for a new cable but I 'm not sure I want to keep using this thing if it 's going to break again .
 Cable wore out in 2 months . I got a replacement . But the damn cable wore out again in a couple of months ... NEVER buy this piece of junk !
 I gave one of these to my wife for Christmas 2005 . She used it 3 or 4 times a week for about a year until it broke . Specifically , the weld that connects the axle to the frame broke . My wife is not a heavy person -- 120 lbs . max . So I echo what other reviewers have said
 I 've had this for more than two years . It 's ok exercise , not as good as an elliptical machine or a stair-stepper , but certainly less expensive.Problems however
 I 'm giving it two stars for potential , only . I got stoked about something small and quiet that I could use inside when the weather was stinky . It came missing a piece , the adjustor knob was broken , the display cracked , and it only worked out my knee joints , as far as I can tell . I returned it within days .
 The item shown in the picture is not the item being sold . If you buy it you WILL NOT RECIEVE the item pictured . They have substituted there higher priced scope in the picture . Look close you will see the yardage adjustment in the front of the scope and the giveaway is the MOA adjustment knob on top . The one they will send is a 4X32 fixed basically and airgun scope ! Be careful . I have written but they will not respond !
 Although it is a nice blade , and have no complaints about the product itself , I ordered two and only received one , and was still billed for two . Now I am going to have to order an additional foil elsewhere , and I need them very soon . Very disappointing . I doubt I will do business with this company again .
 When I saw that Amazon carried my favorite breeches , I jumped in and ordered 4 pairs . I love the Sigma cotton breeches with a zipper pocket . But , what I received was Tuffrider Pull On breeches with no zipper pocket , in light weight fabric -LRB- I hate pull on breeches ! -RRB- When I called Equestrian Collection to inform them that I had not received what I ordered , the person just kept going around in circles telling me this is what I ordered . I 'm sending them a copy of the Amazon page to show them what I ordered ...
 The sheath surrounds the knife . That 's as good a review as I can give.My Ka-Bar rattles around in this sheath . So I tried my sons . Same thing . The picture indicated there were two restraining straps , mine has one.I would not recommend this item to a friend . I would advise against it.Warm regardsChris in Florida
 I do n't understand how anybody could give this sheath a good review . I bought it as a combo with a next gen Kabar , which I also have a few complaints about , and right out of the box I knew the sheath was junk as soon as I touched it . It does n't have the `` feel '' of other Kydex sheaths I own or have made . This just feels like a cheap plastic from Japan , oh wait , it is . It actually separates along the seams when you bend it just a bit . Take this out into the wild and you would have a great knife and a broken piece of plastic . I 'll take Kabars leather sheath any day over this piece of junk . I 'm very disappointed in you Kabar !
 This product says it fits ka-bar knives 7 '' long but absolutely does not fit ! The width of the sheath is more for a dagger . I followed the `` no hassle '' instructions to return the item and a month or more later i still do not have the label that was `` sent on the mail . '' Instead i got 6 or so emails saying it was coming and 6 more saying its cancelled . Guess im stuck with a cheaply made plastic , useless sheath ...
 Purchased to go with the Ka Bar Bowie , but it did not fit . Now it just collects dust . There was nothing in the product details that indicated that these two items were incompatible . Fact , I felt that the product details indicated that they were compatible . Be weary .
 The bodycircles workout is superb ! I am having challenges with `` tennis elbow '' and stiffness in the cervical/thoracic area , and this workout is the answer ! I use it to alleviate stiffness , as my own complimentary medicine for physical therapy .
 The exercises are effective however the VHS is in a word cheap - mine is defective -LRB- wo n't go thru the hassle of trying for another -RRB- . The audio goes in and out which is extremely annoying . I put up with it because the rings are a solid workout . Be prepared for complete annoyance until you can memorize the tape -LRB- hello - we 're in the DVD world now -RRB- , mute the audio and play a CD instead.Gaim should have more respect since they 're pitching ` CALM ' .
 This is a very nice looking watch . My husband bought it for me for Christmas , and I like it , but the time is VERY hard to read . The background is pink and the time is silver , which does n't make for much contrast . I do n't know how they got the time to show up in the pictures , it is not dark enough . I am debating on whether or not to return it due to the difficulty in making out the time and date .
 WARNING READ FIRST !!! Airsplat is not the company to but from . This company is known for sending broken gun or completely the wrong gun to your address . I haved ordered from them and received a broken gun . When you try to get another one they make you pay for another and make YOU pay to return that one . AIRSPlAT is a joke DO N'T by from them !!!!!
 This strap is thinner than those used in yoga classes . It is sharp on the arch when held there for poses . I would not purchase another one .
 I bought this for my son who is constantly rolling his ankle . He wo n't wear it because he says the brace digs into his ankle -LRB- despite the padding -RRB- . He also had difficulty fitting this inside his baseball cleat , so maybe it 's good for hightops and court shoes , but not cleats ?
 About a month ago , I ordered an ankle brace from The Brace Shop . I wanted a small but they shipped a large . I admit that there is a possibility that I failed to update the size correctly . Upon receipt of the brace , I followed the Amazon communication link to the vendor and asked that they ship a small as soon as possible and send me an authorization so I can return the large brace . To date , I have not received a small brace nor any communication from the vendor . I have also tried to call , but their business hours are limited.Need help !
 I had read great reviews of the Casio watches and expected to get a great looking watch . This review is based on the esthetics 's of the watch and not it 's functions ... You can not see the face of the watch , only by looking at it in certain angles . Although the watch may be very dressy , it lacks the ability to see the face of the watch . . PLEASE be aware of this before you buy it . There were no reviews for me to check out.Take notice that in the picture of the watch face the numbers look dim . THE reality of that is far worse . I am going to try to return it .

 *** Update *** 3/1/09Sierra at Manduka just received my returned mat . She stated that I did indeed wear the film off , but the texture of both sides of my mat were unlike the norm . She offered to send me another ProLite which would be the correct texture , but I decided to go with the eKo as I heard great things about it . I will say that Mankuka 's customer service is the best I 've experienced . They are very committed to having satisfied customers and even go through the trouble of practicing on your returned mat to see what it is that was n't working for you . So I feel that if you are one in many that get a mat like mine that was slippery , you will be in excellent hands to get the mat you will be happy with . I 'm looking forward to practicing with my eKo . ************* I rarely give reviews , but I felt this is important if you are a serious yogi . I treated myself with a Manduka mat for my birthday after hearing so much praise about them . I 've had mine 4 months and I have done everything to make it less slippery
 After reading the rave reviews , I was really excited to start a life-long romance with my new Manduka mat . However , our short-lived relationship led only to heartbreak . I was ready to move on from my peeling -LRB- but sticky -RRB- cheap-o that I 'd purchased from my local big box retailer a few years ago , and wanted something lasting that would be eco-friendly and all that stuff that the other was not.Unfortunately , I had to cast it aside in the middle of our `` first date '' because it was insanely slippy -- to the point that I was concerned about injury if I continued to practice on it . Down dog was like being on soapy glass and high lunge left me in fear of pulling a groin as the ship of my foot sailed out behind me -LRB- I practice Vinyassa , too ; not Bikram , and am a non-sweater -RRB- . A `` coating '' was mentioned on the packaging , so -LRB- still hopeful -RRB- I returned after class and washed it with the rough side of a sponge THREE times . I am not exaggerating . I tried again between each soaping and still ... fail . I even tried leaving it in the sun for several hour stretches as per suggestions in reviews ... fail.Finally , my hubs convinced me that it was never going to be all that I was hoping for , and I returned it . Then I bought the Jade Harmony mat and my yoga life is transformed , just like I had hoped it would be with Manduka . Some affairs are meant to be short , I suppose . I also realized that Manduka is made in Germany , not in the US , whereas Jade mats -LRB- or at least the one I got -RRB- is made in the US . Being `` eco-friendly '' sounds really nice , but damage is already wrought on the production end ? Is a mat that was made and shipped from Germany really good for the environment ? Does it help sustain American jobs and families at the time when we need that the most?So , now I 'm in love with my Jade . It is sticky and lovely and everything that I wanted in a mat so far . It seems that inner peace and nirvana are within my grasp . Sorry , Manduka , you taught me a lot ; perhaps it is due to your shortcomings that I can now recognize the tenor and quality of my new relationship .
 I purchased this high-end , environmentally friendly , `` non-slip '' mat because my cheap , 7-year-old mat was wearing down , smelly and beginning to show its age.According to the description , and other reviews , I understood that this mat was `` superior '' but needed a little breaking in time -LRB- aka , removal of sticky film on surface -RRB- . After 2 + weeks , 5 attempts to wash and remove , and multiple attempts to do my yoga on the mat , it is still slippery and unusable ... enough to make my supporting leg slip backwards towards a deep lunge during a simple warrior 1 or 2 pose . Each time I 've tried to use the mat , I end up grabbing my old mat to finish my session.Since I 'm also a yoga teacher , I wanted to have a mat in better condition to use on a daily basis , and have unfortunately not been able to use this mat . I am sorry that I have to return this mat .
 My husband has a manduka and it is slip proof . His is the `` black mat '' , tho the desgn on the top is squiggles - and this one and the new `` black mat '' -LRB- it actually does come in different colors now -RRB- have grids . If you can find one with the squiggles , snatch it up , cuz this one stinks . It compares to the one I got at Target for $ 10.99 . I slide around on it like its a skating rink . The website says
 I really dislike this mat . True , it has plenty of cushioning . However , I slip and slide on this mat so much ! I do n't sweat that much , I have given it a generous break in period , and I have scrubbed it like their customer service representative suggested -- still slippery . Not worth the money at all!Go for the Jade or Lululemon mat instead , save yourself the hassle .
 Got this as a gift and so far have not been able to use it . Sweating even a little makes the mat so slippery you ca n't even hold downward facing dog . It would be very dangerous to attempt any advance poses . Like other users have said the smell of the mat is very over powering and distracting while trying to relax but thats the least of your worries . I have never left a review before but I felt since this is so expensive and so dangerous that it was important to inform other yogies .
 thought it would be a much better mat . too narrow , not sticky , slippery ; just mediocre . In fact , I use a cheap , thin sticky mat over it and my practice is better . Also , it 's NOT a travel mat . it is heavy and bulky -- not a problem for back & forth to attend class , but would never pack this for a trip .
 The mat has good thickness to it , feels well made and good stickiness to the floor . However if you sweat , it is like working out on an ice rink , very slippery .
 This mat is very slippery for vinyasa yoga . I bought it to replace my old mat that I have for over 5 years , a regular inexpensive mat that I couldn ' t find any more in the market . I have washed the manduka mat more than 20 times and I have tried all possible different detergents . It is still slippery .
 I 've been practicing yoga for about 4 years now . At the suggestion of my amazing yoga teacher , I ordered a Manduka because it was on sale - she also ordered one for herself . I 've been practicing on my Manduka for 8 months and will , unfortunately , be retiring it in the near future . Just this morning , while practicing in a Vinyasa flow class -LRB- in which the temperature is raised to 85 degrees -RRB- I had to actually roll up my mat mid-class and continue practicing on the floor because my slipping became so severe . The thickness of the mat is fine ... but if my hands and feet become even the slightest bit sweaty -LRB- and no , I 'm not talking actual drops of sweat on the mat -RRB- I slide all over the place . Even a simple pose like downward facing dog becomes practically impossible , as my hands will slowly creep , creep , creep their way further and further to the top of my mat . Jumping forward or backward is treacherous and staying stable in triangle pose becomes the most frustrating thing on the planet as my feet slip in opposite directions . It 's important to know that I am NOT someone who sweats a lot , so I ca n't even imagine how a heavy sweater would manage on this mat . If you are someone who practices a gentler , more laid back yoga -LRB- restorative , hatha -RRB- this mat would probably be absolutely fine . But for vinyasa , hot yoga , or any other type of more `` advanced '' class , please do not waste your money . Your practice will cease to be a place of balance and will instead turn into frustration because your poses will become compromised from the severe slipping . What 's worse , you could also injur yourself . My yoga teacher was also extremely disappointed with this mat . She and I both tried giving our mats salt water baths -LRB- as suggested by a Manduka customer service rep. -RRB- but , sadly , it did nothing to help the slippery nature of this mat .
 If you sweat at all , do not buy this mat . I use it for Pilates and it is so slippery I nearly always end up putting a gym mat -LRB- yuk -RRB- over it . I 've scrubbed it , I 've brushed it ... it is still downright hazardous . I paid $ 80 for this mat at a rip-off yoga facility and I want to return it !
 I heard alot of great things about this mat , and was so excited to order and start using . What a waste ! It does n't do any of the things it claims . I sweat alot on my hands and feet , they were both sliding continuously . During down dog , my hands were sliding to where I was practically out in plank pose!As far as not bunching or moving on carpeting-that 's not true either ! After just doing sun salutations , I was practically `` spooning '' with the person next to me ! I was just way too close . The mat slid a ridiculous amount considering that one of it 's points is supose to be that it doens ' t do that ... I have had this mat for several months now , and have given it fair time to try and use it and break it in , so I ca n't even claim that it 's not `` working '' properly because it 's new or not broken in.All in all , it was a real disappointment . I have tried other mats that were cheaper and better -LRB- like the Prana sticky mats -RRB- , but I have found the best solution to be one of the cotton yoga rugs just thrown over top of any old mat you have ... Maybe I can at least use this for something then ... !
 The first time I used the Prolite it felt narrow . I was used to a mat that is 24 inches wide . The Prolite is advertised as 24 inches wide but I measured it after I got home and it is only 23-5/8 inches wide . Although only a small difference but it made a big difference in how I felt using it .
 after a few months it started to disintegrate . Now I have to put it in the land fill .
 If you are sensitive to smells do not buy this mat . Seemed to fill the room with it 's funk.Does not grip well . I bought it for grip.Yes , it 's stable . Worth it ? Not to me.Try the hugger mugger earth elements mat -LRB- 5mm model -RRB- . It 's got great grip and seems like a feather weight compared to this mat . Not as stable in place , but seems a better value -LRB- reasonable price -RRB- . And it 's biodegradable .
 Um ... can someone tell me if this mat is supposed to be really slippery at first ??? I 'm hoping it gets better ... but I could barely finish my yoga class I was slipping so much . I do n't even slip this much on the cheap mats . Is anyone else having this problem ?
 So , I 've practiced power yoga for the last 5 years and never had an issue with my Jade mat , which desperately needed to be replaced . Because my current yoga studio uses Manduka mats almost exclusively , I decided to get one ... BIG mistake . Let me start off by stating that this is definitely a high-quality mat with great cushioning but by no means is it light and after slipping and falling on my face -LRB- literally -RRB- doing forearm Vashistasana last night as well as not being able to stretch deeply in downdog because my hands kept slipping , I 've decided to give this mat away and stick with what I know and love . I really wanted to like this mat but it completely turned on me once I began to perspire ; the color is lovely and it 's a nice thickness but unless I 'm doing a restorative class where there is no chance of sweating , I will never step on one again ...
 I reviewed this at the Manduka site as wellUpdate 10/07 - Manduka were very quick getting back to me . Recommended a 50/50 water cider vinegar wash daily and leave it in Sunshine . I 'll try the first one , sunshine in Ireland could be a problem ! 10/07I bought an Olive Pro-Lite . Have used it for about 10 hours practise , which has been below par practise as downward dog means keep repositioning , even plank gets gradually worse the slipper it gets.I 've done the salt scrub and scrubed with a nail brush as hard as possible.Still the mat is like an ice rink.The variance in the reviews would appear to be for different products ! I think Manduka need to look at quality control10 hours to break a product in is a bit excessive but Manduka say it can be 3 months .3 months of slipping in practise would make it a chore.Its a wire brush to the may now to see if I can get some usage out of it before getting a new product
 I bought this mat to replace my old Gaiam natural rubber mat , which was falling apart after 6 years of regualr use . I was super excited to find the Black Cherry color , but when I took it to my first class , I was slipping around like crazy , and I was n't even sweating . My teacher suggested that it might need to be wiped down with mild soapy water to remove any factory residue , and probably just needed some time to break in . I tried both -LRB- including a salt scrub as suggested -RRB- , and continued to slip and slide all over the mat after two months of 3-4 classes per week . I found it very distracting to my practice . Bottom line , I 'm really disappointed that I spent 80 bucks on this mat . The firmness of the material is good , but it really needs some more texture on the top to prevent slippage .
 Using this mat is like trying to do yoga on a slip 'n slide . I have to put my old cheap mat from Target over this one to avoid sliding out of even the simplest poses . There 's no point buying a product that ca n't stand on its own -LRB- no pun intended -RRB- . Take your hard-earned $ 65 and buy a different mat .
 My wife bought this mat and she thinks it is too slippery . Her yoga instructor told her to wash it to give it more traction . She has washed it twice , scrubbing it vigorously with a brush , and it is still slippery . Maybe we can use it as a sled .
 Do n't buy this item . It was n't a real Manduka . Tag was glued on one side , not sewn on both sides along edge like the real thing . What a disappointment !! Always had great results from amazon ... until now . Be careful !
 I have been using the Manduka PRO for yrs and wanted the light weight version . I so wanted to love the Pro-lite but 4 months later it still stinks and is super slippery -LRB- and I hardly sweat -RRB- . My hands slip in the very first down dog of my practice . I would not recommend this mat until the manufacturer resolves these issues . I can smell the chemicals even through my yogitoe -LRB- and I have washed it several times and left it in my patio for days to air out -RRB- . I do like the thickness and weight of this mat , but the chemical odor and slippery-ness are deal breakers for me .
 was so excited to receive ... very disappointed . once my hands got moist i began to slip and slip . returned for a jade mat .
 I 've had this mat for 2 + years and agree with the previous reviews . This mat is not sweat-friendly , particularly if you practice vinyasa . And , once sweat absorbs in the mat , the odor starts brewing -LRB- even if you do clean with the special yoga mat cleaner , herbal concoctions or whatever else -RRB- . For profuse sweaters with a regular practice , this mat is not for you . For those who dare take an inversion with the Manduka , be sure to put a towel under your hands and/or wipe off your mat before moving into position.On a positive note , this mat does offer more cushioning for the knees -LRB- but is by no means as plush as a Tapas Ultra ... not suggesting you buy this either because it falls apart -RRB- . Oh and the Manduka holds up under toe-digging , which is another plus.Namaste !
 After carefully reading the reviews I decided to ignore the negative ones and go ahead with a purchase of a Manduka ProLite mat . But then it all began . The slow realization that I 've just spent $ 80.00 + on a new yoga mat I 'll never be able to use.I purchased my mat from a retail store in Chicago , who wo n't take it back because I went through the salt scrub process Manduka told me to do.I tried everything to make this mat not slippery as a soaped up marble floor , but after months of trying to use it and having to use a towel or another mat provided by the studio I 've given up.I 'm out $ 80 dollars and I highly recommend , if you sweat , to avoid this mat . For gentle yoga , or yoga where you do not perspire this is a great mat . It does n't absorb sweat so it theoretically stays very clean , which is fantastic . But if you sweat on it you will not get past the point where you begin to perspire.I wish I would have listened to the other -LRB- few -RRB- negative reviews rather than assuming that since most reviews were positive I would have a positive experience with my mat.I 've also talked to several people at my yoga studio and they all agree that these mats are useless without a towel . Hopefully Manduka will give me a discount on one of their towels since my mat is useless without it.I can happily end this review by telling you that the people at Manduka are very honest and helpful and they went as far as sending me a towel to use on my mat for no charge . For their kindness and understanding I am tremendously thankful.Happy Yoga !
 I bought this mat because it was supposed to last a lifetime -LRB- or two -RRB- . This is false . I used the mat for only 6 months 5 times a week to practice ashtanga and the surface started to peel off like the others mat I used before -LRB- but this one costs twice as much -RRB- . The purplelite is much heavier than a regular mat too , so realistically this is not a traveling mat . The `` lite '' in the name is just because it is lighter than the black mat.However I still think this mat is superior to the 20 dollars mats
 I purchased this mat March of 2009 with high hopes of loving it . Yet I hate it . It still stinks like day 1 , I contacted the manufacturer last year hoping to get some advice . Their website suggests rinsing with apple cidar vinegar which did nothing . Manduka sent me a free sample of their mat-wash to combat the chemical smell ... which did nothing.Do I still use it ? Yes . I know the smell is not hurting me it just bothers me.Do my hands slip on it when sweaty ? Yes ! So I use a mat towel.All in all , I would never recommend this mat .
 Loved the length and thickness of this mat.Unfortunately carried a very toxic smell through my yoga practice.Tried airing it out for a week - could n't get rid of the smell.Used some mat spray - still no luck.Got in touch with the company for a return.Hoping it was just a bad lot !
 I got this mat as a gift and , after five months , it still has that smell of PVC and whatever chemicals they use in the processing . I tried leaving it out to breathe on the patio and it still stinks.I called up the company about this problem and they made no attempt to resolve it . Given that yoga and the yogic philosophy are all about health and peace , I feel that this mat makes it hard to really enjoy one 's practice.Do yourself a favor and buy another mat . I certainly wish I did .
 I bought this mat with the expectation that it would keep me from slipping , since I tend to sweat alot on my hands and feet . I was in for a big disappointment . For the price that I paid compare to the other yoga mats , I was very disappointed . Lesson learned , find a yoga store and shop in person rather than on-line . For those of you who sweats alot , DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THIS MAT .
 Too slippery . I do n't even sweat and my hands an feet just slip away all the time . Not worth t he money
 ordered size XXL for my brother for christmas , he said it fit great overall but it was too short ! he 's 6 ' 5 '' and ussually an XXL sweatshirt fits just fine all over , including length . He loved the sweatshirt , so was disappointed that he had to return it !
 Those earplugs would have fit an elephant . I showed them to my otologist and he laughed his head off . I tried to give them to him to give to a `` larger patient '' ; he said throw them away . I did . It was n't even worth the effort to return them .
 I purchased this item for my yearly trip to India . Indian food always runs my digestive system ragged and I wanted to purchase an item to help control my bowel movements . Much to my surprise these items turned out to be `` aqua blocks '' not `` anal blocks '' ! They are for your ears ! Using them for any other body cavity is highly inadvisable . I will be repurchasing an appropriate product .
 I found these earplugs tended to want to go too deeply into the ear and perhaps for some ear canals they could do damage . The design is otherwise quite clever and may work for some.I returned mine and will go back to the putty type of earplug
 I have small ears , I guess . I only got these to properly fit in once . Lost one on the second swim try . Read others tips and still had no luck . Had better luck with the silicon waxy things , though I hate how those collect debris.Not for everyone , it seems .
 these plugs are not rigid enough at all to stay in the ear . i 've tried and worn so many different types of plugs since i had my ear tube surgery and my audiologist taught me how to put them in so i know i 'm doing it right . but if i so much as move my jaw to speak while taking a bath with these things in they start to fall right out and water gets in , which is quite painful when there is a hole in your eardrum . also , despite having pediatric-sized ears even as an adult , they are too small . the part shaped like a christmas tree does n't have enough girth and the stem is too short to hold onto easily enough to get them in as far as they really need to go , which is likely why they keep sliding out . granted , most others are far too big , which is why i tried these . but these are much too small and much too squishy to work . something in-between would be perfect .
 ordered size XXL for my brother for christmas , he said it fit great overall but it was too short ! he 's 6 ' 5 '' and ussually an XXL sweatshirt fits just fine all over , including length . He loved the sweatshirt , so was disappointed that he had to return it !

 The Adidas flex shirtbands were too small in length . I purchased them for a slender -LRB- 126 lbs -RRB- 5 ' 9 '' teenager and they did n't fit except as a tight wristband . Very dissatisfied . Amazon needs to have the vendor add the length of the shirtbands for full disclosure marketing .
 The photos for this are deceptive . What appears in the photo to be metal is almost certainly plastic with seams running all the way up both sides . the lightly pebbled black hilt is really cheap plastic printed in a leather pattern . The blade a shiny plastic spatula . This should appeal to the under ten set in search of a knight 's sword .
 the only metal on it id the guard , blade , and sheath capping . the blade is n't even false sharpened . i would suggest the knights ornamental dress dagger .
 this volleyball was not the volleyball that the NCAA women use . It was a reject . Claims to be a super touch . More like Super Slouch . Have been playing with this so called volleyball for a month now and leather is beginning to crack . Ball has no bounce to it and feels dead . I have played with other super touch volleyballs by Molten and they were great ! I bought 2 of them and they were both crap . Either someone is making cheap imitations of Molten Super Touches like mine or Molten does not have a quality control and makes great ones and then piss poor ones .
 These soakers are not high quality . I 've used them for three weeks , and they 're already starting to wear a hole in them . If you skate a lot , I would look for some with a nylon strip on the bottom .
 I had one of these for years , which worked fine until I was working on my handlebars , accidentally yanked the cord too much and it stopped working . The way this one works , there 's a `` base unit '' that the computer slides into -LRB- a nice feature , so that you can have one base unit per bike , and switch the computer back and forth , allowing you to record `` bike 1 '' and `` bike 2 '' with one computer -RRB- . So decided to just get a spare `` base unit '' . Unfortunately , that never really worked . Bought another whole system , and that did n't work , either . So now I have two of them , both of which only function as a clock . Kind of disappointing , because I really did like the first one I had .
 Sorry , I can not agree w / the reviews . I am returning this bike computer.Reason
 I 've bought two of these now . One just stopped working all together . The other I used two times . TWO TIMES and now it wo n't register the wheel moving . Done with SIGMA . Garbage .
 This thing is poorly constructed and works when it wants to . It worked fine for the first couple weeks and then quit . I replaced the batteries but nothing worked on it except the clock and the stopwatch . I ordered another and it worked fine for about a month and then everything stopped working.I read review after review with people complaining of the same issues . I will NEVER buy a SIGMA product again .
 For the price , I expected something that lasted more than a few days . But nope.For starts , the round shims that attach the cord to the front of the frame will break when you try to use them , so you have to use duct tape . For another , this speedometer will start working only sporadically after a few days . After 2 months , it 'll rarely work at all.Don ' t waste your money .
 U have to have a degree from MIT to install this JUNK !! and then it still wont work DO NOT BUY !!!
 I did a quick add to cart based on the image above , looks white with a bit of charcoal gray maybe , it 's actually olive green .
 The hard hat I received was not the one the one I chose in the picture for 40 dollars , it was one I could have chose for 27dollars out of the three choices that I had .
 I was very disappointed when I realized no darts or mounting hardware were included like they were suppose to be . AND when we hit the 15 it also lights up like we hit the bulls eye as well . Not worth the price !!!!!!!!!
 You can get a board better than this one installed in a Cabinet for only a few bucks more . The Cabinet version is identical to a board you see in the bars ... I have actually seen some bars use the Arachnid Cabinet version right here on Amazon . Your money , but I would never pay this price for simply a dart board alone .
 Can not rate the dart board itself . Dart board was obviously returned by a prior Amazon customer , poorly repackaged and shipped to me as &#34; new &#34; merchandise . Lower corner of dart board was broken off and accessories were not packaged but just pitched in the box . Do n't understand why Amazon would have wasted their time and money shipping this out to me . Evidently good help is still hard to find despite such a high unemployment rates . I guess we wo n't have that new dart board for our party next weekend .
 Hello , I would consider myself to be an average dart player/plays often . My 1st thought after reading the reviews even though the 800 got a lot of 5 star reviews I was still uncertain & skeptical for a couple of obvious reasons -LRB- $ 250.00 -RRB- . My pessimistic side unfortunately was correct - For starters Arachnid should be completely ashamed of themselves for the junk hardware & ridiculous pre-school MOUNTING method for this level board ! Next the board has a very cheap junky feel to it - from the garbage buttons to the actual dart impact - do not believe the reviews that tell you it feels like a `` bar board '' - FULL OF __________ - it does NOT !!!! Lets move on to the actual game play , Yes the 800 does offer a good selection of games however in four of the games I played so far I got a bunch of wrong readings - this has never happened on my $ 50.00 Halex board that just died after 8 years :--LRB- . Next the voice function is really PISS POOR as it seems to work intermittenly , I am NOT referring to the `` heckler mode '' rather the typical call outs . The board has a good bright red LED readout - serves it 's purpose . THE BOTTOM LINE if you can afford $ 250.00 for a board that does not perform any better than a $ 40 - $ 100 board besides the LED 's than you MIGHT be happy with this typical cheap , junky feeling board . I was really hoping for a much better board - especially from the ARACHNID brand at a LARGE EXPENSIVE PRICE !!!!!!! Amazon please help ! Update - the voice function stopped working completely ! This board is JUNK !!!! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1_VltcJeEQ&context;=C3373f86ADOEgsToPDskLYOesE7S_tPAaGdc5BkBo2
 I bought this board to replace a Halex board that had gone through so much use over the last few years that the borders separating some of the single and triple cricket numbers had completely disintegrated . It was time for a new board . The two main features that I was looking for was a board that had the ability to switch the bulls eye between single/double and all double formats , and a computer that I could play against when no one else was around . After seeing the features on the Pro 800 I decided to order it.When the board showed up I hung it on the wall and started to play only to discover that the double bulls eye would not consistently register . The problem was initially intermittent but started to get much worse within two days . It got to the point where the double bulls eye would only register once in a great while . I sent the board back to Amazon and they accepted it no problem , and I had a replacement board the next day after I filled out an exchange request . Fantastic service.So I hung the second board up and started playing . Every time that I hit the bulls eye near the 16 , the machine would register 16 instead of the bulls eye . When I pushed the bulls eye with my finger by the 16 I noticed that it pushed the 16 pie piece down as well . I decided to remove the back cover and have a look at what was causing the issue and found that the inside pie on the 16 had not been well trimmed and a piece of the pie -LRB- will post a picture if I can -RRB- was under the round bulls eye piece . This was causing the 16 to register when the bulls eye was hit near the 16 . In addition one of the other triangle pieces was missing a good chunk of plastic on a corner . I trimmed the piece that was overlapping with the bulls eye and closed up the back only to realize then that I had broken a warranty seal . So much for being able to send it back . At least trimming the piece made the bulls eye work correctly . The board now registers all the numbers like it should have when I bought it.One other issue that I have with the board is that the pie pieces are poorly trimmed on the outside as well , and I have torn the skin on my knuckles from the sharp edges of plastic/nylon sticking out of the pie pieces when pulling my darts out of the board . Trimming those down myself as I come across them as well . To be fair , I do n't remember the first board I received -LRB- and sent back -RRB- having this issue.For what this board cost compared to other boards on the market I should not have had to go through this type of experience . This board should be right the first time every time , not two lemons in a row . This indicates poor quality control and a lack of caring about the customer on the part of the company.That being said , the board is not without its ' good points . I will list what I consider to be the pro 's and con 's . ProsCan switch the bulls eye to be either single/double or all double . Good to have if you play the 01 games in both steel and soft tip.Darts stick in the board with very few bounce outs . Can use a harder material short tip and the darts do n't bounce out of the board . I have not played on a home board before this where the short tips would consistently stick.Good instructions for hanging the board on the wall .01 games against the computer opponent are good.When the volume is turned off it stays off until the machine is turned off.ConsThe way the board hangs on the wall . All other boards that I have hung have done so with two screws that are put into a wall horizontally . This board hangs with two screws that are put in vertically . For me it was difficult getting the screws in at a distance where I could put the board on and it was completely tight against the wall . I finally put it onto some backer board and then secured that to the wall . Now nothing moves or vibrates when the darts hit or are removed from the board.On cricket games the computer opponent plays unlike any opponent that I have played against in competition . No player that I have ever played against will throw at a triple 17 and a triple 15 when 20 is closed with 40 points and 19 and 18 are still open . It may average out at the end in terms of marks per round for a particular average , but is not a realistic representation of how cricket games are played . Would be nice to see the computer play the game as a real player would play it.All the settings on the machine need to be put in every time a game is changed . It would be nice if I want to do three players or one player against the computer and those setting would be maintained when switching between cricket and 01 until I changed them myself.I have had this board for a few weeks . I use it almost exclusively for 501 at this point -LRB- still using my old board for cricket -RRB- and am looking for a new board . For the amount of money I paid for it I feel bad not using it for something . Had I not opened the back of this board and voided the warranty I would have returned it as well . It may very well be a good board for some , but based on my experience I ca n't recommend it . And I just do n't see how this board is better than one that costs even a fourth as much .
 I purchased this product here on Amazon . The product SHIPPED FAST and looked nice . I took it to the feild the first day of hunting season and found the Feild of view very limited , unless I sat there with my Gun on a pod mount , I did not have enough space to draw my rifle to my shoulder without hitting the blind in front of me . The chair was as comfortable as a collapable camp chair can be expected and the interior pockets were nice . But the armrest BROKE 1st TIME OUT preventing it from opening or closing properly there after . The tent portion of the phone was good for keeping me warm , so if you do n't mind spending $ 60-120 on a onetime use product to keep you warm and do n't need alot of extra space for a gun/bow may be a decent product , the Avid nature photographer or something . Also the feild of view like the last guy said is very limited for usability , you can only shoot what is in directly in front of you . Contacted AMERISTEP 's customer service , NEVER GOT RESPONSE , Stuck with broke chair I have used once.Lousy product , even more lousy customer service .
 too small , very limited field of view , very cheaply made , broke after one hunting trip
 When I bought this sweatshirt , it arrived in good time but , when I got the sweatshirt , it was in HORRIBLE quality , it was made from CHEAPLY made cotton , the letters were VERY poorly sown on and is probably the worst quality sweatshirt you will buy anywhere . I paid about $ 43 when I could get 2 sweatshirts from another store with much better quality even if it does n't say YALE . Very poor , I would never EVER buy from here again .
 Great product for smaller capacity bladders . But I can quickly fill this to the rim and then some ... -LRB- too much info ? -RRB- Well , you should know . So unless your body has a quick shut off ability - you 're heading for trouble if you 're a big water drinker during the day .
 I bought the TravelJohn-Disposable Urinals thinking they were a portable toilet , especially for # 2 since Urinal is Latin for Urinus , the Roman god of fertilizer . Well , they 're strictly for # 1 , this I found out while I was in the museum with no toilets.First of all , who needs a Disposable Urinal for # 1 ? We have nature or back alleys for that so it 's not hard to find a place for # 1 . Secondly , my Urinal pack did n't come with instructions so I had no idea how to use it . It 's some snorkleing bag .
 I am female and I travel a long distance to work everyday andI thought it would be great to use whenever I am stuck intraffic . Well , I tried it yesterday and I was notable to get it unfolded enough and I was never able toget any urine in the bag . Needless to say I was smartenough to put plastic on my car seat , because I definitelywet my pants . As confused as I was the first time , I hadto go again while still stuck in traffic , so I tried anotherbag and once again I got wet all over . I guess it requirespractice , but I am not a fan at this time .
 I received this product a few days ago and started giving it to my cat . My cat will not touch the stuff !!!! So , I can not tell you if the product works or not . I will keep trying to get my cat to eat the supplement and if she does , I 'll write another review.Okay , I 'm back a few weeks later and my cat has started eating this product . I have n't seen a difference as of yet , but I will come back to write another review when I see results . My cat has lost it 's hair on one of her ears so , I will see if the product will help grow her hair back .
 well ... i had to give this two stars for a couple of reasons . I bought it to add to my cat 's food -LRB- six cats -RRB- . Bottom line , none of them really like it ... i mix it up with a can of soft cat food and put it in to bowls . In a double-blind situation -LRB- some get it some do n't , who does and does n't varies by day -RRB- , NONE of them really like it . Some will take a few licks of the mixture but most will simply sniff and walk away . I Know it is this because without it , they readily eat the food.Major issue is that it DOES N'T mix well . I have tried all sorts of methods , including putting the stuff though a Ninja multi-blade processor to make it finer . there is what looks like little black pepper bits , that always end up left behind , even for those that will eat it from time to time . I have gone though about half of it now , disguised it in wet food and blended it - same result ... ends up at the bottom of the mix . I 'm sure they get some of it , but seems i throw out about half of it . So , be warned , dogs and horses will probably not have an issue with it , but cats are picky eaters and you ' r rolling the dice as to if they will eat it ... i suspect , no matter what , they will leave most of it unless they are starving i 'm going to throw the rest out.Second , I have n't seen ANY change in any of the animals -LRB- six weeks now -RRB- ... just fyi.Now , the MAIN reason i gave it two stars was because I tried to contact them twice with a question and NEVER got an answer . for that reason alone I will never purchase their products again .
 After having a tough time with my dogs allergies , I decided to give this product a try . I have n't . Noticed any changes . In my dogs skin or coat . Also it is almost impoossible to get her to eat it . Really hummed by this product .
 I have a pug with chronic skin problems and I was really hoping that this would be the `` wonder '' product . He still has skin problems . I think his coat might be a little bit better but he still has lots of flakes and itchy skin .
 One of my dogs has allergy/pollen issues every year for about 2 months ... Gave this to both my dogs for 5 weeks twice a day in food and did not help to promote healthy skin , hair . . Did not grow hair . My one dog is a bedlington terrier mix , is 12 yrs old and has never had skin / hair issues , but after taking this for 5 weeks I actually started seeing him itch , probably the 1st time in his life , I guess he could of had a reaction to something in it . Thought this would be a good vitamin supplement for them , but it was money wasted for me .
 I would give this product a `` minus 2 stars '' if that option was available . Priced a bit high , but used as directed would last a long time , if you could use it . My older dog did not like the taste . My younger dog did n't seem to mind . Both dogs had diarrhea after using this on their food as directed . I even reduced the dose by half and still their poops were loose . I shared some of this product with a friend . Her large dog had loose stools after eating it as directed . Ca n't say what it does for the skin and coat , but works well as a laxative . -LRB- I do recommend PetNaturals ' `` Skin & Coat ; '' chews . My dogs like the taste , and I did see improvement in a couple of weeks . -RRB-
 Years ago I had my dog at a dog show where multiple vendors sold their products . I had just bought a sea kelp supplement from another vendor and then when I met Sissy Harrington-McGill from Solid Gold she saw me product and said `` that is from the North Sea and everyone knows that after Chernobyl all products from the North Sea are radio-active and you will kill your dog if you give him that . Unbelievable that someone would blatantly bash a competitor like that . The jet stream goes around the World clockwise or West to East and that area is pretty is North East of the accident . There may be radiation there from the accident and it would be fine if she said you should do some research about the accident and possible radiation contamination as oppose to saying if I give him this stuff he will die ! FYI I did give him that stuff and for an Akita Husky male - he lived to about 12 which was pretty damn good for a big dog .
 Got this for my dog who has lymphoma and is undergoing chemo . My dog 's been eating grass and sometimes dirt and other dog 's poop , so I thought she was lacking a nutrient . I was going to just buy a multivitamin tablet but this was cheap with good reviews so I thought it would help.Its made of ground up seaweed with flaxseed meal and some dried pineapple flakes sprinkled in.My dog still eats grass after having been taking this supplement for 1 month.This supplement also makes me concerned about my dog 's teeth . I think the pineapple flakes are acidic and make it easier for tartar to buildup on her teeth . Also the flakes become mushy when you mix it with warm water , as per the instructions . So when she eats it , theres this green flakey mush stuck inbetween my dog 's teeth that 's hard to clean out.So I dont like this product . I dont really see any effect , and it makes me worried about my dog 's dental health . I 'll stick to multivitamin tablets for my dog .
 Did not live up to what it was supposed to do . I wanted a kelp suppelment only seaweed meal . Did not even notice a difference .
 I am using these for gear attachment for diving , and they feel very chincy . I am disappointed with them . There is nothing wrong with them functionally , but this is an opinion ... right ?
 this watch looks like a million bucks but the chronometer function reset itself at the 45 position after a few weeks , which is disappointing . it 's not rigid . i 've had to have the band fixed three times as the pins have fallen out . for the price , it 's definitely not worth it . looks-wise , it 's worth $ 150 . but the mechanics are timex quality . invicta is hit or miss . pray you get a good one and do n't spend over a hundred bucks .
 I do n't know about you , but when I go out for a long range hike , I 'm budgeted when I do so . I have very limited funds for such a venture , so when I see this cheapy advertised as better than military spec and better , I think `` Hey , that 's a great deal . '' Then I get it in the mail , I 'm all excited , I pull it out , first thing
 Shipping was slow and not shipped when promised . I paid extra for quicker shipping , lol , dont do it !!!! Very good quality though
 Length :
 Looks nice , installs easy , and has many game options , however the 20 registers as a 5 80 % of the time and the 1 registered as a 6 at about the same rate . This occurred from the first time I played . I will be sending it back .
 For a product that costs over 100 dollars , the packaging was surprisingly cheap . 10 dollar action figures have better packaging than this dartboard . I turned it on and realized that only 2 numbers functioned . I literally had to `` massage '' the entire board with my thumbs and miraculously brought the whole thing to life in 20 minutes . A few numbers still do n't react to the darts but a few kneads with my thumbs sort of made it a bit better . I wanted to pay more to insure that I get a higher quality board , but i was mistaken .
 I was very disappointed when I received this item . It was not protected at all . It was in the box that had the picture of the dart board on the outside . It should have been put into another box for protection . When we recieved it , then entire top of the board was cracked . Again very disappointed in the packaging .
 We bought this item hoping it would stand up to our family of four and our love to play darts . The item worked for about one hour . Three of the six darts broke within that first hour also . It seemed if you threw a dart too hard or near the center , the machine just simply went `` black '' . We had to start our game all over again . It was disappointing with the cost of the game and discription stating it is durable . We returned it .
 the board simply went crazy restarting every time i switch on the board . it looks okay on the first day everything was find with few bounce out.if you think of getting this board look somewhere else .
 I purchased this dartboard via Amazon prime for the free 2day shipping . I have bought this board previously from a local shop and left it with my previous roommates . As such , I am familiar with what a new board includes . The board I ordered from Amazon lacked the AC adapter and the protective film that covers the display had already been removed . The board works fine but I gave a 1 star rating to draw attention to the serious quality control issues at Amazon . Buyer beware .
 Extremely disappointed . It worked well for the first 2 weeks , then an error developed that ca n't be fixed . I ca n't even open the frickin thing because there is a warranty seal on it . In order to get it fixed , I have to pay the return shipping for their original non-working product , then possibly a fee on top of that . Absolutely horrible business practice to make the customer pay return shipping for a product that fails within the warranty period . Seeing if I can get an exchange through Sams Club so I do n't have to send it to the company .3 bad reviews , to 8 good ones should tell you not to buy this product . For DMI Sports , Inc. it is inexcusable to make a customer pay return shipping and a possible fee for THEIR non-working product . DO NOT BUY !!!
 I 'm in the process of returning my third Arachnid 6000 . Looks great but all of them have the same problem out of the box . Halfway through a game the game resets .
 This was a gift and when it arrived I was a bit disappointed not at all what I expected and was really expensive
 This product did not work right out of the box . It heated up fine but no fog . I checked the things the manual said to check with no luck . The pump did n't seem to be pulling any insecticide up into the tube . Seeing it looked pretty simple , I unscrewed the brass fitting at the end of the tube that pulls the insecticide into the burner . Inside is a small ball bearing that acts as a ball valve , and a spring . I suspect the spring was either misaligned or the brass fitting was screwed in too tightly to allow the valve to function properly . I replaced the components , screwed the brass fitting back on , and the pump now functioned fine . I still have the fogger , but only because I ca n't find an inexpensive alternative that performs any better .
 I purchased this for outdoor use in an open field . With volume turned down to half , the voice was maybe carried about 30 yards which basically means , I could have yelled over people to that distance . If turning up the volume over the half mark , we got serious feedback and distortion . The two sirens were not associated with the volume and were way too loud even for outdoors . Yes , it gets your attention but to the point of it being a noise nuisance . I do not recommend this megaphone and if I had another opportunity , I would have paid the little extra for the 25 watt.Pros
 A couple years ago I bought several BB gloves to someday play catch with my son . Pulled them out & all were fine except the Rawlings Playmaker glove I 'd bought for myself . All the top layer of `` leather '' on the back had flaked off ! Yes , purely cosmetic but a very poor showing from what used to be the top company . Others are Mizuno & Spaulding , I 'd recommend them .
 Perfect when they arrived and after one use in the chlorinated YMCA pool , the front of the jammers was all pilled up . Not sure how many uses they 'll get before you can see right through them . For the price , they should be a bit stronger material .
 Great fit , low price , but it is made from really thin fabric and does not last long at all , will spend more for different brand .
 after a few days use , the color faded and the jammer is full of knots.I will not buy this product again .
 I 'm a little confused about thisProduct FeaturesIt is a machetteIt comes with the feature Polypropylene HandleAlso with Cordura SheathIt comes qualityAfter i read this , i thought a machete and a sheath are included , but what I received was only the sheath , was it mistake or this item have the sheath only ?
 There are better glasses out there for the price . The ear pieces on this model crumble . This causes the glasses to slip off your face . The warranty wo n't cover the glasses if they slip off your face and break even if it 's due to faulty ear pieces . Buy something else . The `` Life Time Warranty '' does n't exist .
 got chafed and bruised from this one . i think the cutout made me feel like i was being stuffed into the hole . i was hoping to like it better than the planet bike one -LRB- no bruises or chafing -RRB- , because i do n't like the way it looks , but i 'm switching it back .
 This seat is unsafe and gets in the way . Unless your arms are half again the length of a normal person you will be right on top of your child . The quality of the unit was ok . The function was deplorable.I would never recomend this over a rear seat or a pull behind . Do n't through your money away on this .
 This product may have changed through the course of a few years , because my neighbours and I have different ones . It may not fit into most bikes because it requires a fairly long steering tube . Even if it fits , it may loosen later . There is no head support , so my daughter was very uncomfortable over very short distances . Basically , I have returned my product !
 When I saw this baby seat on Amazon I got very excited . Riding with my baby between my arms with both of us watching the road ahead seemed like a lot of fun . Plus , all the customer reviews reassured me this was the best I could get.However , once I got it I noticed the mounting hardware , particularly the stinger -- a 7-inch steel bar where the seat slides for mounting/dismounting -- would represent a lot of trouble.Sure enough , once installed the stinger sits right in front of you and it simply is too dangerous to have a 7-inch steel bar pointing at you when you ride . You just wo n't be able to use your bike without the baby seat on.This is a serious disadvantage over back-mounted baby seats which can easily be dismounted for riding solo.I hope new prospective buyers find this information useful .
 This is not a safe product . I do not know what I was thinking . After riding twice with my daughter in this , I am getting rid of it . She did not enjoy it and just kept trying to turn around to see mommy , and I was white-knuckled trying to keep the bicycle under control . It was extremely difficult to maneuver with her seated up there . This is not for us ! I have come to my senses .
 I 'm sorry but this is simply not a safe option to carry your child . I cant even believe it is on the market.Just think of what happens when you crash your bike . All of your momentum is moving forward . And with this carrier you put your child right between your heavy body and the handlebar , or pavement , or another vehicle or bike if you run head on into someone !!!! I can just imagine someone jamming on the brakes , the bike and child stopping but momentum carrying the bikers chest and body right down on to the top of their child 's head . I shudder to imagine the injury and trauma this might cause . Come on ! Would you strap your child 's car seat to the front bumper of your car ? When you are piloting a bike your first priority is to operate the bike , not making goo goo ga ga faces at your child!Since your baby wo n't be able to speak up I will ... DONT PUT THEM IN THIS DANGEROUS POSITION.As far as what to buy
 I started seeing these child seats about 6 months ago and could not belive that these are being sold stateside . The has to be the worst idea for trasporting children since just riding on the handlebars . It is hard to imagine that any parent would strap their own child to the front of a bike and ride . This is just a bad idea . For any parent who is considering buying any child seat , please look at either a trailer of just getting them self propelled on their own bike . Remember , these seats are mounted higher and your center of gravity will be affected as well as changing the handling of your bike . 25-35 lbs will make your bike unstable regardless of your ability and skill level . If you go down , they go down . Having been in the bicycle industry for 20 years and being a parent myself I feel that this product should be banned . Thanks for reading & be safe !
 How well you will like this seat depends on your particular bike frame . Some people do n't have the same problems that I have . I recommend going to a bike shop that sells them if you can and try it on your bike . I personally feel it 's only worth buying if you already have a rear mounted bike seat and need a front one because you have 2 little kids.PROS : * People like the seat and you will get lots of attention * The seat is super easy to install and remove if you want to bike without the seat . * The baby has an unobstructed view . * It 's easy to steer and handle the bike even though it does n't look like it would beCONS1 . For me personally , it makes me feel claustrophobic . I 'm 5 ' 7 '' and have a cruiser type bike . My knees hit the seat unless I open my legs a little . It 's manageable but annoying and not good for long rides .2 . You have to keep your seat low so that you can touch the ground at stop signs . I ca n't get off my seat and straddle the bike because the ibert is in the way . This makes it more work to pedal .3 . The seat is overpriced . It is cheaply made of plastic with no padding for the child .4 . The back of the seat is too low so the child ca n't lean back and sleep . Why not just make it taller ?? 5 . The seat wobbles a bit .6 . The seat belt is very cheap and flimsy . It 's not like a regular stroller harness . It 's hard to describe but all I know is I ca n't get it to stay on my baby 's shoulders right .
 Before ordering the iBert seat I read many of the reviews here , so I was a little hesitant . I thought it would probably be fine , though , and the idea is so brilliant that I ordered it . When it arrived a few days later , I was so excited that I immediately installed it , which only took a few minutes and very little skill . I then put my 18 month old son in , put his helmet on , and we went for a ride around the cul-de-sac . My son LOVED riding in it . It was way more fun for him than in our bicycle trailer where he usually rides.I am only 5 ' 4 '' , and I had to ride with my knees out , which was awkward . Also , because the seat attaches to the handlebar post , when I turned , even gently , the seat swings way out over my knee and I can not continue to pedal . I commute by bicycle with my child , so we would have used this seat a lot . These issues were serious enough that after thinking about it for a few days , I decided to return the seat . After a lot more research , I decided to get the Chariot SidecarrierChariot SideCarrierinstead , even though it is far more expensive.So to sum up , the iBert is a fantastic idea , a lot of fun for kids , but uncomfortable enough for the grown-up that I would not want to use it daily . I was really disappointed after having such high hopes .
 I researched soooo many child seats and wanted this one to work . It 's did n't , no matter where I positioned it . I 'm 5 ' 2 '' and found it impossible to ride without my legs hitting the bottom of the child seat . It was dangerous when stopping , because of insufficient room to get my legs down to hold us both up . Also , no matter how tightly my husband and I attached the seat , after a few blocks it would shift to one side -- made worse when my son fell asleep with his head leaning to one side , making it incredibly difficult to steer.I returned it after two bike rides . It 's just too dangerous .
 Despite al the research I did online the ibert did not fit correctly on either of our bikes . My mountainbike stem does not extend as shown in the instruction photos . I managed to install it on our beach cruiser but could n't turn the handlebars more than a few degrees before it hit the side of the ibert . Because of the shape of the wide beach cruiser handlebars turning was dangerously limited .
 I had such high hopes for this child bike seat and it fell flat on it 's face ! I read all the reviews and it seemed great . In reality though , it is extremely awkward and very dangerous . I am a woman of average height and build -LRB- 5 ' 6 '' and 140 lbs -RRB- . There is only 6 '' clearance between the child seat and my bicycle seat even with the child seat pushed all the way forward . This makes mounting the bicylce next to impossible . Also , my knees hit the child seat when pedaling , even when adjusting it as high as it will go . Please beware of child and parent safety before using this bike seat ! I am returning it and starting my search over .
 If you intend to get any kind of decent workout , while riding around with your kid ... do not pick this bike seat ! I have six bikes . Due to clearance issues , this seat would only fit on one of the six . It will probably work with most cruiser bikes . The position of the seat forces you to pedal with your knees spread out , which is ok for a while , but gets uncomfortable after 10 minutes or so . The rear mounted seats are much better IMHO .
 I loved the idea of the i-bert . Not available anywhere locally , I had to order it online and was thrilled to find it for a decent price on ebay . This turned to disappointment . I am 5 ' 7 '' and I need to have my saddle on the lowest setting in order to safely ride with the ibert installed . Which makes it very uncomfortable to paddle and I am not able to use it for any kind of longer trips . Otherwise with the saddle at the correct height for me , it 's almost even with the ibert and I am not able to get safely and quickly on and off the saddle , because there is not enough space between the ibert and the saddle when they are almost at the same height . If you are shorter , this might work for you , as your saddle would be at a low setting anyway . Maybe it 's also the type of bike I have , but I am not going to get a different bike to accommodate a child 's bike seat ...
 I read a lot of reviews about this seat and they all had positive comments , I ordered this product and found out it did n't fit correctly in my bike and when I finally got to install it , I could only ride straight , I could n't turn and i had to return it . Make sure it fits before ordering .
 I am 5 ' 4 '' and have a Raleigh Women 's Mountain bike that was not compatible with the iBert . When installed , my infant 's legs were underneath the gear shifts , so I could n't shift gears . I modified my handlebars to raise them , but that did n't make much difference . In addition , I could not ride without really bumping my knees -LRB- it was not a minor inconvenience -RRB- . There was also no way to safely mount or dismount the bike because there was n't enough clearance between the iBert and my seat . When coming to a stop , I could n't put my feet on the ground and had to really lean to one side and balance on the toes of one foot . Too bad , I was really excited about this product . I think how well it works is 100 % dependent on the adult 's bike frame - and I have no doubt that if it did fit my frame , I would have given the product 4 stars . iBert should give some instruction as to frame sizes that are iBert compatible .
 I am writing this review less than 24 hours after having a minor accident with my one-year-old in his ibert seat . He sustained minor injuries to his face , but it could have been much worse if we were going faster . Before I begin , it should be noted that the proprietor of the bike shop where I went to buy my boy 's helmet informed me that these seats are still not legal , even though they are being sold online . He does not sell them for this reason , and does not recommend any front-mounted seat because of the dangers of how a front impact would manifest . Coincidentally , this is exactly the kind of thing that happened to us , only one week after purchasing this seat and on our third ride.We live in Chicago , where we have a beautiful lakefront path that is very safe and free of cars . However , one must ride the streets to get to it . Usually , we have a direct path to and from the lakefront on side streets that have bike lanes . Yesterday , one block of the return route on the side street was blocked off for road work . It was poorly signed and the large metal street plate that my front tire caught on was the same color as the street , so as I turned the corner for the detour , we were obstructed by this plate and went down . My little boy face-planted on the street plate in some loose gravel . There was no way I could prevent this even though we were going very slowly . -LRB- He also had his helmet on correctly and it slightly malfunctioned , but that is another review . -RRB- I realize now that the placement of the seat prevented me from seeing the road directly below my front tire , so I misjudged my turn . Also , the nature of this accident was like a front impact -LRB- think `` doored '' by a car door while riding too close to the side of the street -RRB- , so my weight going forward caused more force on the front part of the bike , and the seat , and my little one . If I did not have the seat mounted on the front stem of the bike , we would not have gone down . Since there was an extra 25 pounds there , I could not safely correct once we hit the plate.There are a lot of issues here with how the signage could have been better , how the street plate could have been differently colored , etc. . But the fact remains that the nature of the front-mounted seat -LRB- maybe not just this one , but any front-mounted -RRB- contributed to this being a much more dangerous situation than it could have been . Perhaps for lakefront bike paths and quiet suburban or small towns this is a great fit , but for city riding it just does n't feel like the safest bet , no matter how slowly and cautiously and alertly the parent is riding .
 We were pretty excited to try this device out . So we decided to buy a really nice commuter bike since this would not work on my wife 's road bike.Unfortunately after installing this , we had to lower the seat post all the way down , and the ride is still not comfortable . The ibert is placed as far forward as it can be , and the saddle is placed as far back as possible . The problem is there 's not a large enough gap between the saddle and the ibert if my wife needs to stop without tilting the bike a lot.We contacted the company , and they said that this was a problem for many smaller bikes . At the time of purchase -LRB- and now -RRB- there was no mention that this might be an issue on the web site.We might experiment a bit with this , but we may end up having to re-sell this , and purchase a rear-mounted bike seat . I think this product would be great on a larger bike , my child truly does love it .
 I love the idea of this seat but it does not work for shorter women or men . I am 5 ' 3 '' and attached to my mountain bike . I only had a couple of inches between the back of the iBert seat and my seat . It was impossible to stop safely because there was no room between me and the seat . To stop , you would need to lean sideways on one leg and tilt the bike significantly.I had a male friend who is 5 ' 7 '' and he had difficulty stopping for the same reason . Definitely make sure this seats your bike and your body frame before purchasing.I do n't write reviews often but this seat offers limited compatibility for smaller frames .
 This is the first time in a long time that I regret the purchase I made on amazon . With the seat installed , there is n't enough room for me to comfortably fit behind the child seat . I am about 5 ' 6 '' and have a smaller womens bike -LRB- Breezer brand -RRB- , so maybe that 's part of it . Also , there is very little space for my child 's legs . The handle bars really pin him in . I do n't like this front mounted design at all.I should mention that my child loves it - riding up front with a steering wheel . But it 's just too unsafe for me to ride .
 I purchased the iBert seat yesterday . It will not fit on my 2007 Specialized Expedition Elite . I need the Stinger to be about a half inch longer . I have looked on-line to see if there are longer attachments , but so far no luck .
 I bought this seat with high hopes that we 'd be able to ride around safely our little one . We have 2 mountain bikes -LRB- high end -RRB- , and were looking to just cruise around the paved bike lanes by our house . Well after installing this seat on my girlfriend 's bike -LRB- mine has carbon fiber headset spacers ... so out of the question -RRB- , I noticed how it bent the aluminum on my girlfriend 's headset spacers . Even after tightening the bolts properly , the seat moved when I put my 2 year old in the seat . Not only that , but he could touch the brakes/shifters , which I did not like . He only weighed 20lbs at the time , and already looked too big for it . Width was just perfect for him , and his feet hit the limit on the seat . -LRB- specs say up to 38lbs , which I find hard to believe . The only way I can see this seat working is if you have steel spacers/steerer tube to mount this to AND your child is under 2yrs/25lbs . I returned this seat -LRB- had to pay a 15 % restocking fee -RRB- and bought theWeeRide LTD Kangaroo Child Bike Seatinstead . Fits up to a 4 yr old/40lbs and is mounted by the headtube and seatpost of the bike . Feels 100 % stable and we all love it ! I 'd recommend taking a look at this seat , if you are interested in the iBert .
 SO SAD . i wanted both my boys on my bike with me , and this product was so built up but didnt even come close to work ! im athletic , strong and healthy , even adventurous , but there was about 8 inches between my seat and the ibert , and my chin would rest on my sons forehead if i could reach the handle bars ! where i bought it , the guy didnt even let me get out what type of bike i had , he said it worked with all bikes . but seriously i could not reach the handle bars at all ! not even close , they are below my sons knees !
 This was a product that sounded like a great idea and turned out not to be.I thought I liked the idea of having my son in front of me on my bike until I got this seat and started thinking logistics.There is very little space between the seat and me , and I have to sort of reach around the seat to steer and brake -- to say this feels unsafe would be an understatement -LRB- I have returned the seat without ever using it , as I did not think it was safe -RRB- . And while I like the idea of having my son where I can see him , I realized that in reality I would be putting him up where stuff -LRB- gravel , bugs -RRB- could fly in his face . I 've since noticed that many other front-mounted seats I 've seen pictured online have `` windshields '' for the children inside them . Also , most other seats I 've looked at having padding inside for the child ; this one is just hard plastic and seems like it would be rather uncomfortable for the child on any but very short rides.Finally , of the three bikes I own , I could only mount this seat on one . On one , the stem of the steering column was too short -LRB- I could have bought a longer one and had it installed , at a cost of about $ 150 -RRB- . On the second , the handles curve in a way that makes it impossible to mount the seat -- they interfere with the leg portion of the seat . Only one of my three bikes would actually accommodate this seat -LRB- all three are pretty standard , ordinary bikes -RRB- .
 I was very excited for the first use of the iBert , based on the benefits outlined by its front-of-bike design . But , my excitement quickly turned to great disappointment as my knees bang the bottom of the iBert on every pedal . I now have to choose between inefficient bow-legged riding , or a return of the item . I am 6 ' 1 with long legs and perhaps that poses a problem for the design of this product . So , if you are an experienced and efficient biker and are looking to maintain your good body position , you may want to reconsider.Tim -- Denver , CO
 I looked at several other front mounted seats like the BoBike , Yepp Mini , and an old Hamax and it seemed like this one would work best with my bike -LRB- cross bike with threadless headset -RRB- . But I have a smaller frame bike for my height -LRB- 5 ' 8 '' -RRB- since like many women , I have a fairly short torso and longer legs - compared to male proportions . The seat mounted easily but when I tried to test ride it , I could not get on and off the bike - there was not enough space between my seat and the child seat . Not even close ! Very disappointed . I finally got on but then my knees hit the iBert . The manufacturer should give a minimum distance needed between the stem and saddle so that those of us with smaller frames wo n't waste time .
 With the incredible number of positive reviews , I was really excited to buy this seat . Unfortunately , I am most likely going to return it unless I decide to get a new bike . The iBert seat does fit onto my bike , as they say it will , but I do not fit on the bike when the seat is attached . To me , their claim that it fits every bike is a half truth.The iBert seat was very easy to attach to my bike -LRB- less than 10min -RRB- , but there is no room for me once the seat is attached . I am 5 ' 10 '' and put the seat on an a Trek 830 with a 21 '' frame . With the iBert seat on , there is so little space between the back of the iBert and the front of my seat that I can not stand over the bike when it is at rest . This means if I come to a red light , I would have to lean onto one leg while balancing the child rather than standing over the center bar with both feet securely on the ground.Also , iBert claims the seat is easy to remove so you can ride when your child is not with you . While the seat does come off easily , this leaves the `` Stinger bar '' exposed and moving when you turn your handle bars . If you have to stop suddenly , it would be very easy to gore yourself . The entire Stinger assembly can be removed in less than 5min , so it may not be a big deal , but iBert claims you can leave it on when you ride without the child seat . I think this would be very unsafe.I will look for a different bike that might fit the seat as I love the idea of it . For now , however , I am simply disappointed .
 There were no specifications indicating the model , which ended up not being the current model -LRB- the current model is a 2010 to the present and I purchased this in April 2011 -RRB- . This model has a shorter leg length than the current model . Be sure to distinguish between the model being sold and the model you want . Your kids can stay in the seat longer if you get the current model . It is still a great product , but I am frustrated with Amazon for selling me an old model .
 I put this seat on my hybrid Trek 7500 bike , and I do have to pedal with my knees slightly bent outwards . I 'm not tall , either - instead average at 5 ' 10 '' . However , I do n't think having to bend my knees outward by this required amount affects my riding much , if at all . I think this is truly dependent on the fork stem . On my 7500 bike , the fork stem is angled slightly towards the seat , which in return leads to a lower placement of the bicycle seat into my knee area when pedaling . Bikes with fork stems can are more perpendicular to the ground most likely will not have this issue.I echo the complaints of others - the seat belt straps are somewhat worthless . The shoulder straps will certainly fall over the shoulder of your child . Even if you try to tighten them to the point that they are uncomfortable to your child -LRB- which you should n't , obviously -RRB- . I do n't think this is a serious issue , however , as the bicycle handle bar should also serve as a pseudo-safety bar for your child as well.My main gripe with this iBert seat is that plastic lap bar . The mechanism of how this locks into place is incredibly , and worthlessly , designed . In fact , it will eventually fail to actually lock into place over time - permitting your child to lift the bar up and out of the way . Granted , your child most likely wo n't be able to get out of the iBert seat because of the seat belt -LRB- if it 's still properly over his/her shoulders -RRB- and the legs are blocked by the handle bar . But , once my boy lifted the lap bar in the middle of a bike ride and as I tried to close the lap bar back into place , I ended up seriously maiming his thumb , as I did not realize that after he lifted the lap bar , he immediately placed his thumb through the hole where this lap bar is supposed to latch/lock onto.Plainly speaking , over time , the seat will stretch -LRB- it is pure plastic -RRB- and once it stretches its wideness past a certain point , the lap bar will not latch/lock into place any more , simply because of its poor design.I do not recommend purchasing this . Instead , I 'd get one of the others recommended among these reviews , such as the one that possesses a headrest to permit a sleeping child . My boy likes to fall asleep on this as well , and he does so uncomfortably and dangerously .
 I was pleasantly surprised with the simplicity of this seat and its easy mounting bracket . Took seconds to hook up . Unfortunately , it was very hard to ride the bike after the seat was in place . I had to shimmy into place on the bike seat and my knees would hit the iBert as I pedaled . Made it very treacherous to stop and extricate yourself from under the iBert . Also did n't work for my wife . We have pretty standard path/pavement bikes -- mine 's a Raleigh C30 and hers a Giant -- so I 'm not sure how this seat works for others . It has been returned and we are happy with our cheapy rear-mounted child seat .
 We really liked the concept of this seat , but it just did n't work out . For one , our bike 's stem could not be raised the required 3/4 inches , so I had to move the handlebars slightly off the top of the stem . The people at our local bike shop found this terrifying.The seat wobbles and rattles a bit . It seems secure , but the feeling is unnerving . I emailed ibert and they said some people had put duct tape in to stabilize it , but why would n't they fix this themselves?Aside from the difficulty of getting on the bike with so little space between the child 's seat and yours , the biggest reason we ended up returning it is because there 's NO support for the child 's head when they fall asleep . Our daughter would last about 15 minutes before she fell asleep , then it was difficult to support her head and ride at the same time.All the bike shops I went to thought that these front seats were a bad idea and now I see why .
 I have the same issue that the other one star reviewers have.While the seat seems promising , there just is n't enough clearance between the back of the seat and the bike seat if the bike seat is adjusted correctly . If you 're seat is adjusted correctly you should not be able to put your feet flat on the ground while sitting on the seat . This makes it very difficult to ride with the child seat installed . You either need to lower the bike seat or lean considerably when stopped.For those who like to have their bike seat very low , this seat seems like it would be a lot of fun . It is very sturdy and easy to install . However , it is almost impossible to have the bike adjusted for an adult rider and have the seat installed correctly .
 As an avid former cyclist , I could n't wait to get this on my bike and get back to some riding with my now one-year old . Unfortunately , this seat does not work for a short woman on a small bike frame!I am 5 ' 2 '' and attempted to put this on my mountain bike . When installed , the ibert does not leave any room for me to straddle the top tube . I could n't get on the bike!To get past this problem , I attempted to lower my seat out of normal riding position . With the seat in its bottom position , I could sort of hop and get one leg over . Now my knees are hitting the child seat cause I 'm so low and close to it ! Without being able to put my feet down comfortably , how am I going to stop and keep my balance with the baby onboard?I could n't reach the gear shifts , either . I do n't know how there would have been room for her torso and my upper body . I agree with the earlier review that suggested the company offer some guidance on bike sizes that are compatible with this seat . I am really disappointed to be returning this seat . Starting the search over again , for a bike seat that goes behind the bike . Not what I hoped for!For anyone accustomed to riding with decent seat height so they can get a full leg extension as they pedal , this is not the seat for you . Avoid if you are of shorter stature !
 I really like the concept - having your child in front looking up at you and touching your arms is great ! But the fact remains that when you come to a stop , you have no where to go but lean to the side ; and if your seat is up where it should be then you almost fall over - because the seat is directly in front of you , it leaves no room for you to stand over the bar . You may be able to get away with this seat if you are just taking this on very leisurely outings around the hood , but if you want to do any semi-serious trips , or will be stopping and going a lot at stop signs or traffic lights , this is not recommended.Furthermore , unless your child is very small or else you have arms like an ape , you will constantly be putting pressure on their head with your chest . And even if this is the case , it wo n't be but one season until they outgrow this seat . I wish the seat was on top of the handle bars - this would be a much better design . My recommendation is to spend half the money and get the classic Bell child seat that sits above the rear tire .
 Initially I loved this seat , it was easy to install , the directions were simple to follow . My seventeen month daughter used it eight times before the bike fell over one day in the wind . The bike landed and the child seat broke clean off the bar that attaches to the bike . I could n't believe how weak the bar was , I understand if the seat was made so that the bar would break if the child was sitting in the seat during a crash but my daughter wasnt even in the seat , and it wasnt a crash , the bike tipped over and fell and it did n't even fall hard . Was the bar faulty ? I will not be buying another . Its too bad since my girl loved using the seat . Any recommendations for another seat ?
 This product was difficult to use . I did not feel that I had the control I needed to have while riding with my daughter . I would not use this product again as I do not feel it is safe .
 I read many reviews before buying the Ibert . I am not a tall person at 5 ' 9 , but my knees do hit the seat . I do not feel comfortable riding with my child on a busy road due to the hitting of the knees . Also , getting off your bike seat quickly could end disasterously as well . The Ibert takes up some space , so you may hit yourself if you quickly had to jump off your seat . The Ibert seat did not work on my husband 's bike because the front post was too big , so you could not turn the handle bars at all with the seat attached . For my bike , we had to worry about the brake lines and the seat resting on them . I was quite excited to use this with my child riding in front so she could experience the world going by . But it has yet to be used in our house .
 When we first got this it was alot of fun . The kids love being in front . The problems I had with it was that the kids legs are right up against the handle bars -LRB- we have mountain bikes -RRB- . This also made it hard to get the kids in and out . Also , our kids are fairly tall , and the legs of the seat do n't go too far down , so they out grew it very fast . Our kids are also very thin ... but if they were bigger , I ca n't imagine them fitting in this too comfortably . Also , wehen they fall asleep , there 's no head rest , so their heads would kind of flop around . At one point , I had to take one hand to support my son 's head.I 'm not going to go through the safety pros and cons of having them up front versus the back . I think in the end it 's your personal comfort .

 If you are looking for a regulation size -LRB- or even close -RRB- dart board then keep on looking . We were very surprised upon opening this gift that not only was the overall size of the dart board small but all of the target areas as well . For example , the bullseye was 1.5 '' smaller than the one we were replacing . Luckily Amazon.com 's customer service is second to none and I printed out a return label in minutes . Time to keep looking , just a little late Christmas present .
 I bought this for my grandson for Christmas . When he opened it , he was so excited - it was just what he wanted . The lights and sounds were great and he wanted to play . -LRB- He 's 12 - not destructive , and did n't do anything to `` break '' the board . -RRB- His dad immediately went to get materials to hang it on the wall for him . They did n't even get to play one game until the thing quit working . They tried new batteries -LRB- even though they had started with new ones -RRB- , read the entire instruction manual to troubleshoot , etc. . Nothing worked . It 's a piece of junk . Do n't waste your money .
 A couple of months after buying this watch from Amazon.com one of the hands inside the dial fell off -LRB- maybe I dropped it -RRB- I took it into the local Cartier dealer to get fixed . . A couple of days later I got a call telling me that the technician had opened the watch and discovered that the screws were not `` original Cartier '' screws . I pressed them for more details but they would not provide anymore.I was charged $ 150.00 for the repairs . I did not tell them I bought it on Amazon.com out of sheer embarrassment . But obviously this raises a ton of red flags as to why this watch bought NEW on amazon.com would have non original cartier screws ? Is it a knock-off ? Is it used ? Was it bought new , ripped for parts , and then sent back by another customer ? I do n't know.Also , I find the bezel to spin a bit too freely compared to other Cartiers of the same model . . but this might just be me.So much time had elapsed when I bought it off Amazon.com that I could not even return it.Purchase at your own risk.NOTE
 My daughter loves the bike , BUT it arrived very poorly packaged . There was NO inner protection but some zipties and thin cardboard . There were some plastic protective pieces laying inside the box having fallen off what they were supposed to protect . The box was torn and had holes in it from being shipped by UPS . It was layed flat on my porch -LRB- though big letters on the box say NOT to lay it flat ! -RRB- . It also rained further deteriorating the box before I got home . The bike was damaged on the plastic gear shifter with a dent and crack from being rubbed against another part of the frame . It 's not worth the hassle of trying to return it in a destroyed box or letting a child down . Be sure you want to take the risk of this before you buy .
 Hand warmer did not last as long as I thought it would ... Instructions said it would last 24 hours , lasted less than 1 hour for me ...
 I purchased this as a gift thinking I was getting a deal on the discounted price for something the description touted glowingly . The poker chips , yes , are great . The Mahogany wood case is junk . a solid build but came with surface scuffs which is a tell for what this might look like after a few poker parties . The lock and key are flimsy and did n't insert or turn easily . One of the wooden braces came unglued in the shipping perhaps . The interior black felt was filled with wood and packing dust . I did n't hesitate to return this for a refund . This was n't worth the half price of $ 80 . It 's really something you might find at a Cheap Jacks near Macy 's on 34th Street for $ 40 , Maybe . So if they slash the price again in half you might consider it for your kids but definitely not a piece you 'd be proud to show off to the family and friends.Respectfully submitted for your consideration .
 I just returned this . it was dirty inside and the top had a bubble in the laminated surface . The item had obviously been sitting somewhere for ever since it was filthy inside and out and the interior sides had separated from the glue holding them in . i 'd expect to find this at the dollar general for $ 20 bucks .
 This set is just so , so . All the chips have a good color match , but they are all blank chips . The box has a nice color , but a hinge pin was missing -LRB- made in China -RRB- . The cards are complete junk , so just toss them . I did not get my Texas-hold-em chips . The lock and key are a joke . So for the money and as an entry level set its just so , so .
 I was n't expecting much , but was still disappointed . The &#34; Mahogany &#34; is just black paint on particleboard with a lot of blemishes . Two inside parts were unglued when it arrived . After spending time picking out a set with the right selection of poker chips , what I recieved did not match the picture . I did n't come with the dealer or blind buttons.The chips are decent quality and the box is cetainly better than the flimsy silver case that cheaper sets come in.Don ' t go by the picture - just expect a black box and 500 random chips . There are several sets to choose from , buy on price and not options .
 Tandem makes a wide range of supplies for volleyball and volleyball officials . Their hand pumps are fantastic , some of the best you can get for any type of ball . However , I do n't like their flags at all . I ref high school and Junior Olympics -LRB- USAV -RRB- competitions , and I think there are much better options . These are their least expensive flags , but the handles are smooth , finished wood , and I 've seen them slip out of girls ' hands a number of times . The grips are n't comfortable , either . Also , the fabric tends to separate from the rod , needing repair , and over time , the logo begins to crack and peel.They 're okay , if you need a cheap pair of flags , but they look bad after a while , and they 're a bit of a safety hazard . I would n't carry them as a professional ref , and I would n't recommend them . I do n't care for the more expensive Tandem flags , either , as the ones with plastic handles and metal rods are even less comfortable in your hand , and they 're not as solid as the ones with wooden rods . I 'd look at Molten -LRB- with golf grips , feel great and never get dropped -RRB- or Mikasa flags , instead .
 This sport suit seems to be made form american footbal players . The material looks like a cheap one . The pant is streched on the bottom side.I bought one size M but it 's XL -LRB- european -RRB- . I wo n't recommended at all . It 's ugly .
 We were very excited to assemble this bike tonight . The torn apart box foreshadowed what comes next . The bike came with neither pedals nor foot pegs as advertised !!! I ran out to Walmart and bought the last pair of pedals only to find out they do n't fit . Christmas morning will come with a bike that my son wo n't be able to ride and it wo n't look like the picture either because the pegs are missing too . Customer service is closed ; I 'm sure until after Christmas . I hope Pacific Cycle is good enough to mail them out overnight when they re-open after Christmas . I 'll update this review to let you know if they are ...
 This bike did n't last very long . My son was not happy with its handling . The parts wore out way too fast -LRB- handle bars , seat hardware , chain , etc -RRB- . This bike was for my son to get to and from school . I bought it because it seemed like a sturdy bike that would n't fail the less than a mile and a half ride to school . He has another bike for the ramps and stunts etc. . . this bike runs the risk of being stolen so he never rides it to school . They say you get what you pay for but I expected a little better quality than this .
 This product arrived damaged in shipping . There was consistent damage to other bikes that I ordered for a toy drive in my office . There is a systemic problem with the packaging of bikes sold by Amazon . Buyer beware .
 Placed order for this bike on Dec. 7th . supposed to be delivered no later than 19th . rec 'd email saying shipping had been delayed , it would ship around the 13th and we would receive an email confirmation of shipping . By the 16th , we had not rec 'd an email so attempted to call customer service line . For 3-4 hours the line was busy . When finally connected , I waited 45 minutes before speaking with a representative , who emailed for another representative to contact me -LRB- which I have not been contacted -RRB- because she was only able to inform me that the item had not shipped and that it might ship in 3 to 5 days . On the 17th , rec 'd email from amazon saying it has not shipped . I attempted to call customer service all day and have only gotten a busy signal . Still have not rec 'd a response of any kind from babyage . Item still hasnt shipped . Was to be Christmas gift . Amazon.com shows babyage has instock with 4-5 day process . If bike is in stock `` as advertised '' , why the delay ? be wary .
 This seller is not reliable . I ordered this bike for my son for Christmas . The order stated that it would be delivered between Dec 10 and Dec 15 . I called , a week after I ordered , to check the status of my order , because I had not heard from them , and they changed the date to Dec 19 . I am hoping that they deliver but the delay and change of date has me worried . The product description says that the bike is `` In Stock '' , if this is true what is the delay ?
 I 'll say right off that I bought this bike in purple for $ 190 and I see that the price has changed to $ 220 ish . Even for the old price of $ 190 I sent it back . First of all , it came from Wsports and had the wrong part on the left hand shifter . The counter sprocket grip shifter had 7 clicks where it should have had 3 clicks to accomodate the 3 counter sprockets . There are coincidentally 7 rear sprockets which is why I know they had put the wrong left hand shifter on the bike . I 'll also say that even if the bike had been shipped with all the right parts I still would have sent it back . It was n't absolutely horrible but nothing on the bike seemed to warrant its price tag . Derailleurs , v-brakes , kickstand , forks , handlebars , most all hardware seemed like the type of stuff you 'd find on a 90 dollar bicycle at a superstore like walmart or target . Also the frame was very heavy . It says the shipping weight is 25 pounds but I will approximate that this bike weighs near 40 pounds . I bought this bike along with a Schwinn Solution FS AL and the Solution is 100 times better bike . The difference in quality and parts of the two bikes greatly outweighs the 20-50 price difference . All the good reviews baffle me . I guess people just psyche themselves into being happy with what they got , but I know better and sent it back . Dont waste your time here . BTW I got a refund and bought another Solution FS AL instead .
 It was delivered without pedals so it 's hard to tell how it rides . It was also missing the front axle so there was no way to attach the front wheel so we ca n't even say how it coasts down the driveway.A call to Schwinn 's 1-800 number got a solution but no apology . The customer service rep did n't seem surprised the parts were missing . It seemed as if she gets these types of calls all the time . She said they 'd ship out the missing parts and we get them in 3-10 days . * sigh * When I was a kid Schwinn was THE bike to have . I still have fond memories of my Stingray . But missing parts and apathetic customer service have soured those memories a bit .
 Hard to tell if this is a good ride or not . It came without pedals or front wheel hubs . So , no place to put the feet and no way to attach the front wheel . Goodness knows what other parts are missing . Very disappointing from a company that made the wonderful bikes of my childhood
 Recently hosted a 45 person tournament so we ordered 2 of these sets . The chips do not come in the case -LRB- they are wrapped separately -RRB- and thats fine . The problem is the case handles . One broke before the chips were even in it . A close look and you can see the handle looks rather cheap.When the chips are loaded in the case -LRB- as they will be when ever you use the handles -RRB- it is way to heavy for this cheap plastic handle . It is a bummer because the chips are fine .
 DO N'T BUY THIS PRODUCT . I will personally NEVER purchase any other products from Trademark EVER again . All the black chips , green chips and 50 of the red chips are actually smaller than the rest of the chips . I 'm very disappointed by the fact that when I stack one set of chips with the others , I 'll have uneven stacks that have the same amount of chips .
 As others have mentioned , the chips that arrived are good quality for the price-per-chip -LRB- < $ 100 -RRB- . The fact that I have to drive home is the sheer weight of the chips + case . The case becomes VERY heavy with the chips inside it , and its large square size makes it awkward to carry in any other way other than by the handle.Therefore , to me the handle is a key feature that lamentably can not be trivialized as suggested by other fellow reviewers.It was the primary reason why I returned the set.A secondary reason is that the price is not exactly a `` bargain '' . After going to a local sporting store , I found a 500-chip set for less than half the price of this set - and that one included dealer buttons and 2 card sets . So I bought 2 of them . Yes I now have to haul 2 cases , but they 're infinitely sturdier and saved good money by buying a set with dealer buttons and cards already included .
 Despite assurances about shipping in `` one to three days , '' Warm Things is the worst mail order company I have ever dealt with . Their computer acknowledges your order , but they do not advise you whether or not they have shipped , do not respond to repeated e-mail requests for info , employees pick up the phone and hang up without answering ; if you eventually do get through to someone , promises to return phone calls with info are not honored , and the `` manager '' responded to the fifth phone call only by saying `` we have no way of checking whether your order was shipped , but there 's nothing to worry about , '' when in fact eleven days after ordering and obtaining a Warm Things `` order number '' via e-mail , I am still unable to find out even whether the vest was ever shipped , back-ordered , or out of stock , let alone obtaining the usual UPS or USPS tracking number . Chaos reigns . Avoid them !
 I live in Mexico and my sister who lives in Orlando was going to bring me the Alpine Goose Down Vest , but when she arrived with my `` vest '' I was n't it , the send me something I did n't order a jacket to go to bed , I do n't know but horrible and now I ca n't get my vest because I do n't have anyone comming to mexico in the near future . I am VERY disappointed.Nancy Aliaga Mexico City
 Strap broke and is practically impossible to replace . Strap is not a standard replacement and it is almost impossible to find a replacement that will fit . Save yourself some trouble and find a watch with a standard band .
 My son loved his watch until yesterday . The band broke and is irreparable . I wish we 'd read the other reviews before we bought this watch . It 's only 2 years old , but will now have to be replaced .
 I 've had this watch a couple of years -LRB- mine is actually a W-96H -RRB- , but will never get to test the 10-year battery guaranty , since the strap broke way too soon . Everything else was OK to excellent . Kept excellent time . Time and day were easy to read -LRB- only fair for the date -RRB- . The light made it readable at night . Survived swimming unscathed . Usable stopwatch . Crystal has held up without much scratching . Plastic case was strong enough , but the finish was only fair
 I bought this watch on October 17 , 2009 . The case broke on June 16 , 2010 . I took it to where I bought it and they said that since it was the casing that broke I had to contact Casio . I contacted Casio and they said to send it to them AT MY EXPENSE and they would let me know if the repair would be covered under the warranty . Well , you guessed it , it was n't covered . Can you believe that ? 9 months and they would n't repair it ! Casio said that they do n't cover the case under warranty . Well , gee , what is a wrist watch without the case ? I will NEVER buy another Casio watch again .
 I purchased this bike for my wife from fogdog through amazon . I must say the service was excellent.I did have to return the bike because it is very poorly designed . The bike 's frame was so short that the pedals would hit the front tire and you could get hurt riding it . In addition to the terrible design , it took me an entire day to get the brakes and wheels adjusted properly . The wheels were way out of true and the brakes would not align properly at all . I finally got it to an acceptable point with the wheels and brakes when we realized the pedals hit the tire.The bike seems to have the mongoose name , while the manual said Pacific . That leads me to believe it 's not a true mongoose . The mongoose name and the other review led me to believe it was ok to purchase.In closing , service was great and the bike was horrible .
 The chain broke on the very first ride my daughter took on this cheap thing . The box arrived on my porch with no visible damage to the box so I expected to find the bike in good shape . My disappointment started when I found the decals partially rubbed off making the bike look used although everything else looked fine . After cutting the tie wraps and removing the packing materials , I started assembly . First the seat -LRB- OK -RRB- , then the handlebars -LRB- OK -RRB- and then turning the bike upside down , the wheels were assembled . Upon spinning both wheels , the disappointment grew as both of them were out of true quite substantially . Nothing I can &#8217; t handle although I did not plan on spending an hour truing up both wheels . I then adjusted the brakes which was straight forward . Next was adjustment of the derailleur &#8217; s which again was easy enough although there was some difficulty getting the largest front sprocket and largest rear sprocket to work smoothly . I have worked on bikes all my life so I can live with the tuning and truing that needs to be done . What I can not live with is the chain breaking because of defective or cheap materials . Don &#8217; t bother with this bike . Especially for the price , I expected much better .
 Bought this bike for my wife . . You get what you pay for I guess , because this thing is junk . Every pre-assembled piece had to be taken apart and re-installed correctly . The rear derailleur was installed wrong and the bolt holding it on was cross-threaded making it a pain to place on the bike correctly . After killing a couple hours getting the rear derailleur fixed I moved on to adjusting the front derailleur . . The front derailleur had alot of play in it and when I tried to adjust the screws I realized that the excess play was allowing the screws to slip behind the adjustment bracket making adjustment impossible . Rather than return the bike I am going to purchase a new front derailleur and hopefully get this bike on the road , I refuse to let this piece of junk beat me ... do n't waste your money on purchasing unless you plan to spend more money making it work correctly .
 While I did not expect a ` rolls royce ' for $ 180 , I did expect a bike that would be fault free ! The bike was received scratched and the front gear could not be adjusted to select between 1-3 . The dilemma OJcommerce who sold the bike charge a 30 % restock fee!Quality of the bike was a disappointment even at $ 180 .
 I ordered a bike for myself for my birthday . I have YET to recieve a tracking number nor a reply to my `` wheres my bike '' email . I am unable to cancel the order because thats NOT one of my choices for available actions . I could have gone to a scrap metal yard and made my own bike by now . I guess that once again , I have gotten the short end of the stick .
 The log will work fine as a standalone , but the holes are not punched propoerly to fit in a binder . That 's probably why it is available so cheap . You can punch your own holes and make it work though .
 Very first day I got this I tried pushing a belt into the slots and the whole thing broke in half . I would not recommend ANYONE to buy this . They simply need to be taken off the market . Ca n't see how anyone can get away with selling something that is junk.-Mark
 My bike came with a hole punched through the seat , screws missing , and scratches all over the bike . It would cost too much to ship the item back as the bike weighs 70 pounds .
 Shipping damaged the bike on the first go around and the replacement that was sent included a dented front wheel , bent fenders , missing screws and the wrong assembly manual.Very unhappy because I spent all summer tracking down the shipping on this bike and have n't been able to ride it .
 Simply put , this product DOES NOT work ! Manufacturer puts out glowing reports and I spoke to them personally , but it just does n't work . It was used according to instructions and was given more than adequate time . Do n't waste your money on this one .
 This HR monitor was recommended to me . The size is nice for a woman , but I 'm finding it hard to set up . Also I think this will have interference with my FitBit , so I 'm not sure I will be able to use it at all .
 Bought this for my girlfriend to use at the gym in conjunction with the machines there . No brand of machine at our club picks up its signal -LRB- Precor , Life Fitness , or Octane -RRB- . It works fine on its own , if that is the users intended use . The Polar FS1 is the model we have chosen after this purchase , and it works flawlessly . -LRB- ~ $ 50 @ Target -RRB- .
 It worked fine for a while , even without interference from machines at the gym . Before a year was up , it stopped working . The watch part still works , but the strap does n't transmit any data . I have replaced both batteries and still , nothing . I would have expected more especially since I did n't beat it to death and wear it every day
 I chose the Timex HRM over a Polar HRM because 1 -RRB- This HRM has user changeable batteries on both the watch and chest strap -LRB- Polor chest strap batteries are not user changeable -RRB- and 2 -RRB- I thought I could get the same features on a Timex as I could on a Polar but for less money . Let me just stay straight out , I returned this Timex after using it for a couple weeks -LRB- Amazon was great about the return -RRB- because I hated using it , and I now own a Polar FT4 , which I LOVE ! I found the Timex VERY diffult to set up , the buttons/menus are not intuitive , and the buttons are hard and ackward to push . It also overcounted calories burned .
 Ugh . I purchased this HRM after reading all the reviews for it and for similar HRMs . I SO wish I had gone with my original thought which was to just replace my 5-year old Polar . Unfortunately , the days of a simple but well made HRM that just tells you heart rate , calories burned and time in zone are long gone . I had hoped that this Timex would give me what I wanted with a few extra features I could ignore . Not the case . I waited almost 3 weeks to review so I would n't be comparing it with my old one . In that time I have managed to make this thing do what I need it to do exactly once . I even brought the instruction book to the gym with me so I could follow the instructions exactly before I started my workout.This HRM is WAY too complicated for someone who just needs to keep track of their heart rate during a workout -- during pregnanacy , or if you are attempting to lose weight , or be more heart healthy . I needed it for calories burned as I am pre-diabetic and not once has it given me a result I can believe -LRB- 120 calories after an hour of intense cardio training ?? Alongside a partner whose HRM said 620 calories burned ?? -RRB- While I understand that much of my problem may be `` user error '' my point is that if you just want to press a button -LRB- labeled `` start '' as my old HRM had -RRB- and then push that button again at the end of your workout and get a fairly accurate read-out , this is NOT the HRM for you .
 This was an amazing purchase for me ... for the first 4 months . After that , the battery died really quickly in the chest strap , reading extremely low heart rates for about 2 frustrating weeks before it finally just crapped out . When it first reads your heart rate , it logs in at 30 , which is nearly impossible , and will stay that way for a good 2-5 minutes . Sometimes , it works really well , providing accurate readings as checked against treadmills and ellipticals and the like . It stays pretty accurate on the elliptical , but on the treadmill , it will sporadically read incredibly low -LRB- resting rate -RRB- numbers at a high-speed run ... and the numbers will climb up when slowing down . It 'll do that when road running as well.In all , it 's great when it works , and incredibly frustrating when it does n't -- and about 20 % of the time , it freaks out . It 's easy to read and to use , but useless 1 out of 5 times.P.S . I called Timex directly and they 're sending me a prepaid envelope to ship it under warranty . They said this sounds like a defect in the chest strap since it should not read 30 at the start of every workout . Also , they charge you for the return shipping , just as an FYI . Takes 4 weeks from send to return , btw.P.P.S . I received a new one , and it worked great for 6 months . Now they 're sending me yet another replacement chest strap since this new one stopped registering the heart rate again . Very annoying , but at least I 'm getting 6 months of use at a time for it !
 I bought and used it for about 5 weeks , everyday . After pushing buttons for hours , I finally got it set up with my details and it worked great , for a couple of weeks . Then , it stopped counting the calories -LRB- one of the main reasons I wanted this gadget -RRB- . The next day , it seemed to work again so off I went for another few weeks of daily workouts and calorie burn . Then , it stopped counting calories again and never counted another calorie after that . All the other functions seemed to work fine but the calories were zero every day for days . I finally sent it back and am searching for a replacement . Darn !
 I got large Costco sized bottles but found they did NOT do what all the hype claimed . There are much better leather care products out there . I tried Leatherique -LRB- google it -RRB- and did their recolor restoration on a Ekornes stressless chair while I had some issues with the color finish the rejuvinator and cleaner was amazing making lexol seem pretty much useless . I am looking into other leather care products but though I would share my experience . It is hard to find good leather care product in stores , the internet rules , try a tack shop -LRB- horses -RRB-
 Easier to use than tin of saddle soap but thank God they packaged it in a no leak bag because most of it came out during shipping . The top does n't stay on either . Poor packaging . Will be going back to the saddle soap in a tin the next time .
 For the money , it did very little to clean our sofa . Even though our sofa is not that badly stained , we had expected to see more results than we did and we both worked on the sofa in tandem and notices no difference and absolutely no condition of the leather at all .
 I bought this product with high hopes . This product is simply okay . Also , my bottle was broken upon arrival . Probably wont buy again .
 I followed the directions and washed my two tan leather front seats in my expedition . The cleaner has enough foaming and moisture to clean , but just did n't get much clean beyond the basic surface that water would have done just as well.My leather has tiny lines all through it , and even with a scrub brush gently cleaning , none of then got very clean.I think this product is designed for gentle cleaning of the leather surface , for those who perhaps get some food on their seats , and not for deep cleaning .
 I had a person out to my house to repair a leather car seat ; he recommeded this product to treat my furniture . I found that it takes the color out of my furniture upon testing it in a small spot . I now have a full bottle of product I can not use as it strips the color from the leather . I had heard great things about the product from this person ; beware , it may or may not work for you .
 The neck of the bottle was broken , when I opened the package the liquid poured on floor and wasted . I want replacement of refund . Thanks .
 Product seems to work fine but the bottle top was damaged in shipping because the bottles were not protected properly ... Shipper did not put any packing material in the box so the bottle slid around inside the box . . One bottle top was broken right off ... . Therefore I will not buy anything from Amazon again ... I tried to contact someone there but they keep themselves hidden from anything negative
 Did not get the gray dirt off my leather in my car . Disappointed in this product . I followed instructions but black dirt stains still there .
 I have since learned from several people/professionals I trust that good leather does n't require a special cleaner . Just a damp cloth and mild soap . You should condition your leather about once a year though -LRB- Lexol makes a conditioner which did come recommended -RRB- . FWIW , the first bottle I got broke at the neck in the packaging and it was a breeze to exchange it for a new one .
 I used both the cleaner and the conditioner as described but they did not make a difference on decent looking leather seats in my 2003 Sienna . If they made a difference I have not realized it.I do not regret buying these , I hope they will add to the life of the leather seats even though I have not observed a change in appearance .
 Tried cleaning a sweat stained leather had.Had no luck with this product . Hat looks just the same . :--LRB- : - -LRB-
 I got this Lexol Leather pH Cleaner Spray offline at a local auto parts store ... and I am glad I did.I start cleaning my car and the first thing I notice is the citrus smell . Suddenly half through cleaning the passenger front seat the sprayer broke . At this point the white cleaning rag I was using was still white and given I had not cleaned the seats in months I just returned it.So I went online and after much research orderedGriot 's Garage 11259 Leather Care Spray Kit . Well , the Griot cleaner cleaned old grime of the leather seats I had cleaned with the Lexol cleaner a week earlier.I have used a variety of leather cleaners over the years and in my experience this one does absolutely nothing .
 Followed the directions on the product ... . nothing . Tried it again , after reading ... . nothing . Did n't clean the grill as shown in the commercials or on the product packaging . Contacted the company , nice people but there did n't seem to be a solution . Just not cutting it .
 This set of products does n't even come close to living up to expectations . Do n't waste your money . Stick with the good old tried and true cleaners.As for the `` foaming '' products - if they call that foam , I call a melted ice cream sundae a treat ! -LRB- Strange analogy , I know - LOL ! -RRB- The products come with so many dos and dont 's and warnings about what surfaces you may have problems with that you 're half afraid to use it on anything.Run , do n't walk away from this product .
 Usually my purchases with Amazon are flawless , so I am saddened to have to write a bad review.This Bike came to us with the box crushed and literally broken and punctured held together with tape , I looked inside but really could not tell if everything was in there so we accepted it from Fed-XWe were missing several parts that we were going to try and just get from Amazon to make it work out , with out sending it back ; however when my husband went to put on the front tire we noticed the front forks were severly bent , he said it had to have been run over by a truck and would not be something repairable . In all fairness this is the ONLY time we have ever gotten a bad item from Amazon and they were very good to take it back without a hassle so we will continue to shop with them in the future .
 Product was difficult to use . It came with a video which was not easy to follow as the instructions went too fast before I had a chance to perform the task demonstrated . The balls were extremely hard and painful on the foot . This company needs to have an detailed instruction booklet so you can study the manuevers . I do not recommend this product .
 I paid almost $ 8 for one shirt ? I thought I would get more then one and I guess that was my fault on not knowing how many items you get when you buy from Stitch with us . I tried to return it and you only get about 4 in return . Im not happy with this company or the shirt at all . I will not make this mistake again . I would have kept the shirt if I would have known I wasnt getting a full refund ! I would have given less then 1 star but it 's not possible !
 I needed a cool , 100 % - cotton T-shirt to wear while working out . That 's how Amazon described this product
 This is the only Haynes T-shirt that does not bunch at the back of the neck . It is light and drapes well . But it is too light for printing .
 after about 6 wears of these t-shirts -LRB- worn under dress shirt0 , both collars started to fray w / cotton ballsnot a good deal , unless that 's the look you want
 As thin as paper , flimsy , ill-fitting , and NOT 100 % cotton as listing states . The size was way off , too . If you want a tee that 's so thin it 's practically see-through , this is the one for you . Better get several , though . I do n't expect it to survive a wash .
 Heavyweight ? It it the thinest t-shirt I own . Makes me wonder what a normal Hanes t-shirt is like .
 when I received these shirts they ask that instead of giving them a poor review to contact them . So I did and it was ignored.They never bothered getting back to me . Also these shirts fade pretty quick for a 50/50 blend
 The shirt looks comfy , but it is not &#34; teal &#34; as it says int he description . I am pretty disappointed , actually .
 The print on the inside of the neck gets itchy after a few washes as the ink cracks . Will not buy them again -LRB- normal tags are far better -RRB- .
 I 've ordered 6 size L T-shirts for my husband . All of them are kind of small compared to other `` L '' t-shirts I 've got , but half of them are way too small . It might say `` size L '' on the tshirt but it looks like an `` S '' . The fabric is weird , very thin and colours are not the ones shown on the website . Do n't buy it !
 As a rule of thumb to all buyers who have n't ran into any trouble with LEAD Apparel do n't buy an item from this company . I never received my order and then when I complained they gave me the runaround excuse that I received my item . Luckily I was refunded my money through Amazon and I wo n't spend another cent with LEAD again .
 I ordered the white color . This is only 50 % cotton , so I had to throw it away -LRB- I hated the touch -RRB- . Now I do see that in the description there is a note about it -LRB- 50 % -RRB- , but since the title states clearly 100 % cotton then this is very misleading and I feel I was cheated .
 I believe they should adjust the sizing for these shirts . I ordered my true size but would probably need to order one or two sizes bigger . It was so tight I 'm afraid to wash it .
 These shirts suck . The material is too thick and very coarse . It does not stretch at all . I got some Hanes `` ComfortSoft '' from Target and that material is great , much more comfortable than these .
 I bought one each of the deep red and deep royal colors.I hand washed them , fortunately separately , before wearing and both colors ran , and are still running despite numerous rinses .
 I received these T-shirts roughly two years ago , and have since replaced them . First thing that I noticed is that they are very irregularly sized amongst themselves . The cotton is rigid , and not as soft as what you can get for the same price elsewhere . The fit around the shoulders is small and awkward . Though these shirts are tagless , hanes produces other kinds of shirts in a tagged variety . That they do n't combine these things seems a bit contrived to me . Overall , I still have two of them as work shirts , and they probably would have lasted longer if I could have dealt with the awkward fit .
 These shirts are not really what you think if you are looking for something to lounge around in or work out in they are more form fitting . Disappointed due when someone buys in 4XL or larger they are looking for comfort and room to move in not to be so skin tight barely get them on or fight to pull them off . Very tight in the arms and pits not a good fit hard to move your arms . Nothing personal against the company sold them it is just Hanes brand themselves . I find they tend not to be consistent on their product manufacturing .
 I bought two shades of gray , one was 60 % cotton 40 % polyester , the other 70 % cotton 30 % polyester . I am completely dissatisfied with this product . It is clearly advertised as 100 % cotton , if you look closely at the pictures , they cleverly cover up the part of the print that should say 100 % cotton . A nice scam , I must say . Figures they are based out of N.Y.
 Bought these for my Nike Slingshots , they were a little tight and so they were a pain to get on and off . But the worst part was that they started tearing at the seams within 6 weeks.Stay Away !
 The texture of the cloth doesnt really stay on the golf clubs , plastic covers may hold better
 These iron covers appear to be good , but they do not fit well and fall off easily . I have been using them for less than a month and have lost two due to them falling off the clubs while in a cart . There must be better ones available .
 I bought these to replace a neoprene set I had for years that worked great . They were a worn and finally lost one.On the first round with these I lost one . On the second round lost two more . They just fell off .
 This is really useless and very cheap looking . Also , the fairway wood covers are just too big for fairway woods . Wish I had not bought it .
 This was a christmas gift for my parents to replace their old one . It was not good quality . They said it felt and looked like a child 's set . My parents will probably return it and buy something else . I do not recommend this product .
 I 've never been so unhappy with an Amazon purchase . The first one arrived damaged ; the bottom was loose and the finish was chipped . I asked for a replacement ; it was worse than the first . The top was broken and detached and the finish was once again chipped . It 's quite a shame as the design would have been perfect for my needs .
 For the price , this was a good product . Well made , packaged and delivered timely . However , I ordered two of the same item , shipped at the same time and when they arrived , they were two different colors . If that does n't bother you , than you are good to go . If it does , you may want to consider ordering from someone else . For the price , I did n't bother sending them back , but you may try contacting the vendor .
 I purchased this item as a gift and was embarrassed by the quality-the corner was damaged , and the item was warped so that the shelves were coming out of one side . THe stain was very uneven and it had a horrific chemical smell.I was frightened by the sticker indicating that the item passed the `` formaldehyde release carb '' , though by the odor I have my doubts . All in all a real bummer.I dont want to go through the hassle of a return . Already spent enough .
 I received a defected item and It was not the flag I order , the flag was sewm upside down
 Was not pleased with the quality of this merchandise.We thought the patriot symbol would be painted on the glass -LRB- vs the sticker decale we received -RRB-
 the problem is for that product is sweeting inside , i changed two times and the same probems both of them .
 This is a nice looking watch . I 've had good luck with durability with other Nike watches in the past . One negative thing about the watch is the date information is very small and difficult to set and see . The other major problem I had with this watch is that it stopped working after less than a month of ownership .
 Amazon describes these balls as `` lacquered wood bocce balls '' that come in a `` molded plastic case . '' These balls are some sort of resin , NOT lacquered wood . As such , they 're a dull color unlike the lacquered wood balls in Amazon 's image . Furthermore , the balls come in a nylon soft case -LRB- a case that sags when the balls ' weight is applied -RRB- , NOT the molded plastic case seen in the picture . However , the model number on the set I received is the same model number Amazon lists , so I can only guess that the set has changed over time to a cheaper version.My family still enjoys playing with this set , which is why I gave it two stars and not the lower rating it probably deserves .
 This net is alright . Not great . The picture shows that the net comes to a point at the bottom . Is it tied ? Glued ? No , you have to tie it yourself . Basically , when you get the chipping net - the net is open on both ends . How the picture shows the top open - this is how the bottom is . You have to bundle it up and tie it yourself . So at the bottom of the net is a bunch of extra netting - which is the knot - after you tie it of course . This chipping net seems to only work well outside . Comes with two hooks to anchor the base . These hooks have to be pushed into something soft - like the ground , grass , sand , etc. . If you use it indoors and ca n't anchor it down , when you chip into it , the net will fall over backwards . It 's an ok net for the price . The construction is n't the best - you could probably do better making one yourself .
 I got this watch and it looks great . The battery dies within 6 months . I went to get the battery replaced and the whole thing fell apart . VERY disappointing !
 My cats LOVE these toys . I have bought a total of 4 of these . The very first one lasted the longest . The 2nd one did not last very long as the circle ball part area snapped off separately from the feathers ... not in the part that is removable . Pretty much the feathers were no longer able to be attached to the stick . After these 2 ... I ordered another 2 . I attached the 3rd one and it broke off in the same spot IMMEDIATELY . I havent used the 4th one but im not buying anymore of these . What a waste of money .
 Feathers were soooo hard & stiff . . My cat really was not interested in playing with it due to it 's texture
 This item is huge . If you do not have a baby lion I would definitely stay away from this product . I have a 17 pound cat and the chain and toy are way toooo large even for him . They would hurt his pretty little face if it hit him . Would send it back but would cost me more in postage that worth . Would not recommend this for a household cat .
 Very disappointing . I got these for my son who is 7 though still struggling with tying . We got them and put them right onto this shoes . By the end of the first week they were coming apart the laces were fraying ... The clips that are suppose to hold the end of the laces did not stay on . He was coming home everyday with his shoes needing to be fixed and his soccer cleats fared no better . I have gone back to his regular laces . I had bought a pair for his basketc \ ball shoes and have taken them off before the season even starts so I do n't have to deal with them . They were not convient or helpful .
 $ 10 for this ? Really ? You can buy 3 mm -LRB- 1/8 in . -RRB- shock cord for $ 0.30 / foot at Annapolis Performance Sailing -LRB- APS -RRB- . -LSB- ... -RSB- Then get some toggles . I found this on Amazon , unsure of how competitive the price is , though . http://www.amazon.com/Amico-Plastic-Toggle-Spring-Single/dp/B008AOUNHS/ref=wl_mb_hu_m_1_dpI spent a whopping $ 12 at APS and got 4 different colors and enough shock cord to outfit 100 pairs of shoes . APS sells only Novatec brand cord -LRB- highest quality cord available -RRB- . One more thought , having extra shock cord is great for my kids . They pull ridiculously hard on the elastic and then a couple of months , it wears/shreads the elastic and then they 're trash . Since I have bulk cord , I simply replace the elastic.Don ' t waste your money on these laces , just make them yourself !
 These laces work ok , but they are not as well thought out as the keen laces they were replacing . The mechanism is larger than it needs to be .
 I followed the online instructions for these -LRB- i 'd planned to use them for my running shoes -RRB- , got what I thought was a good fit , snipped of the excess -LRB- as instructed -RRB- and went for a run . By the end of the run , it was clear that the laces were a bit too tight . But , as I 'd followed the instructions and -LRB- foolishly -RRB- snipped off the excess lace material , I ca n't loosen them . $ 5 down the drain.So be warned
 It seems an ingenious device , except after patiently following instructions , the device broke . I have a call into the manufacturer , but it broke ! Why bother ?
 If you wear men 's 9 1/2 shoe size and you want to string it to the top of the shoe 's lace hole , you have only an inch left to tie the knot and you will need a plier to tie it . And if you are my friend who wears size 11 shoe , you can forget it completely or you can buy 2 to make one and tie them together . The manufacturer is way too calculative and not to give an inch more on the lace.also the laces are way too tight n cut off your feet circulation.Update 7 mos . later
 On the box it says `` lemon yellow '' and the picture was different from the color that i actually got , its more like Chick Yellow .
 I would have rated this product as I love it however , one of the snaps that you put at the end of the laces is defective . It is only half the size of the other snap that functions hence , it can not be used . Now , I am stuck with laces that do not look nice , one has a snap , while the other one is just knotted to prevent the lock from slipping off.I ca n't believe it did n't undergo any quality assurance check before it was shipped out .
 On the surface , the idea of these laces seemed good . But in actual practice , the locks kept coming loose and I had to continually retighten them . Also , the laces themselves are too stretchy . I can not recommend these laces .
 These just did n't work out for me . Once you cut them and lock them , that 's it . If they get dirty and need washing , too bad . I tried just using them as regular laces , but they were too long . Oh well , If they were black instead of white getting dirty would n't have mattered . Live and learn .
 It 's a nice concept but does n't work in practice . I have a pair of Keen sandals that have their own lock type laces with only four lace rows and they work very well . They pull fairly easily straight through all rows just pulling on the lock end and they are about half as stretchy as these lock laces.It is a different story with adult running shoes or athletic shoes . My shoes have many lace rows and the laces do n't pull straight and easily through even a couple rows . Now I have to pull the laces tight one row at a time , like regular laces . The problem is that these super stretchy bungee laces want to slide back , so it is very difficult and time consuming to tighten and hold each row tight as you work your way up to the last row . Now I have super long laces that I have to tuck under one of the tightened down rows to keep them from flying around or tripping me . It 's painful , ugly , and unsafe . If I cut the bungees shorter , I ca n't loosen the shoes enough to get them back off , or more importantly , back on my feet the next time.If you do n't tighten your shoe laces and your shoes are a fairly loose fit on your foot anyway , this may not matter . If your child only has a couple rows of laces and they do n't need to be tight , then these laces may be fine , too.I replaced these after a couple uses with regular oval shoe laces . I can now appreciate the simplicity and suitability of ordinary shoe laces . It 's easy to tighten or loosen each row and get a nice tight fit that makes your shoe a part of your foot . Tie them with a bow and another knot for security to keep them a reasonable length .
 I got these for my 8 year old because his laces never stay tied.I put these on his new shoes and we ca n't stretch them enough to get his foot into the shoe . I pulled them too tight before cutting . Just a thought ... might want to do the first time `` lock lace '' of the shoe while it is on your foot .
 I wanted black laces of this type got pocadot gay . Shoe dyed them black however the dots come back .
 I have a lot of base layer stuff as I commute daily year-round on my bicycle . I got the underarmor as a gift so I put it in the rotation . I found that while it is good enough for against the skin comfort it does n't breathe as well as the wool garments I use . Also , it does a terrible job with odor control . I ca n't wear this more than once before it needs some cleaning whereas the wool will go as long as I care to -LRB- I mean forever -RRB- .
 Believing that i need protection from the elements of winter and having explored this garment -LRB- albeit a cursory exploration -RRB- at Dick 's Sporting Goods , i ordered this garment from Amazon.com.When this somewhat expensive purchase arrived , i tried it out . The sleeves are too long and it is difficult to put on and to take off . I would not order or buy it again .
 I 'm fairly new to masks so I may have bought the wrong ones . I do n't know . These do not keep smoke out at all!It 's also extremely uncomfortable . I bought a large because I have a medium sized mask that is slightly small . This `` Large '' mask was smaller than my medium one and digs into the bridge of my nose!If anyone can recommend a good comfortable mask to keep gases and smoke out I would appreciate it tons ! : -RRB-
 Absolutly worthless sizing information ! I mean , really ! Sm , Med Lrg , are you kidding me , I have a skinny 11 year old , are we talking women sizes or girls and what is the standard for any sizes . Done with Amazon clothing searches .
 This was not shown in black . This is the color that I want .
 It rarely attaches correctly and almost never locks down so it leaks and rarly fills the tire with air and never completely . Not to mention the secondary way for the pump to connect is weak and fails constantly . Expect to loose your water bottle holder .
 From a person who has gone camping all of their life , it was time to upgrade our family tent to a bigger one . We found this item at Dick 's Sporting Goods and it was on sale for 249.99 ! Brought it home and started setting it up . The first thing I noticed is what ended up being the cause of me returning this tent and going with a different brand . The floor of this tent is made from the same material as the rest of the tent . Most tents I have ever seen have a stronger material used for the floor -LRB- like the material that tarps are made from -RRB- This one seemed flimsy and I was worried about it lasting a long time with kids and pets running around in it.Just as I suspected , after barely setting it up , I found a rip in the floor and took it back . -LRB- Yes , I used a ground tarp -RRB- I opted for another tent -LRB- one with a stronger floor surface -RRB- . On the upside , this is one HUGE tent ! More room than most people would ever need and a curtain to separate the tent into two equal size rooms . The awning was a nice feature too ! The awning itself measured about 4 ' x 10 ' . If you are in the market for a nice sized tent , this may be what you are looking for , but PLEASE BE AWARE the floor is NOT as strong as most tents and hopefully , you have better luck with yours than I did with mine !!!
 Upon setting up the tent the first time I discovered a small hole in the floor and another in the back wall of the tent . If you folded the tent the holes would line up . I also noted that the screen roof had a run in it . -LRB- like a nylon sock -RRB- . Water leaked in the large back panel where ever a tab was sewn in . These seams were taped . None of the other side leaked.Even though the warranty states Eureka would repair or replace the tent Support stated they had nothing to replace it with.It will also take 6 to 8 weeks to repair . My camping came to a stop . I had to pay to ship it back .
 Holy cow , for the amount of money that this big brand Eureka tent cost me , I was FLOORED -LRB- literally ... ha -RRB- by the floor ! It is absolutely paper thin and made of the exact same materials as the walls . We have owned a lot of tents , both family and backpacking style . Both high end and low end brand wise , and this is the WORST floor I have ever seen in a tent period . I would n't trust this not to leak for one second . Also , and perhaps a fluke , were the holes and snags in the ceiling of my BRAND NEW TENT . I set it up inside my house , looked up , and saw 2 dime size holes in the mesh ceiling . After checking more carefully , there were probably 5 or 6 other good size snags on their way to being holes in the ceiling and I had just taken it out of the box . This is the second tent -LRB- the first was not a Eureka -RRB- , that I 've set up at home and had to return this week . I know it sounds picky but for $ 300.00 I want things to be of reasonable quality . Bummer . I 'm still on the hunt for a quality mid-priced family tent . : -LRB-
 I have tried the EddieBauer 2-Room mammoth tent on many trips in all types of weather . I have three of them since they have proven to last , but I wanted to upgrade to something larger with easier openings and an extra covered area outside of the tent . After reading the reviews on multiple websites , I presumed this would be my best option . Upon receiving the very heavy tent , I noticed that the carrying case it came in is very thin polyester , with only one zipper , making it difficult to close when packing . The tent it self was a very simple design making it easy to set up , although I recommend using two people if you do not have decent upper body strength and good arm length.The poles were all very light , but with light poles comes thin material . The first pole snapped once I tried connecting the elbow . Luckily I was able to fix it by slipping and sodering a metal tube over the cracked metal . -LRB- The wire within the pole remind intact -RRB- After everything was set up I was shocked at how big this tent was , its incredible and will easily prove itself to be the biggest tent at any site -LRB- Whether you like that or not -RRB- . After entering the tent , I noticed that the floor of the tent was made out of the same materials as the walls - thin polyester material . I know that the other reviews already mentioned this , but make sure you get a very good tarp to put under this tent , because I can bet the floor will rip with the smallest rock or twig . I am taking it out two weekends from now & bringing a back up tent because I really dont believe this will last.End Result
 Purchased this item to go camping for a week . It rained for two days . Water leaked in through the window and door zippers . I returned it and received a full refund .
 This was our third tent owned . We loved the roominess -LRB- able to fit king size air mattress , two children 's cots and two full size dog beds , plus a camping potty -RRB- and the ability to put up awning.I 'll start with the awning . Very easy to install , but unsteady during winds . The first rain shower this tent took in 90 gallons of water . Thankfully , we were camping on our own property ! Took hours using our 10 gallon wet-dry vac to get out the water . We put the tent in our barn to dry out the rest of the way , and since we did n't stake it down the poor thing fell over putting a good size gash in it 's rainfly . No tears shed , but it will be missed.Purchased a smaller Coleman Instant tent & absolutely love it !!!! In one fall weekend camped at two cub scout family campouts and able to put this tent up with my 10 y/o son and I. Have n't experienced rain with this one yet .
 The picture associated with this item is incorrect , so what you see is not what you will end up getting . It is a 12 '' vinyl Arkansas magnet , but instead of just the Razorback logo , it 's actually a circular magnet with `` Arkansas Razorbacks '' running along the outer edge , and then the Razorback logo in the middle . I got this for my wife , and while she actually liked it a bit more than what I * thought * I was getting her , I wanted to let anyone ordering this product that Amazon has the wrong product picture for this .
 If you have the new 2011 Tippmann A5 , do not order this!It does NOT fit the new 2011 tippmann a5 . I ordered one , and had to return it .
 This was not shown in black . This is the color that I want .

 This item description specifies 3/2mm thickness but the suit I received had a 2mm body and 1mm sleves/legs . Too thin for my purposes so I returned it for a refund to my credit card.I gave it 1 star because of the incorrect description - there is no 2mm spring suits to select from so I think the product description is wrong rather that a item shipment error.I have owned Body Glove suits in the past . The quality looked fine .
 Do n't get me wrong
 The watch does n't work , probably just a battery but the instructions say that to replace the watch battery you have to send it to Nike otherwise you void the warranty . Very disappointed because the watch is cute .
 I ordered two bumpers for $ 18.35 to check out the quality before I ordered more . I liked them , went back two weeks later to order more and the price had jumped to over $ 30 for the exact same bumpers . At that price you can buy something better at a marine supply store . At the old price they were a good value for the money , not so much now .
 Do n't buy this product if you are looking for a FULL SIZED Craps Game Felt -LRB- as it is marketed -RRB- . Actual size of the Craps game print covers only 24 x 60 of the 36 x 72 felt . Picture on Amazon page shows print covering entire felt size incorrectly . I wanted a FULL-SIZED Craps Game Felt and expected the print to cover the entire 36 x 72 inches of felt especially because of how it was pictured . I returned this product .
 I ordered the poker/craps layout -LRB- i 'm only interested in the craps -RRB- , and i received a one-sided blackjack layout . ok , i return it at no charge and amazon re-orders me another one . 2nd order arrives ... again , a one-sided blackjack layout which seems slightly used . So i return it and i guess Amazon gave up , and refunded me my money . Their return policy was great in this case ; they just need someone with brains in the warehouse . So i 'm lookin ' for another craps layout .
 I ordered this item , for the craps layout . The first order camewith a poker layout on one side , and blank on the second side . Ireturned this , free of charge , and waited for a replacement , asthe item was out-of-stock . Well , the second one came , and it wasidentical as the first item , craps layout on one side , blank onthe other side . This one was also returned , free of charge . Itappears that quality control , in reviewing the product for shipping , or a problem in the manufacturing , is causing the product to arrive , not as advertised . I ca n't wait to see what the THIRD one looks like !!
 This item is called a `` Poker Craps Layout '' , but it only has Craps . The other side is blank . I 'm not sure if this is what is intended .
 Do n't get fooled ! They claim the size is 36 '' X 72 '' , but the actual size is 24 X 48 '' . It was a miniaturized version .
 It 's pretty irritating to order something and have a different product come . That 's the case here . Sure , it 's still a stopwatch , but update the image . I purchased this mainly because of the way it looked , yet now I have something that is quite different .
 On the order page Amazon did not mention the size of the mask . Naturally , i presumed it to be of a free size or as something that could be adjusted to the required size . However , the mask delivered is of a size that will not even fit a child , let alone an adult . Additionally , i think it to be of a poor quality .
 According to the Respro website : The Sportsta filter uses electrostatically charged fibres to attract airborne particulates down to 0.3 microns in size . 1 Micron = 1/1000mm ... The Sportsta filter offers protection against
 Although the product is a good product , You are not able to select size . The amazon recommended company sends mediums and they just do n't fit everyone . Order from the Respro Website direct , You can select sizes there and they ship immediately .
 I had ordered the Respro Sportspa mask based on the recommendation of Respro 's customer service.I asked them which mask would they recommend for me that would not allow the smell of cigarettes to come thru . They said `` Cigarette smoke is a particle , a very small sub-micron particle . The best masks for you would be either the Sportsta or the Aero Allergy mask . Both of these carry a Hepa-type filter which is used for the removal of sub-micron particulates . `` I did go ahead and purchase the mask -LRB- medium -RRB- and I am a petite person . Unfortunately , I found that the mask did NOT filter out the cigarette smells . I am typically walking down the streets in NYC where people are smoking outside . Not once did this work . That is the main reason why I purchased this mask . So , if you are looking for a mask to filter out cig . smoke , I would not recommend the Respro Sportspa for that .
 Note , this is n't about the product or even about Amazon . Due to some previous reviewers commenting that they could n't select the size they wanted here , I want to the Allergybegone website to place my order directly from them . I was able to select the size I wanted and also selected 2 day shipping as I wanted the product ASAP.A week passed and nothing . I contacted the company and was told `` Oh , it 's currently out of stock . We 're sorry . '' A fact thata . should have been made clear on their websiteb . they should have emailed me directly to let me know aboutI 'd note that this makes having paid for 2 day delivery that much more pointless.As of 15 days later , I have still yet to receive my product . As someone who runs an online business , this is staggeringly poor customer service and simply unacceptable in this day and age.I will be canceling my order with the company and go find someone who can actually fill my order even if it means getting a different mask . For all I know the Respro product is the best . I 'll never know because the company selling the thing is staffed by incompetent buffoons with no concept of customer service .
 like several other reviews here , i 'm pointing out two things
 Insofar as I can tell , Respro has more types of mask for more types of activities than does anyone else . I own this one , the Sportsta , and the only issue I had with it is that its `` large '' size is too small for men with larger than average sized heads -LRB- i.e. , if `` one size fits all '' hats do n't fit you , this mask probably wo n't , either -RRB- . I wound up buying the one Respro mask that comes in an XL size
 First of all , this is not the suppliers fault . It was my mistake . For Moms that are trying to order these practice pants , your son will probably not wear them . You would have to wear white compression shorts underneath . If they do n't , their boxers will be a peek-a-boo moment . I was unaware you can see through these pants . I will try ordering the heavyweight ones . Thank you though , for offering the variety you do .
 These gloves have the worst synthetic lining I have ever seen , it already tore in the wrist -LRB- leaving the padding loose -RRB- and fingers area .
 I have bought these gloves at the end of October 2011 . I box 4 times -LRB- Heavy bag , sparring -RRB- per week and use 2 pairs of gloves -LRB- so I use each pair twice per week -RRB- . Today these gloves are starting to tear on the sides and on the inside.Plus , the `` hook & loop '' ties are too short and do n't take up when you punch too heavy.Don ' t waste your money buying them - put $ 20 or $ 30 more and buy Ringside , or Rival - brand.Update on April 27th
 the product is ok for beginners or someone messing around . as fair as its breathable mesh , not really . . it was n't long before my hands started sweating . i would n't want to spar with these , because there is n't enough cushion and the straps could cut someone . shipped on time -LRB- 2 days for prime -RRB- . all in all , if you have money , the protex gel is the way to go . go out to the local sports store and try them on . you will see the difference . big time . so much more comfortable .
 These may be decent gloves for beginners but if you are a decent amateur fighter , train semi seriously , or throw heavy punches on the bag , pick another glove . I used these gloves for about 3 weeks and the middle knuckle on my left hand is starting to hurt from throwing a lot of jabs . I think I 'm just going to have to bite the bullet and buy a more expensive more serious hook and loop glove as these just dont do the job .
 I bought these to use with my heavy bag . I have average sized hands and these fit almost perfect , maybe slightly loose , without wraps on . But you need to wear wraps , and these would not fit with wraps on.Also , the chemical smell on this is pretty strong and it makes me feel nauseated.I 'm not sure what to do , because I do n't want to spend a lot of money for gloves . But these are useless .
 though the price was certainly right for these gloves , they promptly split at the seems during the 2nd or 3rd training session . A little duck tape allowed me to continue using them , but from now on I will spend a little more money and get a better glove . My trainer told me to get genuine leather and I am wishing that I would have taken his advice .
 DO not buy these gloves . They are n't worth the little money you spend on them . They are extremely cheap and flimsy and give off a STRONG chemical smell . Do not underestimate how strong these gloves smell . Its nauseating and it doesnt go away . Regret every penny spent on this trash . If your serious about training , and want a quality product , invest in some reyes gloves . They are $ 100 + but real leather and they last you . I dont even want to give these gloves away they are so bad . The garbage seems like the final destination for this crap . Waste of money .
 Got these for Christmas on the 25th ... destroyed them on the 26th . Although the gloves absorbed the impact of some bag strikes , the pleather ripped after only a few hits . These are not bag gloves , and they will quickly fall apart with even light bag training .
 These are n't professional grade gloves . So do n't let the `` Pro Style '' description fool you . They work fine for aerobic or cardio-boxing/kickboxing , however they 're not for heavy contact use during long-term training . During high levels of heavy bag training they fall apart quickly . Figure on spending no less than $ 70 - $ 120 for better gloves that can take heavy training on bags and sparring . Higher-end gloves also protect your hands more effectively .
 These were my first boxing gloves and needless to say the last gloves I ever bought for less than $ 50 . I know how to wrap my hands , and I know how to punch but I injured my knuckle twice in these gloves . The first time I landed a left hook to the temple of my sparring partner . I was out for a month . I babied that hand for 3 months then the first day I go heavy on the bag with them I re-sprain the same knuckle again.First off a boxing glove will last you about 6 months if you 're a 5 + session a week fighter . It 'll be more if you 're a two a week fighter and pretty much a lifetime if you do that cardio boxing stuff . Reason is the more you hit the bag or your partner the more the foam breaks down and sweating into the foam does n't help either . About this glove : Size
 I used these for a kickboxing class , it was my first time taking it and only once a week . After only a few classes my knuckles started hurting and were turning red from these gloves . I could n't use them anymore after that . Clearly these are not adequate for even the lightest boxing activity and not even worth the money . Better to buy a better pair than wasting it on these trying to get a bargain .
 I bought these gloves as a replacement for some cheap $ 20 bulk generic made-in-China gloves my boxing gym has available . Because they are Everlast , I thought they would be good . I 've been very disappointed . These gloves offer almost no wrist support , and I had to start using wraps to protect my wrists . After about 4 weeks of medium-duty use , the vinyl is peeling and the stitching is falling apart . The only good thing I can say about them is that they do n't smell as bad as other gloves I 've used , so they do seem to resist odor as advertised .
 The stitching at the thumb started pulling apart after only 4 uses of these gloves - about 30 minutes of usage each time across the span of 2 weeks at a boxing fitness class . Even though these are inexpensive gloves , that does n't mean they should be expected to fall apart after only 4 uses . Either I got a defective pair of gloves , or all of the gloves are just low quality / durability . I think you 're better off buying other comparable gloves if possible .
 these gloves are ok but however when i punch the bag alot with wrap on i start to feel my knuckles hurt .
 These gloves may be good for aerobics , but they only lasted my first 5 months of heavy bag training and some light sparring before the seams started falling apart . The gloves are fine to try to see if you like boxing , but for long term use look for a higher end glove , especially if you hit harder than a 60 year old woman .
 I got these gloves to use with the heavy bag . I 'm just hitting for fitness . Not serious boxing . At first these gloves proved to be good . Combined with hand wraps , my hands did n't hurt after punching.Now after about 2 months of use , once a week , I noticed the right glove seams are coming apart . They 're coming apart at the at the outside of the wrist.I 'm still using them though . I just wish they did n't start to fall apart so soon .
 I train about 5-6 days a week and needed some new sparring gloves . I saw the price of these Everlast gloves and could n't resist . Well , I should have . I suppose I should have known these would be poorly made given the price , but I had to try them out . Long story short , I obliterated these gloves after just a couple weeks . The stitching is all ripped up , the thumb is about to come off of the left glove , and the stuffing is coming out . Plus , they have a terrible synthetic smell that I get to enjoy every time I get in my car.Basically , no one should by these gloves . Everlast should do a better job and not make junk like this . Yes they are cheap and yes I train hard and often , but two weeks ? Come on .
 These gloves are good entry level gloves , I see many people give them five start but perhaps they have n't tried Grant or Cleto Reyes , if you 're a boxing fan look at the gloves they wear , their doing away with Everlast because of the quality , they are cheap , I bought a pair myself when I first started in Muay Thai and now I also train in American boxing , but as became a better and stronger fighter I began to experiment with better quality equipment , so I gave my old Everlast gloves away . I love Cletos and still use them but they run a little big , I love Grants even more , the quality and material of both brands is a lot better than Everlast , you may pay 100 bucks more but you if you 're not serious about your training or if you punch like a little boy stay with Everlast but if your really train like I do and profesional boxers , and fighters do the research and try out Grants or Cletos you 'll feel the diffence in the foam and the 100 % leather workmanship . Believe me Everlast is just an entry level glove .
 I got these when I started and I have bought much better gloves since.Pros-Cheap-Breathable palmCons - hand compartment is very loose . this is dangerous ! - Knuckle padding is insufficient - Padding is at a weird angle so there 's a gap between the glove and your hand . - wrist support is terrible ; handwraps can not make up for this completely . - fake leather is very thin especially on the palm side - stitching is falling apartIf you plan to use these for more than aerobics , you will hurt your hands and wrists . If you get serious at all , you will probably upgrade within a month or two . Just save your $ 25 towards better gloves now .
 Recently joined a Muay Thai training class and bought these 16oz Everlast gloves . After a little over a month , they were busted . The outer layer is a cheap material ; just a flimsy paper thin plastic -LRB- vinyl ? -RRB- cover . It burst open and exposed the cheap foam inside after standard use . The product really feels like a toy . The Title gloves are only a few bucks more and feels really sturdy . I purchased those after this Neverlast crapped out on me . Do n't waste your money on this junk .
 These gloves offer no protection . They are made with flimsy material . My hands were hurting within minutes after throwing the first few punches on a heavy bag . I went back to my old gloves .
 The Gloves had a tear in them when I recieved them , something I think should be checked and looked over before they shipped the products out , could have happen in shipping I do n't know but the location of the tear I did n't think so , but I can say Amazon accepted the return with no problem . Also the gloves were a really tight fit for a 16 oz gloves , I ended up re-purchasing from Amazon and got the Protex2 Training Gloves for $ 18 more but they fit much better . Would not reccomend the Everlast Pro Style Training Glove if you have fairly large hands , my hands are not really huge but average size for a man .
 I consider myself as semi trained boxer . My trainer once recomended these gloves but i do not . Im a very heavy hitter there for this gloves last me 3 months then my knuckle which is also wraped will move the paddin . if your a heavy hitter do not purchase these . I have had 2 pairs of these . there cheap there fun but do not hit a heavy bag with these . I used the BLUE 16oz
 I ordered the 14 oz in red . They fit well , had the right amount of padding for sparring and moderate heavy bag work , and the lining breathed well and did n't smell . After the fourth use , however , they began to split at the seams and the stuffing started to come out . I 'd love to think it 's because I punch that hard , but I think it 's because these are n't made well or are defective . Returning them and buying more expensive gloves .
 These gloves rip too easily.I 'm on my second pair in only a few months.Emailed Everlast and they never got back to me with a resolution.Look at other gloves if you hit hard .
 I bought a pair of these as a workout set for heavy bag use , and have been mostly disappointed with them for that purpose.Pros
 The inside of the right glove began to shred within a matter of weeks . Unfortunately it was past the return policy of the seller . Needless to say I 'm very displeased . ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Also do n't order from MMA ONE STOP SHOP they are not a licensed dealer so if the product is defective the manufacturer will not do anything about it . Their customer service is useless .
 I been training for about two years and these were my 2nd pair of gloves . I kept re-injuring my hand and never knew what the hell I was doing wrong until I purchased another brand . The hand injuries went away soon after I bought the new set . These gloves SUCK unless you are just purchasing them to get drunk and take em out back with some of your buddies in which case , buy two sets .
 I did n't notice when I ordered these that they did n't have a size listed ... they came half way down my arm . I was going to return them , but ended up selling them to someone with bigger hands .
 I used these shooting glasses at an indoor range and they fogged up so severely that I could not see the target after about ten minuets of shooting . They were at a point where they were actually dangerous . Without a backup pair of glasses , I had to raise them up on my forehead to continue shooting . I tried them again at an outdoor range and they did it again but not quite as bad . This time I was equipped with a back up pair . Now I just use them to clean my guns and they work for that . I replaced them with another brand which work like they are supposed to .
 THey show three tubes , you only receive one . So for $ 6.00 it is not worth it . Tried to contact company with on results .
 Bought two of these to take to las vegas for the lazy rivers . Did not open until already there . The one worked out well and the other one had a hole straight out of the package . Did not contact the supplier im sure they would have replaced it but we were already on our trip and not worth the effort . I would not recommend this product
 Note that this product only includs one ring , not 3 as is pictured . At the time of my purchase , the price was about triple what other retailers were selling for , but since they pictured 3 rings -LRB- which is the number of tubes I needed -RRB- , it seemed rational . I felt deceived when I only received one.Then , within the first hour of use by my daughter , a seam in the tube broke . Now I need to replace it again . This purchase was a total waste . Would strongly recommend * NOT * buying this product .
 First of all , At first when you look at the photo of this short it shows it 's straight but it 's actually baggy -LRB- It is more Obvious in black color -RRB- . If you take a closer look at the photo , you 'll see the man in the picture actually holding the leg area in the background so this short will look more attractive to the buyers . -LRB- I know i need to look at at measurement but i also need to look at photo to see how it 's going to look -RRB- . That 's why he is holding his hand in the back of his leg -LRB- to hold the short to make it looks more slim -RRB- . Second the quality is not as good as `` new balance 5-inch short '' When you wear New balance , it 's feel as if you have no short on . It 's very soft and nice and unlike this one , it has 3 pockets . I do not recommend this Short to anyone . . If this short is comfy , so is my pijama . Look for New balance 5-Inch Tempo Short , It is much better . You wo n't be disappointed.Update Aug , 2010
 I bought this watch for my husband one year ago . It is one of the most beautiful watches that I have seen for a man , and he always received compliments on it . However , 10 months into owning it , there were serious cracks on the underside of the band on both sides simply from forming it around his wrist to wear . This resulted in the rubber on the band snapping and making it totally unwearable . I called the Invicta corporate office in FL and found out that there is NO warranty on the band , and that it would cost $ 57 to replace the band , which includes flat rate shipping . Also , it could take up to 90 days to replace , which is not a big deal , but I thought I would disclose that too . This is my husbands favorite watch , but it makes no sense to replace a band with no warranty that could n't last for a year with normal wear .
 Watch arrived with a dead battery . Took it to a Jeweller who replaced the battery which unfortunately revealed that the GMT hand was not keeping time . Reached out to Invicta directly to ask for assistance and raise the concern . After 2 email replies that were dismissive and did n't address the specific issue was finally able to speak with a Service rep over the phone . Instructions provided -LRB- to pull out and turn the crown counterclockwise to set the GMT time -RRB- ultimately resulted in the crown coming completely off ! Rep informed me that I could ship the watch to them and get it back in 6 weeks -LRB- why would I want to send a brand new watch for `` fixing '' ?? -RRB- or deal directly with Amazon.com to address -LRB- i.e. refund -RRB- as Invicta washed their hands of it and said that this was an `` amazon problem/defect and not theirs '' ... bought this watch at a deep discount and now I know why ... look at all the reduced prices on this brand of watch ... the MSRP is grossly inflated in virtually every instance so buyer beware beacause there are obviously reasons why they do n't sell any of them at the MSRP !!! You may get a lemon.Having purchased other Invicta watches and loved them , I am quite surprised and upset around this experience with both Invicta and Amazon and I caution you to think hard before purchasing this product . If you do n't mind receiving a dead watch , paying for a new battery to discover the watch it faulty , and then have to spend your money and time to ship back for a refund or fixing and not recieving it back for 6 weeks ... well then go for it.Watch does look great I must add . Invicta/Amazon - get your acts together ... serious quality issues here , both in service and product .
 Killed more bugs stepping on them than this crap did . It 's a waste of money . Use baking soda instead . Nothing killed like diazinon .
 2012 was predicted to be especially bad for ticks and mosquitoes , so I purchased this to be proactive and spare my 4 dogs and little girl from a parasitic attack.While its hard to know exactly how many bugs it killed off , I ended up picking a few ticks off my legs a few weeks after spreading the pellets and my daughter gets eaten alive every time she is out in the backyard -LRB- despite citronella torches as well -RRB- . The benefit did not outweigh the risk and detriment of laying down chemicals on my yard .
 I would ' t recommend buying these socks . . they 're a bit heavy and although durable , they stretched out to where now i 'm constantly pulling them up over the course of playing . . i 'd go for a lighter weight sock that retained it 's shape a bit better . .
 I did not find the product effective in preventing yellow and spotted leaves on my rose bushes . I will not use it again .
 His review caused me to buy the wrong product.Its not an insecticide ... only a disease preventive -LRB- fungicide , I think -RRB- Look elsewhere for a combined product .
 I reported the no-show of this product . My rose dust did not appear . But , Home and Lawn told me I needed to ask all my neighbors and friends and my neighborhood priest to see if they had seen the product in their yards and porches . I did that . Zip . Then I was told by Life and home to check with the carrier -LRB- FEDEX -RRB- . I did . Zip . Finally after no resolution from Life and Home they will send out a route tracer . OK , Meanwhile I have been waiting since the 3rd of December 2012 for the rose dust . A lot of hassle for a $ 14.00 dollar plastic container of rose dust . Meanwhile , my roses were getting very sick with rose must and black spots . I had to go to Home Depot . Do n't buy anything from this outfit . Buy it at Home Depot instead . You will have fewer problems . Colonel Boyer , U.S. Marines
 Speedo suits are very good quality , but I can never wear one . The cut for the butt is terrible ! Maybe if I had a tiny butt it would n't be a problem but I can not wear this suit in public because it only covers a little more than half my butt .
 I ordered the black one . According to the photo provided , it was supposed to be black with white seams , but when i received it , it was all black . Once I put it on it fitted perfectly . But it is simply too difficult to put on even though it is the right size .
 Glad I bought this at a local bike shop so I can go back tomorrow and get a refund.I was willing to give this little half-sized floor pump a chance because it fit my needs perfectly . But the pump head broke in my hand when I first attempted to attach it to a valve stem . Another issue involving sloppy loose thread tolerance where the hose fitting threads into the pump base , I 'm quite sure it would have leaked air down there horribly .
 Useless piece of junk -LRB- I only rated it one star because you ca n't rate it zero -RRB- . Item did arrive on time , but I thought at first it was a wrong item . The pump barrel is half-length , the handle is way short of flimsy and the plunger rod bends if you just look at it . Valve is schrader only , no presta . This is n't a bicycle pump , much less a floor pump . Worst of all , for $ 10 you 'll just toss it out , because it is n't worth the time or effort to get a refund . Do n't waste your time with this item . -LRB- I suspect the other review from `` overly happy Polly '' is a fake -RRB- .
 I purchased this watch specifically because of the compass feature . Well , a COMPASS uses the Earth 's magnetic fields to determine geographic direction . This watch has a SUNDIAL . The directions actually tell you to align the arrows on the watch with the sun . If you are in the middle of the woods , or the sun is right on top of you -LRB- noon -RRB- , or at night , and this watch is all you have to get you home , you will be waiting for the next sunrise to see where is East . You do n't need a watch to get yourself directions using the sun . You can use a wooden stick for that , which is freely available .
 it sucks ! the ball are of different sizes . I purchased 3 balls and found that all three of them are of different sizes ; moreover , they dont even bounce well .
 I was looking for a replacement to a ball I recently picked up in Australia . It was a great indoor ball with a soft , bouncy core , wrapped in two red PVC halves held together by real stitches.This ball is much too hard for indoor use . The one I received was also red & white , not all red . The fake seam on the ball is very sharp on the fingers too .
 This ball is not worth the money . It worse off in just two overs . The PVC started coming off . This ball is heavier than the cricket ball , and even thought it 's soft if you press on it , it 's really not safe . You still need protective gear . Just buy the regular cricket ball . Or , if you 're looking for a safer alternative for backyard cricket , put some electric tape on a tennis ball .
 I purchased this knife based on other reviews . It has no power . I could n't even cut through the ribs of a catfish . Mine went back . Hope this helps others .
 Our electric knife died . Bought this at WalMart the day before Thanksgiving . It would n't cut the turkey . Tried again tonight . It would n't cut the raw meat my wife was preparing for the chili . It is a piece of junk . May be great for fish , but it will not do what electric knives normally do . Avoid .
 This bag should be called a snack tote - it is much too small to be called a lunch bag . I could fit my son 's sandwich keeper in it and that was all . No drink or snack . He would surely starve if we kept on using it . We had to purchase another bag that is ample in space and will keep his belly filled thru the day !
 This bike mirror is advertised several ways . I bought it as a 9 '' mirror , but an 11.5 '' mirror arrived . Interestingly , my order says 9 '' , but the description in my order says 11.5 '' . The problems
 This mirror needs a much sturdier clamp for its size . I think the mirror is great but not much good to me if I can not mount it effectively .
 Speedo suits are very good quality , but I can never wear one . The cut for the butt is terrible ! Maybe if I had a tiny butt it would n't be a problem but I can not wear this suit in public because it only covers a little more than half my butt .

 This mat is useless for yoga . I had another Aeromat that I loved . I was looking for a replacement but this mat is terrible . My hands were sliding all over the place . Later in the day I had the mat in the back of my car and my kids complained of the chemical smell it gave off . it is very strong . Complete waste of money .
 The watch is beautiful but it is HUGE , ridiculously HUGE ! I could have put a chain on it , wore it around my neck and been Flavor Flav for Halloween ! I returned it but got another Invicta that was more normal sized . I knew it was over sized before I bought it but seriously unless you are a 6 ' 8 '' defensive tackle or have tree trunks for wrists , this watch probably is n't for you .
 It is a very attractive watch but much to big to wear on my arm . Maybe it would be OK as a thigh band
 The Aluminum sporting rest by `` Brand Not Specified '' is unstable due to its 3 leg base design which can be a problem on uneven ground . One pound weight is twice as much as other `` Quality American Made '' products which have been sold for many years .

 I purchased this watch in 2006 . I thought it was a fine watch until it came time to replace the battery.My local Seiko dealer refused to attempt a battery replacement so i tried to do it myself . That was a mistake . I found out the hard way , why the local dealer would n't replace the battery.Its almost impossible.I ended up with a broken watch . Do not buy this watch is my recommendation .
 When I received the chair I was ecstatic ! It was beautiful and I could n't see any flaws on it ! It opened very easily and for all practical purposes was exactly what I needed for the races.Once we got to the stands not only was it too wide for the seating allowed it was the most uncomfortable thing I 've ever sat in ! I had to just fold it up and sit on it flat . That was n't comfortable either but it was better than sitting in it the way it is supposed to be set up.I would like to return it because there is no way I would have known that the size was wrong without actually being at the track .
 I purchased this stuff because a friend recommended it because I have a serious issue in my basement -LRB- where I sleep -RRB- with Spider Crickets , aka Camelback Crickets and Cave Crickets . I kept waking up with one crawling on me somewhere nad I eventually just could n't deal with it anymore so I purchased this stuff . I sprayed the outside of my house , and in the basement , and surprise surprise it did n't even faze these nasty little insects . I even sprayed one directly with the spray to see if it even did anything and the cricket just hopped away , perfectly fine ! uhhhh so frustrating . I would not recommend this stuff . The only good thing I can say about it is that it does dry fast , in case you have pets and does n't leave a strong scent . Hopefully it 's more helpful for everyone else and their insect problem then it was for mine .
 I had switched from the Spectracide bug stop to this on account of all the advertisement . Perhaps it works better in a suburb area but out here in the farm area I call home . No such luck . In fact , I would say it did n't do anything at all apart from waste my time . I continually had all sorts of bugs and critters finding their way into my home . This was never the case with the Spectracide 9-month product . Perhaps I did have to re-spray it every 6 or 7 months but I did n't have any bugs crawl into the house with that product . This Ortho one leaves me killing something nearly everyday !
 I 've tried this product outdoors to create a barrier for ants around my house and insided my house because we get them every year . -LRB- I have used the bait traps in the past but they are a little unsightly and tend to bring more ants before they get rid of any -RRB- . I decided to start early this year before the ants had shown up and this spray did n't do one bit of good . I applied a thick line drenched in this poor excuse for an insect killer around the house , the ants still came . I sprayed it on them directly they died alright but as soon as it dried ants walked right over where it had been sprayed . Guess they left out the part where you need to constantly keep the area wet with this garbage . Oh and it 's definetly not waterproof , the stuff just washes right off in the rain . Save your money try a cheaper product .
 Okay so I bought this recently & the same day I saw an ugly looking spider in my house . Well I go to grab this Ortho & I spray him once , nothing he just runs like crazy , I keep spraying him easily 20-30 times everywhere he goes , NOTHING ! He slows a little bit , then after 5 minutes of spraying him , drowning him in it , he eventually gets tired I 'm guessing . . So I smushed him . Then today I had fruit flies on some old fruit , I spray that fruit like 50 times throughout the day . . What happens ? They do n't die , I sprayed one fruit fly about 10 times he was STILL running through the liquid making a trail haha . Do n't waste your money people please !!! BUY RAID IT WORKS IMMEDIATELY !! THAT IS A GUARANTEE !
 the cock roaches liked this more than me . the duration of the effect on the insects was not more than a few hours . not sufficient for home defense and i 'm wondering why this product is so ineffective .
 When I use this stuff I feel I 'm only killing the bugs by drowning them with the product , smh . The only thing good about this thing is its professional looking design and it is odor free -LRB- water does n't have an odor either , btw -RRB- . I wish I could refill the container with a bug spray that actually worked .
 I was spraying outside when the base of the handle split apart , the spring and plunger came out in my hand splashing my leg with enough insecticide to soak my shorts and run down my leg into my shoe . Could have just as easily gotted sprayed in the mouth or eyes . This sprayer design is dangerous!This insecticide does ` nt seem to be very effective on my roaches or ants either .
 I would give this zero stars if I could . My hubby finally cut down some trees and bushes in front of our house and apparently left a lot of roaches and ants homeless because we noticed them coming into the house like crazy afterwards . Went to Walmart and bought this stuff and after the 3rd or 4th room the sprayer broke and started leaking but he kept spraying . Did not see a decrease at all in bugs and they just kept stomping across the `` barrier '' that we sprayed down as if it was water so we still ended up calling an exterminator . This was $ 12.00 wasted
 I know the description says it works for spiders -LRB- excluding black widow and brown recluse -RRB- , but I thought it might work if I soaked them with it . I sprayed my firewood shed with it until it formed a puddle , and wolf spiders and several other kinds were walking right through it as if nothing happened . I sprayed a black widow in a crack for about 10 seconds straight and it just sat there . I waited several minutes , and the black widow just walked out of the crack like nothing happened . I sprayed a wolf spider about the size of a dime directly in the face , and he held his arms up like he was in attack mode . Then he walked away . It may work for ants or something , but it does n't work for spiders .
 I 've used this product for about two months with hope that it would work . Unfortunately , it did n't provide any protection and it just seem like the bugs were saying , `` That 's all you 've got ? '' Pffhh . My current solution to prevent bugs from entering my house were to use Raid instead . I sprayed near my main door and the outside of my basement 's windows and that seem to keep them off for about two to three weeks . Ultimately , I would n't recommend purchasing this spray .
 I tried this stuff because I have sugar ants coming through the window and eating my cats food , And I sprayed inside and outside . They are still coming in ! I resprayed to make sure I did n't screw up and it does nothing to them unless you spray right at them ! I even soaked the entire wall in this stuff and almost emptied the entire canister and it hasnt repelled a single thing ! Most useless product ever , I will never buy another Ortho product again !
 I had a light infestation of fleas after a dear pet died and bought this product to kill them before it got to be a major problem . I think the fleas did the backstroke then gave me the finger ... it did not work . Needless to say , my light infestation got to be a big problem that I have not yet conquered.For the record , I only sprayed the concrete floor of my garage . I did this on 3 different days and the problem only got worse . I probably would have been better off mopping with hot soapy water . I do n't think fleas can do the backstroke in soapy water.I ca n't say if it prevented anything else because I did n't have a problem with any other bugs.It got two stars because I liked the sprayer part .
 For the record , I purchased this from Wal-Mart on sale for around $ 12 . I needed it to spray around my new construction home because I 've been having a pretty invasive amount of spiders and other little bugs coming in . I sprayed around the house and followed the directions to the tee ; I even sprayed twice in some areas . And here , three weeks later , I can honestly say I notice no decrease in bugs . Spiders have set up webs , crickets hop , and other assortments frolic and play exactly where I sprayed . It 's quite disappointing , really . I feel like I just purchased a jug of water . Be aware - when they say it does n't kill black widows , they mean it . See the photo I uploaded for solid proof .
 Dont know if this product works . Bought it brought it home , removed all appliances and went to spray . Trigger detached on the third pull and does not go back . Apparently the manufacturer engaged in too much cost cutting ? This product is going back.Ortho 0195310 1-1/3 - Gallon Home Defense Max Perimeter and Indoor Insect Killer Pull 'N Spray
 Ok I bought this product in the past & it seemed very effective . I am trying to eliminate cockroaches . I bought this product again & found that it has NO EFFECT whatsoever . I was extremely disappointed . I would not recommend this product at all . I am not sure if they changed the ingredients or what but it does not work .
 When we first moved into our apartment 2 years ago , we sprayed the outside and inside with ortho max home defense . It worked well then . Last year , sprayed again in February , March , and April . Spiders still came in . In order for this product to actually have an affect on spiders , I had to arm myself the the jug and spray the heck out of the spider before it would die . This year , the same thing . I even sprayed a small stream in front of the door after my boyfriend had to kill one . As of now , two more had entered in with in the past hour and he had to kill them the old fashioned way , with a shoe . This product is not effective as it used to be .
 Our neighbors recently moved in and then back out of the house behind us , and the roaches they left behind moved to our house ! I used a whole bottle of this stuff , its been a month now and they have gotten worse ! Unless you spray it directly on the roach it does n't effect them !
 Did not work for me . I srayed a small roach at close range and it went about it 's business as if I had sprayed water on it.This is a what the Ortho rep replied when I inquired as to how this product is suppose to work . `` Thank you for contacting us concerning Scotts products .

 I bought this with high hopes , but after spraying all over my home I was still seeing just as many bugs as before . I decided to try spraying them with this directly and it did absolutely nothing . I sat and watched a roach after I sprayed him and , other than being annoyed , it seemed fine . Ran around in circles for several minutes before I finally killed it the old fashioned way.I thought maybe I had gotten a bad one and I wrote Ortho asking for help . They sent me a form letter . Fine for them . They have my $ 15 , but poor products and communication are enough for me to scratch Ortho off my list in the future . An apology might have made me consider them again.I ultimately went with Cyber WP . It is n't much of an on-contact killer -LRB- takes a bit longer than Raid , for example -RRB- but it keeps them away for months !
 I actually like the bottle and the design . Quick and easy to apply.But ... the actual defense solution is AWFUL ! I have a problem with ants and spiders in my shed and garage and it does nothing . I have used about half of the bottle in these small spaces and it has done nothing . I did n't expect it to keep spiders completely out but I had hopes about ants . NOPE ! I have sprayed three times and have n't notices any difference . More spiders and the same amount of ants . Disappointing.I will still be searching ...
 Tired of dealing with spiders , and in prep for earwig season , I bought this product with high hopes of creating a defense shield around my house , windows , doorways , everywhere . I just love to have my windows and doors open all season long.The good news , the # of spiders coming into my house has dropped dramatically . I went from catching 4-6 per day to 1-2 over the past week.Bad news
 I bought this product with the plunger type handle . The trigger on the nozzle leaked , ran down my hand , and dripped all over the floor . I washed my hands immediately , but the product burned my palms causing a red rash and the following day I had several clear blisters on my fingers.This all happened 3 days ago and my hands are still burning.This product has a faulty deliver system . I do n't recommend you buy or use it .
 The perimeter protection is a lie . The very next days ants and bugs are walking over the sprayed area like nothing happened . Do not waste your money .
 This life vest keeps me above water , I suppose , but it is way too big and unable to be tightened sufficiently , so it rides up to my chin .
 It 's bulky . Shifts a lot.Defenately not good for boats where you will be sitting for an extended period of time.Very uncomfortable with seats that have backs on them . I used it in my seaeagle kayak for 4 hours and it was very uncomfortable . I 'm going to look at a neoprene vest that has a lot less bulk .
 Before ordering , we looked up the measurements on the Stearns website , so we could be sure to order the correct size . This arrived and is being returned on Monday at first UPS pickup . The size is NOT correct . XL is stated to fit up to a 48 '' chest on Stearns website -LRB- Amazon , inconveniently , does NOT provide ANY sizing info -RRB- , but this does NOT fit that way . FAR too small . It looked like my husband was trying to wear a child 's life vest when he tried this on - it rode up way too high around him on all sides , and while it did close in front , it just looked too small . He also said it just did n't feel right - the `` riding up '' all around meant that the shoulders did n't rest properly on his shoulders . This is NOT the insecure feeling you want when you 're swimming in Lake Michigan , esp . if there are one to three foot waves ! We are not water testing this - we got it last night , and it 's already packed up to be picked up for return on Monday.Amazon , please start providing sizing info -LRB- that you verify yourselves ... do n't just go by manufacturer 's stated measurements -RRB- so that your customers can buy with more confidence!I am still giving this two stars , though , because the quality SEEMS to be good -LRB- nice padding , good shoulder webbing , etc. -RRB- If only the sizing info were provided accurately -LRB- or at ALL ... Amazon , I 'm talking to YOU here -RRB- . I recommend buying this in store , in person , AFTER trying on . Do NOT buy this via mail or online order ... you 'll likely be disappointed.OTOH , the Body Glove life jacket that we ordered DOES fit correctly , just as per the stated measurements . We 're keeping that one . So it 's down to the usual
 Too tight . I thought I ordered a loose fitting shirt but got a tight fit . Shirt itself would have been okay .
 Everything I wear is extra large and it fits fine . With this thing extra large is so skin tight I can hardly breath . I will never order another one .
 THE ONLY THING ABOUT THE COLD GEAR IS THAT 'S WHAT IT IS COLD . I 'D DO BETTER WITH THERMAL WEAR AT A BETTER FAR BETTER PRICE . I ALREADY HAVE TWO HOLES IN MY LEGGINGS . WOW . WHAT A RIP . ANOTHER NAME BRAND PRODUCT MADE OVERSEAS , AND OVERPRICED SOLD TO THE GULLABLE CONSUMER . VERY , VERY DISAPPOINTED .
 Horrible Display on Amazon shopping cart and order receipt !!! - when I add the clothing in the shopping card , it does ` nt specify the size selected !!!! Also , on the order receipt , it does n't specify it either . Why is it not included ?
 I ordered this mens under armour for a christmas gift . I cant say for sure that its a knockoff . . but its defintily nothing like the one I got last year at Bass Pro Shop . Seems to be good tech material tho-if ordering get a size up from what you ` d normally get . I returned and went back to Bass Pro . . slow to refund ...
 Was not very happy with this shirt . The first thing I did ` nt like was that the sleeves were too short . I tried a medium and large and both were too short . The medium fit my body right but not the sleeves . The large was a little big on my body but the sleeves were still too short . I did ` nt think this was very warm either , possibly because I 'm used to the compression which is tighter . Overall , if the sleeves were n't so short it would be alright . I returned it and ordered a compression crew which I 'm extremely happy with .
 I am satisfied with what I order , BUT I am suppose to get free shipping and Handling if sold my Amazon to which is reads . So force without further a do . That it .
 I purchased two Sunlite bicycle mirrors for our cruiser bike since the Blackburn end bar style would not work due to the cruiser handlebar configuration.While this mirror positioned , correctly allowed me to see everything without my body obstructing , which occurs with straight type handlebars , it is cheaply made . The metal clamp is made of soft metal as I found out when the mirror continually became loose and I repeatedly tightened the clamp . As avid cyclists , we do a lot of riding , we regularly check all components on our bikes as parts do become loose over time when you ride a lot and especially on not so smooth bike paths.Also the mirror end has an adjusting screw that I had to repeatedly tighten as well to keep the mirror in place . I noticed recently , after having this mirror for 1 year now , that the mirror would not stay tight . While I was tightening the nut next to the mirror I noticed the mirror moving off the screw.Upon further examination the mirror arm contains a threaded end for the mirror part to screw on to the arm . The plastic piece on the mirror , which screws onto the arm , apparently became stretched or stripped inside . Thus , tightening the nut on the mirror end actually forces the mirror off the arm . This is not a long life product.I have since looked at other bicycle mirrors that have the mirror attached to the arm differently and appear more secure -- such as the mirrors Electra Bicycles sell .
 The mirror was a good choice for maybe a child 's bike . The arm is too short and I could n't see around my own body . I returned it for this reason .
 I fitted these to my handle bars and they kept coming loose . The metal part meant for anchoring it to the bike is weak . Bent while I was tighten the bolt so that it gets a good grip on the bars . Metal is to soft , and keeps expanding , hence the mirror keeps moving . I have decided to remove them and ride without mirrors . Sadly , I bought 2 pairs for my bike and my wife 's bike .
 Now I 'm not saying this is a bad mirror . But it did not work for me on my bike . The arm was too short . It might work for you if you place it on the farthest end of the handlebar , near your pinky finger . But I was looking for something more near the center , near your thumb on your left hand .
 I have a hybrid bike with straight handlebars . It is very difficult to adjust the mirror to get a good rear view . If the arm had been a little longer I think it would be an improvement .
 The mirror is way too small and unstable . The pictures and description are misleading . This mirror is too short/too small/too unstable.If this is their deluxe version , I 'd hate to see their regular version . Do n't bother with this product .
 I ` ts a big mirror and has a nice look to it , but the clamp ca n't handle the weight of the mirror and it tends to start sliding around not long after installation .
 I orders the 18 '' docking wheel and I was surprised to find after I had installed it to the dock that the hardware was missing . I called the vendor and I am still awaiting for any type of call back . Do n't think I will be buying from this vendor again.Capt . Ken Pappas
 Folks , I purchased this item , and it is NOT the Taylor Made Dock Pro . The item Overton carries and shipped is a DockMate . Overton is bringing this to the attention of Amazon .
 This mirror is better for chopper style handlebars because the stem is short.I put one on a cylocross style bike that I had to lean forward and reach down to the handlebars.My arm was blocking the view.The mirror needs to be above the arm so the rider may see behind the bicycle.Most Chopper style handlebars are riser type so the mirror is above the arm anyways and the arm is not blocking the mirrors reflection.Installation was a little difficult because the brace that connects it to the handlebar nearly was n't wide enough . COULD THE MERCHANTS PUT SOME SIZE DIMENSIONS IN THE ITEM DESCRIPTIONS !
 To begin with , the listed dimensions are wrong -LRB- it 's actually approx . 64 `` h , 55 `` w , 17 `` d -RRB- . I emailed Sportsman 's Guide before buying to ask about this and never got a reply -LRB- first bad sign -RRB- , but I bought it anyway . The materials are nice enough , but the construction is about the poorest I 've ever seen on a manufactured item . On my unit one of the plastic clips that hold the tabletop on was installed upside down , making it unusuable and requiring drilling out rivets to fix . Other clips have been moved , leaving holes in the trim where they were incorrectly placed the first time . Holes that should be there to hang the pantry bag are missing . The fold-out shelves do not fold out to be level , they tilt . Altogether incredibly shoddy workmanship .
 I think it is way over priced . I do n't think it is worth $ 70 . The frame around the countertops part did n't meet properly . The top shelf wo n't open level . The frame work is really weak . For what I am going to use it for it will do , but I ca n't believe I paid this amount . Should of spent a little more and bought the one with the sinks .
 This would be a great little camp kitchen except for the workmanship . I 've owned mine for almost 2 years now and held off on writing an opinion until I had a chance to put it to use multiple times . The other reviews submitted are just about right on the mark about this product , meaning there are good points and bad points . The good points are it is well thought out and the features are practical . It is smaller and more compact then other camp kitchens available which makes transporting a breeze . The main table top is large enough for a portable grill , or 2 burner stove while the outer table is sufficient for prepping . The bad point is the workmanship ... . The manufacturing is shoddy to say the least . The quality control dept. of the manufacturer must have all been on vacation or out sick when these were released to the public . The materials used to produce the unit are n't the problem , they certainly are sturdy enough ... . It just seems the manufacturer decided to slap them together as quick as possible with no regard to quality workmanship . But if you can look past that glitch in them , the tables do serve a useful purpose ...
 The hinge broke on my 2nd outing to the range . I noticed the cap was VERY tight to snap shut and makes me believe that it could have been a defective unit altogether . I have many other items from BC and this is the first to disappoint me .
 I love this same set up on my 3x9 30-06 scope but the size 15 front lense cover spring for my AR-15 scope broke after two weeks . very dissapointing to from good company .
 I have used butler creek flip caps for over 15 years and have never had a complaint until now . In fact mine get quite a bit of use , they dont just sit in the safe.All I was doing was sighting in my new scope that also had my new butler creek flip cap attached ... and the cap broke at the hinge . Like it was brittle . I was absolutely stunned . First time out and it broke . Very surprised .
 i placed my order on jan. 21st . i was notified today feb. 9th . 2012 that opticsale still has not shipped my item . extremely poor customer service . buyer beware . p.s. i sent email today to cancel order .
 I purchase this because I thought I was getting what is actually shown in the picture . However , what I received was only the clear rubber bite mouthpiece . The red/black valve part shown in the picture -LRB- to which the rubber mouthpiece is affixed by sliding onto the red part of the red/black valve -RRB- is NOT included . I needed the whole assembly and not just one part of it . Sticking the mouthpiece onto a tube by itself is useless given that there is NO VALVE which will turn the flow of water on and off . Apparently , I need to buy the entire MSR hydration kit -LRB- for $ 20 -RRB- which includes the assembly shown in this picture , the tubing and the cap in order to actually get what is shown in the picture for this item . If they are only selling the mouthpiece then they need to advertise it as such . A mouthpiece is not a `` valve . '' The valve -LRB- red/black part -RRB- shown in the picture is a valve . I needed what was shown and not just a part of it . This is a grossly misleading advertisement and needs to be fixed . I realize we 're only talking about 6-7 dollars , but for that price , I SHOULD have gotten the whole assembly .
 It is OK for a double seat cushion or cut in half for two . However there is no frame and the straps with one cushion in back offer no support . It is all kind of floppy .
 I hate giving a bad review but if I can save someone from making the mistake I did on purchasing this , it will be worth it . It was inexpensive , but the poor quality of the product still made it a bad purchase . It has never been used and will continue to `` collect dust '' until I give it away to charity .
 This mug works great while it last however , do n't expect the mug to last longer than 6 months before it cracks . I actually bought this mug twice the first one lasted about 6 months before I notice the crack . I at first thought it was because I left it in the freezer too long.Yet the second one I bought and this one only lasted 2 1/2 months before it cracked . I also only kept it in the freezer no longer than 2 hours however , it still cracked.My advice if you HAVE to have is buy 2 . One for looks and the other to drink out of even after the crack happens .
 Bought this halter because the headline said `` Yearling '' halter . NOT MINI YEARLING which is how it arrived . I 'm so angry they need to be very specific with their advertising whether these are actual HORSE size or miniature horse size .
 We have a baby -LRB- 3 year old -RRB- shire who keeps breaking out of his halters , and any replacements we find are all too small ... I was pleasantly surprised that this piece was too big for our little guy - we made a new hole for the buckle under the chin , and have no complaints . Even though the description says 1100 + pounds , it 'll fit your 1600 + Draft with no problems . : -RRB- Edit
 This strap is well-made and potentially comfortable , but at its longest length , shorter than many other straps I own . Disappointing but not worth returning .
 I play an acoustic and the strap really is too short . It should have been about 5 '' longer . I read the reviews and I thought maybe the guys who play electric below their belts thought it was too short , but apparently unless you 're 90 years old and play your guitar under your chin it 's just too darn short . The other problem is that the strap adjustment loops on the back do n't lay flat . Therefore , you have a constant bump on your back where the strap adjustment is at . I would have sent this back but my wife threw away the packaging so I 'm basically stuck with it .
 4/8/10 - I bought this Golf Guard case in December of 2009 . It has four clasps . One of the clasps did n't make it through the first flight in January on Delta ... it literally got ripped off . I 've now traveled with it several times and I 'm down to 2 remaining clasps . Last night on the luggage carousel , only one of the remaining clasps was holding it closed . Today I had to ask the TSA to tape the bag closed . It 's a shame ... every other feature of this bag is as advertised ... I really like the case ... but the cheap clasps are a critical design flaw . I 'd recommend you spend a little more money on a sturdier case .
 Bar started rusting one the day it was installed . I do not recommend this item unless you plan on painting it .
 This item does what it is suppose to do and looks nice but after about two weeks the emblem fell off of the money clip . Should have invested ina more expensive one .
 Good product when it works but once the light goes out , there is no way to replace it so you need to throw the lantern away . Thats a fatal design flow . We did n't even use it much , its been sitting on the shelf . Come on GE !
 It never even occurred to me to use this for emergencies , as the power here goes out so seldom . I bought this in a store 's camping department , and that 's what we use it for . Unfortunately , last weekend while camping a big storm blew through and knocked the lantern over . No big deal , it just tipped off the hanger it was on and fell about 3 feet . It 's rugged , right?The bulb never came on right after that . We opened it up to find out exactly what type it was so we could buy another , and found out it 's NOT a normal replaceable bulb ; it 's hardwired into the base . Once the bulb is dead your lantern is dead . What an absolute waste of money and materials !
 I bought the GE Emergency Lantern several years ago . I tested it and it worked . I removed the batteries and waited for an emergency . The snow came to Atlanta today . I pulled the lantern out , put in batteries that were new , and discovered the lantern does not work , even after repeated testing and changing of batteries . I would say it is unreliable . It appears a switch problem . The lantern was not used , except for the successful test . It is fraud to sell something like this . I would advise not risking money on this product and I would conclude it is junk.GE Emergency Lantern
 Yes , this was a great light when it worked . Now that the bulb is out , there is NO WAY to replace it . A sledge hammer would be necessary to break in to get the bulb out , then what 's the point . I definitely would recommend buying something you can replace the bulb .
 I had this lantern for over 5 years . Used mainly for camping . The unit is great and durable . BUT now that the bulb is burnt , I disassembled the unit to get to the bulb . The bulb attached by wire to the battery unit . I research replacement bulbs and guess what - there is no replacement . Now this unit will go into the trash and fill the land field . How sad when the problem could be resolved by buying another build . Do n't waste you 're hard money on this unit . BAD CALL GE !
 This thing is junk . I have one . I did n't use it all that often . But when I did , 9 times out of 10 the batteries in it were dead . Not the normal drain you 'd expect from batteries sitting on a shelf , this one seems to kill them even when it 's off . I keep a 4 D-cell MagLite on the same shelf as this one and it 's batteries have lasted much , much longer . Both having been loaded with fresh Duracell alkaline D-cells at the same time . And when it 's turned on it 's a horrible power hog . Especially when compared to other portable fluorescent lanterns.What 's really worse about it is YOU CAN NOT REPLACE THE BULB . It 's soldered and glued into place and CAN NOT be replaced . 8000 hour lamp life my eye . Mine ca n't have lasted more than 300 hours of time being lit . So now several pounds of plastic and metal will go into the trash . Oh , wait , it ca n't go in the trash because it 's got a fluorescent bulb with mercury in it , so it 'll have to go in the hazardous waste recycling . An even bigger waste because of the non-removable bulb.I 'm more than willing to give products a break but this one gets a total thumbs DOWN.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS .
 Theres no bulbs for this when it fails . They dont even last 1000 hrs much less 8000 like advertised . Its a junk throw away for our land fills ... Another P.O.S. made by Jasco and GE . They dont care what they sell .
 GE made these with 2 different bulb types . Ones replacable , but this style bulb here you throw bulb & lantern away when it goes.The new GE lanterns Fluorescent bulbs are not available . There 's some hard wired and glued into place . These lights are junk and filling up our landfills . GE is the biggest lightbulb manufacture in the world and refuses to make them for its own products . Also owners are stating less than 1000 hrs usage from these bulbs . I can believe that too since I quit buying GE 's regular bulbs a few yrs back due to short life span.If this was a 10.00 lantern I would tend to agree with them to toss the light but at 29.00 they can kiss mine ! Buyer Beware of GE 's practices . Research all thier products well.As a side note
 THe lantern worked well till jarred and the bulb blew . EAsy to remove but can not find a replacement . Would not buy another ,
 This can be described as a glorified flashlight . Emergency lights come on automatically when the power goes off . With this product , you need to switch it on as it is powered by 4 D-batteries . Not to mentioned the batteries are not included , so you are looking at buying batteries and keeping them handy when the power goes off . The latern looks nice - has a classic look . For me or if you are aged , for example , you do n't want to go search for this light when you have no power , I would like the place around me light up so I can be safe . If you are going camping , then you might find the product claimed 18 hour battery life useful . I returned the product .
 I bought this item and receive the chinese one . Not TITANUM!Please , a little think before order this `` seiko '' !
 I was about to buy one but not after hearing its not titanium ? can anyone help me out with a reply if its a legitimate watch ??
 I was wrong to think that these socks had cushions on heels and toe areas - they do n't . they are very very thin . . and lost its shape after just one wash .
 The first time I wore the socks I got a nice blister within 5 miles , and had to end my hike early . I like the sock in general for the gym or whatever ... but they did n't prevent any blisters ...
 5 stars for the socks themselves - I ended up wearing them myself ! I got them as a gift for my brother in law but the size Medium only fits up to men 's size 7 or so ! I had to go to a store and buy his socks , then ended up keeping them for myself . They are really great socks but carefully check the size chart .
 Although it gives the appearance of a solid product , this press is a textbook example of poor engineering . I want to consider two issues separately , design and reliability.Design : This device appears to have been designed by successive corrections of mistakes , rather than by following a global engineering plan . To disassemble and clean the priming system , for example , requires unscrewing several layers of components . In addition , screw heads are not aligned in an intelligent manner so that you can reasonably comfortably use a screwdriver or other tools . Components critical to the proper functioning of the press are installed in a way that proper placement ca n't be seen , such as some of the primer smaller parts , made of fragile plastic . Changing the shell holder plate is a cumbersome process prone to mistakes - for example , the indexing ball bearing can easily fall off if extreme care is not taken . Changing the primer plunger is also cumbersome and the smaller plunger does not necessarily properly line up with the center of the primers . The issue of design is not a problem until you have to take the press apart -LRB- which happens often , as we will see next -RRB- and find yourself working through layer upon layer of mechanical components . On the plus side , the die plates give a measure of flexibility.Reliability : The awkward mechanical complexity would be tolerable if the device were reliable , but it nothing like that at all . The main culprit is the priming system . It takes only a few granules of powder to fall into the priming system to inhibit it from working properly , and for you to spend significant time accessing the internal components of the priming system to clear that one granule of powder . You have to go through several layers of unscrewing , with screws of different sizes and lengths to get to the place of interest -LRB- the screws do not line up with accessible space , remember -RRB- . Astonishingly , the most critical components in the priming system are made of extremely fragile plastic and are very prone to failure.Conclusion : This press gives the impression of solidity , and as long as nothing goes wrong with the priming system you can argue it is relatively solid . However , solidity and strength do not translate into reliability when a critical component stands in the way .
 Please do not order from this company -LRB- RnL Treasures -RRB- . I ordered this item on 30 Jun and have still not received my merchandise -LRB- it 's 26 July -RRB- . I emailed Rnl Treasures several times for a status of my order and they have not responded to this day ! Find these battleaxes somewhere else - that 's what I am going to do !

 I 've had good luck with most Platypus stuff but the bite valves are not worth the money . They hardly give any flow - unless you bite really hard , AND they leak ! I 've bought two in the past year and they both leak . I thought I may have abused the first one so I took care to make sure the second was not treated poorly , however it 's been less than two weeks and it already leaks !
 On 8-21-2012 I ordered a set of leupold 30mm rings for a sako rifle.What I got was a set of 1 '' rings.I sent them back on 9-10-2012 and asked for a refund.It is now 9-30-2012 and I have no refund , and there is no contact phone number on your site . Sence then I bought 30mm rings at brunos shooting supply . Will someone at amazon look in to this and send my money back , thats if anyone at amazon reads these reviews .
 I loved the look of this watch , SKA245 . The quality of case , bracelet and crown were excellent , and the price was right.The problem I had , was the watch would never hold a charge , regardless of how much I tried the `` start-up procedure '' as indicated in the instructions . -LRB- The second-hand keeps skipping every other second , indicating a low charge -RRB- . Speaking of instructions , my watch came with the manual for another Seiko model , not the Kinetic . What they did include was a photo copy of the instruction sheet tucked into the watch 's box ... very strange!The bottom line was , I am returning the watch and do n't know if I would ever buy another Seiko Kinetic . Too bad , it was a beautiful looking watch . Not recomended at this time .
 The watch itself is a beautiful piece , but if it 's not worn every day it stops working , which I find annoying . They are supposed to hold a battery life after a full charge for at least 3-6 months ... I 'm about to send it back .
 The first time I used this tube , it got a small hole on the seam . I was able to fix it . The second time I used the tube , it split a crack about two inches long . Because of the cold , the material became brittle , causing the crack . The temperature was about 10 F , not an unreasonable temperature for sledding , I would think . This tube stinks . Enron stock is worth more than this thing .
 I read the reviews that told me these snow tubes do n't last , but I tried anyway . It 's true , they do n't last long . I have three boys 10 and under who put them to the test . One sprung a leak , unable to sustain rougher sledding . If you have a child who is not rough -LRB- jumping on after running for speed -RRB- this tube might work . I do n't recommend it for active kids .

 I have a standard 48 x 72 goal and this wo n't fit . I bought this as a Christmass present for my son and he is very dissapointed . Hopefully I can send it back . Do not buy this unless you have an undersized goal .
 Looks like it would last awhile , since it is pretty thick . The velcro straps look substantial enough to take some abuse . But , if you have an official size goal 4 ' x 6 ' ... it wo n't fit . Although it said on the package that it `` fits most 4 ` x6 ' goals '' . My goal is a pretty common 4 ` x6 ' goal and the target is good 6 '' too narrow . I guess it must be made overseas and someone there did n't convert their metric system to inches correctly .
 Nice . They have `` vegetarian '' right in the title of the product , and it has BEEF in it ! WTF ?!?!?!

 Only for the novice . A boring watch . Slow slow slooow . Poorly presented . What were you thinking Phil &#62; ?! Do not recommend .
 I got a white , straight cotton version of this tank -LRB- no polyblend -RRB- . The shirt did n't have loads of reviews , but I took a shot at getting one . The cotton is cheap and nasty feeling . Abrasive like paper towel or something , washing did n't make it any better . I will be tossing it aside for extra . I tried wearing it as an undershirt , by the time the day was over I was itching -LRB- literally -RRB- to get it off ASAP . For $ 8 per I feel it should have been a little better quality , I will keep shopping around .
 Pros - Very cheap - as in affordableCons - Shrinks much more than the equivalent product by Champion . - Bottom of shirt curls upwards , very annoying . - Does not last long - holes start forming in about a year . - Cotton is also courser than Champion .
 I purchased a Russel workout tank on amazon and was seriously disappointed . It was not the same sturdy , medium weight shirts I have been buying in the department stores . I decided to try this brand , which was a couple of bucks more and I was fine with that thinking -LRB- hoping -RRB- it would be a quality product . It is not . It is the same tissue paper crap . In fact it has a spongy stretchy feel to the cloth . At least the Russel tank had a decent texture . Both these shirts developed holes the very first day at the gym . The Anvil also blew a hem seam on day 1 . I am not an animal in the gym . The wear through is from normal abrasion from the machines padded areas . Ya , pathetic . Keep looking folks . Me , I 'm back to buying at the department stores . You can not trust the name brands any longer . My thoughts , e-stores like Amazon , eBay etc. have driven the prices down so low that the top brands have dredged up cheaper online only product lines to keep them competitive.I gave the tank 1 star as it fit well although I did go one size larger than what I would typically buy from a brick and moorter . It has a good free movement cut and plenty of length . I will not buy again and do not recommend this product unless you can not stand any weight on your skin . Realize it will disintegrate after a short time .
 They are already in the garbage . My daughter wore them once . Enough said .
 I have owned a boat buddy trailering accessory for about a year and a half and have been sorely disappointed with it since the second trip to the lake . The product sounds great and I beleived it would save time on the ramp but I found that to be untrue . The directions state the you must still latch your boat with the winch strap when you trailer down the road and I found that it was best to latch it before you drive up the ramp unless you want to use a hammer to drive the pin loose from the eye of the boat the next time you launch it . One of the first problems you 'll find with the design of the accessory is getting it to latch properly . If you do a good job of hitting the latch dead center and with enough force it will latch as designed and you 'll think , WOW , this thing is great ! But when you do hit it off center , let 's say about three or four inches to the left , you will easily bend the latching lever back toward your tow vehicle making it inoperable . Not a problem as long as you have your hammer ready . You can bend it right back in place as it is weak and easily bent . It would be a good idea to always have a hammer handy with this product so that you do n't leave others waiting for you on the boat ramp . You will also find that if you do n't really tighten up the winch strap before you leave the ramp , the latch pin will pop out of it 's own receiving hole while you are trailering down the highway and it will be bent when you arrive at the lake . Grab your hammer again ! Just a few raps and your back on the water . If you just have the strap one or two notches too loose the eye of the boat will be wedged tightly against the locking pin but not enough pressure to bend the pin . Again , you 'll need your hammer to drive the pin loose . This product should include a hammer ! Do n't expect any help , apologies , sympathy or refund from the manufacturer because the customer service department is as poor as the product . The worst investment I 've made in fishing ! My boat buddy -LRB- and the money it cost -RRB- are in the trash .

 It 's bulky . Shifts a lot.Defenately not good for boats where you will be sitting for an extended period of time.Very uncomfortable with seats that have backs on them . I used it in my seaeagle kayak for 4 hours and it was very uncomfortable . I 'm going to look at a neoprene vest that has a lot less bulk .
 Before ordering , we looked up the measurements on the Stearns website , so we could be sure to order the correct size . This arrived and is being returned on Monday at first UPS pickup . The size is NOT correct . XL is stated to fit up to a 48 '' chest on Stearns website -LRB- Amazon , inconveniently , does NOT provide ANY sizing info -RRB- , but this does NOT fit that way . FAR too small . It looked like my husband was trying to wear a child 's life vest when he tried this on - it rode up way too high around him on all sides , and while it did close in front , it just looked too small . He also said it just did n't feel right - the `` riding up '' all around meant that the shoulders did n't rest properly on his shoulders . This is NOT the insecure feeling you want when you 're swimming in Lake Michigan , esp . if there are one to three foot waves ! We are not water testing this - we got it last night , and it 's already packed up to be picked up for return on Monday.Amazon , please start providing sizing info -LRB- that you verify yourselves ... do n't just go by manufacturer 's stated measurements -RRB- so that your customers can buy with more confidence!I am still giving this two stars , though , because the quality SEEMS to be good -LRB- nice padding , good shoulder webbing , etc. -RRB- If only the sizing info were provided accurately -LRB- or at ALL ... Amazon , I 'm talking to YOU here -RRB- . I recommend buying this in store , in person , AFTER trying on . Do NOT buy this via mail or online order ... you 'll likely be disappointed.OTOH , the Body Glove life jacket that we ordered DOES fit correctly , just as per the stated measurements . We 're keeping that one . So it 's down to the usual
 This life vest keeps me above water , I suppose , but it is way too big and unable to be tightened sufficiently , so it rides up to my chin .

 Disappointing . Instruction could have been completed in one DVD . DVD # 1 used up 10 min or more at the end , interacting with a grandchild . This time could have been spent on instruction . DVD # 2 , which was to complete the wreath begun on DVD # 1 , did not show actual placement of some of the flowers/greens . It only showed the wreath after the fact . Since you are only able to see the finished wreath , it leaves you guessing at why particular greenery was chosen and why it was placed in certain areas of the wreath . I felt this was important information to have when attempting to design a wreath of your own -LRB- which is why I bought the instructional DVDs . -RRB-
 The drain hole is 2 &#34; above the bottom of the floor of the cooler making it difficult to drain the cooler with anything inside . Also no way to fasten the lid of the cooler so racoons ca n't get inside . The cup holers reduce the insulating integrity of the lid . On the plus side it is a good size compact cooler that kept better cooling than another cooler it replaced . Still looking for a great cooler for camping .
 This cooler is big . It has rollers for easy transport . It even has cup holders at the top . But it fails to do the most important thing - keeping things cool . It must be an insulation de-fect or design flaw . Or perhaps it 's not produced to keep things cool for long periods of time -LRB- like 12 hours or a full day -RRB- . This barely kept things cool for four hours , with ice in it . Everything melted.The problem with good coolers is that someone manages to steal it from you . So I had to purchase a new one . This looked good , but upon using it once , will never use again.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT .
 Cooler looks and feels great however one day on the beach and the sand got in the handle and made it impossible to close it , and if the handle is n't closed you ca n't leave the lid open so that makes it very inconvenient . Unfortunately we had to return it . If they make something like this but with a handle that does n't have holes I would purchase it again .
 I 've had two of these and they are simply average . They do the trick but eventually break from wear . If you plan on jumping rope regularly like I do -LRB- 20-45 mins a session , several times a week -RRB- you should get a better rope.A decent rope will not cost much more than 20 dollars -LRB- e.g. a Nike rope , which I just reviewed -RRB- , but will last you for years . I have worn out one of these Everlast ropes in just a few months . The other lasted about a year before breaking . Typically ropes break either near the handle or where it hits the ground - I 've had one of each type of failure happen with this rope . The handle does not have a bearing , so the rope is n't as free to rotate . Furthermore , the rope itself is pretty thin and does n't last much wear.Sometimes `` more is less '' - if you go ahead and just dish out the 20 bucks now , you 'll probably end up with a rope that will outlast several of these .
 Do not buy this product . It wears down and breaks , either at the handle or by the cord -LRB- yes , I used it so much that it wore down the rubber cord so that it broke -RRB- . Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money to get a better rope .
 Not great . You ca n't adjust the rope length . There is only a small plastic stopper inside the handle - no ball bearings to help the rope rotate . The vinyl rope holds kinks way too much . Do n't buy this ...
 I bought this from Ross for like 4 bucks . I liked it , until it broke after 2-3 weeks . The rope rubs at the handle and will eventually break . The rope weight is good and it spins well , so I 'll give it two stars , but it is not durable whatsoever . I think other reviews have said the same thing . I just bought the Valeo deluxe speed rope , and that seems way more durable and it spins even better in my opinion .
 Pun intended -- this is a speed rope you should skip . I do n't understand how people can rate this four stars while noting that it breaks easily . If the rope breaks , it stinks ! Mine lasted about a half-dozen workouts before breaking . That 's ridiculous . I figured that it was cheap because jumpropes are such simple pieces of equipment . Wrong -- this rope is cheap because it 's a piece of garbage . Spend more and get something better .
 I bought 5 of these ropes for my friends and myself and within a week of normal use the cord literally broke on ALL OF THEM !! We thought this was outrageous and so not expected from everlast products , but come to think of it , I 've purchased everlast handwraps and the thumb strap and the hook n loop closure are poorly sewn so they come off easily making them useless . You would think that a brand that specializes on boxing gear would be your best bet but it is NOT!I can not begin to express my frustration , I mean , I would totally understand if it was 1 out of 5 , but 5 OUT OF 5 IN A WEEK ?? This is just a rip off . I ca n't return them since I 'm in south america , but based on my experience , I figure that if this company ca n't even make a simple jump rope that works properly , I 'm not even gon na try the gloves , shoes or anything else from Everlast .
 Because of the way the rope is attached to the handles , continuous spinning wears it down very quickly . While I was jumping , one side of the cord snapped and almost hit someone at the gym . Buy this only if you 're trying out jump rope for the first time . If you like it , invest on a better one in the future -LRB- such as Buddy Lee 's for $ 30 -RRB- .
 I bought this jump rope at TJ Maxx for about $ 6 . The price wasnt bad , but the rope broke on me in 3 weeks . i would buy a real speed rope or something different
 Rope snapped at the handle , and the other side is worn through 50 % , so maybe the plastic rope is too soft , or the handles too sharp.I 'll put it with the Everlast Heavy Bag , which snapped its hang straps in 4 months.Ironic company name , now that I notice it .
 I waited in anticipation for my legendary SOG knife to arrive after I had waited years to accually own one . I removed it from the package to find the knife only in a small cardboard sheath around the blade and nothing else.Every other knife I have ever ordered came much better packaged . The knife has a good edge and a good look but it has flaws , very small but yet there . It does not feel like quality as do my lesser priced Kabars , Case and Ontario knives do . The sheath is a joke , nothing but a couple of cheap weak rivets and poor stiching , the hole for the leg tie was not even punched all the way threw , I do not see it holding up well . It even feels cheap . My other knives have better leather and better , rougher construction and rivits in key positions . My rate for this knife on a 1-10 would be 5 and dissapointed . My rate on the value and price ; it is comparable to a $ 20.00 flea market special , big let down . SOG has lost my admiration .
 I liked having this mirror and it was inexpensive , but it was also , cheap . The piece for mounting it broke off within a couple of months . And that 's with minimal use . It was a disappointment .
 This was rather difficult to install on my boat . I also found out that it does n't meet the requirements for acceptable mirrors in Texas by the US Coast Guard .
 It works fine . You get what you pay for . The key word for this product is `` economy '' .
 Advertised Product Features -LRB- Actual Product Feature -RRB- - cotton -LRB- actually 35 % cotton and 65 % polyester -RRB- + Feature form-fitted eye , nose , and mouth openings as well as an elastic band to hold the mask in place without slipping -LRB- actually true -RRB- - The specially-designed openings help prevent glasses from fogging up -LRB- actually causes glasses to fog up quite a bit -RRB- + Available in Mossy Oak Break-Up Camo pattern -LRB- actually true -RRB- If this was advertised as a poly/cotton mossy oak break up half mask , then I would have given it a much better review . However , I think if a product is sold as cotton , then it should be made of cotton .
 The tires are of average quality . please be sure you want gum wall tires , as this tire has a yellow/tan side wall , NOT BLACK AS THEPICTURE SHOWS!I would not have purchased this tire , if the the advertizement pictured showed a yellow/tan side wall , its clearly black in the picture ! Please update your product picture , to include the actual product being sold . The tires have a brand name of Kenda on the side wall , not Sunlite .
 It 's difficult shopping online for proper replicas of favorite movie swords , and even harder to find the real thing . As a bit of initial consumer advice I recommend when your going to buy a replica from an online store you look at all available options and choose the most expensive one.Why ? You stand the best chance of getting something as close as possible in resemblance to what you want . That said , this sword is definitely choice when compared to other cheaper versions . In the product description it is mentioned several times that this blade is sharpened . Now I 've been collecting swords for years and I know full well that Martial arts weapons with a fine edge are very expensive , so of course I did n't expect this one to be sharp at it 's price , which of course it was n't . Chinese swords however make for exellent practice tools for martial arts , mainly because their style requires much more focus on fighting it out rather than the goal of `` one cut , one kill '' style fighting that samurais focus on with katanas . Very difficult to master , but worth the price for a dull blade that is a licensed movie replica .
 Franklin Classic Series 107mm . Bocce SetThe bocce set was what I had expected but the shipping and follow up was disappointing . The bocce set was shipped in the display box , clearly not strong enough for the heavy bocce set , so when it arrived the box was ripped and torn up . I had contacted the company but they were no help only stating that they often ship in the display box . I wo n't puchase through them again or use Amazon .
 I BOUGHT ONE OF THESE ABOUT 7 YEARS AGO FOR MY WHEELCHAIR AND IT HAS WORKED GREAT UNTIL IT ACCIDENTALLY GOT BROKEN . WHEN I RE-ORDERED , WHAT CAME WAS JUNK ! IT DID N'T WORK RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX . THE COMPANY WAS VERY NICE AND REPLACED IT IMMEDIATELY . UNFORTUNATELY THAT ALSO WAS JUNK ! IT WORKED FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS THEN FELL APART-LITERALLY !! . SAD TO SAY BUT AS FAR AS I CAN SEARCH , THIS IS THE ONLY COMPANY THAT MAKES THESE TYPES OF HORNS , AND THEY ATTACH PERFECTLY TO MY WHEELCHAIR . I LIKE THEM BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT SOUNDS AND THEY ARE VERY LOUD TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF MY WAY . I ORDERED ANOTHER OUT OF NECESSITY AND AM PRAYING TO GOD I GET A DECENT ONE THIS TIME . IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL IF COMPANIES STILL TOOK THE TIME TO MANUFACTURE THINGS AS THEY DID YEARS AGO ... TO LAST !
 i got 3 of these for my boys and only one worked well . One did not work at all . they are poorly put together made frm thin cheap plastic . For the price i expected more . DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM !!
 When I first got this item , it was great and had alot of fun with it . However after about 2 months of use , the switch on the microphone broke . I wasnt able to change from the PA to the siren function and back .
 Fell apart very quickly and the back snapped off the first time we tried to use it . The sound was distorted and sounded like the speaker was blown . As cheap as cheap can be . Overall
 First the siren came and it was purple.Then inside one wire was dislocatedand stop working . Dad tape it back together . The siren part works great , but the mic was in and out
 well , received the product and opened it . All looked OK . Inserted a new nine volt battery per instructions . Tried the microphone and OK . Tried the # 1 siren and Ok , Tried the # 2 siren and Ok . Tried the # 3 siren and the same as # 2 . It should be a third type and no good . Only two of the sierns work . Not good.I would n't buy this horn .
 Do not waste your money on this . Very poor quality ... I 'll be amazed if my son gets the rest of the summer out of it . The bracket that mounts it to the handle bars broke within the first few days he had it . I had to make a new bracket for it . Go for a more expensive , better quality product ... this is junk !
 I just got today it was early but its junk its not loud at all and its tiny and wont go on my bike !
 Ok I was excited to buy two of these for our son and nephew for Easter but upon receiving them the box says `` Chemical is known to cause cancer in the state of California . '' Not taking the chance of having my kid play with this thing so I am returning it . Not sure what the heck it means to me , but sounds like a red flag so a word of caution to fellow buyers .
 Warning on the box states : Contains a chemical known to the State of California that causes cancer ...
 Why dont MFG put a fly in Mens Pants . We Men need a fly or we have a problem . I will buy no more pants , shorts , that dont have a fly.The Wolfman
 I bought these thinking they would be great for my son 's new airsoft guns . My son and I tried these in all three spring operated airsoft guns we have . NONE of the paintballs would break , infact they were so soft and rubber like that the paintballs often jamed when even loading one at a time . The airsoft guns we have range from 230fps to 265fps . I also have one that is 310fps , which is above the limit on the bottle -LRB- says not to use at more than 285fps -RRB- . I fired them from all distances at a brick wall , even at point blank range these pieces of junk did n't break , they bounced . All I can say is if you want paintballs these are NOT the ones to buy . I wasted $ 60 on 6mm paintballs that do n't break and I ca n't even use as ammo just to get rid of them because they do n't load . Do n't buy these ...
 I bought two bottles of these -LRB- red and blue -RRB- for my airsoft pistols and rifles . Thinking it would keep my buddies from cheating when they have been hit . They would have worked fine if they were actually 6mm bbs . Granted some of them are , others are way smaller than 6mm . The size of these bbs is so irregular that they just end up falling out of the barrel of the guns . All in all they are not worth the money . They are absolutely horrible , but they do splatter nicely though .

 I got a white , straight cotton version of this tank -LRB- no polyblend -RRB- . The shirt did n't have loads of reviews , but I took a shot at getting one . The cotton is cheap and nasty feeling . Abrasive like paper towel or something , washing did n't make it any better . I will be tossing it aside for extra . I tried wearing it as an undershirt , by the time the day was over I was itching -LRB- literally -RRB- to get it off ASAP . For $ 8 per I feel it should have been a little better quality , I will keep shopping around .
 Pros - Very cheap - as in affordableCons - Shrinks much more than the equivalent product by Champion . - Bottom of shirt curls upwards , very annoying . - Does not last long - holes start forming in about a year . - Cotton is also courser than Champion .
 I purchased a Russel workout tank on amazon and was seriously disappointed . It was not the same sturdy , medium weight shirts I have been buying in the department stores . I decided to try this brand , which was a couple of bucks more and I was fine with that thinking -LRB- hoping -RRB- it would be a quality product . It is not . It is the same tissue paper crap . In fact it has a spongy stretchy feel to the cloth . At least the Russel tank had a decent texture . Both these shirts developed holes the very first day at the gym . The Anvil also blew a hem seam on day 1 . I am not an animal in the gym . The wear through is from normal abrasion from the machines padded areas . Ya , pathetic . Keep looking folks . Me , I 'm back to buying at the department stores . You can not trust the name brands any longer . My thoughts , e-stores like Amazon , eBay etc. have driven the prices down so low that the top brands have dredged up cheaper online only product lines to keep them competitive.I gave the tank 1 star as it fit well although I did go one size larger than what I would typically buy from a brick and moorter . It has a good free movement cut and plenty of length . I will not buy again and do not recommend this product unless you can not stand any weight on your skin . Realize it will disintegrate after a short time .

 The tubes are great while they last , but the first one I got the handle developed a tear during the first workout rendering it pretty much useless . Okay , just a manufacturing defect I thought ; no biggie . Well it happened again on the replacement one . I contacted the company directly , who promised to send me another , but it has been over a month and nothing 's arrived . The handles just are n't strong enough . It 's probably not an issue for the lighter tension tubes , but not these . It 's a great workout while it lasts . Cable training is highly underrated and I may never buy freeweights again . I will however , be buying another brand of cables from now on though .
 There is not water release at the bottom ... so if you need to drain it , it is a pain in the ass . And shame on AMAZON for charging me 14 bucks to return it . No that was n't the cost of shipping , that was my refund mins some kind of return fee . So do n't buy it ... it 's not worth it .
 Bought this cooler about a year and half ago at Target.I chose this one because I wanted a 40-45 quart 5-day type cooler with wheels . This was my first Igloo brand cooler -LRB- before most were Coleman -RRB- . It keeps ice cold , but the walls are only `` half as thick '' as my 10 year old Coleman 5 day cooler and I was surprised how much this made a difference . Using this as a day cooler on a trip to the mountains , I had to empty the cooler daily due to melted ice and food floating in water . -LRB- better package your food well or it will get soggy -RRB- . The cooler also does n't have a drain . So you have to turn it upside down or on it 's side to empty , which is an issue if you 've got food in it.The lid also started popping off after about 2 months of light use . It 's easy to pop back on , but will come off any time it 's twisted lightly.the wheels on it also are `` not solid '' , so forget trying to pull it in sand.Negatives * no drain plug * lid pops off * poor ice retention compared to other 5 day coolers * cheap wheels * thin walls for a 5 day coolerso while it does a decent job , I would n't buy it again . Because of the above negatives , is why I only rated it at 2 stars.as a note , this cooler was replaced this year by a Yeti brand cooler . It kicks ass compared to this cooler .
 The cooler is fine it keeps things cold . The parts the hinges the snap that holds the lid closed . The plastic strap attached to the lid . The plastic handle have not lasted and had to be replaced . The snap on the lid has broken three times . I have looked at replacing it with a metal one but than one of the large side carrying handles broke . So I am done . This cooler is kind of like a big razor . Its the parts replacement that costs you . I did n't abuse this cooler I took it from the car set it on the porch and it stays in the garage . My last Igloo cooler .
 This cooler is difficult to open . I ca n't open it at all with one hand . If you have children who may need to open this cooler or you want to open this cooler without setting down your beer , think again .
 This cooler did indeed do a very good job keeping ice for days at a time . If the ice did n't stay frozen , the water did stay cold for at least 5 days . The one MAJOR problem I had with this cooler is that it does not have a drain . Every other version of this cooler available comes with a drain except this one . I only wish I had realized that before I had bought it . Unfortunately though , this is the only Max Cold cooler that has wheels which was the major reason I bought it other then the Max Cold feature .
 This cooler keeps ice well but there are a couple of problems with the design . The cooler does n't have a drain so it 's a pain to drain the water when it 's still full of food and drinks . The removable lid was a good idea but very poorly executed . The lid always falls off when you have it open to remove food . The lid is also prone to flying off -LRB- even when closed -RRB- when driving with it in the bed of your truck or boat . Be sure to tie it down because there is n't a latch to keep it closed .
 Late last summer I purchased the Luminox Men 's Original Nay SEAL dive watch from the Watch Colony whose company is a seller in the Amazon marketplace . Because I trusted any seller that would be approved by the Amazon marketplace I paid $ 189.00 for what I hoped would be a great replacement watch to the one I had purchased from a retail jewelry store fifteen years earlier . When the watch arrived there was no warranty card with the shipment , only a small rubber id tag giving what looks like a serial number.The watch appeared at first glance to be fine , the only major change from my previous navy seal watch was the strap which was a thinner more pliable rubber one . Later in the year when it was time to turn the clocks back for the end of daylight savings time , I attempted to pull out the watch stem to change the time . IT WOULD NOT BUDGE ! I called the Watch Colony to tell them the problem . The person answering the phone stated in broken English that `` The watch supposed to be that way , stem will not pull out easily because of waterproof '' . This sounded ridiculous to me , so I followed up with two subsequent emails and got the same answer , furthermore , they would not take the watch back since more than 30 days had elapsed since the date of purchase.I sat next to a gentleman on a plane who had just received the same watch from a different retailer for his birthday . I explained my problem and he said the dealer was lying to me , and effortlessly pulled out his watch stem with one fingernail!I then called the manufacturer of the navy seal watch , Luminox and explained the situation . They also told me the Watch Colony was lying about the watch , the stem should pull out effortlessly . Furthermore , they stated that the Watch Colony was not an authorized dealer for navy seal watches , and because of that and the missing warranty card , the usual two year warranty would not be honored.For all I know the Watch Colony may be selling black market items that are inferior to the original design ... they could not find any warranty card for my watch or any other navy seal watch to send me when asked . If I wanted Luminox to repair the inferior watch stem the cost to me would be well over $ 100.00 ! I have attempted five times to get my money back from this dealer , but neither the Watch Colony nor Amazon will refund my money . I have been a good customer of Amazon for over ten years and can not believe they would allow a fly by night company such as the Watch Colony to do business under the good name of Amazon . I am writing this not only to express my outrage at being a victim of an unscrupulous dealer , but to warn future buyers off.This has been the worst buying experience I have had in over ten years !
 Luminox makes money by advertising their watches as being tough , as being used by Navy Seals , and as being a quality product.My 3000 series had the crystal break while fishing in alaska . I am not talking about Deadliest Catch abuse , I am talking fishing with a rod and reel for salmon . A very little bump on the side of the boat and a nice break across the face of the watch . To be honest , this did not bother me that much . I assumed that my watch , 3 months old , would be taken care of by Luminox . To my surprise , Luminox denied the claim and charged me $ 130 to replace the crystal . What was even more absurd than their price was that it took 3 months for them to ship my watch back to me . This is not some random repair shop , this was the Luminox Customer Service Center.After getting my watch back , it lasted another 4 months and the bezel broke . Of course , this was not covered under warranty and after $ 60 and 5 weeks at Luminox Customer Service Center , my watch arrives with a different bezel than the original bezel . After calling the Service Center , I have to send my watch back so they can replace the incorrect bezel with the original model . I ship the watch back , at my expense , and it takes them 3 weeks to call me back and tell me the original bezel is no longer available.I finally get my watch back , a few weeks pass , and I take the kids to the pool to hang out and get some sun . After swimming for about an hour , I look at my watch and notice that the crystal has fogged up and I can not read the watch . My guess would be that Luminox , after opening my watch 3 different times has messed up the waterproofing of the watch . After calling their customer service center , guess what ? You betcha , since the watched was opened due to a non-warranty issue , they will not repair it for free . So the bottom line is the LUMINOX SERVICE CENTER will not even warranty their own work.For a company that promotes their watch as tough , it is anything but and the company itself borders on being criminal in their enforcement of their own warranty and service.I have since bought a G-shock that I has lasted for 3 years without even having to have the band replaced , much less a crystal or bezel .
 I purchased this watch with the thought of ruggedness in mind . I was impressed with the style when I first received it . I noticed that most of the positive reviews here were from customers that also enjoyed the looks and have n't had the watch for a long period of time . Also note that reviews on this watch on other websites explain the same problems . After about a month a noticed that from moving indoors to outdoors , Condensation could be seen under crystal . Not even near as water resistant as they advertise . The watch battery ran down after 2 months . No big deal , I replaced it . Then , Because the case is plastic , the wristban bar wore out the hole on the case so that the watch kept falling off . O.K. I JB welded the hole and made it smaller once again . Next the tritium gas tube fell off the second hand . and floated around inside the case . I was beginning to get annoyed . So a few days later the gas tube got stuck under the hour hand a jammed the movement . I was able to free it up but was not confident in the watch at this point . It ran for another 5 days and then stopped on it 's own . Frazzled , I placed it in my workbench vice and destroyed it . I felt so much better . After all of this I would suspect that you would ask , `` Why did n't you have it serviced under the warrenty ? '' Well , That 's because if you go to their website , there warranty and replacement policy is an absolute JOKE ! They expect you to jump through hurdles to get this watch even looked at . Ridiculous ! Do n't buy it ! Get a Citizen , They actually care about their customers !
 If you want to buy this watch because you think Navy Seals wear it -- they do n't . If you would like a watch commonly used by SEALs , then buy a Casio G-Shock DW-6600 . If you just like the watch , it 's okay , but there are better quality divers out there from Seiko and Citizen , and you should check those out . When I bought my Luminox , there were some that were already broken in the case -LRB- tritium vials had fallen off the hands -RRB- . I sold mine a few months later .
 STAY AWAY , RUN !! DO N'T WaSTE YOUR MONEY ! I purchased my Luminox Watch back in 2001 . I was excited at first as I liked the versatility and design . I needed a watch that could take some mild abuse as I am can be on them . I noticed after about a year the bezel started to wear . Then after the the third year of ownership , water started getting inside the watch itself . The watch would fog up after a shower . After four years of wearing it , the bezel wore completely smooth , showing no numbers at all . I called Luminox and inquired and they advised me to send it to their authorized repair facility . Then I get a phone call from Luminox asking where I purchased it from . I told them and they then stated that it was not covered under any warranty at all being that I bought it off of E-Bay , even though I purchased it brand brand new from a verified E-Bay power seller . They stated that I would have had to purchase it from an `` authorized '' Luminox dealer for warranty coverage . They advised me that the crown was bent , the internals were rusted and needed to be rebuilt , the crystal was scratched to the point of needing replacement , the bezel needed replacing , ect ... . I sucked it up and paid the $ 100.00 plus return S&H ; to have them rebuild my watch and send it back . Two years later the battery was toasted , the bezel started to wear again , and it was fogging up again when I took a shower . I have had it now eight years and the watch is ruined . It wo n't hold the correct time , I have a hard time setting the date , and the bezed it completely smooth again , showing no numbers at all . I called Luminox after the second time I started having problems and inquired about warranty work since their authorized repair facility rebuilt it and they said that since I did n't original purchase it from an authorized Luminox dealer ... and told me that they could n't help me.I like the versatility and design , so I just bought a watch similar in nature from a different manufacturer and it 's warrantied for three years right off the bat.Bottom line
 I have tried to contact Luminox Customer service 7 times . I received automatic responses that they received my emails and they would be geyying back to me . Well , it 's been 2 months and no response.Their customer service is Horrible . If this is indicative of their company , this was my last purchase.I am very disappointed in what could have been a nice watch . Do n't buy them , they do n't stand behind their product . You will notice , everybody has the same complaint .
 I ca n't agree more with these reviews , I 'm not on deadliest catch , or a Navy Seal , or a RANGER ... and my case is chipped , my `` indestructible '' crystal is cracked -LRB- by my 14 month old son , none the less ! -RRB- and 3 of the light tubes fell out and are now rolling around inside my watch . All within one year . FOR THIS PRICE IT SHOULD LAST 10 YEARS!I forgot to add that the case has NEVER been opened , the inside of the watch fogs due tio excessive humidity inside the case and Luminox told me I probably bought a counterfeit watch . I know the difference ...
 This is my 2nd one . The 1st one had battery problems ; it would just suddenly stop ticking once in a while for a few hours , then start again , even when the battery was replaced.This new one has a plastic back . I guess in the current economy , even Luminox has to cut costs , right ?
 Had this watch for three years . It is extremely light with a very comfortable band . I love wearing this watch everyday . However , like many of the folks here have noted ... the watch is fragile . Mine has needed the movement replaced twice . Going for a G-Shock , I ca n't see putting anymore money into this watch .
 Judging from the other reviews , people either love this watch or they hate it . I 'm in the later category . I was originally disappointed by how quickly it went through batteries . Then , the minute hand came loose and now it just dangles . I 've seen cheapo watches made better than this .
 I have owned one of these watches for the past 4 years and replaced the battery once . One day the illuminated part of the second hand fell off and moves loosely on the clock face . The piece is big enough that it was able to jam the second hand stopping the watch . I did not notice for 2 hours . Customer Service was no better , send them $ 12.00 and the watch and they well call back later and give a price to repair it , no guarantees.Another complaint is the small date , you need a magnifying glass to see the date . Do n't Navy Seals care about the date ? If you are looking for a watch that ONE Navy Seal guy wore during his daily workouts , and do n't care about the date or time , this is the watch for you .
 These watches are basically crap ! I never read the reviews because I never actually bought one . I found my first one in a river near a Marine base in the Sierras and was impressed that it was working . When it failed -LRB- water under the crystal and it stopped working -RRB- a year later I sent it in to the company and was told that the warranty could not be validated . I received the second one as a gift . I only wore these watches while camping , fishing , and backpacking . I never wore it diving , and neither one went deeper in the water than 10 feet . The second one just failed . Again , the problem was water seeped in and it stopped working . I ca n't believe that Navy Seals or even Navy cooks rely on this watch . I would not reccommend that anyone buy the watch .
 bought as a gift for $ 200 . It failed the first time after 18 months and Luminox fixed it . Now it failed again 12 months later and Luminox will not fix under warranty . I believe they damaged the internal seal when repaired last time . They offered to replace it at $ 200 - when it has a street price of $ 150 or less.My last $ 25 casio digital watch lasted 5 years with no problems . Would not buy Luminox again .
 After owning this watch for three months one of the lugs holding the strap broke off when it hit the edge of a table -LRB- this a watch supposedly made for Navy SEALS ? -RRB- . The manufacturer refused to repair/replace the case under the warranty and wanted $ 110 to do so as a watch repair . Add that to the fact that the watch is really light weight and the strap is stiff/uncomfortable to wear . Do yourself a favor and pass on this watch .
 I was incredibly excited to find this watch for this price . I had already tried one on and knew the product would be of excellent quality , if it arrived in the condition it was supposed to . I first noticed a large green tag on the product which stated that the watch could not be returned if it was removed . Obviously this raised suspicion as it implied that the company anticipated a lot of returns . Watching the action of the watch , it continuously stalled and would not keep accurate time , indicating a near-dead battery . In examining the back of the watch , there was a large dent in the carbon casing in the back of the watch body . I am immediately sending this back and buying from a better retailer .
 I bought this watch brand new from a large military/police supply site online and loved it for 10 months . Then for no apparent reason , the second hand fell off . It lodged in the minute hand and stopped it . I went on Luminox site and found that they wont even fix a watch of theirs unless you prove it came from an &#34; authorized distributor &#34; , which I found out to my dismay the site I bought it from is not -LRB- of course they dont tell you that when you buy it -RRB- . So if Luminox wont stand behind their own products bought brand new in box , they must know that they are garbage ... Who doesnt stand behind their products anymore ? Wow
 I had the same problem as the others , bought it , looked great , had to have it repaired , they charged me for the repair , came back and still did not work . Save your money buy a good watch . If the military is truely buying these watches for the seals someone needs to look into this as they are getting screwed .
 My model 3001 just broke for the 3rd time . The first two times it just quit and they fixed it under warranty . Now that I 'm out of warranty , the stem will not go back in . I was told there is NO warranty on the stem , even if it was new . They will fix it for $ 95 - it 's $ 165 new.It will still keep time , but is no longer waterproof . I do n't think I 'll throw away any more money on this watch and I wo n't buy another one .
 I have had two of these watches . I went swimming with them on but no diving . They both stopped over time presumably because the battery needed to be replaced . In both instances I was told they were corroded inside and that a repair would approach the price of a new watch . Who really wants a $ 200 disposable watch ?
 My Luminox is 18 months old . I 'm not tough on watches at all , so I 'm mystified why my Luminox is looking ratty.The crystal is cracked and I never remember any traumatic episode involving this watch . The luminous numbers on the outer dial were wearing off within 2 weeks . I 've had better luck than others with the watch band . I bought this watch as a slightly more expensive alternative to a Seiko 5 . Frankly , the Seiko 5 would be a better alternative .
 I was intrigued by Luminox watches for some time before getting one from my wife for Christmas . I excitedly strapped it on and went about my holiday , awaiting family and friends.It was n't too long before I noticed that the watch was running slow , and after a few days stopped all together . Contacting Luminox `` Support '' the first time provided no reply what-so-ever . Second attempt four days later I received a somewhat vague `` Our Service Center can help you with this at 401-946-0920 or info@saltzmans-watches.com . `` To say I 'm disappointed in Luminox , both their product and support , is an understatement .
 I bought the watch for recreational diving , and it has served that function well . I like the tritium glow for night dives . The glow does fade and fail after a handful of years , and `` Luminox Watch Repair '' charges about $ 170 to renew the tritium -LRB- glow -RRB- . Amazon sells the watch new for $ 199 . After sending my watch in for repair , it took Luminox about 2 months to get back to me with the price to replace the tritium . Luminox included a marketing ploy with their repair quote . Luminox offered an `` extended discount '' ... 25 % off of a new watch . Problem is , their `` extended discount '' is $ 263.95 , which is $ 64.95 -LRB- 33 % -RRB- higher than Amazon 's everyday price.Never again Luminox .
 *** WARNING -- DO NOT BUY YOUR LUMINOX WATCH FROM AMAZON.COM *** LUMINOX WILL SAY AMAZON.COM IS NOT AN `` AUTHORIZED '' SELLER AND WILL NOT HONOR THEIR WARRANTY.Mine broke in a year and I just had this problem .
 Would not own another one of these if you paid me . Twice the second hand has fallen off . The seller states that will easily happen if the watch is dropped . Really , a watch that is marketed as one used by and up to the rigors of the Navy Seals ? The funny part is , the watch has never been dropped and is treated like it is made out of egg shells . I have owned many watches over the years and never has a second hand fell off any of them once , let alone twice . Do not buy on of these watches , they are pieces of junk !
 I purchased this watch a little over a year ago . Mine had the tan background.The watch worked fine until the battery needed replaced about 2 months ago.I had a jewler replaced the battery , and soon after the time ran about 2 minutes slow.I replaced the battery myself , and the watch died.I took it to a Luminox dealer , and they told me the movement needed replaced , and the repair estimate was $ 97.00 . I told them to forget about repairing it.This is suppose to be a Navy Seal watch that should take some hard use?I sure hope the Seals do n't actually use this watch.I will never buy another Luminox product !!! Save your money , and buy another brand . This watch is a POS .
 For the price of this watch I thought it would be mil spec . and it is not . I believe that Luminox pays Navy Seals to use their name on the watch . First , the body is all plastic and the metal back cover is held on the plastic with 4 metal screws . Go figure , metal screws in plastic body . Obviously screws will strip the threads when you screw and unscrew the back to change the battery . After the watched leaked and was destroyed I discovered that the threads had stripped of course causing back not to seal . Plastic threads on metal screws would be ok if they put in more screws so if one is stripped you have others that will seal the watch . But this has only four , one for each corner . I was also careful of not over tightening the screws but it still got stripped . If you misalign one screw slightly the threads will strip and your watch is now not waterproof . For that price the body should be made of metal or at least have metal inserts . Other than that watch is ok as long as you do n't use in water and risk water leakage like others here complain of also .
 After about three years the watch died . Fair enough , it needed a new battery . The Luminox website states that it needs to be send back to Luminox for a new battery . So I printed off the pdf form the Luminox website , but had a simple question , so I emailed them . Nothing , no response . So I finally took it to a local jeweler who inserted a new battery and it now works just fine . I suppose that I now can not send it back to Luminox , but who cares ? In summary , a neat watch that is not backed up by its supplier .
 I 've owned two of these Luminox Original Navy Seal watches , purchased from the Army & Air Force Exchange Service -LRB- AAFES -RRB- and Amazon . My thinking was that if they were good enough for Navy Seals , they were good enough for me , a retired military man of mystery and now active civilian desk jocky . I was attracted by the Luminox Light Technology , so-called mil specs and supposed durability & ruggedness . The first watch worked great until its first ever visit to the Virginia Beach surf ! I played in the surf with my kids -LRB- never over my head -RRB- and water had gotten inside the crystal :--LRB- It was out of warranty so I continued to use it as is -LRB- out of water -RRB- . I contacted the manufacturer hoping that my defective out of warranty watch would be replaced but no dice ;--RRB- Even so , when it came time for replacement , I bought another exactly like it , this time from Amazon . I figured I probably somehow contributed to the first watch 's untimely demise and I really liked the watch otherwise ! The second watch lasted a little over a year before the same thing happened , again the first time it was exposed to the Va. . Beach surf ! Now , I 'm slow but I eventually catch on . In hindsight , I do n't believe the U.S. Navy Seals actually use these watches under operational -LRB- or even training -RRB- conditions . The water resistance -LRB- or lack thereof -RRB- issue would be a serious limiting factor . Maybe they use them when they trek to the Base movie theaters . The Luminox Light Technology works great for illuminating passageways for the pogie bait runs and emergency head calls :--RRB- If you 're looking for rugged mil-spec commercial hardware that the military actually uses , buy a Force Protection Industries CAT II Cougar MRAP vehicle or a Polaris MV7 ATV , but forget the Luminox movie theater watches : - -RRB-
 Please do yourself a favor and avoid Luminox watches at all cost.I am a firefighter and assumed that a watch good enough for Navy Seals would meet my on the job needs as well . How wrong I was.After less than a year I cracked the crystal by setting the watch on a plastic countertop . Apparently they are not made to handle impact of any kind . Navy Seals must be a fragile bunch.After considerable hassle , the Luminox service center repaired the watch , but charged me an outragous $ 120 dollars - and it took them all of 16 weeks.Several months later the glow-in-the-dark paint fell off of the second hand and now sits inside the watch housing , getting pushed around by the hands.I like the look of this watch , but the quality is terrible . Even worse , it costs more to fix the frequently broken parts than it costs to buy a better watch.Give your money to a watchmaker with a quality product who cares about its customers - Luminox is not that company .
 The tritium is nice but the case is flimsy ; leaked after battery change . Recently one of the four pins securing the band broke off . Keeps good time . Save your money ; buy a Casio G Shock!Update - After ten years the tritium vials have lost most of their brightness making it difficult to see in the dark .
 I bought this exact model in 2002 for boot camp . i thought i should get the best quality watch for something like that and since it is the navy seal watch i figured it would be pretty good . for daily use it looks cool and lights up insanely bright at night . you would have no trouble telling the time in the dark . now the bad part ... on the way to boot camp , the light strip on the second hand fell off ! it just rattled around inside . then i got to boot camp and i cracked the face without even abusing the freaking thing . it made me sick knowing how much this stupid watch cost me . i ended up having to go to the store so i could buy a -LSB- ... -RSB- timex ironman watch . i used it through boot camp and still wear it today after 7 years of abuse . i had to change the battery for the first time about a month ago . i say dont waste your money . this watch isnt all that luminox claims it to be . its absolute crap .
 Have a Luminox model 211 - water res 5 atmosphere -LRB- 165ft/50m -RRB- - When the watch was one month old , went surface swimming in the ocean and the watch leaked and quit . Sent it back for warranty and they would not repair under warranty . They said the stem must have been out even though I checked and know it was in . Still fighting with Luminox . Might make a good fishing weight . Do not buy for Armed Forces , they deserve better . Luminescence is great , but not much good if it wo n't work .
 Loved this watch when I first got it - has great styling and was a great backup to my dive computer . Used it for diving here in Alaska . Unfortunately quit working within a year . Quality for the price is pretty questionable . No response from company on fixing it ...
 I read up on this watch and decided to buy it , thinking if it 's good enough for a navyseal it 's good enough for me . 1 month later the wristband spring that connects the belt to the watch popped off during a basketball game . Ever since it keeps happening when small amount of force is applied . The luminox glow in the dark thing works great but it fell off on one of the hands inside the case . I feel bad for our military .
 I bought this watch a few years ago . I like the luminous dial , and it has proven to be an accurate and rugged watch . I am disappointed that after a few years the plastic watch band cracked and was no longer usable . Given the price of this watch , and all the military specifications Luminox claims to meet , I did not expect this to happen . I assumed this must have been a defective watch band . When I contacted Luminox to point this out , and asked if they would replace it , they sent me a very curt and direct message in which they stated : `` The warranty does not apply to the band , crystal , crown , bezel or battery . `` In looking for a replacement band , I discovered that authorized Luminox distributors sell them for $ 39.00 . I think this is bit ridiculous for a watch band that only lasted a few years . I 've bought complete Timex digital watches for less than the price of this band , and never had the watch band break . In shopping around , I found a Timex watch band made for Casio watches that looked like the original Luminox watch band . I bought it for $ 8.87 at Wal-Mart . While I still like the Luminox watch itself , I 'm very unhappy with it coming with either a defective or very cheap watch band . I 'm also very unimpressed with Luminox 's customer service . Given my experience , I 've come to the conclusion that Luminox watches are overpriced , and their service is poor . If I could do it all over , I would n't buy this watch again .
 I have two of the Luminox Ops Watches . They are good watches for general physical activity , including swimming . However , if you plan to scuba dive with these watches , please be aware that some moisture will enter within the watch . The watch and crystal will fill up with just enough moisture where one is unable to see the time . It takes about 2-4 days for the watch to dry out ... the watch continues to keep its time . Both of my Luminox Ops watches experience this problem when diving at depths even though Luminox claims this is a water resistant watch at depths of 200 meters.When I inquired about this problem with a registered Luminox service center , they knew about the problem and suggested that I purchase the more expensive model where the complete backside of the watch screws together like a bezel . They 're explanation continued to describe the Luminox Ops back side is only attached with 4 small screws and this design is prone to leak when the watch is under pressure . The service center suggested that I work directly with Luminox regarding this problem . This process of working with Luminox , returning watches directly to the company has been a long and difficult process ... they are not an easy company to work with ! Luminox knows there is a design flaw with the Ops watch . After repairs , I continued to have the very same problem . Now , I take off my Luminox watch when entering the water and use only my scuba computer .
 Like others I have read here , I found the quality to be substandard for the price . I also found the company service to be horrid and arrogant . The band broke nearly right away and the pins come out of the softer polymer lugs . I like the look but would not and have not purchased another again .
 If there was only 22 1/2 hours in the day this might be a decent watch . This is a good looking watch , but that is about all it is . I wore it mountain biking twice , did n't even fall , and now it is losing about 1 1/2 hours a day . That is very unacceptable . I also never saw anyone wearing anything but a Timex , or a Casio G-Shock in the field while I was in the army . I will see what I can do to fix this novelty item and will probably pick up a G-Shock in the meantime .
 The product was junk -LRB- possibly counterfeit -RRB- and customer service is a joke . A supposed Luminox watch lasted just over one year before catastrophic failure -LRB- crown and pin seized -RRB- . I contacted Luminox and they said Dexclusive -LRB- the company that Amazon made the product available through -RRB- is not an authorized dealer and they have no idea where they get their watches from . They said that type of failure is not characteristic of their product -LRB- supported by online reviews -RRB- . No comment from Amazon . Dexclusive has a skeleton crew of front-line customer service people with no supervisors or managers -LRB- they are always `` in meetings '' -RRB- . They would/could not tell me where their watches come from , but stated they can sell can sell their watches so cheap because they only offer a one year warranty -LRB- ??? -RRB- . Of course , they would gladly take more of my money if I wanted to send it into them and pay for any repairs . I only gave them one star because there is no zero star option . If you want a disposable Luminox look-alike , these are the guys to buy from .
 Two of my sons and I all own different models of the Luminox watch . I am now fed up and deciding between a Citizen and a Seiko to replace it . The watches look great and work fine , and are suitable for scuba diving , but when the battery dies -LRB- and it does die , generally after less than 2 years -RRB- the only way to get it replaced is by sending it to the one authorized service center in Rhode Island . By the time you 've paid shipping , insurance , and return shipping , that 's a very expensive battery , and you 've had to wait 2 weeks or more for it . One son 's watch -LRB- a model with the black composite case -RRB- developed a problem with the pins that secure the band . The holes that the pins fit in apparently got too big -LRB- with `` wear and tear ? -RRB- and the band kept falling off . The service center said it was out of warranty -LRB- it was just over 2 1/2 years old -RRB- and wanted over $ 100 to fix it . When I complained to Luminox , the Director of US Operations agreed to fix it even though it was out of warranty . But to my comment in my complaint letter that the Navy Seals branding suggests a rugged and durable watch , he replied that only the tritium luminescence technology is actually used by the -LRB- real -RRB- Navy Seals , and that any other assumption that the Navy Seals hype suggests quality or durability was the customer 's own invention !!! My sons ' watches are still running and I suppose they 'll keep them until they break . But mine is now quite dead and I 'm NOT going back to Luminox . I assume my sons will replace their watches , when the time comes , with more reliable brands as well . WHAT a disappointment !
 I bought a Luminox 3000 man 's watch from Amazon.com . Amazon.com then used JOMASHOP.com as the supplier . When I went to change the date the beginning of this month -LRB- March -RRB- I found the crown stem to me very difficult to pull out and turn . Take note that the watch was never abused or damaged in any way . I called JOMASHOP to get a return order for repairs . First off the person I got spoke such broken English I had to have him repeat everything he said . Sometimes several times . The watch is in the two year warranty time frame but JOMASHOP will not back up the warranty . Personally if I buy another watch from Amazon and learn that it is coming from JOMASHOP I wo n't place the order or return it within the 30 days of purchase . I 'm just grateful that it was n't a high end watch .
 I am extremely disappointed with my newest Luminox 300x watch . The item was purchased about 6 months ago . The watch worked and I was very pleased with it until about 4 weeks ago when it suddenly stopped working -LRB- the second arrow started going back and forth -RRB- This watch was used mainly in the office environment , away from water and magnetic materials . I am an avid Luminox user -LRB- this is my 7th model -RRB- and I was shocked and surprised to see how badly the company handled this - I 've sent this model to the L-x repair center and received an invoice for $ 64 stating `` Major Overhall '' with no explanation of what went wrong . I was very happy with this brand so I called only to argue with the servicemen about the `` warranties '' . My point was straight and clear - if they put Navy Seals logo and claim that the watch is for `` professional use '' then it should be made to meet those conditions ! I do n't want to end up with a broken leaky watch when things go wrong - I 'll be busy with more important things than thinking `` is it still under Luminox warranty ?!!! '' .
 I have two Luminox watches . The 3001 was the first and worked great for about 2 years . Then it started to `` lose time '' . I figured the battery was going bad so I replaced it . Within about 2 months it did it again . Figured I had a defective battery so I replaced it again . Lasted about 2 weeks . Now it 's dead . Additionally , the bezel paint does n't like mosquito repellant . It ate most of the paint off the bezel . I 'm very unhappy about the quality of this particular Luminox . That being said , I also have a 3204 which I love and have n't had a single problem with .
 This watch is not the best . I call the lumi-mox office phone and told them my yellow face paint is comming off . Man they said to bad and hung up . There are better watches out there !
 I 'll stay away from this watch cheaply made see my experience with luminox at -LSB- ... -RSB- Broken in so many ways not just the strap even after replacing with a new strap and even the watch itself
 I have had two other virtually identical watches -LRB- started out using them as dive watches but wound up using them as my regular watch . The latest one I ordered arrived promptly ; I started it up , set it ; it ran for five hours and stopped . I reset it ; it ran another four hours and stopped ; I sent it back , and received a refund promptly . Do ' t know if I 'll try to buy another .
 In a nutshell , if you want a government issued navy seal watch then become a seal ! Luminox was used to help the watch `` glow '' that was the invention ! When you can cough up 10K + then your in the ballpark ! Semper fi
 Nasty cheap plastic case , very average illumination . It may `` glow '' for years but it 's weak . Horrible strap and a load of very dubious nonsense about a Navy SEAL connection . Cheap watch , vastly over-priced . But SEIKO 200m diver . This thing does n't even have a screw down crown ! Casio 's have better build quality than this !

 I bought these under the assumption that the low profile , comfort and sound protection would be good.These are VERY uncomfortable , are hardly sound protection , and are just plain junk!These broke the first day at the range , trust me , these are lame!I returned them ! I will be using the foam insert style
 Well , I think after a few months of use I was at the range and found them falling appart . I tried putting them together but since it has already broken appart , its noise reduction was n't there anymore . So basically , as soon as I started shooting 9mm the noise was able to bounce back into me and my ears were ringing.So I recommend against buying these if you want them to last .

 I really liked this light for the 3 months or so that it lasted . It 's bright , uses readily-available AA batteries -LRB- I found rechargeable NiMH ones , which held a charge for a long time -RRB- . The problem is the plastic mount is well behind the center of gravity , so it bounces a lot on rough roads . That 's what killed my light
 i worked to earn the money to buy this bike only to find out it is junk . the cable fitting to the gear broke within two minutes of riding the bike for the first time , took it back got another one the same thing happened . mom called the bike store they couldnt fix it called schwinn they were gon na send a new part and never got it . took the bike back and found one that we thought after trying it in the store would be okay got home and within 30 minutes the same thing happend for the 3rd time . took back that bike and got my money back . way to go schwinn ... . dont buy this bike you will be disappointed
 This bike is not a chopper/custom . It something parents buy for there kids to show off around the block . A chopper/custom bike is cut and welded yourself . Or restore and old school krate or schwinn phatom . This so to show with some word play you too and own a `` chopper '' if you have a problem with my view feel free to emial me at -LSB- ... -RSB-
 The flag just did not hold up at all . First day on the lake and it fell apart in the wind . Very disappointing for the price . The stitching needs to be stronger and the hem needs to be larger . The pole and clips are fine , but would not buy this flag for a boat . Need to find one that is made better .
 Sorry , friends . This suit really does rip very easily . I received it maybe two weeks ago . It 's been worn while doing nothing more than sitting and standing , and only worn a few times . I 'm going to see if I can duck tape the pants together to somehow salvage the thing . It 's probably an exercise in futility since it will most likely just rip in another spot . This suit should be sold at the dollar store . Actually , it should n't be sold at all . It has absolutely no endurance . Maybe it 's one of those things where every now and then they accidentally make one that holds together a little longer , and those account for the positive reviews . This is another product AMAZON SHOULD REMOVE FROM THEIR WEBSITE -LRB- hint , hint , Amazon -RRB- . This suit was recommended for eczema patients to wear instead of wet wraps . But since it 's already ripped , it 's back to the gauze bandages !
 This is is not the one i order.You sent me a subsitute without my permissin.I wanted one like the fitst one i ordered.This suit sucks , it pinches , and sticks to your skin badly.Feels like you ripping your flesh off.The only way you can wear this suit is to put something under it.Then it double dont work.people dont buy this suit.Its not worth a penny .

 I got this to shed some of this relentless water weight . The pants were so thin that the leggings ripped on the third use . Do n't plan on doing any bending or stretching .
 Dont wash this , It makes you sweat but the material is too thin . I 'm going to replace it soon .
 Please let me know why this has not shipped yet . It was ordered on 8/26 and it is now 8/31 and your system shows the item in stock but not shipped . If it was shipped yesturday , I would receive it on Septemebr 1st . It is due to me on September 1st . Jabsco 45490-1000 Marine Waste Tank Y-Valve
 I already owned a Platypus 3L hydration bag . Bought this only to find the connector would not work with the one I had . Not to worry though you can simply take the end nozzle and switch it out which is easier anyway . In the end I paid $ 12 for a tiny bit of plastic that I may or may not use . The nozzle works well ... . But in my opinion I wasted my money . Use a washcloth and some water .
 Nice little light , lightweight , bright . The major downfall is the mount/strap system . For the life of me , it will not stay put . About every fifty feet -LRB- on the road -RRB- the light rotates 90 degrees straight down . I end up having to tighten the strap before every night ride and constantly adjust during my ride . I ride in the city so I just use it for others to see me . I could not depend on it to navigate my way through the darkness . I have consulted with the directions/diagram that were included , to no avail . There is a certain way to ` thread ' the strap through the mount and around the handlebars . It 's just a silly design . A well thought out light , but a poorly executed mount . Foolish me , I bought two . One for myself and one for my wife . Both are the same.One star b/c it 's such a mindless flaw .
 I was deeply disappointed to find that this wonderful light by Cat Eye was accompanied by such an unfortunate mount . I got this light as a present for a friend , and we spent about 30 minutes trying to figure out the plastic attachment . Then , despite our best efforts , the light barely stayed square on the handlebars.NOTICE
 I bought these to do serious cutting . Never even got the chance because the tore up before I could cut anything substantial . These shears were difficult to align and the handle broke off on something kitchen scissors could cut . An absolute peice of trash .
 Friends do n't let friends ride with this taillight -- it cuts out . it 'll come back on if you whack it , but you do n't know when a taillight goes out . changing the batteries makes it work , but the problem is not the batteries . the jostling it gets when you change batteries is what makes it work.Cat eye customer service is great -- they 'll send you a brand new one if you send it back , but do you really want another 1000 ? Well , maybe , IF they have fixed the problem , but since they have n't acknowledged the problem ... I 'm told some of the newer ones have some internal bits made a little different and may hold the batteries tighter , so maybe they 're okay ... maybe.don ' t use this light as your only taillight -- use with a back-up . the cat-eye 600 is a fine light .

I am disappointed that after a few years the plastic watch band cracked and was no longer usable .

 I will never buy another Luminox watch ! I have this watch , the black one with the rubber strap , in the women 's size with a yellow dial . I have had it for almost 3 years . I do not dive any more since we have had children , but I wear this watch to do chores , sports , quotidian -LRB- daily -RRB- boring stuff . The numbers around the dive time ring have all worn off so you can hardly read them . The watch keeps popping off the band because the hole where the pin fits in on one side has been scuffed and so now it wo n't hold . I sent it back to Luminox and they said it would cost $ 136 to repair . I said , `` Send it back and I 'll use it as a pocket watch . '' I am certainly disappointed with the brand ; I had long held Luminox in high regard because of their `` Navy SEAL '' stamp of approval , but I guess we civilians get an inferior model , or else the SEAL divers only wear them when they are actually under water , and not in combat or training or anything like that . Likely I will buy the National Geographic dive watch next , which also has a cheerful yellow dial , but I am not sure yet .
 I love Seiko watches , but I hate the kenetic feature . It only works well if you wear one watch . I have several and I like to switch off . This means that I have to reset the kenetic every time I want to wear it . I could put up with this if the watch would stay running while I 'm wearing it . Watch a long movie or take a nap and I 'm wearing a stopped watch . Bah !
 This item arrived , and it looks completely `` USED '' , it has multiple scratches , actually more than multiple , and the blue and gray paint is scratched off in several places . What a piece of junk , and a waste of time to order , pay for , and get .
 I 've been using Cateye lights for a long time and like most of their models , but definitely skip this one . The design is flawed in almost every way . First it 's hard to attach to anything other than a seatpost . The attachment is elastic bungee and as the elastic wears out , the grip on whatever you have it on will slip . If you hit a big bump while riding it may fall off altogether . Also it turns on and off by tapping the plastic fob against the red body . If you are riding and the fob accidentally bounces and taps the light , it can turn your light off . This has happened to me several times . The light only lights on one side , so if you tie it on a backpack or a bag it may flip to the non lighted side while riding or walking . There is really nothing good about this design , every part of it is wrong . It should have never made it out of the prototyping .
 I saw a lot of complaints about people receiving the wrong color light in the mail but thought I 'd take my chances . Guess what , I ordered a white light and got a red one .
 Cateye Bicycle Tail & Safety Light RED -- Supposedly -- but NOT!I ordered this RED taillight and received clear ; I went through the return & refund process to get RED instead and AGAIN received CLEAR . Correct the inventory ! The product itself may be great , but I ca n't tell , because I keep getting the wrong item , and now I 'm being told by Customer Service that reordering wo n't do any good because it will just be the wrong item again . ARRRGHGHGHGH !
 i feel cheated , picture shows a pair of light -LRB- white + red -RRB- , however , i only received 1 pc
 Bought this a year ago and stored it away . Got it out the other day to drain and recharge the battery . Cranked it a couple times and the handle broke . Still hunting for a good plastic glue to repair it . Decided to run it all the way down anyway and it was bright for a couple hours and then went extremely dim for two days . After I finally got it discharged , thought I would recharge it with the included cigarette lighter adapter -LRB- no AC adapter included -RRB- . That did n't work either - have n't yet tested the adapter , so I do n't know if it is the adapter or the lantern itself . Anyway , be careful with the crank handle .
 If you enjoy hard cranking with no return , then by all means get this product . But if you actually want to use the device , such as the lights or the radio , give up now . I figured it just needed to get going - I cranked for about 2 hours . I even tried plugging it in to my car . After a week plugged in , it started beeping , but that was it . Threw the whole thing away . It just does n't work .
 First let me say that the sellor did an excellent job of satisfying my problem with this product . They acted prompty , sent email apologizing for the problem and authorized a return with refund in a few days . The product itself did not work properly out of the box . I almost wonder if this was a refurbished item . The item was n't wrapped but the wrapping was in the box . I wound the arm for the recommended time but the charge did not last . The light was n't as bright as I would have liked and the different settings did not work properly . Perhaps other lanterns worked but and this one might have been a lemon but I would not buy any product by this manufacturor .
 The review would not allow me to give this NO stars . This is probably the biggest waste of money that I have ever spent . Wind it up and have light for maybe 2 whole minutes . DO NOT BUY !
 The on/off button for the radio works about 1 out of 10 times . The whole thing has a `` made in china '' feel to it . Do not recommend this for emergency situations . For camping on a budget , maybe .
 I purchased the Outdoor Products Firefly backpack from another website after they ran a sale that beat the Amazon price -LRB- unusual , but it happens -RRB- . I am getting into the bivouac and backpacking experience and needed a starter pack to begin doing some preliminary treks to familiar places . For a 3,500 + cubic inch pack , I expect it to carry enough supplies for a 2-4 day trip -LRB- about 50-60 lbs . at least -RRB- . I packed it with spare clothes for support and some free weights interspersed to simulate a full pack -LRB- app . 43 lbs . -RRB- and took it on a 3 mile test hike at a local greenway . A review of the features and my experience is below -LRB- YMMV -RRB- : Pack - 3.5 starsThe pack is made of fairly thick material ; more than I expected from a lower-end pack . The seams look good , but I did n't have time to thoroughly test them . It does have a sleeping bag compartment with an unremovable divider , but this seems unnecessary to me as I would just lash the bag to the frame on a hike . The overall design of the pack is adequate and typical of an external frame with the exception of two items
 I took this pack on it 's first trip last week . I packed it with just over 30 pounds of gear . 5 hours into my hike one of the shoulder straps tore off at the seam . I used another piece of strap to rig the shoulder strap back together and carried on . The next day I was tightening the top flop down by the strap and it also tore away at the seam ! I had to use a bungee cord to help keep that part of the flap down . Coming off the trail I noticed one of the internal pockets had completely ripped open , also at the seam . My hiking buddies could n't stop laughing at the ridiculous pack I was using . Obviously this pack is very poorly manufactured and will not hold up under normal hiking conditions . It comes with a replacement guarantee , but why would I want another one of their poorly manufactured products ? Fortunately Cabella 's will give me my money back . Stay away from this one .
 Let me start by saying this is a great watch but I gave it two stars because it did not hold a charge like it was supposed to . The manual said 250 swings of the arm should be enough to charge it up to last 1 day but I wore it two days in a row and the watch stopped each time over night . I bought this same watch 15 years ago and it was recently stolen from the gym . I looked around at other watches but always came back to this one . Amazon is great and the watch was delivered on time . Unfortunately Watch Grabber -LRB- the actual seller -RRB- sent me a dud .
 The mask has good color and would no doubt camo the face . The problem is -- it is too tight for comfort . Just a little more material would have made it acceptable . Do n't plan on wearing eye protection with it . That is enough to give it a thumbs down .
 I bought this watch as a gift for my wife after reading excellent reviews about it . This watch looks nice but it does n't feel like a $ 200 worth ! the stainless steel shine looks cheap and is different from the item picture provided here . the band leather is also not that good . in addition , I received mine with a visible indentation/scratch on the outter diameter of stainless case and will definitely return it .
 I bought this item for my niece that 's a Steelers fan . When I recieved it in the mail , I was so dissappointed with it , I never gave it to her . It 's so cheap looking and cheaply made . It 's maybe worth 50 cents .
 Did receive this product on second order . The band is not nearly as wide as it appears on the image . It is slightly wider than the football shown .
 I wish I read the one review available before I purchased this . Just opened the one I ordered and this picture is misleading . It looks nice and somewhat bulky but it is super cheap looking . I am throwing it out instead of giving it to the person .
 This thing `` works '' in the sense that it occasionally does what it supposed to . The buttons never work consistently and were that way straight out of the box . It has progressively gotten worse and the buttons are losing there resistance making the watch even less reliable . I would n't recommend it to ANYONE .
 Bought these figuring they would be a good value for timing our local high school swim meets . Did n't want to spend too much since the watches often `` walk '' . They are unusable . I returned all 12 of them . Buttons are too hard to click for a stopwatch . Also hard to get into the right mode and keep it there . Timers would be unable to get accurate results . Not necessarily the low price that makes them cheap -- just poorly made . I got some new ones that cost only slightly more and they work great !
 Extremely cheap ... toy . They remind me of party favors . The buttons are oblong , and rock one way or the other when pressed . Sometimes a press results in the actual button making contact , sometimes not . I bought 4 and all 4 are like this , it 's not a fluke . Pick another stopwatch .
 I have never written a review before , but the quality -LRB- or lack thereof -RRB- of this product warrents it . I purchased 6 of these stopwatches based on the reviews , the size of the display and the size of the buttons for a swim team . Most of the watches were malfunctioning from the beginning and by the second use were useless . Do not waste your money . No reliable starts , no reliable finishes . Spend your money on a better quality watch .
 Start and Stop buttons sometimes do not work properly . You have to press really hard to get them to function .
 the product arrived in a timely fashion . It looks great ! But neither I nor either of my adult sons can figure out how to work it !! You ca n't set the time and without that can not get a start on it . So , three adults can not get it to function .
 You certainly get what you pay for . This product was nothing but frustration and I have just thrown it away . The stop/lap buttons simply do not consistently work correctly , resulting in confusing lapping when you are trying to stop and reset . Hard to explain , but the bottom line is that this product wholly fails in its simple purpose .
 Item worked for less than a month . The start/stop button is so unreliable that we are unable to time anything with accuracy .
 I bought this stopwatch a while back . It has been functioning progressively worse over time with unresponsive buttons . I finally gave up on it when I used it for trying to time my wife 's contractions during labor , resulting only in a stream of curses when I could not get the thing to stop in about half my attempts . Works intermittently for unimportant things but buy something better if you need it to count .
 The basic design of this stopwatch is flawed . The buttons stick and/or do not engage . I took mine apart and it 's just how they 're made . The buttons are too big to be supported by the inadequate structure inside , so they wobble as you press them and do n't always hit the contact points they 're supposed to .
 Do NOT buy this stopwatch . I wish I had read the reviews on this ` toy ' because this is what it is . It does NOT work . The buttons do NOT work as they are supposed to , except one in a dozen or so tries and that is intermittent too . I have now given it to my six year old grand daughter . PLEASE do not waste your money on this THING !! Colin Wilson
 If you 're looking for a stopwatch that works consistently without sticking buttons , do n't buy this one . I bought four for our Regional Competition and none of them worked reliably . I wish I could get my money back , as they 're all going into the dumpster . All four judges and their assistants tried these stopwatches and they just did n't do the job .
 According to Acehardware The manufacturer has made the change in the item . The Spout ... well it is not ... it is now just a small hole for pouring . . if your the type that likes to take a swig out of your jug prepared for the dribble of liquid down your chin . The other selling feature ... drip/leak proof ... forget it !! It does leak out of the lid . The only thing nice about it is that it has a nice hand grip which would have been nice if you were able to drink out of it .
 Wish I had read the other review . It 's not the right jug . And , yes , it leaks . Why does it get 2 stars from the other reviewer ???
 I PURCHASED AS A GIFT FOR A FAMILY FRIEND . HE WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THE HANDS DID NOT ILLUMINATE ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SEE THE TIME AT NIGHT .
 I purchased this as a gift for my son , as he 's grown too tall for the little wooden sword he picked up a few years ago a RenFair . This works GREAT ! Long enough to be a long sword for now , and he 'll still be able to use it for many years to come ! And it is getting WELL used , already ! Wanted it by Christmas , and even though I ordered sort of late , it arrived in the nick-of-time ! THANKS ! ** After only 4 months of light play -LRB- it was winter ! -RRB- the handle is coming loose from the sword itself . My 11 year old son was NOT using this as a practice sword , and there are no obvious signs of misuse , like he was hitting trees or rocks or anything ! However , when I contacted the seller , they indicated that they only give refunds or exchanges within the first 30 days . I am very dissapointed ! I 'm not sure how this sword would hold up to actual daily practice by a martial artist !
 The pictures of this watched looked amazing.That 's where it ended.Supposed to be `` free-shipping '' . I ended up paying $ 27 in shipping to get it to me.Supposed to get $ 30 off when I applied for the Amazon credit card.I was n't eligible.You ca n't see the back of the watch-band , and that 's a good thing because you would never buy it if you did.The clasp is hideously cumbersome and f-ugly . The watch is HEAVY . It feel like I had a 10 lbs wrist-weight on.Of course it had to be sized , watches like this need to have `` links '' removed to fit properly.This has to be done by a jeweler -LRB- or someone with the tools -RRB- . $ 11 later.Battery was dead . You need to have special jeweler 's tools to open the back and change the battery . $ 20 later.To top it off , the `` winder '' was broken and it could n't keep time.I returned it two weeks ago.Amazon said they'ed refund me $ 4.98 for shipping it back . How 's that since you charged me $ 27 to ship it to me?It cost me $ 14 to ship it back . Half of what Amazon charged me , and almost 4x what they are going to reimburse me for a watch that did n't even work.Still have n't seen a single penny of my money back.Picture looked great , what a cluster-mess .
 Beautiful Packers bottle operner -- except it does n't open bottles . Do n't buy this or any other NFL wall mounted bottle opener !!!!
 I bought one for my team but it was slow - lost a minute or two every couple of days . I returned it and got another - same deal . Buy one if you do n't need it to be accurate and do n't mind resetting it a couple of time a week .
 This game is not a full fledged game like Virtua Tennis . It is fun to play with others , that 's about it . There is no shelf life for this game . Gets repetitive and boring very fast . They should have thought about modes , mini-games and other stuff . Rent or borrow and play it for couple of days . Buying it is not worth it .
 i was intrigued when i heard rockstar was doing a game that wasnt somewhere along the lines of gta so i picked this up ... i have to say , im pretty unimpressed with it . dont get me wrong , the graphics are really very well done . the character rendering and movement is all above the bar . but darn if there is just very little to actually play on this game . you have your exhibition mode , and an easy , normal , and hard tournament . and the only unlockables are a couple of tables and uniforms . i was hoping for at least some career mode , something that would engage me and make me work toward something a bit longer than one tournament . too bad .
 Rockstar Table Tennis is a glaring example of how industry adoration can inflate ratings of otherwise poor games . It is no secret that Rockstar is beloved by many for giving us the GTA series amongst others but it is a puzzle as to why this game had universal praise since it was released.Just to be clear , Rockstar San Diego developed this title using the RAGE engine which coincidentally powers GTA IV now . It was obviously a test for the developer and the engine . Fine . I would not rate a title poorly simply for this notion alone . It may be simple and far less value than a GTA title for instance but it still has the right to play well and offer a unique experience.This was possible with Table Tennis , but unfortunately the game suffers from impossible AI and shoddy mechanics.The single player Tournament mode is where the most obvious of these flaws presents itself . Imagine practicing the 4 various spins in the game along with the timing of shots , placements and almost uselss `` focus shots '' only to be faced with computer opponents who will volley the impossible . Whats the point you ask ? Why does your character miss the ball when you 've timed it right and the shot is not a reach ? You can time a shot perfectly but for some reason your character will straight up miss the ball . If this was some kind of realistic odds manipulator placed in the game 's code I would beleive it . Much of the games mechanics rely on your reactions but if your character 's animations fail to reflect your reactions , then you 're screwed.Another bad mark on this games charts is the fact that the computer 's AI -LRB- especially Jesper -RRB- can near impossible even on a Medium setting . This AI will decide when it wants to that it can reach any shot , score any ace and defend against the best shots you can send its way.Characters are dull and quiet and there is no motivation to unlock any sort of jersey because they all look pretty bland . Yes the characters are unbalanced -LRB- Jesper -RRB- and you will always get beat by the stronger character.Multiplayer isnt so plagued with the tyrannical AI but thats ok because the game trades that flaw in for a new one . LAG . lag is great in table tennis . Especially when you see a ball come back at you that nobody hit . nough said?Finally the AI rubberbanding in this title is unforgiving . This is painfully obvious when you trounce the computer 10-1 only to be beat 11-0 the next time . If you can beat someone 10-1 why wouldnt you be able to score at least 1 or 2 points in the following match ? Because the computer has increased it 's own abilities mid tournament.It is not that I want to rate this game as a bad game from start to finish . Its a slap in the face because it really should have been better . It was a arrogant and sloppy job on Rockstar San Diego 's behalf and I warn whoever tries to buy this title . Do n't .
 This is a great watch - until you find out ... You may `` think '' kinetic means you do n't need to replace the battery . Well , the charging device that 's internal to the watch loses its capacity to charge in about 3 years -LRB- of course , after warranty expires -RRB- . Only way to `` repair '' is to send off to Seiko repair -LRB- you just ca n't replace a battery -RRB- . This `` feature '' is not in the manual - you find out when you call Seiko repair . Otherwise a 5-star watch , this Seiko `` feature '' , requiring periodic send back at your expense , means this watch -LRB- and those like it -RRB- are a RIP OFF .
 This floor is flimsy , overpriced , and hard to use . There are no handles to pick it up once it is filled with water so it is a two-person job to empty it . You have to lift a corner and let the water drain to the other side where the hose outlet is attached . So far , so good . But then you have to LIFT the corner full of water so it is high enough to drain into a bucket ! No thanks . I 'm sending it back . Take your shower standing in a big Rubbermaid storage tub instead . The tub is good for storing camping stuff when you 're not using it for a bath . It is easy to empty -LRB- two handles and corners -RRB- and is CHEAP . If you really really REALLY need something that folds , this will work for you , but do n't think it folds up SMALL . It does not . It is 54 inches long when folded . Not real handy .
 Paint goes on very thin it is thick even after mixing but when actually painting it on its very thin and even after many coats , I gave up and went with a spray .
 I had a dark site and high hopes . I still have a dark site . I 'm no painter and not terribly steady , so application was a challenge . I had trouble getting it to flow smoothly , then it seemed to take forever to dry so the second coat was not a quick turn . After finally getting the coating like I wanted and cleaning off the spots I did n't mean to cover , I did n't get any glow . I set it in direct sunlight for 2 hours , then took it into a completely dark , interior room . Yes , there was a glow , but only a slight glow . If I had to acquire this site quickly in a dim room , I doubt I 'd have much luck . For daylight situations , I still think you 'd be better with a pearl type fingernail polish . If you need low light , get Tirgicon -LRB- SP ? -RRB- , a laser or a look-thru dot site . Yes they cost more , but they actually work .
 When I received my kit , 4 of the 6 bottles had turned to jello and were totally useless . The kit was returned . If you want real glow in the dark sights , replace your front sites with ones that glow for 12 years about $ 30 . Ameriglow is one brand that works great .
 i like the feel and design for this light but it was really leaky and smoked half pack a day i had to refill it daily before i stopped using it
 does it 's job but this is not what i remember about zippo lighters . i thought these were sturdier but mine feels way too flimsy , the little hinge that holds the cap is loose . i do n't think dealing with a return is worth my time given the price of the lighter .
 I could be a good lighter ? I never got it at all . Do n't know what it looks like . I payed $ 12.00 for nothing
 now is Dec 11 &#65281; I still do have my zippo &#65281; &#65281; it suppose be here in December 4 &#65281; that was 7 days ago &#65281; OMG &#65281; I 'm disappointed . I do n't know when I can have it &#65292; but I 'm living tomorrow &#65281; &#65281;
 This jacket was not sized as advertised . I returned this item because it was too small , even though I ordered my normal size .
 When I recived the watch in the mail the battery that was in it was drained and the extra battery they sent with it was the wrong size . Worthless
 These watches were listed when we searched for waterproof watches . Did n't expect it to last forever , but it completely died after the first 5 minutes in the ocean . Was using it on our honeymoon as an easy , low-profile waterproof watch since we were abroad and did n't have cell phones to tell the time . Did n't live up to ANY expectations .
 I 've owned three because I really like the look and feel of them , but the band on all three broke within three months . Their packaging promotes a one-year warranty , but I 've emailed Hogwild and also gone ahead and just sent the watches back to them -LRB- two months ago -RRB- and have never heard a peep . I wore them all the time , and they are waterproof , but even though I never stressed the bands by taking them off and on often , all three broke within 90 days .
 Ordered `` Assorted Colors '' thinking it was what was pictured - many bands - but no . It 's just one . A purple one . Awesome.Not to mention the watch comes activated which means my battery life is already drained .
 I ordered 2 of these 113h reels . What they do n't tell you in the description is that they are not 113h reels . They are 113hLH reels . They are LEFT HANDED Reels . Karandilla tried to deny me of returning the items because they claim that they are clearly marked -LRB- which you can see for yourself that they are not -RRB- Karandilla has since added pictures of left handed reels on the ad . but it still is n't in the descriptions . just be careful .
 Ordered to increase my wrist and forearm it was difficult to use and did not seem to concentrate on the parts of my arm I wanted to strengthen
 I ordered this item and it stated ` in stock . ' It was a christmas present and a week later I received an email telling me I was being issued a refund because the item is not available . It was too late for online ordering , so off to the mall I had to go . I am not happy .
 I thought this turtle would make a cute bicycle horn for a kid 's bike , but it did not actually fit on the handle bar of the bike we intended it for . Maybe it would fit on a different bike if we had one . Even if we could get it on the bike , it would be impossible for a young child to use it for it 's purpose - to make the honking noise . It 's so difficult to squeeze that it 's not even easy for an adult to make it honk . My 2 year old son likes to play with it , but we will never be able to use it as a bike horn .
 The snail is very like my dragon , and squeaks just the same . But , he does n't look anywhere near as cool . I think it 's something about his eyes , which do n't look nearly as beady .
 This croquet set has plastic pieces that attach the shaft to the mallet . These break very easy ! The plastic covers on each end of the mallet also break . Definitely not a quality item .
 Ordered online , no hammer in the set that arrived . My money was returned but they did n't want the set back -- good thing . First game played , 3rd strike of a ball and the mallet broke at the insertion point of the handle and the head . Second game , 1/2 way through another mallet breaks the same way.We had a Sportcraft set that lasted 4 years . Bought the Franklin set based on description and photos . This Franklin set has some exceptionally poor materials . The handles are poor quality pine and fit very loosely into the mallet head.Very , very poor quality set.For an outstanding alternative , that will save you money in the long run see : http://www.amazon.com/Scottsdale-Croquet-Set-North-Meadow/dp/B0012TN8PW/ref=cm_cr-mr-title
 Nice gimmick!A friend of mine made the mistake of buying one of these.Key flaws : - Heavy frame for the price . It weighs as much as bikes a third of the price . - Inferior components . Shimano 's Alivio components are near the bottom of the range and poorly reviewed . Poor value for money . - `` AWD '' is flat-out stupid . Unless you 're riding downhill - and therefore have gravity to help you - most of your weight is on the rear wheel anyway ! - `` AWD '' is poorly implemented . The bevel gear is a bad idea , requires precise alignment to work -LRB- not conducive to the bumping and abuse a mountain bike is meant for -RRB- , and - being exposed - tends to fill with grit . - The design of the clutch control is just horrible . Clumsy and looks prone to fouling up . - The brakes are low end but effective . Not really a flaw , because they work well ... you 're just not getting value for money.In short , it performs exactly as you 'd expect a bike made by Jeep to . Buy a bike built by a bike company , not a bike made by an automobile company that produces make-believe off-road vehicles !
 Overpriced first , and it does not really stick to shooting glasses , keeps falling off even when attached moistened to the clean surface .
 They are useless ; there is nothing anti-gravity about them . They are just big , clumsy shoes . The comment about the size being wrong is an outright lie . We bought them in two different sizes , and had many family members of varying weights try them . They simply do not work .
 These tubes are nearly impossible to accidentally puncture , but they fail in the 12-1/2 x 2-1/4 '' size because the stems are straight rubber . I tried to use them on a Trikke 12 , and all of the stems tore after multiple refillings , since they have to be bent outward to attach a pump . What good is an indestructable tube with fragile valve stem ?
 These numbers got here on time but at the finish of the race started to fall apart on some of the sweaty runners . I had the stub on a spindle as the runners came into the chute but some of the stubs fell apart at the hole.Luckily these pieces had names on them so I could place them . I will insist on pure Tyvek numbers next time .
 I had a hard time finding breaks and thought this would work because there is not much about what blade brakes go with what I had to guess and this did not work on my blades ... probably going to resale
 These used to be a good product , lasting me weeks on high hill terrain . NOT SO MUCH ANYMORE.As of Lately , these brakes wear unusually fast . A two block hill will take these brakes down to the plastic housing . Have tried from other distributors , with the same results . A 3 mile use under regular up and down streets reduced the pad 80 % . I am unable to use my last years , K2 brakes andI have been a fan of their products for many years . I have informed K2skates company directly on this issue , and they said , maybe it was a bad batch . They do n't seem to really know , and a solution was not offered . Sorry to say goodbye to K2 and hello Rollerblades to my reluctancy . K2 leaves me no choice but to seek out a competitors skate if I want to continue to skate hills with safety and confidence .
 This brake lasted through 3 20 minute blading sessions in my neighborhood before wearing down to the screw . I think they have created a product that burns quickly in hopes to sell more . Do n't waste your money !
 These brakes use to last through months of skating . My most recent brake that I bought has worn down after two skating outings . My first skates years ago were K-2s ; so after skating in Solomons for years I switched back to K-2s . This will be my last purchase of any K-2 products outside of these brakes which unfortunately I will have to buy with some frequency .
 I have been inline/street skating actively and vigorously for over 20 years . These are the worst replacement brakes that I have ever had . Typically , the K2 brand replacement black brake stoppers is what I buy . This is the first time that after only 2 street skating excursions -LRB- maybe total of 20 miles -RRB- the brakes were WORN DOWN to the end . Although I live in a relatively hilly , slightly rural community - It is not unusual for me to have a brake last nearly a month or two ... but only 2 days is RIDICULOUS . Perhaps the material that was used to make the brake has changed ? I purchased two of these , the second one is on my skate and I 'll be pretty aggravated if it does n't get me through at least a half dozen , aggressive , exhilarating street skates .
 It hurts me to say this because I love K2 , but this has to have been a conscious decision by K2 to make a cheaper break . I have been buying K2 skates for the last 10-15 years . They make the best skate hands down . The BOA system is really awesome . I keep expecting it will break , but it has not . It is well made like the rest of their products . The one thing that is really making me mad and question my love affair with K2 is their obviously cheaper and less durable breaks . I used to replace a break once a year , maybe twice ... and I skate every day ! These crumby brakes they make now will last a week . Come on K2 . You are only screwing your best customers . Beginners and people who skate a few times a year wo n't notice but your longtime fans like me are noticing . I am looking for break alternatives . If I ca n't find one , I will consider looking for a new skate . $ 10 - $ 15 for a cheap brake does not work for me at all . My route through NYC has a lot of hills and I am not going to use my expensive wheels to slow nor will I use an expensive break . Shame on K2 .
 I 'm 6 ' and 225 lbs and this thing was like a collar around my neck and did not fit like an adult PFD . It is sold `` as one size fits all '' but there is no way I could wear it with just a shirt on , let alone with jacket and / or rainsuit . I unpacked it , tried it on , and packed it back up and returned it with no hassle .
 I was not pleased at all with the flags I received . they had water damage . the flags showed the damage on the design and the package was all bint up .
 They do not work . We tried these in 2 different sizes , with children and adults of varying weights . The only thing anti-gravity about them is that they make you taller . A huge Christmas disappointment .
 The product is fine . The description is very misleading . You show a picture of 2 items and use the word `` plates '' and say the plates weigh 45 lbs each . No where in the purchase process does it indicate I am not buying 2 plates . Only after receiving the shipping notice did I discover that the shipment weighed 45 lbs , meaning I was only getting one `` plates '' . I bought the `` plates '' on sale . By the time I discovered I was getting one `` plates '' the sale had ended and I had to buy a second `` plates '' at a higher price . You owe me money .
 Poor quality , made of very soft metal . The handle nearly broke on its first use . Product should have a reinforcement on the inside of the handle .
 This is my first stage bag . I regret buying this one . I guess I got what I paid for . It is poorly built . I tried it at home and the balls did n't fit ... So I had to bring out my toolbox to fix it.Spend a little bit more in a better product .
 second time I have received this item ... . first one was had a broken part , this second one I had to tighten the handle down , it was coming off , and I had to use a pair of pliers to bend the tabs at the end of the tube so the golf balls would go into the tube . The quality control stinks !
 Was very excited to use this at the range , it collapsed on the first ball I tried to pick up .
 Nice bag , clean but the handle is very weak inside the bag . The handle bends almost every time you pick up a ball you have to stop contently and strengthen it .
 I ca n't think a worse product that I have ever purchased . The toys you can buy at Chucky Cheese with 5 tickets have infinitely more value than this complete and total piece of garbage .2 nd ball . This piece of junk fell apart while picking up the 2nd golf ball . It buckled a little on the first , and completely collapsed on the 2nd . Like many other reviewers , I could n't resist the low price . However , I ignored the warnings and now get to deal with returning the product.STAY AWAY PEOPLE ! Spend a few more $ $ and get a better shag bag .
 Seems like the quality on this product has gone down the tubes - because the balls certainly do n't ! Ball gets stuck at the bottom of the tube . After failing to get the ball in the tube on the green , I went to the sidewalk and that did n't even work . Handle also bent after a couple of smacks . Total POS . Actual bag looks like cheap nylon . Do n't waste your time and money .
 I received it today and picked up about 5 golf balls and I noticed that the bracket holding the handle to the tube was starting to bend , so I immediately boxed it up and returned it . Even for lightweight use at home I ca n't recommend this
 It is difficult for me to understand the more positive reviews for this shag bag . This is the first one I 've purchased , so perhaps the grade is based on a curve . Sure it is all metal , but the thin aluminum that connects the handle to the tube bends easily with the pressure needed to pick up balls . after 2 or 3 balls , it is quite bent . It takes quite a bit of pressure to get balls into the tube . I envision over a season , that these brackets will break off , so I returned mine .
 Do NOT waste your money on this product . It 's cheaply made and bent on its first use . You ca n't load the balls due to the super hard tube spring clips ; however , it has a super soft and pliant handle attachment to the tube as it bends off to one side or another like wire with the slightest pressure used to pick up a ball . Result
 I picked up a total of 4 golf balls and the cheap metal construction collapesd rendering the device 100 % useless . 4 golf balls ! I 'm starting to really believe in you get what you pay for . This is on it 's way back to Amazon . I would absolutely NOT PURCHASE this shag bag .
 The first time I used it the supporting structures , which connect the handle to the tube bent . I think that they may have been bent in shipping . The handle , tube and other parts look very well made , but the two supports are very light metal that do n't look like they would stand up to any amount of use . I returned the bag and received a refund promptly .
 This is the first time I have been disappointed with a product that has such positive reviews on Amazon . This bag lasted less than a month , is below average quality , and is now being thrown away.When the bag is brand new , the metal tabs over the opening -LRB- where the balls enter -RRB- are stiff . When you push down to pick up a ball , these tabs move out of place and allow the ball to enter the shaft . Once the ball is in the shaft they snap back into place . The tabs loosen up after a few dozen balls but at first you have to push quite hard to pick them up.Inside the canvas bag are two thin metal support bars . They bend from the force required to pick up the ball . Eventually , they bend enough to where you must correct it because the top of the canvas bag is blocking the opening at the top of the tube . When I noticed the weakness in the support bars I did my best to use as little force as I could . I picked the balls up very crisply . . but it just kept getting worse . I would pick up a few dozen balls , bend it back into place , and go on my way.Each time they get bent they become weaker . It quickly got to the point where after a few balls it was bent and I had to correct it . Eventually the bent support bars were so twisted and deformed that they punctured the side of the bag . I 've had the bag for less than a month and picked up about 2,000 balls . Now I have to throw it out and look for a new ball shagger.This bag is junk . If you use it to pickup a few hundreds balls and then loose interest . . it 's fine , I guess . If you want a long-term practice aid look elsewhere .
 This is a poor excuse for a shag bag . The main problem is in the three prongs , or teeth , that retain the balls in the vertical tube . They are not constructed properly , and are way too weak for the job . Once you get 3 or 4 balls in the tube , the weight of the balls overwhelms the spring teeth , and any future balls added to the tube just fall back out . The fabric is also flimsy , and the steel frame is very weak . I bent the internal frame just by pushing down hard on a ball on the green . Do yourself a favor and get the Bag Shag brand instead . It has a 10 year guarantee .
 The first one broke after picking up 3 balls . Amazon replaced it fast , free , and easy , but the it is still the same quality . The top handle is secured to a plastic disc inside . It bends if you put too much pressure on it . I would suggest using pliers to fold the prongs that pick up the balls in . It takes less pressure off the handle and you might get it to last a bit longer .
 Horrible do not buy . The ball did not fit into the tube . If you push to hard the handle bends very cheaply made dont waste your time with this .
 product came timely but . . not happy ! , went to use my intec shag bag for the 1st time and it was able to pick up only half way then I needed to walk to the pavement to pound the golf ball to actually go into the tube , then the bottom end of the bag is what seems to be just cardboard and not working properly . a total waste of my money . This product really stands up to '' you get what you pay for '' and '' if it sounds and looks to good to be true it probably is '' still not happy !!
 Very cheap construction ! Handle bent w/i minutes of using it . Not nearly as strong as the `` real '' Shag Bag .
 This bag is very cheaply made . The spring for the balls was set too tight that the handle bent when trying to pick up the balls . I had to adjust it with a pair of pliers ; do n't think it will last very long.I would not recommend this product to anyone .
 I purchased theInTech Shag Bag -LRB- Red -RRB- for what I thought was a fair price . And it probably was a fair price compared to more expensive models.However , they say you get what you pay for and that 's the case with this product . It is a bit flimsy and if you are n't careful , I could see where the handle would eventually break off due to the weakness of the metal used.So , if you 're looking for an inexpensive ball shagger that wo n't last you a lifetime , the InTech Shag Bag will probably work for you . If you plan on using your ball shagger more than once a week , I 'd recommend purchasing a more durable product .
 This watch has been around for a long time and it 's great for distance runners -LRB- big numbers , big buttons -RRB- . My first one died earlier this year and I bought another one . After one run , the face fogged up and eventually the LCD died -LRB- within one day -RRB- . I returned the watch and got another one , and first day out with it exactly the same thing happened . I think that there is a design or manufacturing problem with the current run of these watches . If they fix it , it 's a great watch ; if not , stay away .
 This heart rate monitor does not work . Out of the box it shows my heart rate at about 40 bpm too low . The chest transmitter sends to the excercise machines in the gym , but the wrist unit does not work . I would recommend you read plenty of reviews before you buy this unit . I am not pleased with it .
 It 's new , purchased 10 days ago . The watch face turns black randomly , it depends on I dont know what . Whoww ... Think twice before push enter -LRB- purchase -RRB-
 This item was represented to have data download capability to a computer . it does not . I feel cheated .
 I generally do n't write reviews about stuff but I really wish someone on this board would have written this ... so I decided to do something about it for the next potential customer . The main issue with this watch is that there is no way to change the information displayed on the main -LRB- big font -RRB- line of the display . So , if you are doing interval training or keeping track of your mile/km times in a race , you can not make these lap times large enough to comfortably see . Instead , you are stuck with the total time of the workout as it accumulates with the lap time in small , hard to read font above it . I am 26 , have great vision , and do not normally have a hard time reading fine print - but , when you 're running at 90 % max HR it 's difficult to steady and synchronize your bouncing head and swinging arm . Can you picture the fun?I owned a Nike heart rate monitor and sold it because it did n't do lap times at all . I thought with this one I had solved my problems , but the staff at Polar insist on reserving this essential feature for the 200 series and above.I will promptly be returning this for a Timex ... much more bang for the buck.Cheers and happy running !
 Read so many good reviews so I bought this watch , tried it the first week just running and it was pretty good . Then I tried it for the first time in a swim -LRB- it 's supposed to be 50m water resistant -RRB- and after the first 50m i swam in a 2m deep pool , I look at the watch to see my time and it was absolutely flooded , what a waste .
 I find it to be too complicated . I can not readily change back to time and heart rate easily , even though the instructions say you can .
 I have used Polar products for many many years but this HRM was not as described . Much too complicated to use for theaverage user .
 The latest RS100 is a huge disappointment compared to the same model from years ago .1 -RRB- The lap time display is way to small to read while running.This matters when you 're in the middle of an interval or lap and you want to look down and see your time so far for that particular lap . I do a lot of track workouts where I 'm sprinting for 200 or 300 meters , it is very helpful to be able to look down and quickly see that half way into the 200 or 300 meter lap I 'm a few seconds faster or slower than the time I 'm trying to hit . This might not sound like an issue to you right now , but considering a watch should last 5 + years , this may become applicable to you before you 're ready to spend more money on a new watch .2 -RRB- Only one workout is recorded.I did n't bother looking into this when I bought it at a Sports Authority because , again my previous Polar RS100 had the function and honestly I still ca n't believe a watch that comes with a heart rate monitor would n't . But when you can only view the lap times and heart rate data etc from the very last workout , you either do n't record your workouts and use those to plan future training or you must write down the data in a journal or excel file . If you do n't care about previous workouts , you do n't need a heart rate monitor and you can move on to a less expensive watch . If you do record times , heart rate , etc. then I hope you 're more diligent than I 'm willing to be.I will be putting my slightly used Polar RS100 on ebay soon .
 The transmitter is defective , I know because I checked with another watch I would like to send me another transmitter
 I just got the Polar RS 100 . Do Not buy the Polar RS 100 . It is the exact OPPOSITE of user-friendly in every way . Figuring out how to use the doggone thing is not at all intuitive . The manual does n't help much . The user 's manual -LRB- even the online version -RRB- is awful -- even the font on both versions is too small . Even getting the strap on one 's own wrist is a little tough . What were they thinking ? I had a Polar heart rate monitor years ago -LRB- which one , I can not recall -RRB- . I liked that one . It was easy to use , and it had a good display . But the RS 100 is JUNK ! Do n't buy it , or you 'll be sorry .
 I received my RS100 HR Monitor and the monitor do not receive the transmitter signal . I was with my local dealer and when he knows that this Monitor was bought at Amazon he says that is not possible to have the replacement by warranty . This type of products should be buy at an authorized dealer .
 This is a beginner heart rate monitor watch - designed by a beginner . Polar could learn a great deal about button layout from competitors .1 . watch seems to have completely dropped the time and date reset . Set once , that 's it ? - ca n't adjust for Daylight Savings Time , ca n't change time zones ? Pretty sad .2 . testing the functions , can not reset to zero . Would be nice to begin each run with a clean 0:00 start point.Real disappointment , simply not too functional . Recommend buying something else .
 Tried out the HRM today without actually exercising.The transmitter is quite good and the watch picks up the heart beat in a heart beat!However the reading is not steady . My resting BPM ranged from 70-96 . Within a matter of seconds it was jumping all over the place.The setup was quite straight forward and out of the box I had it all set up and ready to go within 5 minutes , without reading the manual.Will write an update once I have exercised with it .
 Bought this and tried it several times and it would give me my correct HR . It said my resting HR was 40 , actually 64 and never would register over 84 during good workout with actual HR at 120-130 .
 I have used Polar heart rate monitors for several years -LRB- since 2005 -RRB- because they are compatible with both my Precor treadmill and my Stairmaster . In my experience with the new snap-on transmitters , whenever the original battery begins to fade that 's about the time the transmitter nears the end of its useful life -LRB- about 3-4 months -RRB- . Putting in fresh batteries is hit and miss , but ultimately the transmitter becomes unreliable if not completely dead . Maybe it is the process of breaking the original seal of the battery compartment or something that causes it to fail . Regardless , I have finally come to the conclusion that these are flawed products . Replacing transmitters every 3-4 months is not acceptible in my opinion .
 This watch is absolute junk.I had one before -LRB- years ago -RRB- and it worked fine , so I bought another one.This one refuses -LRB- with 3 different polar transmitters -RRB- to read correctly.It never reads high , only very low ; which is dangerous . Now , I know that HRMs are n't medical devices -LRB- as this one proves -RRB- , but wow.I tried the included transmitter with my recumbent that also has a polar receiver and transmitter with the included cable . The bike shows correct and crap-watch is at almost half.I tried them both with the bike 's transmitter and a spare I had . Again , the bike reads correctly and the crap-watch does n't . Reading on other sites -LRB- without the shill reviews here -RRB- shows that this watch does have a problem . Maybe it 's only 1 production run or something , but something is definitely off with this watch .
 I purchased my first polar a couple of years back , after one year of very light use it broke down
 I purchased this watch since I wanted a HR monitor for running . I had to return the watch since after my second run with the monitor it stopped working . I called the company , they sent me a new strap -LRB- M-XXL -RRB- . I asked them for small since I am a petite women but they said I needed to purchase that as a separate -LRB- $ 40 -RRB- . The new strap did not make a difference . I returned the watch and tried a second Polar RS 100 . The watch within the first week failed to give accurate HR 's . It would report 80 bpm while running . Listen save yourself some time and $ do not purchase this watch . I have used both a very basic Timex and Polar HR monitor -LRB- about $ 30-40 -RRB- and the Timex has worked fine . I spoke with advocates of Polar before purchasing and found many of those who claim `` polar is the best '' only occasionally run ... . and are willing to spend big bucks on a HR monitor even if the darn thing does not work ! I have NO idea why this monitor has the ratings that it does ... it 's misleading !! I would not recommend , especially for smaller women .
 I have been using a Polar S120 for 5 years and when it finally broke I decided to go with a polar again without any research other than finding a similar model . If I am happy with a product I stick with it . I also travel extensively and Polar T31 chest straps work with 99 % of gym equipment out there unlike my Garmin 305 which works with no other equipment , this being a primary reason for investing in another Polar . After duly doing my research I decided that as I was only using this for travel training the RS100 was the way to go . The item that was delivered would n't turn on . I sent it back for a replacement . I also noticed that it was flimsy and cheap looking compared to the S120 . The replacement arrived and it activated just fine . However I realized that my due diligence was poor and this watch had only one HR zone . No worries its just for travel . This watch lasted 3 workouts before the HRM malfunctioned . I sent it back for a refund and am now looking at other brands and higher priced models .
 The set up seemed fairly simple , but the performance was not satisfactory . Sometimes it accurately displayed my heartbeat . Other times the display indicated that my heartbeat was in the mid-30 's . Not likely . Or in the high 150 's . Also unlikely . Lacking any confidence in the results I returned the product for an Amazon refund .
 I bought this heart rate monitor because it met my four requirements in a HRM
 this was new as advertised , but did not work . it appeared to need battery replacement which is a technical job that has to be done by a service center . i have sent it in & am awaiting a quote .
 This HRM is completely inaccurate . It 's not that it is not reading my heart rate , but that it says that my resting HR is 39-40 bpm , when it is actually around 60 . It did work one time but that was it . Every time I 've used it , except for one workout , it has stated that my HR is between 40-55 bpm during a heavy workout ! I 'm going to have to return it and I 'll probably get a Timex instead .
 My ancient polar S210 needed a new battery so I decided on a long overdue upgrade . Boy was I disappointed . The rs100 seemed to have all the features I was interested in , and the price was fair , but right out of the box , it never accurately recorded my heart rate , even when I used it with my old chest strap -LRB- which has always transmitted my heartrate accurately to my S210 -RRB- . The only good marks I can give this whole experience was that amazon.com has a very simple return process that made this ordeal nearly painless . I have since replaced my old S210 battery and watch band and am back in business .
 I already have this set but was just looking to maybe get another Griffey , Johnson , Biggio , or Smoltz rookie . I got a bad box though . The majority of the cards in the box I got were badly cut and had other nicks on the edges . Overall I liked the design of this set , unfortunately I got a box that Fleer should have just dumped .
 This is a great idea , and I love the collar . But for the price we paid it is not up to standard . It has already almost faded completely and we have not even had it for a month , it has faded so bad that it is even white in some places . I would not by this product from this seller again , but I am still going to try and find a nice saints collar . Like I said love the concept , but for quality it should be cheaper , or for the price the quality should be better !!
 I bought this collar for my little peekapoo puppy who is named after the old New Orleans Saints mascot . He is barely 5 pounds and was able to break the clasp with his teeth . I can understand a big dog able to do that . . but not my tiny puppy . It was cute while it last , but that was n't long at all . : -LRB-
 I did a lot of research in an attempt to buy a bike trailer under $ 250 . At first I brought home the Avenir Discovery but my wife said it needed to be convertable to a stroller ... so I returned it and ordered the InStep Rocket . For about the same price as the Avenir , the quality of the InStep 's side windows and seating were not nearly as good . The seat was terrible and small - the kids slid into one another . I do not recomend this carrier .
 I bought this item through Amazon . The product arrived and the left side of the unit had about a 3 inch horizontal tear . Not the best sign of quality control right out of the box . So I called the support line and was on hold for 9 minutes . The rep who I spoke with advised that they were short-handed this week ... ok . The csr advises that they will send me out a replacement part , without really confirming where my tear was . As it turns out , she was going to send the top canopy instead of the part I actually needed.So she evidently now is sending me the right part and begins describing the detailed -LRB- albeit not ultra complicated -RRB- process of replacing the part . I asked if the part will come with directions . She said that it would n't but that if I could n't figure it out I could call customer service back and they could walk me through it -LRB- 8:00 -5 CST , M-F -RRB- . So now I 'm retrofitted the base of this trailer that my children are supposed to ride in ... not the kind of situation I thought I 'd be inheriting.So far , very dissappointed .
 This trailer does not attach to all bikes . Upon receipt of the product , I assembled the trailer and attempted to take it for a spin . I was extremely frustrated when I found that the trailer would not attach to my GT Avalanche 3.0 . I contacted the manufacturer and they told me to return the product as there is no attachment that would fix the problem . My bike does not have an abnormal frame and I was shocked to learn that the trailer would not work . Unless you have a bike frame with a very WIDE and FLAT area where the quick release mechanism attaches to the bike , I would suggest staying away from this product . I am now looking for a trailer that will attach to the actual frame and NOT to the quick release mechanism .
 We just bought brand new Giant hybrid bikes -LRB- FCR3 -RRB- . I was REALLLLLY excited about getting this trailer , after reading all the fantastic reviews . Unfortunately , when we bought it , it was missing the very important little piece that helps it connect with the bicycle . So , I called the company and requested that they send the missing part . No problems there . They were nice , and sent the part right away . HOWEVER , I just received the part in the mail and went out to the garage to install the connector . No such luck . Although all the parts are there , the fork around my wheel will simply not allow that part to be screwed in . I 'm probably not explaining this well , but if you look at where the screw goes into the fork/wheel , that 's where the connector has to go . Part of the fork on mine sticks out , making it impossible for the connector to work.I give it 2 stars for 2 reasons
 I 've had this trailer for about a year now . I may not use it the way that everyone will - I live in a city , have no car , and so this is the primary way I get my daughter around -LRB- to daycare , the store , etc. -RRB- . For someone who uses it casually , it may be perfect - but mine has not stood up to the wear-and-tear of everyday use.The good
 Knew it was too good to be true ! Quality of the sweatshirt/t-shirt was poor . Very thin material with threads hanging off the sides . Returned it as soon as we opened it . Get what you pay for .
 I bought this for the office thinking we would be able to use as a little practice putting hole , instead it 's turned into a better frisbee . Poorly constructed and the `` wings '' break very easily .
 It 's too bad that Amazon says things are in stock when they are not . Maybe when they outsource product they should have a little bit better inventory control .
 These numbers got here on time but at the finish of the race started to fall apart on some of the sweaty runners . I had the stub on a spindle as the runners came into the chute but some of the stubs fell apart at the hole.Luckily these pieces had names on them so I could place them . I will insist on pure Tyvek numbers next time .
 Be careful ordering this item . You will end up with an auger that has no motor . Does not even come with a handle to crank the piece of crap . Power head is discontinued and yet they are still selling these units . This is nothow you keep me as a customer . Amazon-Sportsman 's Guide thanks but no thanks !!
 I got this sometime last year thinking it was decent pricing for such a solid looking gun-I was wrong ... When I got it , the canisters were very difficult to put in , and once i did screw them in finally it seemed as if it was leaking a bit . A week after I purchased it the canisters stopped screwing in all together , I took a closer look at it and realized the needle that punctures the canister was made too far away from the area you put the canister in ... After an interesting battle with customer service over getting charged multiple times , I was fed up and decided just to put it away and forget the whole mess , until amazon reminded me i still had to review this product ...
 when I first got this gun it seemed great entil i put a co2 carten in it sprayed everywhere . this is my first co2 gun and it keeps on spraying everywhere now it wont even shoot please help !
 I live on the Delmarva peninsula and this product did not touch water spots left by irrigation overspray ... I would advise looking elsewhere .
 I tried this product on my truck and it did n't really take off the hard water stains like it said it would . I would n't suggest using this product.I was very disappointed with it .
 I tried this and it did n't work at all ! I expected more from meguiars ! I bought it from them because of there reputation , however do n't waist your money .
 Worth less soap and water would do a better job . Do not buy this product . It 's waste of time and money .
 bought this cause of the name meguiars.figured it would work . didnt even touch waterspots . tried 4 other products . the only product worth buying is spot x hard water spot remover.works unbelievable.had spots baked on c6 corvette hat had spots baked on from florida sun .20 minutes window looks brand new .
 Length :
 Less than expectation as the bounce back power is weak.On the other hand , I am a non-US user that the power of this device limit to 110V that does not work in our country that needs extra coverter . And this is not mentioned in the description.Quite disappointing product .
 To the want to be better putters out there , save your money . I knew there was a reason this item was priced so cheap . Everything arrived in good shape and on time and that 's all the good I have to say . Very thin plastic and it only throws the ball back about 2-3 inches , maybe . I tried it on more than one plug in . Maybe I got a lemon , not worth my time to waste gas and spend money on the postage to return it , even if Amazon did offer to pay for it . I ca n't believe Amazon would let such a company sell this product on their web site . Surely , somebody tested it . Maybe not and maybe that 's why the price was so low . Spend a little more and actually get a return that gets the ball back out of the tray.Thanks , OpenMinded
 The thing that shoots the ball out after does n't work welll at all the ball goes maybe 2 feet ! Buy something else !
 At first they worked great very entertaing not the best for battles . In about 1 month the gold one began to fire as soon a I pulled the slide and not even touched the trigger . Dangerous ! Soon enought the black ones slide snapped off as i pulled it back then it snapped in half . Good for starters not built to last more then a month .
 I did n't realize i was ordering a book ! Tought it was a dvd so I sent it back ! Thats all !
 I was so disappointed when I finally got this product and the DVD was missing , but Amazon took care of me right away . Not sure how a book is going to help , hard to dance looking at pictures and reading a description . After reading the other reviews , which I should have before purchasing , I will purchase another ZUMBA DVD instead .
 THE ITEM THAT I RECEIVED WAS JUST A DEMO . NOTHING STATED THAT IT WAS A DEMO . I FEEL LIKE I WASTED MY MONEY AND THIS WAS FAULSELY ADVERTISED .
 I thought I was buying a book with a significant exercise dvd . Not so . Misleading description and packaging of this item . This is more of a book with a nutritional focus than even an exercise focus . I do n't know why this was shown as a result of a search for zumba exercise dvds .
 Elproducto es bueno lamentablemente s&oacute;lo es el libro no contiene el DVD de ejercicios que seg&uacute;n yo contenia &iacute;nicamente es un demo del lo que yo necesitaba , ahora tengo un libro ...
 When I found this , I was so excited I could n't wait to get it home and start doing my Zumba.To my surprise the DVD only showed 4 diffferent dance MOVES.There was NO WORKOUT at all !!!! I 'm very DISAPPOINTED in it.I liked the book just for reading & recipes & menues , I wished I could have said something good about the DVD.Do NOT buy if your looking for a workout . : -LRB-
 If I had wanted a book-it would have been fine-but I wanted a CD ... I mistakenly ordered this item instead of a CD.It cost too much to return it , so it is sitting on my shelf . Thanks , Barbara
 I bought it by mistake , thought it was on dvd and found out it 's a hard cover about how Zumba was discovered and invented by Beto Perez .
 I was so happy when I received what I thought was a book with the cd / dvd and i only recived the book . After reading all the other reviews I should have picked something different .
 Okay I am an idiot too . I totally was not expecting a book only . I punched in Zumba video got this . I need to read better . It does say on the book though that a video comes with it . You could put somewhere that the DVD is not included . I will read it though .
 I was disappointed was hoping this was a full vidio plus book vidio just a small demo i dont wont to read how to zumba workout i wantede mostly watch n learn
 I agree with the other one-star ratings above . One of my coworkers and I each purchased the book and were disappointed in the instructional DVD . We both expected to see `` sixty minutes ' worth of music to help you dance your way to the perfect body , '' like was mentioned on the inside cover . What we received was a DVD with a few instructional moves and then some music without the moves or instructions , just music . On Page 132 states , `` In this chapter and on the DVD , you will find three twenty-minute Zumba workouts . You can perform them consecutively to create an hour-long workout . Or if you are tight on time , or new to Zumba and want to pick up the basics , you can do one of the two-minute workouts by itself . '' The DVD did not include three twenty-minute Zumba workouts , only short instructional moves , without any instructions on how to put the few moves together into a complete workout . We both felt that we had been `` ripped off '' in purchasing the book and DVD , since the DVD did not include what the book jacket and book contents promised . I contacted the author and publishing company and received the immediate reply they would be back in touch with me . That was a month ago ; I have heard nothing further .
 I wanted the DVD and instead got a worthless book . When I contacted the seller , she said to bad read the fine print . It also came in an envelope barely held together by a couple of stickers . I am highly disappointed with this purchase . I will never buy from this seller again and would not recommend them to another buyer .
 I thought the book and dvd was a cool plan to read to understand and dvd to watch & learn . Wrong -- what a major disappointment . I understood the dvd was a learning workout but it only shows steps but no actual workout . Major waste of money .
 If you 're buying this for the book , great . If you 're more interested in the DVD , as I was , you 'd better try some other product . What the description fails to mention is that the DVD only offers a very brief tease or preview of what a full Zumba workout would be .
 I was hoping the DVD would teach me some greatZumba moves ... it has about 4-5 simple , simplemoves ... waste of time , so glad I did n't purchaseit .
 Wow , the DVD is about 3 minutes long and teaches you a few extremely basic steps . This is not a workout DVD at all and you ca n't learn Zumba with a book . Who published this thing ? I ca n't believe someone actually got this book published !!! It has convinced me to become an author and the first publishing house I will go to is the one that fell for this .
 I placed the order on January 25th today is valentines day February 14th 2011 I yet have to receive my Zumba workout tape . !!! This is not my first time ordering from Amazon . I ordered a Transcription book for school and it got here in 4 days . I would not recommend greatbookdeals to anyone !
 I should have read the description better . This is a book not an instructional video on a zumba class . It does come with a video but it is mostly music to use to teach a class . The book has good heath and eating tips but this is not what I was looking for .
 The DVD did not work . I 'm still waiting for a refund of my money .
 This dvd set one dvd does not work at all and the others keep stalling .
 I just bought this DVD and i was surprise i expected people dancing the whole hour with me , i hate to work out alone , i enrolled the gym and they have Zumba in their schedule but only 1 intructor is good and she only does zumba once a week , which is not enough for me , other instructors dont make me sweat at all , and i get so bored , i expected that this DVD will help me on my routines but definately i get even more bored exercising watching a video with just music on it , i have a lot of song by myself i just needed to play mi cd and dance but that 's exactly i didnt want to do , again i 'm so dissapointed
 I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS CD.I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY MONEY BACK . NOT WHAT I WANTED . NOT ENOUGH EXERCISE MOVES
 I was very disappointed in this product . The DVD was just a short demo of a few basic Zumba steps . The routines must be learned from the book . There is just a `` sample '' of Zumba music on the DVD . I 'm returning this item for a Zumba DVD I can do at home with routines that are visualized on the DVD . I would definitely have not purchased this item if I had known it was a book and a very limited DVD .
 The book may be a good read but it does nothing for working out . The disk has only a few moves do n't really get you motivated . Now you have to buy the disk to start the program . not
 Did n't read ad closely enough and did n't realize that it was a book with a demo dvd . Wanted a DVD set
 I wad disappointed first that it took almost a month to get the book . I have ordred many booksAnd this was by far the slowest shipping . The book was n't what I thought your descriptioWas vague . The `` DVD '' that came with the book was nothing but a demo so nowIf I want to do zumba I have to either join a class or put out Morris money forZumba music not a happy camper
 This is not a balanced review because I 'm too upset . My daughters wanted a Zumba workout DVD for Christmas . I thought I was buying a basic Zumba workout DVD . I was totally surprised to find a book was delivered to my door . Even more surprised when my daughters said the DVD is nothing close to a workout video . We are all disappointed . Beto Inc. have certainly learned the techniques of crass and deceptive commercialism .
 This book is very informative but unfortunately the DVD is not very helpful at all . Definitively get this if you are interested in signing up for a class but do not expect the DVD to be used in place of a class .
 From the description , I 'd expect to receive a Zumba DVD , so that I can work out at my own schedule at home.How disappointed I was to find out it was a book with DVD sample of Zumba - that 's all !! The description should mention that is a book.I 'm not interested in reading Zumba at length , just want to do it .
 Very upset , I was excited about my order and only received a book even though my order says that it includes DVD . This books seems to be stolen from Conneticut Library with a slot for the DVD but as I mentioned no dvd was included .
 This product came with a dvd and a book , however the dvd was only a few minutes long and was only a demo . I had expected to begin doing the Zumba workout at home with the DVD I thought I had purchased , but was dissapointed when I was unable to do so . The book has diet ideas in it but I have a hard time getting motivated from reading . I was not satisfied with this purchase .
 The DVD in this set is not a `` fitness DVD '' . It is simply a presentation of the very basic steps without any type of workout or routine presented . There is also a lot of peppy music , but no workout at all.All the workouts are in the book , but I found it impossible to visualize the movements from the photos provided . Really , can a person be expected to learn to dance from a book?If you want a visual introduction to Zumba , you will have to buy one of the videos in the series . This wo n't do it for you .
 The product description of this item claims it 's `` an exclusive instructional DVD with 60 minutes worth of music to help you Zumba your way to the perfect body . '' It claims to provide `` Hot moves that make you feel like you 're on the dance floor-not on the elliptical machine ! '' This leads the buyer to believe that there will be a work-out provided on the DVD . There is n't . The DVD consists of a few minutes of basic Zumba moves and the rest is music -- just music , no moves . The buyer is expected to create his/her own workout from reading the book . The book 's title is
 I confess , I bought this book . To be fair , I only bought it in a last ditch effort to save my order . I had cancelled one book from my order and had to find something else to replace it immediately or else lose entire order , per Amazon customer service . So here I am.This book opens with a chapter about how zumba came about , then follows with an explanation / history of merengue , salsa , cumbia , etc. . Next comes a how-to section on doing the moves and lists of music and steps that correspond to do with time markers . Finally , a chapter about fat fighting foods and recipes.In an orange envelope at the back of the book is a DVD . Is it a DVD that will open you up to the mysteries of Zumba footwork ? Well , no . It will barely scratch the surface . It will only teach you a few steps . Then the screen goes gray , with a big timer in the corner . You , my dear reader , open your book to the section with the song list and steps corresponding to time markers . Then you match up the song and the steps to the timer of the particular song you have chosen . Too bad there is n't an instructional sheet that tells you a -RRB- how to carry said book and read it , while b -RRB- glancing at TV screen to make sure you are doing the steps at the right time as the timer on the screen and c -RRB- how to do salsa/merengue/cumbia / whathave you while holding book and reading.If you , as I do , go to Zumba class already , then the above reading/dancing/timing thing is n't so impossible but have an answer prepared for the inevitable question from your significant other , `` what the hell are you doing ? `` If you , my dear Zumba-deprived friend , do not already take a Zumba class and think you can learn to dance by reading , I say to you , `` Really ? '' and then I 'm going to encourage you to leave your home and take a Zumba class . Or buy the videos . Or the Zumba for Nintendo Wii . All of which are better than this book .
 I am a big fan of Zumba but expected a follow along video of the 60 minutes music . The music is a gray screen with music and timer . Hard to follow and boring . If I knew this before , as the description was vague , I would not have purchased it .
 this product is not what i expected , not helpful at all , a waste of money , i would defenetly not recomend it to anyone .
 Was not satisfied with this . It was not a workout video . It was instructions for Zumba and a book , so I refused it when it arrived . That was one of the options Amazon gave , but I still have n't had my account credited with the cost of the Zumba package that i returned , without opening.Too bad .
 I typed in the search bar `` workout dvd '' , this came up as a dvd and looked fun . I ordered it and received a hardcover book with NO dvd . Wow , what am I supposed to do with this ! I wanted to get started the day it came in the mail , when I opened the package and see a book ! Are you kidding me !! Feel very taken .
 It has been 1 month and I still do n't have the book , so I can not give a review . I live at an fpo ap address so I 'm not sure if that 's the reason why .
 I am so glad there are reviews to read about products before you buy them ! I was seriously about to buy this when I read in the reviews that this is a BOOK that ` show ' you dance moves ! I mean come on ! you ca n't do fitness from a book !!!
 Very disappointed . DVD - 60 minutes ... HARDLY It only shows a few demos of the moves that one can watch on youtube for free . 10 minutes max . The rest of the DVD is music with a timer that appears on the screen for the routines . You have to look up the routines in the book ! The moves in the routine are on separate pages so you are flipping back and forth through the book to figure out the routine . Most moves are not as demos on the DVD . Book had illustrated moves . That 's fine if you want to read and figure things out . WOULD NOT RECOMMEND if you are experienced in aerobics or dancing . I am going to see if I can get my money back on this one .
 I bought Zumba on line , though the book was informative I was disappointed with the CD , no where in the description did it say the CD was a short demo , this disappointed me , so I returned it .
 I thought I was buying a DVD not a book . You need to make it known better when it is a book and not a DVD .
 When I ordered the book with an DVD I was so happy because I will be able to read also to watch the video , because when I read the product features said : Now the DVD and classes that have hooked millions are available in book format , with a complete workout program , fat-burning diet , and an exclusive instructional DVD with 60 minutes worth of music to help you Zumba your way to the perfect body.When my order arrived without of DVD also the cover is not the same &#62; Immediate I contact amazon to return the item .
 this was a great product if you were looking for a book . However even though the product read `` dvd '' i already had this dvd in my zumba package that i bought a year earlier . I was looking for different levels to challenge my students on rainy days and get them interested in zumba . this might be a great buy for someone who is looking to read a bit more on the nutrition , zumba info . thank you again for allowing me to return this item !
 I was so disappointed to receive a book and not a DVD . I browsed through the book hoping that it might still be savaged , but to no avail . It is better used as a textbook about Zumba than to actually do the workout . Very frustrating . It was terribly misrepresented .
 This book cover shows what looks like a couple in the middle of zumba . States that it includes a DVD . DVD is definitely not zumba at all . The dance moves are in the book , and I do n't know about you but I need visuals . It 's difficult to learn steps from a book . If I had bought this I would have returned immediately . I checked it from the library and ironically enough , it is catalogued as a DVD , not as a book . I returned to the library the next day !
 Zumba
 I was under the impression that this was a workout dvd . It is not . Sorry I wasted my money . It was n't worth to return it for the amount I paid for the book . The description on the listed item should read that the video is not a workout video . I was under the impression that it was an instructional introduction to Zumba with the workout .
 Simply disappointing . Most of the book was his autobiography and that would have been o.k. if the DVD would have been an actual exercise DVD rather than just showing the basic dance steps . The nutrition portion of the book is good .
 Be sure to READ what you are ordering ! I ordered this thinking it was an acutal work-out DVD , but it is a book and a DVD of music ... no routine . After receiving it , I went back and THEN read the reviews-which I should have done first . Since I wanted a routine , I then went back and ordered the DVD `` Total Body Transformation System '' which I love .
 thought i was getting a music cd . wad really fooled . to much trouble to return the book . book not but help without the cd
 The wife hates this one she thought it was a DVD and its a book , what read ten pages and then work out , thats some crap . O ya you people ca n't count the works very good &#60; &#62; because from the arrows -LRB- is -RRB- 14 words . It should be good enough if someone says Crap or Sweet . The 14 word rule should be gone .
 Like many others who wrote here , I too , thought this was a DVD workout video . I understood that it was a book but I thought the accompanying DVD was an actual workout video and not music so that after I read the book I can make up my own routine ! Who wants to do that !!!! Really mad I bought this and I want to return it !!!!!!!
 this is a terrible product . Yes there is a book and yes there is a disk , but the disk only has few minute segments of zumba , not nearly enough to make the purchase worth it . There is more content about zumba on youtube.com .
 I purchased this thinking the CD would come with it . I was dissapointed . I will be returning the book shortly .
 Wheb I searched out Zumba , this was listed . Since then better options are listed . I assumed it contained a DVD to learn Zumba , well it does n't ! I did n't find this product very helpful for what I was looking for .
 This dvd was so poor ! It was advertised as 60 minutes of music . It was so broken up that you only got about 3 min . at a time and no practice time as advertised . Wish I did n't buy it !
 This book has some decent recipes but the video leaves a lot to be desired . I would not purchase this item again .
 This product is misleading . Who would buy a book to learn Zumba?This is a book with a CD of Zumba music . Not helpful at all . Just a way to sell something nobody needs.First time I ever got burned on an Amazon product . Read carefully
 Not at all what I expected . Just a book with a short video . Not at all what I wanted .
 My fault I did n't realize it was a book , since I entered Zumba dvd 's and this came up . The dvd included was clearly misrepresented on the cover of the book . This only show a few basic moves and IS NOT a workout dvd .
 I was disappointed since the DVD was more instructional . I know all the basic zumba moves and I only wanted the DVD to do routines during the cold and rainy days in my city . This DVD is more for new folks to the art of zumba . I will probably give this to someone else who is not familiar with Zumba for I felt it was wasted purchase . I wanted some lovely routines that would work up a sweat . Not so in this DVD .
 Sorry to say , that I was very dissapointed with this sale . You can read in my order that says `` With DVD . '' The DVD was not included and I was not interested in the book at all . So I had to return the book.Thank you anyhow , as I am always pleased with Amazon , especially with the service - Whispernet - you provide to my Kindle .
 I used this locking carabiner for two trips on my motorcycle . It did n't survive a third trip , you get what you pay for.The tumblers inside gave up the ghost , they are made out of plastic and the vibration from a single cylinder engine was too much for it .
 It took a few squirts of WD-40 just to make the -LRB- disengagement -RRB- button ` move ' . Then , as I had an instinct that this unit was junk , I tested the opening/closing mechanism WITHOUT attaching it to the item I needed to ` lock ' . On about the 10th lock/open cycle , the lock ` froze ' in the locked position . Nothing I could do would make it open . Fortunately I trusted my instincts to test it a few times BEFORE locking-up the item I needed to secure . That saved me a lot of grief , and all I had to do , then , was toss this unit into the trash .
 Ok , it was < $ 15 but come on . It 's basically a flat tarp with magnets on the corner . Magnets ??? How about a taper for the pool table corners ? Maybe buy it for as a liner for your cat box but this thing makes no sense to me as a pool table cover . Not worth my time to return -- garbage can liner .
 I purchased one of these as part of a Groupon Goods deal shortly before the Super Bowl . Though it appears to serve its purpose well , the colors of the mat themselves look very dull and the trademark gold of the Saints helmet looks more gray than anything . This is in complete contrast to the sample images I 've seen strewn across the net which feature comparatively bright colors -- and it makes the mat look very cheap indeed.Would not purchase again , and certainly would n't recommend this product to anyone .
 Well all I can say is you really get what you paid for on this item . Thing broke a week after I got it though I managed to fix it and rig it , to bad it only shoots full auto and that 's it now . Got ta love Chinese crap . When it worked though I functioned great though what can you expect from a gun that has a metal gear on the motor , then the rest of the gears are nylon or plastic . It was inevitable that the metal gear was going to eat up the plastic one sooner or later .
 it want that great of a gun . i didnt like it . i am saving up for a more powerful gun
 Watever you do do not get this gun if you are gon na do some backyard airsoft war . It is not recommended for outdoor . the BB curves up as soon as it hits the outside , i do n't know why i got it i guess i was young , but avoid this gun . The sight 's crosshair is way off , the mock scilencer is loose , the stock is about to break . The high cap . is actually pretty good . I 've had this gun for about a year now , it jammed once . I would suggest going to hitguns.com , or speedytoys.com , hobbytron.com , airsplat.com . they have good guns there , but i found this gun in those sites too .
 I bought this for my son 's birthday . He has wanted one for some time and he finally convinced his mother to let him get one . Basically , it looks cool however , in operation it was a great let-down . The fact that the scope is useless does n't bother me , or that the silencer that is supposed to be in the package was n't there , those would be just for looks with a product like this . The disappointment was how short the battery life is , how slow the repeat in automatic is , and how weak the output is.I understand that in this type of product where a really good one can cost many times what this one cost , that there should be some expectation that it will not be `` All That '' . However , the telling tail is n't that I 'm unimpressed but that my son played with it for about 4-days -LRB- of course he only got a few minutes of battery life in each day -RRB- but he has n't touched it or done anything with it for about a month now . In other words , a 12-year-old who is really excited for this , who wants more than anything for this to be fun , and worked really hard for several days to find the fun in it , is unimpressed!While there is nothing in this products description that is truely misleading , I can not recommend this product due to it 's lack of performance .
 Ignore my previous review , this gun was purchased for my younger brother and he had not had a chance to try it out yet.The high capacity magazine does not fit or click into the gun all the way . The only way to fire it is by holding it in upside down . The normal clip will run out in 10 seconds with conservative fire . Sometimes it does n't fire at all . Sometimes is fires continuously on semi-auto . Sometimes the range drops to under 10 feet . The clips are faulty and the gun is cheaply made . This gun is a worthless waste of money that broke the first time it was used . A spring gun is always a safer investment . Besides , anything this cheap is bound to suck !
 This gun is a piece of $ # ! & My bro got it some time ago . He was so excited . It made me glad to see that he was so gung ho about his new airsoft.He loaded it , aimed at a 1-foot target not more than 20 feet away , sprayed as accurately as possible , and guess what happened ... ? Yup , out of the 20 in the clip , about 5 or 6 hit . Not on the bull 's eye , I can tell you that . The 20 shots went wayyyyyyy too fast for comfort , and the accuracy sucked like mad , but my brother 's hopes were not dashed yet . -LRB--_--RRB- He filled up the 110-shot mag , winded it up , aimed , and the same thing resulted , only this time , the spray lasted longer than 3.5 seconds.OUT OF MAYBE 50 SHOTS FIRED , ABOUT 12 HIT . I checked the gun all around , but it was not defective at all , except for the part that this gun was made very cheaply.My brother tried it on semi-auto , which is usually more accurate . Not for this gun , though . In fact , the semi-auto was even less accurate than the automatic feature !!! OUT OF 10 SHOTS , ONE OR TWO HIT ! i COULD N'T TELL BECAUSE THIS GUN 'S 140 FPS MADE BARELY A SOUND WHEN IT HIT THE TARGET ! -LRB- We were shooting in the dark . -RRB- Let 's not even talk about the `` red dot scope , '' or the `` silencer . `` I only gave it a two because -LRB- 1 -RRB- That is the next lowest you can give , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- This gun 's looks is okay . Please buy a different gun off ebay or something !!! You can get an m16 with a grenade launcher with 300 fps and 300 mag cap for less than 20 bucks -LRB- if you bid correctly -RRB- ! By the time my brother had finished playing , his dopamine levels were probably under normal . In simple terms , he was disappointed .
 I bought this gun and i was dissipounted in it it sucked i wish i would have spent mu money on a real gun so i could kill myself insted of buying this piece of crap.It broke instantlly out of the box and its fps is like 150 not 200 and the low cap magizene runs out in secongs and the 110 round clip also blows so terrible gun over all DONT BUY PLEASE ITS IS HORRIBLE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 This gun fired one clip of 20 rounds and did not fire another shot . This gun is not worth the money , spend a little more and go to a store or buy from a good site .
 The quality of this gun is low . The plastic feels cheap . The construction is not solid ; it feels like the gun will come apart . The BBs get jammed all the time . I think I spend more time clearing jams than shooting . I would n't even say `` you get what you pay for '' because I 've bought airsoft guns for this price , which have a far superior quality than this one . The only reason I did not return it was because of the possible cost of shipping this overseas . However , now I 'm thinking about it again . I would recommend fellow shoppers NOT to buy this gun .
 This gun is bad quality it broke the second day I had and not in one place in more then one place if I were you I would n't get it just dont its a big east of money not a gun to recommend to people
 I have been in airsoft for about 3 years now . I used to have a Classic Army M4 full metal electric rifle and I wanted a gun that I gun play with my friends that have cheaper guns . I decided to buy this gun because its by Cyma and they are a pretty good airsoft company , but this gun is one of the worst . It jams up a lot , it is terrible quality , and the clips suck . Do not waste your money on this gun , but spend it on the Double Eagle M82 electric airsoft rifle . My friend has that gun and it is great . Please , Please , Please do not waste your money on this gun , it is terrible .
 I recieved this gun about a week ago and could n't wait for it to arrive . It managed to arrive one day early because I live close to it 's store in California . When I recieved it I could n't figure out why I could not mount the scope . It was broken . Next I tried to read the instructions which are total crap because they are awfully written . I started to shoot it and every time I wanted to use the larger clip I had to jam it into the socket every time it stopped shooting , which was quite often.Next I had my sister shoot me with it from about 10 feet away and did n't even feel it when the BB 's hit in a T-shirt . Plus , aftera while of shooting the semi-automatic started to fail and it would only shoot automatic . Lastly , in it 's first CQB the strap fell completely off.Here are the main good 's and bad 's of this gun.Good : - relatively cheap-lays down a lot of BB 's in a short amount of time.-collapsable stock is nice.-relativly accuracte at close rangeBad : - Clips either tiny or worthless because it wo n't stay in the gun.-extremely weak-accesories may come broken.-insructions awful.-low battery life.-fire settings jam/don ' t workP.S I 'm not really Jacqueline K. Schmidt .
 if you actually play airsoft dont buy this gun . the one i got in the mail might shoot 100 fps . i charged the battery , shot my friend , then he laughed and shot me whith his 320 fps M4 A4 . not good . i then shot myself in the hand point blank and it did nothing . its a good gun for a 5 year old . thats the gun i got . i would not tell anyone to get this gun if your serious about airsoft . you got ta spend $ 100 + to get a good MP5 , there is no way around it . dont waste the money .
 it is weak , and too short of the clip . the boxy mag doesnt work . it takes forever to turn .
 well ok i got this gun with kida low hopes but still i wanted it to be cool and of course i take it out and it looks great and i kind of put it together and am messing around and the battery takes that first 12 hours . so the next day im all excided and i bring it out side and it shoots THREE times and stops and it dosent shoot anymore , if anyone mabe knows why ... or if theres something that will make it shoot i would be extreamly thankfull
 when i first got this gun , i thoght it was great , but then i actualy looked at it and the truth is it sucks . It constantly jams on semi auto , its not accurate on auto unless u use the silencer , and its cheap . if u load it with 25 or more rounds and u put it in , the clip lets all the bbs out . the semi auto clip wont shoot half of the bbs u put in there , and all the accesories suck .
 Ok , this is gon na be short.But this is a decent SMG , well , it 's slightly underpowered , not a great idea if you 're playing with serious airsofters with AEGs.Construction wise it 's durable . except the selector switch does n't seem to like going full-auto anymore.Ammunition wise it sometimes can jam.That 's all
 after i shot this gun once today the mag release broke off and now i cant take the mag out of my gun and the scope wore out super fast so now no light goes out of it it was a fun gun but needs better parts
 The gun did n't even come with all the parts.This gun is ok and is cheap and it jams were you put the clip in and its impossible to get the fricken clip in . Its not powerful at all it does n't even go through cardboard . It hurts my brother but he 's a big fat wimp . Other than him it does n't hurt anyone . its ok for starters but you start to want more power . Hope this was helpful .
 The reason I rated these product that way was because at first , when I bought it , it was seemed to be a googd gun that has a rapid fire in the Automatic mode , had a good range , and it had a strong damage for it to be a cheap gun . Once , I was shooting in automatic normally -LRB- this happened 3 weeks after I bought the gun -RRB- . Later , when I was running out of ammo , I do n't know how , the trigger of the gun went out flying but that was n't the problem because if it would , I would just need to open the gun and put the trigger in it 's place . THE REAL PROBLEM WAS THAT ONE STRANGE PIECE OF THE GUN GOT DAMAGED AND I COUL N'T FIND THE PIECE ANYWHERE IN THE INTERNET SO , AT LAST , I SOLD THE GUN IN EBAY .
 I got this gun sometime ago , and sadly I never realised how bad this is until it started breaking , and when I got a MUCH higher quality airsoft gun . This gun is 100 % plastic , and a very cheap plastic for that matter . The red dot sight that comes with it is also garbage , and also 100 % cheap plasic . The rail on it broke off , the magazine release broke completly off and now i have to use a small flat head screw driver to take out the mag . The tip broke off when I had the silencer on it . It has maybe a range of 50 feet before it flies of in some crazy direction . It says it has a FPS of 250 + ... not even close . More like 100 + ... this thing cant even punch through paper . The sling attachments snapped . Everything is loose on it . Small battery that you can drain in an hour and it takes like 8 to fully charge . When i tried to clear a jam in my new gun , I realised that it was a very tight bore barrel , and that equals distance , power , and accuracy . This gun , you can take the unjamming rod and move it freely in the barrel and that means
 I bought 2 of these for my boys . The first one fired about 3 shots and then the trigger went limp - not like a jam , but a broken trigger . Checked for jams and there are none . Then the second gun fired about 100 times and it jammed . Cleaned the bb 's but the trigger feels bad or broken and it still wo n't fire . The gun looks cool , but the laser scope is not very functional and more of a gimmick . Seems like the battery compartment was an afterthough because when removing the hand guard to get to the battery the battery or battey cord easily gets caught and you need to mess with it . Overall the gun stinks because of cheap internals and accessories ! Peace ...
 This gun has a defective magazine and Sellers can not find you a magazine that works when you notify them of your issue . I actually had a Seller who offered to try out magazines so that they could ship me one that works and they could n't find one that was n't defective . Without the magazine , the gun ca n't be used . Do n't purchase this product .
 Okay . . First off , this gun shoots about 150 . It says it shoots 250 which is a lie . I have a pistol that shoots 200 and its far more powerful . . I have had a lot of airsoft guns . I have had quite a few spring pistols , a pump and a spring shotgun , and three electric automatics . I would prefer all of those guns but one over this one . . The Wells M4/M16 was the worst . . I have had both guns -LRB- this and the wells -RRB- and they both broke in two days . . Its not like I threw them on the ground or put broken bb 's in them . . They just broke . . They got jammed super easily and they eventually did not shoot . . I would not recommend this gun to anyone . I sent is back over two weeks ago and still have not received my refund . . I 'm not saying that other electric guns under 50 $ will be better . . Im saying that if your not willing to spend 90-120 $ on an electric gun that your gun will suck , but you can get a descent spring gun for about 40 $ . . I have had all my spring and pump guns for maybe about 4 years and not a single one has broke . . I have a Remington Tac 1 that you might still be able to buy at Walmart for about 40 $ !!!! and it shoots 350 fps -LRB- honestly -RRB- . . It is a great gun . . Now if you are willing to spend about 100 $ I currently have a Wellfire G3A3 and it is great ! I have had it for about a week and a half and not a single issue so far . Thanks for listening ...

 Gun jams too easily , can not fix it . The sight is a 1/2 '' off and you can not adjust it . Silencer does not silence . Liked the size of the double mag , and the weight and design of the gun .
 First off I like the looks but the inside guts suck ! the shipping was realy fast but the first time I used it it worked for about 15 muinites than some thing went weird I was shooting it in semi-auto and it suddenly went into full-auto and didnt fire anything . basicly if you want a sturdy gun DONT BUY THIS GUN !!
 I FIND THIS FAIRLY WORTHLESS . THE MANUAL IS WRITTEN IN CHINA BY ENGLISH CHALLENGED PERSONS . THEY HAD TO ADD SOME CHINESE WRITTEN WARNINGS ON THE TOP OF THE BOX IT CAME IN . THE SCOPE IS DESIGNED TO FALL OFF , WHICH IS OKAY , SINCE IT HAS NO FUNCTION . JAMS OR MALFUNCTIONS CONSTANTLY . THE SPEEDLOADER -LRB- COMPLETELY INCORRECTLY DEPICTED IN THE `` MANUAL '' -RRB- , DOES NOT WORK WORTH A DARN . UNRELIABLE .
 if this is the accushot or utg mp5 which the summary seems to describe . SAVE YOUR MONEY . bought two couple months ago . both broke . the internals arent that great and the wiring needs to be replaced . you wont save yourself any money cause the gun needs to be upgraded to work efficiently . Save whatever and get TM or ICS MP5 . you have been warned .
 This airsoft gun is what is known as an LPEG , or Low Powered Electric Gun . Let me tell you , they were not kidding when they named it that . I actually used a chronograph to rate this gun at 60 feet per second . It is hard to feel shots from this gun at a distance of 10 feet.It was fun to mess around with , but I would recommend saving your money . A UTG Multishot Shotgun can be had for around 60 dollars , and it fires 3 rounds per pump at over 300 feet per second . Also try to get your hands on the Cyma Glock 18c AEP -LRB- Automatic Electric Pistol . -RRB- I have seen those for 50 dollars .
 I may have just gotten a defective product but it was supposed to be brand new from amazon . I like the product and the resistance was good at first . The second set of overhead tricep ext. with one band attached and it snapped right at the base of the handle . Im going to send it back .
 This is probably common to all bands , but I had n't thought of it before I bought this . The hard plastic handle pushes into your arm quite a bit for a number of the exercises . This resulted in noticeable bruises on my forearm after using this.The other problem is that this band is a little short for me . You 're not supposed to stretch it beyond 3x its unstretched length . I 'm 6 ' tall and to do several of the exercises in the pamphlet , I would need to stretch it 4x or longer . This is probably a better length for someone that 's around 5 ' 7 '' .
 Looking through previous customer reviews , I realised that most of them faced the same problem I did , that is , the TNT Cables that were advertised on Amazon were for 3 x R4 -LRB- 40 pound -RRB- cables , but the set that is sold by Amazon contains 3 x R3 cables -LRB- 30pound -RRB- , 2 x handles , 1 x door attachment , 1 x poster -LRB- of exercises -RRB- and no instructional DVD.I returned the item , and Amazon customer service was top notch -LRB- as usual -RRB- . Someone should really :1 . review the advertising on the page for the TNT cables , or2 . make sure that the products that they send out match the descriptions on the website .
 I am very dissapointed . I live in Brazil and I travelled to Orlando , Florida and made some orders with amazon.com . I bought the TNT cables RED !!! And I receive the pink ????? I return to Brazil with the wrong item !!!!
 These have to be the worst bands I 've ever owned . I thought I would try these out for extra resistance for my p90x workout and boy do these things hurt when you use them . They do have pretty good resistance but they hurt my hands so bad because they rub hard against your hands to the point it left rub marks and the cheap plastic handles are so uncomfortable . I immediately boxed them up and shipped them back after using them 1 time . I have been using the GoFit bands for the last 6 months and they have been great but they only go up to 30lbs resistance and that 's why I was shopping around for more resistance . I guess I will keep looking .
 The product was good while it lasted . Unfortunately the plastic handles are not built to last . My 5 yr old daughter was playing with the bands and ended up breaking one of the handles . I would not recommend this product .
 The TNT Bands are no good . The bands will snap because of the plastic thing in the tube , it puts a strain on the tube causing it to pop . Just buy the bands from bodylastics . Much better product . The TNT bands are trash `` DONT GET THEM ''
 After reading all the positive reviews , I purchased these for the P90X program while I 'm on the road and away form my free weights . They certainly provide a good amount of resistance and seemed to be a good choice . Unfortunately , during the `` lawnmower '' exercise , one of the bands broke . I used the remaining two for the remainder of the workout without issue . Two days later , I was doing seated flies and SNAP ! I would really like these to work , and perhaps I received a bad batch , but I 'm thinking it 's a design flaw.The bands are connected to the handles by inserting them into one of the three slots on the handles . In order to keep the bands from sliding out , the manufacturers have inserted a round object into the band , which are actually hollow tubes , causing them to bulge at either end . In both instances , my bands broke very close to the bulges . I believe the stretched plastic causes additional stress to the band , and while the rest of the band can certainly handle the advertised resistance , that bulge introduces a week spot that cannot.Update : I wanted to circle back with what worked . I did end up returning these and buying a different set , albeit more expensive.http : / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026JOS4W/ref=wms_ohs_product_These works great . I have abused these to death and they just keep on doing what they do best -- resisting me.Bodylastics Resistance Bands 134 lbs . of resistance-Max Tension Edition with User Book
 These paddles are called `` heavy duty '' but they 're the lightest weight paddles I 've ever bought . I bought them for the boys dorm that I manage , and the boys have gone through them like disposable paddles . I would recommend not using the words `` heavy duty '' on the description .
 These dumbbells arrived quickly but when I opened the package I saw two poorly molded hex dumbbells . The grips were ergonomic and comfortable but had burrs and chips near where they attach to the weight . Both of those downfalls are okay though because dumbbells do n't have to be pretty , they only have to be heavy and weigh a certain amount . Well , that 's why I am rating these dumbbells only 1 star . I ordered two 55 pound dumbbells . One of them weighs 50 pounds and the other weighs 52 pounds . I already have 50 pound dumbbells , I do n't need another set of 50 pound dumbbells . Therefore , these were an absolute waste of money for me . Thank you China .
 It was a very horrible buy . Within a month the stepper went out . I had to throw it away . Trying to fix it would have cost me more than to buy a new one . Do n't buy .
 When i bought this product it came missing a screw , I bought one of the same size to replace it from the hardware store . The screw was part of the holder for the weights on the side -LRB- which is still in tact -RRB- . The pole wobbles as you step , no matter how tight the screws are -LRB- there are 8 total , 4 at each direction on the base and 4 at each direction in the middle holding the poles together -RRB- . The pulley system under the steps , slips regularly if you do n't have a consistent stepping motion . And last but not least the wire for the step counter was exposed because there was no way to hide it with the way the designed it , so it was easily pulled out of the back by a child . I 'm disappointed in this product it really looked like it might actually be worth it .
 The twister was fine , except that many screws were missing needed to put it together . So , its just sitting . Can you send me the additional screws for the 2 steppers I 've ordered ??? Please .
 I just bought this product and it is sturdy and cheap . But there is not instruction manual on how to use the buttons or explain that stupid twist plate . What is it for , I can twist without it . Anyway , 10 mins after using the machine I got a severe knee injury . I didnt have an injury before using it but I got one now . I am going to have to get rid of it .
 `` We have been involved with this product and the manufacturer , Southwest Windpower , from the mid 90 's . Initially the manufacturer -LRB- Southwest Windpower -RRB- had pottedregulators inside the nifty cast aluminum housing on their 303 wind-machines . After installation the machine ran great -LRB- except for the unbelievable noisefrom the blades -RRB- for about 2 weeks until the uncooled regulator overheated andself destructed . We were living off the grid in a very remote part of Samoa at the time and literally depended on the output from our wind turbines and solarpanels . We had a lot of experience with older types of permanent magnet windgenerators and spruce -LRB- wood -RRB- blades . Our older Redwing generators never gave usany trouble except for the necessity to periodically replace the brushes . Southwest Windpower was contacted after our early debacle and this was the beginning of many overseas phone calls and 99 email correspondence over 4 years , fightingwith them to stand behind their product and do some actual real world testingof their product . These people had a great idea but the bugs were not workedout and we were their unwitting test subjects . Jay Yaeger , Dave Snowberg , SeanHickey , Andy Cruz
 the item which I received looks nothing like the picture . The branch which I got instead looks exactly like the 18in branch which is also sold by this company although the branch which I received is 12in as advertised . Unfortunately because the branch is so wide around and smooth my parakeet will not even set foot on it which makes it a big waste of money .
 The photo shows two dumbbells but they only send one . Pretty stupid . Also the order was EXTREMELY slow in arriving .
 I 'm getting older and fatter and was trying to lighten my ride a bit when I got this seat . Two or three hour rides are fine . Multi-day , five hour rides with younger , faster and stronger riders ? Not so good . Not only will you get dropped , your but your ass will hurt as well .
 Uubearably boring . Screeching voice . Nothing here you ca n't find in other Pilates guides . Do n't waste your money .
 As a first time customer to Amazon , I was disappointed to order the item , need to return it , yet again received an item where the team name appeared streaked .
 this is the worst airsoft gun ever . it stoped working after firing one clip . however , when i fired this one clip , it shot really far and hard . id say around 190 fps . but after that , it stopped working .
 The material and texture of the real thing looks very different from the posted image .
 Pros : - Looks nice -LRB- I receive a lot of compliments -RRB- - Heart rate monitor is comfortable , unobtrusive , and very accurate-Lots of heart rate training modesCons : - Cheap plastic face that scratches very easily-The clasp on the band constantly pops open-The buttons stick out so far that every time you bend your wrist back or bump your arm the watch changes to a different mode . This happens CONSTANTLY and is extremely irritating.-It is very complicated to try to figure out all the different training modes-No compass or altimeter settings that are common on most other Suunto watchesBottom line : Suunto has been making great watches for long enough that they should have been able to avoid the mistakes they made when designing this watch . This watch is definitely overpriced for the product that you get . If your looking for a good heart rate monitor you can find models by Polar with all the same features of the T3 for about half the price .
 Hi Everyone , Dont go with the appearance of this watch . This watch appear attractive in picture but in reality its cheap plastic . the black clasp is plastic and the most dissapointing thing is you couldnt see the time or any data in the watch because its so dark . also light dose not illuminate the watch more than 3 sec . what good is the watch if you can not see clearly the details . Please make a decision wisely and I would recommend not to go by the loook .
 Batteries would die in about a month.Not intuitive button patterns to operate ... as in starting , setting , clearing workouts ... never got to the point I could do it without thinking.Replaced this with a Timex HRM ; much happier .
 had to switch bands , standard band had patent leather look to it . scratched from day one . i ca n't understand why a $ 150 sport watch would not come with a mineral crystal face . i 've had $ 50 nike watches that were scratch proof . after changing the band the watch is pretty functional and cool looking , but still can not replace the convenience or functionality of a mounted computer for biking .
 Face is made of cheap plastic - it scratched within an hour of putting it on . Watch had about 20 scratches and dimples after 2 weeks . I 've been wearing a cheap Casio for the last two years that hardly has a scratch on it . Other problems include - the buttons press very easily making the watch change functions constantly , for example when I put my hand in my pocket or put on a coat ; also , the functionality of the watch is not very intuitive , with five buttons it should be much easier to move through the different functions of the watch . Finally , the watch is very well photographed in the ad , and does n't look any nicer than my cheap casio in reality .
 Cool knife design but the blade metal is too fragile . Tip broke easily . Do n't pry -LRB- at all -RRB- with this knife .
 The item had two slices in the left front pocket.We returned it to Fogdog and requested a replacement be shipped and that we did not want a credit.when I next heard from them they said they were issuing a Credit . We sent a e-mail and again said we did not want a credit . The next thing we knew we received a e-mail saying that a credit had been issued . We are NOT HAPPY!Mary Maskill
 The Plastic release button broke off . I think people are too quick to leave a review , yes it did work but this item should be banned . Very Cheap and NOT safe !!
 I think the idea would be great , but I 'll never know . They will not go on my helmet unless I cut the strap , which I do not want to do . Sure wish it had mentioned this in the info about the product !
 The clip fit well and worked as advertised.I was happy with this product for about four weeks . Then it started hanging up a little bit . Had to wiggle it to release . Then one of the locking prongs broke off .
 This clip works great . . for awhile . . then as all things cheap plastic do . . it breaks ... and I am talking about the button part that holds it together . . as soon as it break your chin strap is dangling ... so seriously ... do you really want your motorcycle helmet thats protecting your head , held on by a cheap piece of plastic that has a clip prone to break off on its own after less than a year of using it regularly . I dont and will never buy this clip again .
 I have an EXO1000 that has a snap on the male end of the straps . The snap does not fit through this product 's fittings . I do not want to cut off the snap end to install this . This item is cheap and I question the quality or comfort if installed , or even whether it is safe if involved in a crash .
 Not very pliable . Twists & tangles easily . Would never use heavy monofilament again . A better option is braided line for 30 # weight or higher .
 We ordered a Philadelphia Eagles welcome mat to be given as a gift , but received car mats instead . The car mats said Eagles , but were not the team colors , so we returned the purchase and had to buy something else from somewhere else . To return , we had to purchase a box , so the wrong item cost us money . We 've been contacted by Amazon that the credit has been processed , but at the time we 're writing this we still have not been credited , so we 'll have to contact customer service again . Never again will we order from Starter Mats , and neither should you .
 I think this product is too weak . The picture gives a wrong impression about the product . The pump handle is also very small . This is delicate pump . I would not recommend this product .
 The product is very good . But , cover is too bad . so , contents leaked out.The product is very good . But , cover is too bad . so , contents leaked out .
 I bought this based on reviews . I am disappointed after having used it for nearly two weeks.Two reasons can be given . -LSB- 1 -RSB- The liquid soap is not thick -LRB- like most hand wash soaps are -RRB- and therefore it is difficult to apply to the bath sponge/brush . You use more than you might need . -LSB- 2 -RSB- The perfume is not as pleasant . I expected more . We have used Zest aqua marina and it ranks much better.I will not buy it again and if I could return , will do so .
 Note to tube manufacturers
 The tubes are amazing , very thick and strong . The dimensions fit my bike perfectly.But the stems are super THIN . As I pumped up the tire , the stems started shifting from the hole . I kept trying to straighten out . It was off just a little , pointing in at an slight angle.Then I went for a ride , came back and PFFFFFFF , the stem ripped and out came the air.It seems like a dumb thing to skimp on the stems when the tire is so durable .
 I have purchased three of these in the last two months . I only get a few rides out of them before I get a leak right at the valve stem . My local bikeshop installed the first time and after the first leak I went back to purchase another tube and showed them the problem . They said that I must not have had the correct tire pressure in them while I was riding . Everytime since then I have confirmed the tire pressure before the ride . These tires clearly have a design problem at the valve stem . They are n't worth the money .
 My tube lasted less than 3 months on my bike , not because of the tube itself but because after about 3 months , the valve , for no reason , simply started leaking air . Ridiculous .
 Item arrived on time . Pumped up a tube to 30 psi ; I noticed it did n't inflate evenly , so the tire blew within 15 seconds at the weak spot . I cut the tube open to look at the uniformity . Just a thin spot in the rubber about 3 inches long . Wish I 'd had some ear plugs in.Fortunately , I bought 3 . If the other tubes do well ; I 'll write another review , but for now these tubes were manufactured poorly . I would n't think it would be difficult to get rubber to a uniform thickness with heat.Jokes on me ... they got paid anyway .
 In all the tubes I 've bought and repaired while cycling through Utah , Idaho , Washington , Oregon , California , and Nevada I 've never had one that did what this tube did . I installed it and not a day later my tire was flat . Upon close inspection , the valve stem had busted open and was leaking air like a sieve . I attempted to patch it , but patching a rubber valve stem is trickier than I thought , so the tube remains useless . In summary , DO NOT BUY THIS TUBE IT HAS A CHEAP VALVE STEM ! Unless you are good at patching valve stems , which never having had the necessity to do so , I was not .
 I am sure I do n't know as much about bike things as a lot of the other folks who have posted here . All I know is that I paid a bit extra for a `` thorn resistant tube '' and it did n't last as long before my next flat as my other `` normal '' tubes . Do n't think I 'll purchase again . Does n't seem worth it . Statistically N = 1 , but I do n't have the money or patience to do any more sampling .
 I bought four of these ... two for each bicycle . Well , two of them went flat within days . One split on a seam -LRB- no corresponding hole in tire -RRB- , and the other split at the stem -LRB- same as above -RRB- . My tire sidewalls specify 50 - 75 psi , and we regularly run at 70 psi . We ride mainly on streets , sidewalks , and paved bike trails.They are awkward to change out , as they are so stiff . It would be well worth it , if they were n't falling apart .
 tldr
 Not very pliable . Twists & tangles easily . Would never use heavy monofilament again . A better option is braided line for 30 # weight or higher .
 it was really nice at first but if ur an ameture skater , then dont even bother buying this board . I snaped both of my decks within 2 weeks . the first deck i did a nose slide at a skatepark , and it snapped . the second board i snapped today doing a regular kickflip . Although it is good for beginning skateboarders , i was really shocked in the poor quality mongoose put in its skateboards if i could rate any lower , it would be in the negative stars .
 This is a really good beginners skateboard ! I learned how to ollie on it and i also learned a kickflip on this board . But after a while i realized that the board wears down quickly , especialy the bushings . the deck snaps when you try more advanced tricks and i suggest getting nicer bearings if you plan to keep this board for a whilePros
 Wheels do n't lie flush with the ground due to warp . bearings popped their protective shield within an hour . Looked like it had been returned once as well.STAY AWAY !!
 Balls lost their stiffness after 2 weeks of use with a ball machine . The other brand of balls purchased are still somewhat stiff and have a much better and even bounce .
 Maybe I got a bad batch , but these were nearly flat right out of the bucket . After a few uses they became heavy and limp . They might give you the best bang for the buck , but you get what you pay for.spend a little more and buy Wilson US Open balls or Dunlop Grand Prix balls . These are premium match balls , but they stand up well to time and torture.My roommate has been playing for over 20 years , myself only about two years and we 've gone through virtually every brand of balls . Avoid Gamma balls.Buy Gamma overgrip though !
 I bought these balls a few weeks ago and the bounce is low and noticeable compared to regular tennis balls or other pressureless balls . I am thinking about returning these or just discarding them from my regular set of tennis balls.I have 120 gamma pressureless balls from 2008 -LRB- dual color yellow/blue -RRB- and they are work fine . The current set does not say pressureless on them . Perhaps these are meant for pets!Avoid these , if you need the balls for tennis machine try something else.Shame on you Gamma for such a poor product . I bought these because I liked the quality of my old Gamma balls .
 These balls are horrible , they do n't bounce like regular balls , worse yet once they come up from the ground it does not come up straight , it goes to the sides most of the time .
 I purchased 2 buckets for my tennis ball machine . They are no longer firm after 2 hours of use . Other brands used in the same machine are still firm . Price differential does not support better return for the cost of these balls .
 I see this as a Cyber Monday deal and is show 's the original price was $ 19.99 and Cyber Monday price is $ 29.99 ? What 's up with that ? From the looks of the other reviews , looks like its not even worth $ 19.99 !
 i was trying to save and that 's what i got cheap made balls !! i have never seen anything like it before ! even the cheap ones at walmart survives longer than these balls.bottom line if you wan na use it for your dog then go ahead if not they are not for tennis !!!!
 The bracelet shows as white , but came in yellow . One of the charms is different too . It 's a cute bracelet , but the description should advise the difference .
 just so you know , it 's impossible to click on `` p.m. callanetics '' without fast-forwarding through the a.m.i know , it sounds impossible . how could they do such a thing ? but it 's true . and i tried . and it gets REALLY frustrating.thanks to previous commenters , i expected that would happen . i would highly discourage purchasing this item UNLESS a new version is released with a better-formatted DVD .
 Very boring . Misleading video . Everyone is using a barre , not a chair like she claims you can use . Boring voice put me to sleep .
 The image of this item depicts a Tiger leaping through the D ; however the item I received contained no tiger , just the D . It was a gift , so the recipient does n't know that it should have looked different , however I do and I 'm not pleased with the bait and switch used by the seller . I wo n't do business with &#34; The Memory Company &#34; again .
 The product is way to big for the average adult head . I have a 7 1/4 - 7 1/2 size head . The Knit cap was way too big . It really looks funny . I never wear it because it looks silly . This is for the adult size . It seems others are happy with the youth . Unless you have a HUGE Mellon I would not suggest this purchase
 The machine worked great for the money -LRB- we 'll see how the durability of the wheel and machine holds up -RRB- . However , I was very dissatisfied w / the tech support . I wanted to run it on DC power w / a generator or inverter . When I went the inverter route I went up to inverters w / surge up to 2400W . It blew the inverter . Then I tried a neighbors 600CW generator w / 3000 surge . It blew that as well . Their support offered no help other than it should n't have done that . They quote no surge or return phone calls . I would move on past ATEC for all athletic training needs .
 The sweatshirt is nice & thick but it has a very small opening for the head so it ends up feeling very tight around the neck . The t-shirt is very thin and has an uncomfortable seam on the right side .
 I can not recommend this item as the top is pretty much poorly designed fancy garbage . It is not at all suitable for this type of bottle , but would work fine on a squeezable bottle . It takes a significant amount of pressure to hold the dispenser in the open position . Once in the open position , the water trickles out at VERY slow rate . To get the water faster you would need to suck on the bottle which looks quite foolish , but is also ineffiecient as there 's no vent to release the vacuum you create . I just remove the entire top to drink . No issues with the bottle itself but I should have gotten the loop top .
 I was very excited about my Sigg bottle . However , though it looks really good , I 'm unhappy because one can not fit in ice cubes , it has terrible insulation if they fit anyways , and the sports top that I purchased releases barely any water . I also have a Thermos brand stainless steel bottle which , though plain and not nearly as trendly as the Sigg , works much much better .
 My daughter had her heart set on this water bottle ... we purchased it with a gift certificate , and were anticipating the order to arrive in the next few days . We just received an email stating that our order has been canceled for no given reason . this company ONLINE FITNESS should be banned from Amazon . They lie about the products they have . I would like to find out how I can put in a FORMAL COMPLAINT about this particular vendor ... breaking their promise and breaking my daughter 's heart . They should be ashamed of themselves .
 I was disappointed to have purchased this water bottle with the understanding that it was BPA-free but recently SIGG has come out with a statement saying it is not . You havee to look at the color of the lining to determine if it is the old or new lining . This one has the old lining .
 i received this bag about six week ago . I washed the bag and it fell apart . The bag is not well made it just fell apart even though i washed it on the gentle cycle . I sent an email explaining my problem and asking how i can get a refund for and i never got a response . When the bag first arrived i love it . It looked great and i thought it was just the thing for me I even showed it to a couple of friends who expressed their desire to purchase one but i had to tell them it is a waste of money as it can not be washed .

 Beware this table is highly unstable ! After spending hours of diligent attention to every detail of the assembly instructions , we witnessed the table support literally fall out from under the table . The thin metal-like hinges that form the foundation for the thin legs are much too fragile and appear to be made of tin . If you can believe it , the instructions provided with the table expect you to assemble the table upside down and then lift and flip the entire assembled table onto its legs without bending the table halves themselves or any of the flimsy legs/struts ! We ended up salvaging the table tops and purchasing 4 very stable saw-horses that when placed strategically , provide an excellent support for the table -LRB- I spent $ 160 extra for the saw-horses -RRB- .

 I bought this for my 14 year old son , but after seeing it in action , got rid of it . You 're asking for broken bones by using this , it is not safe , just think about the physics of it ... all your weight dropping on one small point that can be thrown off by any pebble or slick spot . You 're gonig to get a broken jaw or worse . Cheap thrills ? Not worth it .
 I won the Flybar in a radio station drawing back in July 2004 ... Being a 40 + year old fatman I gave the pogo stick to my 12 and 14 year old sons who are a couple of skateboard Gods . I supervised them at all times they were on it and only let them jump with the minimal settings for their weight while they learned to control it . They both became very good at riding it within a couple weeks and loved jumping on it , they used it so much that the tip began to split from all the impacts it had with the concrete and asphalt where they jumped . After contacting the company about the tips , the owner himself sent me some new ones , along with some other Flybar flash.About two weeks later I got to spend MANY hours in the Emergency room at the Trauma Center here in Seattle while I listened to my 14 year old son scream in pain as 4 doctors pulled on his leg to try and set the massive Open Fracture -LRB- Bones Protruding From The Skin -RRB- of his left Tibia and Fibula -LRB- Lower Leg -RRB- that he received when the Flybar slipped out from under him as he landed on it.It is now 2005 ... My son is off his crutches now but still walks with a cane for support and is always in pain by the end of the day . The $ 3500 worth of Titanium implants will come out soon then he can continue his quest back to becoming a normal boy again . The hardest part for him is being 15 now and 6 ' 3 and 220 pounds , very athletic ... . He knows he will probably never play the sports he loves so much again due to the severity of his catastrophic injury.Hindsight being 20/20 ... . I should have sold the Flybar at auction as soon as I won it .03 / 14/2005Two weeks ago there were 28 reviews of the flybar , now there are only 22 . Is n't it amazing the ONLY reviews that got deleted were from people who have maimed themselves on the Flybar?Perplexing is n't it ...
 DO not reccommend unless you plan to wear a t shirt or some kind of undershirt with this polo . : - -LRB-

 This item is not as advertised . Amazon is supposed to be known for its customer service but this is the worst customer service I have ever experienced . I was sent one club -LRB- seven iron -RRB- when I ordered this the first time . I called and emailed Amazon customer service to explain the problem and they admitted that it should have been full set . They assured me that the second one would be a complete set and offered to overnight it because of the problem with the first order . The second package was once again one club -LRB- five iron -RRB- . When I called again they told me the item was listed incorrectly on the website and it was going to be removed immediately . When I emailed them back to point out that the listing was still on their website they told me there was nothing else they could do and referred me to their legal department . Amazon had no intention of filling my order with a complete set of clubs . I have never been treated with such a combination of dishonestly and incompetence .
 Do n't believe the title of 3-PW . This is not a set ! I have ordered this item twice and each time I only got 1 club . The first time I got a 7-iron and the second time I got a 5-iron . The listing is very misleading .
 I have a friend with whom I have been riding who has the Dura-Ace 10-sp chain . He has broken his chain THREE times with me -LRB- 3 different NEW chains -RRB- . Each time I had to bail him out with my chain breaker by taking out the failed link -LRB- never the connector link -RRB- . This guy is not big -LRB- 5 ' 8 '' , 155lbs and is by no means an `` animal '' for strength -RRB- . These 10-speed chains are super-weak . I have never had a Dura-Ace 9-speed break -LRB- nor have I ever ridden with anyone who has ever had a 9-speed chain break -RRB- . Stay away from the 10-speed chains . My `` new '' bike has a KMC SL 10-sp on it and it is working well . The manufacturers are in such a race to be the lightest that they will sacrifice everything to suck you in .
 This pedal works ok for practicing . If you have an amp with no distortion whats so ever , I guess this will get the job done . But I STRONGLY advise against recording using this pedal . Have tried to run it to an amp and mic it . Have also tried running it straight in to a recording device , and the result is always the same
 This product was a complete waste of money . If you have a spare bag/backpack at home , use the money you would spend on this product at target instead . There is nothing in here that you ca n't easily acquire yourself and additionally ... acquire things of higher quality . Most of the items look like they were purchased at a dollar store and then tossed together as a ` kit ' . Example - the poncho that is provided in the kit is not even as durable as a garbage bag . It certainly would n't hold up in any kind of disaster situation.There are 3 packs of tissues ... I assume this is for all the crying you will be doing in an emergency or the crying you will do once you open up the package to see how much money you have wasted.So do yourself a favor and DO N'T purchase any of these kits . Take the time to go to Target or Walmart and buy things that may actually be useful in an emergency .
 First off I 'll say it was my fault for not reading the details carefully enough . I had just ordered a Premier style jersey with the stitched letters and numbers and loved it . This Hines Ward replica jersey was the screen printed version with the mesh type fabric to let in air . Not a ` bad ' jersey but not at all what I was looking for . I had no issues returning the item and getting a refund .
 Received jersey with wrong name and number . Hines Ward jersey with the wrong number . Customer service representative was rude on the phone disputing the fact that the jersey was wrong . Never sent postage to be able to return ... still have the jersey sitting in the closet .
 I am very unhappy . I wanted to give this jersey to my wife for Christmas . He 's her favorite player . I ordered it in plenty of time . I think it was the 10th of December . The shipping was outrageous but I needed it in time . Well , they e-mail me to tell me they ran in to a bump in the road . Can you believe that . Offered me other Jerseys but not the one she would want . Today is the 21st of December and still NO jersey . I 'm sure once I do get it she 'll love it but in the mean time , I 'm pissed cause I ca n't give it to her on Christmas .
 The item shown is a baitcasting rod , the one that was sent to me was a spincasting rod . I have been trying to contact the seller to have my order corrected and have received very limited replies . I suggest that until the seller corrects their inventory and/or listing that you avoid buying this fishing rod and dealing with this seller . The seller also needs to work on customer problem resolution!The Shakespeare Catfish casting rod , both the baitcasting and spincasting rods , are heavy duty , and able to handle catfish over 40 pounds . I have about 10 of these rods in my collection and I use them all the time . I wanted to buy a couple of new ones to give as gifts to my twin daughters for Christmas , paired with Ambassadeur 6500 reels .
 Inferior product and not true to size . XL more like a Medium . Got my money back .
 After only 45 days , one of the mugs was cracked top to bottom when I removed it from my freezer . Disappointing and not worth the hassle to return . Tom Nelson
 This is just terrible . It is not in the least bit the rod in the picture . I recieved a red gold and black one . The `` quality fuji '' reel seat is CRAP . It is so loose it could even fit a penn 8000 reel on . Thats the biggest spinner . Its so so thick ! twice as thick as any other 10 foot pole , so bulky , dont buy , Ugly stiks are so overrated . And when i bent the rod i could here cracking . Penn and shakespear are usually great , but this is just a dissapointment . I returned it for a refund , lets hope this goes smoothly , Amazon usually has great refunds .
 I HAVE 3 UGLY STICKS AND EVERYONE HAS HAD THE HARD EYE COME OUT DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT i HAVE PUT THEM ON DISPLAY WHERE WE FISH TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM BUYING THEM
 I bought this ball because it was stated as being Heavy Duty ; and I agree that it is a higher quality ball than traditional playground balls.We have an Australian Shepard and she tears apart all playground balls - we have scores of dead playground balls in our yard.This ball looked like it might have been up to the challenge.The dog played around with it for about 10 minutes ... got frustrated , bit it , and it is now deflated.I also ordered the Baden ball but have n't received it yet ... . hoping it might do the trick.I 'm sure this ball is great for all purpose play ; however do n't buy it if you are planning on having your dog play with it .
 I was going to submit a picture of this thing after only one year . . have n't done that yet . It 's pretty much lost its whole top covering and looks like hell .
 What you see in the photo is a nice enough looking stem . It actually looks polished . What you get is the ugliest chunk of metal I 've ever seen . I would never put that on my bike . It looks like to pieces of metal that were shoddily welded together then spayed with some chrome . It 's awful . Do n't buy it . I 'd send it back but it 's not worth the time . I 'm going to give it away to the local bike collective . They might be able to find a home for it . uhg ! Nothing is worse than thinking you got a deal on a piece of equipment then you get the ol' bait-n-switch .
 This vest I thought looked great when I got it in the mail , and when i tried it on , it actually did fit like a glove . Its small and superlight weight , so you do n't really feel like your wearing it . All that changes when u get in the water . This thing is more of a floatation aid then one that actually keeps you afloat . Its fine if your not strapped into a wakeboard or waterskis , because then you can use an arm or leg to give a kick to keep your head up every 5 seconds . So if your using this NOT with a wakeboard or waterskis , your okay , but if you are , have fun trying to keep your head outta the water while waiting for the boat to get set or putting the skis on with your head under water . I really do n't recommend this product .
 This is a very light weight sweatshirt which is available in many colors , but if you want a quality heavy weight sweatshirt this is not it .
 Updated Review
 Proof that you get what you pay for , these low-priced sweatshirts are thin and skimpy . Sweatshirts seem to have taken the same quality nosedive as jeans . Ribbing around collar is especially thin . I am still searching for the real thing .
 I orderd this shirt for my boyfriend in Canada . I knew it would n't get there in time for Christmas , but I did n't know this company would deliver it to the wrong address ! Hell , they delivered it to the wrong country ! When I tried contacting them , they did n't even have to courtesy to reply to any of my emails . I will NEVER buy from them again and I would n't recommend anyone buying from them if you want your items delivered to the right place . I hope whoever recieved it enjoys it , because my boyfriend never will . Nothing like paying good money for nothing !!!!!!!
 paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon/this store - NEVER AGAIN !
 First , the shipping and packaging . Very poor for both . Shipping was far too long . I waited almost two weeks to get the four sweatshirts that I ordered . The packaging was in a plastic bag which was okay , however the sweatshirts were just stuffed into the bag . All of them were dirty and needed to be washed right away . They looked like they had been stored in someones garage or worse ... in the trunk of somebody 's car . I would be very surprised if I discovered Fashion Rack was a real store and not some roadside vendor.Second , I ordered XL and glad I did . I normally wear a large , but after receiving four dirt and dust covered sweatshirts and laundering them , they shrunk to just about a Large size . I 'm not sure what will happen with the next laundering . If they shrink more they will be too small and unwearable.The material is very light . This is fine with me . Others may not like a light sweatshirt . It wo n't keep you warm in very cold climates.All in all , I got what I paid for . A cheap sweatshirt .
 Problem is - I do not know how I like this product because I received sweatpants and a sweatshirt . Can you help me with the return ? There was no paperwork mailed in the package received
 I bought the Gazelle Power Plus in Sept. ' 07 . Since then the left swing arm cracked , the right swing arm cracked and just the other day the left replacement swing arm cracked . It seems to be made of very cheap , poor quality metal and it cracks at the welds . Every time the swing arm breaks the Gazelle is unuseable for about two weeks while waiting for the replacement part . Then it takes about an hour to replace the swing arm because you have to disassemble half of the machine to get the broken part off and the replacement part on . After breaking three times in six months I 'd say this is Lemon Law category . For the six months that I 've owned this piece of garbage it has been out of commission for 6 weeks and cost me three hours of repair time.Think twice about buying this machine , but if you do be sure to buy the following tools as well
 Over the past few years I have owned a number of these machines and all have broken down . I 'm lucky that all were within the warranty period . I will say that I use it for two 25 minute periods a day but they break down too easily and are not as durable as they advertise . I would gladly pay more if I knew they would last . They all break in the same place . You would think that they would do something to improve quality . While working , there isnothing better but workmenship is lacking . By the way I weigh less than 185 so my weight is not an issue .
 We had this machine for 4 months before it broke and needed to be replaced . Our 's broke at at a welded section under the handle , where the bar coming up from the foot stirrup meets the cross bar under the handle . My wife was the only one using the machine and she is 200 lbs , well below the suggested weight maximum , so this seems like shoddy work to me.At the end of the day , the $ 300 we spent on it would have been better served getting a membership to a gym for three years .
 The seller of this product was great , but the item itself was a nightmare . It arrived with two left base supports and when I called the manufacturer for a replacement part they challenged the situation claiming that it was impossible . I had to provide photos as proof and call for a parts pick-up . When the replacement part arrived it was the wrong part . I again had to call for a pick-up and request a replacement part . It took 3 tries to get the correct part and correct bolts . I found the customer service to be difficult and rude . I will not buy another item from Fitness Quest .
 Purchased this unit 14 mos ago . Steel frame just cracked . And I weigh about 280lbs -LRB- well below the 350 that it says it supports -RRB- Warranty only good for 12mos . I will keep you posted on customer service experience.Update
 Gazelle Power Plus . I have been trying to locate current information on Fitness Quest Inc in Ohio to get replacement parts for a Gazelle Power Plus . I have found that that location in Ohio is closed and have n't found any other information on it . Does anyone have another company that replacement parts for their products can be purchased from ?
 I had this for a about 5 years , I used it for about 6 months in the beginning , and just last fall I got back on it . Maybe 4 months after I started using it the cable broke . NO , I am not over the wright limit . The cable hit and injured my foot when it snapped with amazing force . A friend had the same thing happen this morning to her . I think there is a design flaw . Unless you like massive bruises on the top of your foot and having X-Rays , I 'd pass on this thing . If it had been continuously used I could see how it just wore out , but less than a year of use ? My friend has had hers for about 19 months she says but did n't use it the whole time . We tried to contact the company but the website does n't work , 800 disconected . Anyone have better contact info ??
 Do n't buy this equipment unless you have two very strong people who are expert mechanics . Other exercise equipment comes partially assembled , this just has alot of odd pieces.Complaint
 When my Gazelle arrived , the box looked like it had been through a war zone . Amazingly , most of the Gazelle was still intact . However the water bottle holder was broken . As this is an optional component , I went ahead and assembled the Gazelle and contacted the company 's customer service . I was promised a replacement , but here it is over 4 months later and I still have n't received the thing.I realize this is just a minor component and the rest of the Gazelle is working fine . I just ca n't recommend any product from a company that has such ineffectual customer service . I certainly would never purchase another product from this company for fear that the next broken part would be important and I 'd never get that replaced either .
 Luckily I did not buy this DVD however my friend did and not only were we disappointed but we were also really confused . I have been a certified aerobics instructor teaching kickboxing for 3 years now . Never in my history of aerobics have I ever seen anyone do a jump kick to the side . This is not only dangerous but uncomfortable and not even correct !!!! Will you sweat , sure , only because you are so frustrated from the weird choreography which she makes no attempt to breakdown and the fact that many of her combinations do not have good flow to them . Please if you want a quality workout and something worth your money check out Cathe Freidrich . On her website you can actually preview about 10 minutes worth of many of her workouts , I think she has over 60 workout DVDs . I realize this review may seem out of place among the 5 stars but I have started to compare all other home workouts to Cathe Friedrich and no one is able to even touch the superior products and workouts that Cathe creates . Also I had to give her 1 star but if they had an option for no stars then that is what I would have chosen because frankly its not even worth 1 star . My friend did this workout once and has not done it agian because she dislikes it so much , it was a waste of her money .
 First of all if you 're looking for something short , this is not it . The workout is 89 minutes . I needed something I could work out to 30-40 mins a few times a week . But the thing that bothered me the most about this workout was that Ms. Bento has terrible form . If she ever actually punched someone with those punches she would hurt herself . I have a black belt in martial arts and ten years of training and I could not get past how bad her form was -- I would be afraid that viewers would inadvertently hurt themselves imitating her . She has clearly not had any formal training at all in throwing kicks or punches . It is extremely disturbing . I definitely got a good sweat on but could not get past her terrible form . I had to modify almost everything so that I did n't injure myself by following her poor form .
 I have the first version of this mag , and they are not good , you get a lot of misfires after some months of use . I do n't really know about the newer versions though .
 Dissapointed !! Back sheet tore in first week and the clip for the clipboard separated . Would not recommend . Working on a refund. , ,
 Was not very happy with this shirt . The first thing I did ` nt like was that the sleeves were too short . I tried a medium and large and both were too short . The medium fit my body right but not the sleeves . The large was a little big on my body but the sleeves were still too short . I did ` nt think this was very warm either , possibly because I 'm used to the compression which is tighter . Overall , if the sleeves were n't so short it would be alright . I returned it and ordered a compression crew which I 'm extremely happy with .
 I ordered this mens under armour for a christmas gift . I cant say for sure that its a knockoff . . but its defintily nothing like the one I got last year at Bass Pro Shop . Seems to be good tech material tho-if ordering get a size up from what you ` d normally get . I returned and went back to Bass Pro . . slow to refund ...
 Horrible Display on Amazon shopping cart and order receipt !!! - when I add the clothing in the shopping card , it does ` nt specify the size selected !!!! Also , on the order receipt , it does n't specify it either . Why is it not included ?
 Too tight . I thought I ordered a loose fitting shirt but got a tight fit . Shirt itself would have been okay .
 Everything I wear is extra large and it fits fine . With this thing extra large is so skin tight I can hardly breath . I will never order another one .
 THE ONLY THING ABOUT THE COLD GEAR IS THAT 'S WHAT IT IS COLD . I 'D DO BETTER WITH THERMAL WEAR AT A BETTER FAR BETTER PRICE . I ALREADY HAVE TWO HOLES IN MY LEGGINGS . WOW . WHAT A RIP . ANOTHER NAME BRAND PRODUCT MADE OVERSEAS , AND OVERPRICED SOLD TO THE GULLABLE CONSUMER . VERY , VERY DISAPPOINTED .
 I 'd been interested in silat -LRB- and other martial styles -RRB- for some time , so I finally ordered this dvd . First off , it seemed to be cheaply burned from an old vhs tape onto a disk . Second , there seems to be confusion as to what is on volume 1 & 2 -LRB- breaking and history were to be on 1 but were on 2 , etc -RRB- . When it comes to the juru short hand forms ... it gets weird . The practitioner does a couple punches while slapping his arms ... then the combat application shows a grab and sweep -LRB- huh ? -RRB- . You can pull some useful techniques and ideas from it if you are willing to dig -LRB- or are running out of new moves in traditional systems -RRB- , but as a martial art tape , it looks sloppy , tense , and confused .
 I order this item over 6 months ago . The Jersey never showed up , but my credit card was still charged for full price plus shipping . I have made multiple adempts to contact them and I have yet to get a response . Do not order save your time and money . I recommend you just wait till next season and buy a jersey in store .
 The image of this item depicts a Tiger leaping through the D ; however the item I received contained no tiger , just the D . It was a gift , so the recipient does n't know that it should have looked different , however I do and I 'm not pleased with the bait and switch used by the seller . I wo n't do business with &#34; The Memory Company &#34; again .
 I am a school secretary and really like Cramer Flex-I-Cold packs for the students . The 4x6 size is perfect and they are pretty durable and last quite long . I was excited to find them at a good price but when they arrived , it was n't the item pictured . Very disappointing . I will say the icepaks are the same size as Cramer 's but a different , slippery packaging not soft/gel feel like Cramer .
 I have been using Power Pro braid 50 lb , let me tell I believe there is a quailty control issues with power pro and I am not the only one . I have snapped the line on some 15lb fish , and I was completely baffled at first . How could this happen ? 50lb braid should NEVER break , let alone just bringing in a 15-20lb fish . After a few uses the line gets much much weaker , there is no protection the braid . I tried contacting the manufacture , and right away they tried to dodge the bullet saying I cut the braid on rocks , but where I fish there is no rocks , nice try . I am going to use the 50lb line I bought for catching fish under 10lbs in fear it may break on fish larger than that . There are other brands , Spiderline Tuff-Line XP , and Fireline . If anyone is interested in compairing brands for breakage let me know .
 The product was exactly as described . However the processing part was way too slow . All other items ordered with this product arrived much sooner then expected . I expected this item to arrive a few days after purchase , not a week and a half . Change processing policy and future buyers will be very please with your service .
 I bought a Black Sjambok - 42 '' to fend off wolf packs when I walk in the wilderness . Once , I was attacked and could n't use it so I was severely bitten several times before a passerby scared the wolves with a loud horn . It 's not very good for fast attacking animals which are highly mobile and work in groups . Might be good for snakes or rabid skunks , but not much bigger . Probably worthless against an armed man as well .
 Bought these to replace a lost smaller 16 '' wheel . Hub can be knocked out for a 1 '' axle . The Wheels are fine , going slow over perfectly smooth terrain or with low weight loads . I had my wheels loaded -LRB- heavy -RRB- and they `` potatoe Chipped '' in that the wheel completely changed shape and the rubber came off . Easy enough to put back the rubber back on , but I 'm looking for replacement .
 I bought this item to bluild a utility cart . I took a chance when ordering it.The max . load rating is 60lbs . which was n't said in the description !
 I 've had two of these watches in two years . I like the looks and the functionality , but the reliability seems to be lacking . In the first one , the sweep second hand quit after a couple of days . That one was replaced under warranty . The second one lasted almost two years , and then died . I thought it was the battery , but when I went to have it replaced , it still would n't work . When they tested the old battery , it still had almost a full charge . Neither watch was ever abused . Maybe just bad luck , but two in a row ?
 The online purchuse was very simple -LRB- both times -RRB- . However , the product was broken when I received it -LRB- both times -RRB- . I have returned the first one and only received a partial refund . They did not refund the S&H . I disagree with this as it is not my fault that it was broken . I still need this product but I have already spent $ 11.98 on S&H with no product to show for this purchase .
 Wow , I read both mixed reviews for this product and obviously I went with the positive feedback . I was very excited to open the box . I put it together sat on it for about five minutes and wrapped it back up for another day . I set up the hammock about a week or so later while traveling on vacation . All excited to take my first relaxing nap , I set it up per the directions again and proceeded to enjoy my first portable hammock nap . The reviews will not allow me to publish all of the things that came out of my mouth in the next few minutes of my second time on the hammock . As others have listed in reviews . I am not a large man . 5 ' 9 and 180lbs and this hammock did n't last ten minutes . Both support leg collapsed like Bambi on ice . That was my last time on it and I hope some reads the review and listens to the negative reviews like I did not . DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY !!!!
 I read the reviews and they were fairly split . I read reviews on other sites and they seemed to be more in favor than opposed . I bought this for my boyfriend who is about 220lbs and 6 ' 4 '' for his birthday . We opened it in the dining room and it seemed to be an easy set up . He laid on it to `` try it out '' and we packed it up for him to take camping . He left for his camping weekend and upon first use , the bar supporting the hammock broke . It 's unfortunate that it was poorly constructed because he was very excited to receive this and it was a good size for his larger frame .
 I was really exciting to find a hammock that could hold up to 300 lbs . I took it on vacation without testing it & now I 'm so disappointed . It was a little tricky to set up . Per the instructions , extending the `` A '' hook while walking backwards to `` unfold '' the hammock did n't work , it just pulled the hammock towards me - none of the other parts fell into place like the directions indicate . Anyway , once unfolded & bars `` locked '' in place , put hammock on & got in . Getting in was typical for a hammock , balance & coordination are needed - that was expected . I was in the hammock for 15 minutes & one of the steel bars that touches the ground bends , bringing the hammock down . The bar bend so much that I could barely get it back in the box to return it . Wish it would have turned out better - I was really looking forward to laying in a hammock by the pool . So sad now ... & a pain to repack & return too .
 I do NOT recommend buying this Hammock . I bought it for my son who weighs just 145lbs -LRB- it 's suppose to hold up to 300lbs -RRB- and it broke the second time he used it . We are now past the 30-day return period , but I am hoping Amazon will come through and refund the entire amount of purchase .
 I bought this item for my husband for Christmas . After carefully reading reviews I chose the larger hammock because it was reputed to be sturdier . Sadly , though my husband is well under the weight limit on this one , the hammock collapsed while he was on it . I admit the huge laugh we got out of that moment was priceless but still , we decided it was n't a good purchase and sent it back . Good for a laugh but not much else .
 This product was very disappointing . The rack construction is not very good . The rack collapsed the first time in use with about 1/2 of the weight limit requirements on it . Returning for refund .
 I purchased this hammock because of its size and weight load capabilities . I am well under the limit at 255 pounds . This hammock is the most uncomfortable hammock I have ever used . The fabric is supported by an eye on each end hooked to the frame . With no weight in the hammock it looks very inviting . When I get into the hammock , the material pulls tight from end to end , right down the center , and it feels like I 'm laying on a steel rod . The edges of the hammock are loose , since they are not directly supported by the frame . There are metal tubes that keep the fabric spread out , but they do not support the weight . When I contacted customer service to see if I was missing something in the set up , I was told I was not , and that the hammock was designed this way for safety , it was not designed for comfort . If you see pictures of someone in the hammock you will notice them laying in the hammock to one side , but not in the center , which is not the best place to lay in a hammock . I suggest you not purchase this hammock .
 I got one today . I was so excited . It states if is for 300 lbs . Well I weigh 207 and it did not hold my weight . It was a piece of junk . I laid on it with no problem , I got off my 8 year old got on it -LRB- watching him the whole time -RRB- . He got off and I got back on it and it broke.I am so sad .
 I did some research on portable hammocks . I chose this one due to some good reviews and really did not pay too much attention on the bad ones . Big mistake ! After reading the other bad reviews , I pretty much had the same experience . I was excited when it was delivered . I opened the box , followed the instructions , and seemed to work well the first time . I was able to lay on it and relaxed . A little difficult folding it back but got the hang of it after awhile . I was looking forward to using it again one sunny Saturday afternoon but the folding frame just collapsed right after I set it up and laid on it . I will try to call Swimways Customer Service to see if they would replace it . Otherwise , I will just have to go through the hassle of returning the product . I will continue to look for other more reliable products out there . Any suggestions ?
 This product was a gift that we gave . After three months of LIGHT use , we attended a party where this hammock was used . Someone laid in it and the fabric ripped and sent the user to the ground . After inspection it appears as though it was the fabric stitching pulling and then finally tearing . Very embarrassing as I thought I purchased a half-way decent hammock.This is a low quality hammock which I do n't think anyone would find a use for as the quality is so too low . The life of the hammock after light use is about a few months .
 Was delighted to receive this hammock as a Christmas Gift . However , we were unable to set it up . We followed the directions -LRB- starting setup over several times in case we missed some small detail . -RRB- Went online and viewed Kelysus video on set up as well . Each time was the same result . The hammock could not connect between the two attachment points . Measured the hammock -- seemed to be appropriate for the description . Made the assumption that the manufacturer used wrong parts for the support structure that resulted in the support structure being too long.Return to Amazon was easy with a quick refund .
 I bought at Costco due to attractive price . I am pretty handy but I could not stretch the hammock enough to connect to the hooks on either end . I then took the arc supports out of the hammock to see if then it would stretch but then not only did it not stretch enough from end to end but I could not get the arc support back in their pockets.I ended up cutting 1 '' off each arc support and am now quite satisfied ... plus I used an extra S hook on hand to make the hammock more comfy.Not enough time on it yet to make an evaluation on comfort and durability .
 The stand is great , but the hammock ? I damn near touch my chest with my knees.Luckily I have a friend with a sewing machine so I can fix it .
 The rod seems ample enough . However the reel would not release the line . We took it to Dick 's -LRB- they also sell this combo -RRB- and asked if they could repair it . The repairman said that he would not work on it because the quality was so poor . He took a new combo off of his rack , and after a tug or two on the line , it seized in the same manner .
 This visor is square in shape instead of oval , I have never seen a square visor before . It looks very strange . Also , it is not comfortable as it is supposed to be , it is uncomfortable at the location where the sides hug to my head . I will not be wearing mine .
 This visor is unbelievably bad . Most visors are actually curved to fit around your forehead and have soft terry cloth against your skin . Not this visor . This visor has the thin nylon fabric that covers the brim against your forehead , and under that , right in the middle of your forehead , is a raised hard block about 2 '' long by 1 '' high -LRB- with no curve what-so-ever to this 2 '' block -RRB- which is positioned and pushed right into the middle of your forehead . I have no idea what the purpose or reason for this block of hard plastic is . You really have to see it to believe it . It is absolutely the most uncomfortable visor , hat or other item that I have ever worn on my head . It is a total waste of money . How they can possibly call this a `` no headache '' visor is totally beyond me . It gives me an instant headache and is way more uncomfortable than the cheap visors from Target or Walmart that often feel too tight and uncomfortable after an hour or so . I ca n't wear this for more than 15 minutes without being in real , actual pain . It even leaves a clearly visible red indentation in the middle of my forehead . I would return this instantly if I bought it from a store . But having to pay for the shipping both ways makes it not worth returning . I 'm going to just through it in the trash . At least I got a few laughs when I showed it to friends on a recent cruise and let them try on my `` no headache '' visor . Would give it 0 stars if I could .
 The satiny fabric covering the visor is nice , but it is basically inexpensive plastic underneath and breaks easily . Additionally , under the fabric in the upper middle of the visor , there is a `` ledge '' of sorts , which leaves a very visible DENT in your forehead when you take the visor off . I do not recommend this product .
 It 's un comfortable and hurt my forehead . It 's stiff and unpleasant to wear . I would not buy it again . In fact , i had to buy another visor to repplace it .
 Bought a new one . It arrived falling apart at the seams and definitely causes headaches . Hurts to wear for more than 5 minutes .
 A few problems with the device . It took a long time to get in and once it did it was the wrong one . Not sure if that is a problem with the picture , or what . As far as the performance of this model , it is too small and does not fit properly on the lumbar region of the spine . The twist ties are sown on with very thin material , and in about 2 weeks it rips.It does come with a cover for the roll which is a positive.The crinkles that the night roll makes when it is bent push into the sides of the stomach and hurt after about 20 minutes.Overall I am severely disappointing in the device and its performance . I wish there was a way to warrant it with a 0 star.There are better products out there , just take 3 minutes to look and find something else.-Very sad purchaser .
 I was hoping this would be the answer to my back pain . I tried it and it 's good in theory , but in practice , it 's uncomfortable in the extreme . It 's not flat enough and wide enough to support the area between ribs and hips , so it 's like lying on a mattress with a 3 '' lump in the middle . Unfortunately , I took it out of the package to try it , -LRB- How else can you find out if it works ? -RRB- and I see that I ca n't get my money refunded . Bummer !
 I had great expectations that this support would ease my lower back pain while sleeping , but unfortunately it did not . It is large and you feel almost silly wearing it , like one of those blow up beach life saver rings , but surprisingly it was n't too bad sleeping with . I 'm thinking a wedge to elevate the legs may work better for me . I did try using it several times and still awoke with the same pain . It did n't seem to help me and I could understand that some people would have a hard time falling asleep or staying asleep with it on -LRB- it feels awkward -RRB- . It was worth a try ... it now sits under my bed collecting dust : -LRB-
 It 's probably wonderful product -LRB- my yoga teacher recomended it -RRB- but I have difficulties falling asleep even without that contruption , so with it ... not possible .
 Desperate people in pain will try almost anything to get some relief . This pillow did nothing to help my lumbar pain , and , in fact , was uncomfortable to use . Try some other remedy . I now have a collection of pillows , wedges , and over the counter pain patches that do nothing to help .
 I found the roll to be a good idea but badly designed . It 's too thick and too stiff to do the job . I found an inflatable back cusion to work much better .
 I tried this one night . It 's just too narrow and tall to support the arch in my back smoothly - in other words , it holds a small part of my arch unnaturally above the rest.I went back to a towel , which I can customize to my back.I 've been trying to sleep on my back . Then I found that when I slept flat on my back , it hurt because the arch was n't being supported . That 's why I bought this . At this point I 've been trying to use the towel , but I 'm also going back to sleeping on my side sometimes .
 The size of the roll is too large to fit comfortably on my lower back -LRB- I 'm 5 ' 2 '' -RRB- and my side waistline when I sleep on my side .
 I liked the idea of not having to grind before I go out into the back country . With this product I was excited to grind for myself and friends while we were enjoying the sunrise . On the second trip the wing nut had stripped out on it not allowing me to set the grind the way we liked it . On the third trip it was completely useless . I think I will continue to pre-grind until I find something a little more sturdy
 Ridiculous ! I 've received three of these grinders , and all were broken . The first
 This grinder is clumsy to use and took me 30 minutes to grind enough beans for a double espresso . It wobbles about and the handle bangs your hand with each revolution . If you were at the top of a mountain , it might be worthwhile , otherwise forget it .
 I decided to begin brewing French Press coffee to take along to work . My Rancilio Rocky is used to grind coffee for an espresso machine and I did n't want to switch back and forth between a fine and a coarse grind . I looked around for an inexpensive grinder that could be used exclusively for the press.The design of the GSI Outdoors Java Grinder is impressive in its simplicity . A shaft passes through the middle of the unit . The bottom of the shaft holds the conical burr . At the top is a wing nut that can adjust the grind . After setting the grind , the crank fits over the shaft and locks it in place . Coffee beans are added through a sliding door on the top of the grinder . The whole unit fits on top of the French press and the coffee is ground directly into the carafe . It took a couple of minutes to grind 35 grams of coffee . It provided good consistency and I was generally happy with it . I would have rated this device four stars , except ... This morning I was halfway through the grind when it quit working . Upon inspection , I noted that the shaft has a six-sided bolt head that fits into a corresponding opening on the conical burr . The burr is not made of metal and the opening has enlarged with use . The shaft continues to turn , but the burr remains stationary . I ca n't see any way of fixing this , so the whole unit will have to be trashed.This unit was used around 20 times and has reached the end of its lifespan . Maybe I was expecting too much from this grinder -- maybe it 's designed only for occasional use . But for anyone who plans on using their grinder on any regular basis , I would recommend looking elsewhere .
 I bought this item thinking that it would be a great option for those of us that try to be `` green '' . I am trying to stay away from electrical appliances . Unfortunately , it only took two mornings of coffee-making for this thing to break . I am very dissapointed . I am returning it as soon as I find a box to send it back .
 The `` powerful ultrasonic signal '' is a somewhat high-pitched and very audible beeeeeeeeee . I would n't use it unless the combined sonic force of the mosquitoes were louder . I could n't stand to listen to the thing for more than a few seconds , so I have n't tested it on mosquitoes , but I just heard one opinion today that it does n't work -LRB- on mosquitoes -RRB- .
 Would not consider this a men 's watch . Face and band were perfect for me , but too small for my husband with average wrist . The band length is also shorter than most mens watches . When trying to close the clasp it ripped the hair outbid his arm.Although it is a pretty watch it just did n't fit or look natural on man 's wrist . Returned watch and ordered different one .
 Button came with black ink smeared all over one side . How someone missed this when manufacturing or packaging the product is beyond me . Spend the extra $ and buy from someone else .
 I was going to give this product a `` 3 '' because the trays acutally quite nice . Just as the previous reviewer , I love handing out chips in them.However , I re-read the name of the product , and I had to change my vote to a `` 1 '' . These chip trays are not stackable which is really frustrating , not only during game play but afterward when I 'm trying to store them !
 BUYER BEWARE !!!! This seller advertises a product in a picture and what you get is NOT what you see.Maybe I trust Amazon too much , but after something small like this , I will be paying closer attention to what third party sellers on Amazon Advertise and you should too!I ordered this product for my daughter . The seller 's advertisement displays a package containing two black , two white and two pink Under Armour headbands . It states that there are 6 headbands . Then , without realizing if you scroll down way down below in the conditions , it describes a different product . This is deceptive advertising.I contacted the seller requiring immediate response or I was filing a grievance with Amazon . They did not reply for over a week and when they did , only offering me only to return and refund , no headbands . I contacted Amazon and had to do an A-Z Refund because I was so pissed off and felt like I got pissed on by this seller . If you show an item in a picture and offer a product description , that is what you expect to receive , not to have to read the fine print below.I consider this to be deceptive and being I am in advertising , NOT Truth in Advertising -LRB- and I should have known better !!! -RRB- . This seller reminds me of a car dealer ! THEREFORE , I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS SELLER ***** BUYER BEWARE *****
 I read about these in Runner 's World and how great they were at staying in place in your hair . This is not true - I never tested them while running but just walking around the house caused them to slip back on my head so I ca n't even imagine how frustrating they 'd be running .
 When I received this button set I was disappointed by the look and feel of the blind buttons . The dealer button is OK although not the best quality but the paint on the little and big blind buttons has completely come off -LRB- and I have not used these more than 10 nights -RRB- ! I would recommend superior quality finish buttons if you are serious about your poker set .
 i 've never receive this product !!! please can you send me this item , i paye for 2 , at the same address.thank youbest regardsmr G&eacute;ronimo
 Installed the net on our frame and within 2 hours of playing , the bottom vinyl border had pulled apart leaving a large 3 foot long hole . Net also tore in 2 places . Very poor construction . If you like to repair nets every hour , this one 's for you .
 I bought these Impact nets for the exact goals that they were designed for . We use these goals in our basement all winter long . Despite taking care to assure that they were installed correctly , which is not that difficult , they held up for one kick of a soccer ball by my 14 yo son . Now maybe a 4 yo might not hurt these nets with a power shot but a 14yo blew the ball right through the nets on the first shot and nothing but holes after 15 minutes . Although relatively cheap . You get what you pay for . Believe me not worth putting them on the goals folks !!!!
 Base on the photo we were expecting a rigid foldable roulette board . This is not it ; this is a simple felt printed on two sides ...
 Today the mat came in the mail i was very surprised by the fact that it did not come with chips or a roulette wheel even though in the picture it clearly displays both i knew the price was just to good to be true . On the other hand the mat is very nice and big it almost covers the entire pool table .
 I realize you get what you pay for , and I did n't have high expectations for the security of a safe someone can literally pick up and walk away with , but I did not expect to have problems with the one thing it 's supposed to do - LOCK and UNLOCK.The instructions that come with it are vague and inaccurate . For example , to program the code , you 're supposed press a red button , release it , `` and you will hear 2 beeps '' . You do not hear 2 beeps.But that 's ok , because the code works ~ ~ > SOMETIMES . I usually end up using my key , but if I wanted a key-only safe , I 'd have purchased one.Twice I emailed the company , Lockstate , and did not get a reply . So I called them , spoke to a very nice man who said he 'd have to research this and would call me back.I 've yet to receive a call . Maybe their phone system is made by their engineers and he is working with broken equipment!Felicia
 I wo n't trust this safe , our key broken the first time using it . What if we put valuable inside then the key broken ?? I wo n't recommend this unit .
 Just bought my hubby a new acrylic holder for xmas . Ordered new trays and decided to get the heavy duty ones since I wanted to get him the best of the best . Well , the new holders arrived -- and while they are very heavy duty , but they are also 9-1/2 '' long -- almost 1/2 '' too long for either carrier . I called the company and it turns out the light weight ones are 8-1/4 '' long . They really need to make this clarification on the product description and they do n't . Check the size of your carrier BEFORE you purchase !!!!
 I ordered 2 of these and found that believe it or not , these are n't very fun to kick . The material is a bit hard ... not springy/elastic ... so the kids at church do n't like using it . We 're playing kickball with regular 4-square balls instead.This ball is durable though ... perhaps that is why it is hard ?
 I teach a PE class at a school for kids ages 6-17 . There are two different kinds of `` kickballs , '' utility and playground . This would be classified as a playground ball that is very hard and rough . This ball hurts really bad if a student gets tagged or pegged by it . The core is also so hard and tough that it is extremely tough for kids to kick it . I think this would be a good ball for an adult league .
 We 've had this bench now for a little over a year , and the seams on the seat are coming apart in four separate places . The only people who sit on it are my 6 yo and 9 yo , neither of whom is large or rowdy while sitting . Also , one of the rubber feet regularly slides off whenever the bench is slid on the floor -LRB- every time a child pulls it out to practice -RRB- and has to be replaced , or else the metal scratches our wood floor . Otherwise the bench is a good size and stows neatly . Just wish the seat was better quality .
 I do n't really like it . There is bad smell came out of the cushion which made me wan na throw up ! Bad for your health .
 I 'm dissatisfied with this bench . It 's way too tall , even on the lowest setting , and I 'm only 5 ' 3 '' . The pad also came with spots on the seat . It appeared to be used . The box it came in was all taped up and looked re-used . As long as the goods inside were undamaged and in new condition , it would n't have bothered me . But again , the pad had spots on it , and there was no manual or anything that came with it , which I find odd . Even your simple toaster comes with directions or warranty of some sort . If I had purchased this at a local store , it would definitely be returned . Unfortunately , I do n't want to have to pay for shipping to get a new one when the bench itself was about $ 30 . I 'm going to have to think about this one ...
 Music123 apparently thinks I ca n't read ! Instead of an actual `` On-Stage KT7800 Plus Keyboard Bench '' with the large , square seat shown in the photo , I received a much smaller bench apparently made by `` Guardian Cases '' . Needless to say , I 'm returning this order and will look elsewhere for the actual item I wanted . It appears that this vendor -LRB- Music123 -RRB- is engaging in the classic `` bait & switch '' tactic , assuming I 'll be too stupid to realize they 've sold me a lesser product.Definitely the last time I 'll order from Music123 .
 The bench is easy to set up and very stable as previous reviews said , but the foam is saggy . I need constantly to move my body a bit to keep my wrist position on the keyboard . That is annoying . I would not buy it if I had known this problem earlier .
 I returned this item - the seat size is listed as ----------------------------------------------------- Product FeaturesWeight Capacity
 I used this bench both at home and out on gigs . It was safely transported each and every time . In the middle of a performance , the bench collapsed and I had to play the rest of the act standing up . During intermission , I realized one of the arms had bent and I was unable to lock the arms into parallel holes in the bench . Wow ! This happened about three weeks after I got the bench - this is pretty unacceptable . I found another chair for the second act , and I will be purchasing another bench - probably the Hercules one.I contacted On Stage Stands about replacing the legs portion of the bench . They do not understand that it is bent and have refused to replace the product . I 've had nothing but good experiences with On Stage Stands in the past , and own several of their keyboard stands ... but this might be it . I 'm going to look into Hercules products from now on because they seem to be of higher quality from what I have read.Many people have had good luck with this bench , but do n't get it unless you plan on assembling once and using it at home only .
 Bought for a present and the seat ripped within 1 week of using it . Very disappointed . Poorly made , and will not hold up to a 100lb individual using it .
 Like Todd , I received the `` guardian '' bench , not the one on the website , even though I ordered directly from Amazon Prime because of his review . In addition , the stool had clearly made the rounds on the order-return circuit
 Unfortunately the bench we received was not constructed well , or had a manufacturing issue . The 4 pins did not all line up . With considerable effort -LRB- and force -RRB- , we were finally able to get the pins to go into the holes . As you can imagine , pulling them out was equally challenging , making it impractical to adjust easily/quickly . The stand was also not welded correctly , so the bench wobbled . We are returning it .
 The collars are worthless but I did n't need them going into the purchase . I use spring clip collars . The bar is very well made and of good quality . About 18 lbs . However , it is not as shown . There are only the outer bends . The center ones are not there , just straight . So therefore , there are only a bend above center as depicted in the photo , but no bends below center that are closest to the center of the bar . I kept the bar anyway thinking I 'd use it but it has since fallen from favor and I went back to using the other bar which was of lower quality and lighter weight -LRB- about 14 lbs . -RRB- with one side larger than the other that had to be turned down on a lathe to get the Olympic plates to slide on . But my lower quality bar has all the bends in it , which I was hoping to have replaced with this supposed higher quality bar . Too bad ...
 The bar itself appears of good quality . However it was mailed with 2 collars that can not lock or clip to the bar itself . Therefore the weights will fall off the bar -LRB- possibly on to your foot -RRB- After calling customer service 3 weeks ago I was promised that I 'd receive a new set of collars within 5 days . I am still waiting .
 DO NOT BUY THIS BAR ! I AM THE SECOND REVIEW TO POINT OUT THIS BAR ARRIVES WITHOUT ANY WAY TO KEEP THE WEIGHTS ON THE BAR . There are screw holes but no screws .
 I ordered this shirt for my husband who is a tried and true Bengals fan . The product arrived with license tags unattached and floating in the package and I was unsure of whether it had been previously worn or not . The patch on the shirt looked as if someone had sewn it on themselves -LRB- think cheesy high school letterman jacket -RRB- . The shirt is very thin and the patch is very bulky and makes the shirt uncomfortable . I will be returning this item : -LRB-
 I bought a King Canopy for my booth at a farmer 's market last year . From the very beginning the canopy part was too small for the frame making it very hard to get up each time . It completely broke after only one summer of use . It never had been mishandled or misused in any way . Two of the cross arms just completely snapped . For the cost of this product , it should have lasted longer and the canopy should have fitted properly .
 Maybe it was me that got the wrong size , but it does fit snugly if not comfortably , but all the inside is made of a dense foam that is very hard , and then only a very thin layer of pad attached with velcro . It also sits too high on my head and that seems to take away from the back protection . I think I might have to stick with Pro-Tec .
 I am still waiting for my package and can not get the option to contact seller or change shipping status . .
 I bought three tanks like this from the Danski site , and they did not fit well . As I try to return them by shipping them back , a woman who claimed to be the manager refused my claim because I did not have the tags on the items . I told her I had been shopping with various clothing companies and none of them requires tags . She says `` Oh , our product is made overseas . '' Then what company has their clothes made in the U.S. nowadays ? I told her that it is not acceptable that she refuses my return for this very reason . She went on , `` then ill just have to donate your clothes to the charity ! `` Need I say more?Oh , before this incident ever happened , I also got an invitation on my email to write a review about the product . So i wrote about how the tank did not fit me on their website . Guess what , they never make it public . only the good reviews go alive . What trustworthy company !
 After using this product for about a month , the plastic tab that connects the lid to the container is cracking due to the weight of the lanyard . Soon it is crack all the way through and render the lanyard useless .
 If I could give it less than 1 star , i would . Trust me , anyone who finds this either on purpose or accident should steer clear of purchasing it . There 's a reason it 's going for less than $ 50.00 . First off , I know my He-Man memrobilia and this is not an official release . This is at best a cheap hong kong knock off . It isn ; ' t weighted properly , as you can tell by the general picture . The WHOLE THING is make out of 440 Stainless , and none of it is hollow . The entire sword weighs in at well over 20 pounds , and that does n't make it conducive to lifting.But maybe you 're saying , `` All I want to do is display it '' . I say , okay sure . But that 's about all it 's good for . And if you ever have any Masters of the Universe fan walk into your house , they 'll tell you that it 's inaccurate . First off look at the picture of skeleto they include . The swhord is far different . First off , the sword is meant to split into 2 separate swords . Second the tip of the blade is not suppose to connect , it 's supposed to take on a tuning fork like appearance . And do n't even get me started on thewir claim that it 's just like `` in the movie '' . This claim is complete and utter nonesense seeing as this sword design was concieved in 2002 , about 15 years after the release of the live-action movie . Besides that sword , was all jagged and looked like more of a real sword than this one does.If you want my opinon , steer clear of this and wait for them to officially license He-man swords , I know it 'll neve rhappen , but atleast you would n't hvae wasted your cash on a crap knockoff.If you want a better notion of pricing on licensed sword merchandise , look up lord of the rings swords . Then you 'll get a good idea of pricing.This skeletor sword is a fake , and a bad fake at that . ~ JYH
 i do n't care for this product . I already own a pair of Russell Athletic Sweatpants which fit this same description . The big difference is the blend of cotton/poly . In the first pair I purchased the blend was 65 % cotton/35 % poly , they were also labeled Premier . this second pair , which i purchased off of amazon , are 50/50cotton/poly , and they are n't nearly as durable and comfortable as the premier pair . i am trying to resell the 50/50 blend pair rt now on ebay .
 Reading the description , I thought they would be more substantial -LRB- more than likely good for light workouts -RRB- . DOES NOT RUSSELL MAKE THICK , LONG-LASTING SWEATS ANYMORE ??
 They are fine and just what I was looking for , but after the first wash and dryer exposure they shrunk a bit particularly in length . So , if you are a large probably should consider the X-large considering the shrinkage .
 As per usual the delivery time for most things through amazon is speedy , sometimes damn impressive even without paying extra for expediteted shipping ... As for the product though ... I 'm not sure if it 's just me , but when I think of `` sweatpants '' , I tend to have an image in mind of a fairly thick and durable material with a nice stretchy waistband ... What I got was basically paper thin medium quality pants , and the drawstring broke the second time I wore them ... I 'd pass on these unless you ca n't afford other leggings to cover you 're own arse .
 These sweats have a simple flaw
 These pants are THIN . No warmth whatsoever . Great on a hot summer day , but not in moderate temperatures . You 'll freeze ! Not worth the 13.99 for such thin material .
 Had I had know that these pants would be so big -LRB- I ordered a large -RRB- , I would have ordered a size smaller . Besides this , they are very thin and cheap ! No wonder they could not get retail price for them which is ridiculously expensive . I am sending these back immediately .
 These are 50 % polyester ... NOT all cotton . Ultra cheap construction , drawstring is not continuous , and broke in one day of use .
 They were so thin , I had to return them ! I bought them for my son , for the fall but they are way too thin .
 There a comfortable set of light weight sweatpants but there cheaply made . I had bought three pairs of there 's and with in a month the draw strings have come out the back off two off them . Only buy them if you plan on sleeping in them . Why ca n't they just make it a draw string and not a loop .
 I bought these sweatpants intending to use them as sleepwear and occasionally to hit the gym . I am an average white guy - 5 ' 11 '' , 195lbs - and bought my usual size . The good news is that the waistband fits and they are comfortable , the bad news is the pant leg is easily long enough for someone 6 ' 8 '' or larger . They drape over any shoes I wear and cause me to slip on my tile floors when I 'm getting ready for bed . Not at all what I was hoping for . If you are a taller guy in need of some light sweatpants , I would definitely recommend these . Everyone else should steer clear .
 Once upon a time , Russell was a good quality manufacturer of athletic wear but they 've gotten cheap like everyone else . The waists run very big on these pants , which is contrary to previous versions , and the drawstrings are much flimsier - I can see some people breaking them if they pull too hard . The stitching on the insides of the waists is very sparse and spaced far apart , and you 're able to see some of the waistband material after a few washes - I do foresee these pants falling apart in a relatively short time because I see holes by the pockets after six weeks . The pant legs are extremely long and people will step on the back of the pants and ruin them . The crotch area is VERY long and you have to wear these up to your armpits to get the crotch right and keep the pant legs from dragging . I believe these were a labeling mistake by Russell , that they 're considered a tall/long , and they sold them for pennies on the dollar to Amazon - Amazon , in turn , does n't say anything either and sells them for full price as regular length pants for amazing profit percentage - think about it - the legs are WAY too long , the crotch is WAY too long , and the waists are WAY too big - they both benefit - Russell gets rid of mistakes and Amazon makes a killer profit . Have stranger things happened ? Sure they have ...
 it 's taken me a while to write this because of my frustration . 1/2 of the seams are inside out which makes it look as if i 've gotten dressed in the dark ! these have to be among the worst exercise pants i 've ever purchased . i 'm embarrassed when i wear then . i would have appreciated knowing how poor the workmanship was beforehand - but that never would have happened
 Description says these are cotton . Says nothing about a blend . When received , discovered these are 50 % blend -LRB- that means 50 % polyester ! -RRB- . I need cotton . I need to send them back , unfortunately . What a waste of time .
 I just received these sweatpants 2 days ago and have worn them twice . I was looking for some light-weight , comfortable sweatpants with pockets , which is what I received . The fabric is soft and the picture provides an accurate representation of the item . The pants seem sized larger than expected -LRB- in both measurements -RRB- , although it 's possible they would shrink to the given size in the wash.Sadly , I forgot to include the basics , like quality of build , in my criteria . The first time I wore these sweatpants , the drawstring disconnected from the back of the waistline . After that , I was able to completely remove the drawstring from the waistband . I wish I could say that I unduly stressed the cord , but I was basically just re-positioning the waist.I will not be going with the same item again .
 Wrong color , order black and got all grey , wrong color ordered black got grey , wrong color , will be returning asap
 This is my first review ever . I 've always felt that Russell athletics made quality workout clothes at a good price , until those sweatpants ! These are by far the worse fitting sweatpants I 've ever tried , unless you tie them around your neck and stick your arms out of the pockets I ca n't imagine them fitting anyone properly .
 There not really want I was wanting and the strings break why to easy and they get wholes way to easy also
 like sandpapernot real soft cottongave me the heebee geebees
 These are listed as 100 % cotton in the description but the graphite and grey heather colors are 50 % and 52 % polyester respectively .
 These pants were so thin my husband refused to try them on and returned them . Held up to the light they were see-thru .
 This product indicates 100 % cotton . When received I discovered it was 50/50 cotton/polyester . Since i am allergic to polyester , I had to return the item/s as I ordered 2 pair . I have not heard from the company yet in 6 weeks for a refund . Do I pay shipping on a poorly described item?I hope not ...
 These are not the fleece sweatpants that you find in stores . They are thin and clingy and much more poly than cotton . I tried one pair and now both pairs that I bought are on their way to Goodwill .
 I called the Amazon rep. I just got my pants and the Oxford color is 58 % polyester and 42 % cotton and the Graphite color is 50 % cotton and 50 % polyester.I was looking for 100 % cotton track pants and were disappointed.So the description of the pants which says 100 % cotton is wrong and is to be corrected .
 Bought a whole bunch of these in black , grey , and blue . Loved the open leg , light material . HOWEVER , they are imports , and they must be produced in a country of midgets . They are over-generously proportioned in the legs and seat , but a medium pant ought to have a leg inseam in the 32 '' in range . These are about 28 '' after the first washing -52 % poly/42 % cotton . Steve Urkle would be proud to wear them , but I 'll be turning them into shorts - heck they 're already knickers . Additionally , Russell has no customer service to speak of . Their web site listed outdated phone numbers . An email to their sales rep , and a phone call to an answering machine at the corporate office for the Southern Division -LRB- since the northeast 's numbers were non-functional -RRB- resulted in no response . I always had good luck with their product , but I would n't buy from them again after this .
 Dealer service and delivery was top rate but the quality of the product was below the quality standard I had come to expect from Pachmyer.The fit was loose even though the factory installation instructions were followed to the word . The factory grip on the Ruger SP-101 is a much better grip . Do n't waste your money on this one !
 we were excited to take this on a trip , was easy to pack flat in our luggage . and we were excited when we blew it up for our son to play with , it had a soft bouncy quality . however within literally three minutes of playing with it , the ball hit a tree and got a hole . we 're gon na try and patch it when we get home ... but just a warning that it may be $ down the drain .
 I was hoping this would be a nice alternative for my grandkids to a real soccer ball . I was very disappointed to find I had to air it up by blowing into a straw then sticking a plug it . I would fear giving it to young children because the plug would be a choking hazard . Trying to plug it while the air is releasing is a big disappointment and I had to leave the straw inside . No instructions whatsoever as how to air up the ball or whether to leave the straw in or out . There was just a photo of a woman blowing into the straw on the back of the package . I had to try several times and still did not get enough air inside of it . Save your money it is not worth it . It comes with two plugs .
 I was excited when I purchased this item . It really sounded like a quality product . It 's not ! The made in CHINA quality workmanship is obvious when you try to screw the cap on . The threading is poor and the really BIG PROBLEM is the tip of the injector -LRB- NOT A NEEDLE POINT -RRB- is a flat end not a pointed tip like you would think it should be . Try injecting a 3mm flat tip into your X-mas turkey . It just does n't work at all . If you do n't own a grinder then you had better shop around . This is totaly NOT worth a dollar . SEND IT BACK TO CHINA !
 I bought one of these for my son 's graduation party at our local club with the intent of shooting some clays on the side . The price was very attractive . Fortunately , I also bought a hand thrower as a back up.Out of the box the thrower would not `` frisbee '' the clays properly and they just kind of wobbled into the ground about 20 yards away . Very disappointing . I adjusted everything and still got the same results . I 'm actually not a total moron and do have an engineering degree , so I 'm only a slight moron.I called Do All , the manufacturer , and was promised that they would ship a complete replacement unit by the secretary/customer service/tech support person . A week or so later a $ 0.25 part showed up in an envelope . More disappointment from Do All.Save your money DO NOT BUY this product . A hand thrower will be much more rewarding if you are on a budget .
 Hi All , The spring is too hard to work for an adult female.Throws the clays well.Has sharp edges -LRB- cut myself , first round and was a bloody mess -RRB- . The stamped metal legs REQUIRE the pegs be inserted firmly.Will NOT mount to a table.Pulls the legs out of the soil EVERY time you shoot.Basically IMPOSSIBLE to use by yourself -LRB- plan on a buddy -RRB- . Using this trap is a LOT of hard work . Stick to a hand trap , smaller , cheaper , easier to use , weighs less.Save your money . A sit down trap is much better , if you have someone tohelp throw for you .
 Bought this product to save a few bucks over the more expensive models . Well , as they say , you get what you pay for . Tried to hammer the feet into the ground but the shock of the arm releasing was too much for the unit to hanlde so it kept coming out of the ground . Also , the unit was extremely difficult to reload the spring . I am a pretty strong guy and I had a lot of difficulty cocking it for another release . I even tried to loosen the spring thinking I had it too tight but that did not help . Finally , the pull string broke after the third pull . Overall , you would be better off buying a hand held thrower .
 This was purchased at Walmart for about $ 30 . Some parts were missing from the box . Assembly took about 15 minutes.I thought it would at least function nominally but I was wrong.I tried to use it on the ground and every time it threw a clay it would jump up from the torque and I 'd have to reposition it . The stakes did not hold it to the ground . I then tried the option tire-mounting method shown in the instruction manual , but that did not work either . One bolt simply was n't enough to counteract all the torque.Finally , I took the legs off , mounted it to a piece of sturdy board , and used C-clamps to secure it to a table . While this mounting method worked , the thrower kept breaking clays . I suspect that the throwing arm was bent.Also , every single nut and bolt comes loose , some faster than others . Although they include a couple of locking washers , they did n't include enough.I plan on boxing this up and returning it . It 's a poorly made product that is clearly not able to withstand the forces induced in this sport .
 This product was easy to assemble . The swing arm is a bit hard to cock . The problem I had was that after I had it cocked , I would pull the string but it would not release . I tighted the spring but had the same problem . I still have not been able to throw any pigeons with this thrower and I plan to return it and get a different model .
 If you are tired of broken clays , assembly and headaches , you must buy the WingOne the Ultimate Hand Held Clay Target Thrower ! Check it out at -LSB- ... -RSB-
 The `` tetron '' hakama I received was in fact cheap cotton -- in the wrong size . At length I convinced the vendor that this was not what I ordered , and persuaded them to give me a refund , but they refused to reimburse me for the cost of shipping it back . `` Top quality , '' indeed . Let the buyer beware .
 My one star review is based on the fact that the product description clearly states the 2 flags are included in the shipment , however i only received one . If instead I received both flags I would 've rated the product high marks as the flag is somewhat nice , okay quality , goes on and off door window easily and even comes with a thing to mount it on a wall instead .
 I had previously purchased a Schwinn exercise bicycle a few years ago , and was very happy with it . When I needed another , I chose this model . The new bike , like the previous one , is a very good product . However , the method of shipping of this bicycle is disconcerting . I had read the previous Amazon reviews stating that the bike was shipped in ordinary boxes -LRB- which is a problem when you ship something as heavy as an exercise bike -RRB- , but also read that the Schwinn people were very nice and helpful about sending replacement parts . Since I did n't need the bike right away , I decided to take a chance and order it.As other reviewers noted , the Schwinn customer service was very nice and tried to be helpful in fixing my bike , which arrived damaged in a box that looked like it had be sent through the Carribean during a hurricane . Unfortunately , the part that was broken was a main component of the bike , and therefore a whole new bike needed to be sent . Amazon quickly and efficiently sent a new bike , but required me to send back the damaged one . Unfortunately , the second bike also arrived in a damaged package . The Fedex delivery people registered an official complaint before they even delivered the bike , and that bike was also damaged.The good news was that I was able to put together enough pieces from both damaged bikes to have one whole working product . Since I was still required to ship back the remaining pieces to Amazon , I had to buy a box to ship it back . It 's actually a bit inconvenient to pack up an exercise box , so I feel the need to warn other consumers that if there is a problem it may take quite a bit of effort to fix .
 I purchased this bike from a local dealer 15 months ago and it has broken down 3 times in the last 15 months . The resistence motor is defective which is what I have had replaced 3 times now . This motor does not allow you to change gears or bike through a program -- upgrading to shifiting on the fly technology would be a plus.The positive aspect of the bike is the comfort and grip heart rate monitor and the ability to swap out saddles also a plus . Ovewrall I can not recommend this product .
 We have a C130 upright less than 3 years old . The resistence died . Called their customer service and they 'll send someone out for over a hundred bucks to look at it , order the part and then charge us another $ 75 to come back and install it . After a lot of research -- the schwinn site is useless for support info -- found an aftermarket parts and repair site and it looks like the unit we 'd need to fix this is > $ 400 ! Can you say R-I-P-O-F-F ?
 Mechanics/computer fails repeatedly , schwinn does not stand behind their porducts ... buyer beware . I used mine a total of 23 times at low resistance ... now its at the curb .
 I purchased this bike for the Goldbox price of $ 239 . Placed the order on Dec. 22 , and it shipped on Feb. 15 . Amazon did keep me informed as to order status.Upon arrival the box was all beat to hell . Started assembling the bike and the left shroud was cracked . Was n't about to pack all that back up and take to UPS for return . Called up Scwinn , or Nautilus , or whoever they are , to have a new shroud shipped to me . The gal was helpful and registered the bike for me . Then she asked for the serial number , the numbnuts drilled a rivet through the first digit of the serial number , but she guessed it should be a 3 for this model . I reminded her that I would need a crank puller to pull the crank arm off in order to replace the shroud.I went on to assemble the bike . The pins in the front panel electrical panel connector had to be straightened with needle-nose pliers . Also found the left front base cover with the moving wheel was cracked . The shrould and gear puller did arrive in a few days.Got the bike assembled in probably twice the time it should have taken due to the cracked shroud . So far , the bike appears to be stable and quiet . Longevity is a big question due condition the bike was received in .
 One star is too high a rating , but I ca n't put in a zero . I received this bike in defective condition . After I assembled it , it would not crank at all-not one turn . Since it was supposedly under warranty I called the Schwinn Customer Service number . The representative wanted me to check the pedals and adjust the support bracket . The pedals turned freely and the bracket is welded in place-no adjustment possible . I insisted that the defect was internal and needed a trained technician to fix . The representative finally agreed to arrange for a technician to come to my house to fix it . Then she told me a technician would contact me within 5 days . There was no promise that the tech would come within 5 days or 5 months . This is no warranty at all in my opinion . I 'm returning the bike through Amazon who was very helpful .
 If you are looking to buy Schwinn beware of an issue that has plagued many models , the dreaded e-2 error . I have the 112 and have been fighting this issue for four years -LRB- anger will keep you going and from throwing it and my money away -RRB- . I 'm on a fourth motor assembly . I called Schwinn today 7/20/2009 for a fifth and they said they can not ship me anymore motors , since this last one was just over a year old . I 've actually isolated it down to an electronic component called a potentiometer . It 's a $ 3.00 part at Radio Shack , but needs to be matched exactly to the original specification and I ca n't seem to get the right one . The ones in the bikes are defective . However , after four years of removing and reinstalling motors I 'm done . No more Schwinn 's or Nautilus , Inc products . If you are looking to buy , beware . This problem has been going on for a long time and who knows if they are still putting these defective products in the new models . I would n't waste good money to find out . Go with another brand . The e-2 will burn your money away .
 After about 2 years of use , my Schwinn 101 bike failed for no apparent reason - all the resistance gave out . I figured out how to get the screws out of the plastic `` shroud '' that hides the inner workings , but could never get the shroud all the way off because I could not get it by the pedal assembly . Schwinnn provides no repair directions to help with that step , an don online search also proved futile since all the online manuals from Schwinn cover other topics.Peering inside , I can see that the tensioning spring came off . But that ca n't be fixed with the shroud still in place . So , I 've been stymied in the efforts to fix it myself and get back on to the bike ... I have to say this is typically lousy modern design that fails to block failure , AND fails to make it simple to deal with the failure . So , I 've now wasted 2 hours in futile repair efforts and have to go the gym each evening to bike until I can buy a new one . I will not buy another Schwinn !!!!!
 The bike delivered to my door was damaged in a completely broken package . Directly sent it back and asked for a replacement . Because of it , the delivery date was much later than promised . Now , Amazon want to charge me with the damaged and returned bike . Amazon had no reposne to my complaints . All the communications -LRB- e-mails -RRB- got retuned back . Amazon purposely does not let their customers to send them complaints by returning customers ' e-mails . Their e-systems are just for orders and credit card numbers . Had to call credit card company to dispute the charge . Shame on Amazon !!
 The package arrived taped up and the box was completely ripped.How am I supposed to put this together ??? I now have to go and buy $ 20 worth of bolts!Terrible
 This target is made of metal strong enough to handle 9mm ammo . It is clearly durable . However , to be used at a minimum of 30 feet , the target is so small that it is difficult to hit dead-on to make it function as advertised . I found myself aiming slightly above the soil level in order to contact the target . Because it is so small , this target makes for a very difficult and unrealistic shoot . Also the DVD that came with the box is more of an advertisement for Do-All , and not the assembly directions , and does not run completely through . I feel this target was a waste of my money .
 Item was shipped and delivered quickly . There was parts missing , the box was open , and there was no instructions . I called Do-All , and they said they would replace the missing parts . The store that sold the item should check returned items to ensure that all parts are there before the sell it again . I would not purchase anything from that company -LRB- J&M Hunting supplies and Marine -RRB- again .
 A little bit too big for a bedroom wastebook . Quality is very poor . Item came dented and we were going to try to push dents out but they were all over . As far as returning the item we had no problem at all .
 ok , so it took these a while to get in , a lot longer than I wanted . They are car mats , so i figured they 'll be fine no matter what . I was cleaning my car and found that these things are falling apart after only 1 month . The fiber comes off the mat just by running your hand across it .
 i have now bought 2 of these because i liked the wide angle so much . they are sharp and clear . i use them in costa rica to locate something -LRB- like a sea turtle , or fish jumping -RRB- , then use my higher magnification binoculars to look . dropped both sets only once -LRB- that i remember -RRB- and the image doubled and can not be forced back . i 'm going to buy the extreme set this time .
 I received these as a christmas gift from my wife . While the quality seemed good , I was not impressed on the zoom . These binoculars are for viewing things . such as a bird right in front of you , not at a ballgame or event where you are trying to see further out . I bought an $ 18 pair of bushels 12x25 right here on amazon for my kids to use . They are a 1/3 of this price and completely blow the nikons out of the water with the zoom and clarity . I would not recommend this item for people who are wanting to see things that are more than 25 yards in front of them . They simply do n't have the magnification power for that .
 i made a real mistake and took about 5 shoots after the first 1 because i wanted to post picture of what a mid power air rifle at over 20 did to the little target . i can tell u that this trap will not hold up to its own rated cal to use to give an example a beeman p17 pistol shoots a .177 pellet at 400fps give or take even these left a dent that removed paint on the outside of the housing any way only reason i give it 2 stars is because it looks nice and if you use it at over 30 yard with very low power rifle IT MIGHT STAND UP TO IT . for me it was no good the smallest thing i have is my p17 which is a target pistol since im not a pro marksman i do n't think i can use a 10 yard gun at 30 with any accuracy everything else i have will probably damage this thing to much with one tin of pellet to use it again just spend a little more money and get something more solid .
 Do not waste your time this is a cheap flimsy item Use an old box your better off .
 Do not get this trap it 's really not even that good . I did not buy this off amazon I got it from my gun club but it 's the same exact thing so I thought I might rate it on here . I am A competitive pellet shooter down in AZ and I got this trap . My gun dented this trap up so bad it 's warping on the back . 2/5 stars .
 I was disappointed with the sticks , for 2 reasons .1 -- the vertical angle of handle to the blade is lower than usual ... placing the handle lower off the floor than normal . This made the sticks undesireable to all of my teenagers , the age group I bought this length of stick for . ** If you want to use a long stick that is angled for use by tiny tots , then hey ... this stick is for you .2 -- I know teenagers are hard on floor hockey sticks ... but these broke quicker than they should . They plastic is a bit too brittle . I also speculate that the goofy angle of the blade causes any slap of the stick to stress the blade more than it should.On the pros ... the shorter-handled goal sticks were nice.I will not buy these again .
 This bullet box worked ok I suppose , but not for what I wanted . You have to be a very long distance away for this to be used safely -LRB- manufacturer reccomends 100 + yards -RRB- so no pistol training here . I did try it at about 10 yards just to see , and after the first shot I was hit in the face with hot lead that came from the box . Upon closer inspection the .22 almost penetrated the steel back of the box . Again , might work well for long distance rifle practice , but do n't plan to use a pistol .
 The only reason I did n't send it back was it is heavy to ship back . The company obviously went to the lowest overseas bidder for construction , and I got what I paid for , a trap that had gaps in the metal due to poor quality workmanship . The pieces did not fit tight at all , I was glad I had a welder to fill in the 1/8 inch gaps in the metal . I repainted it and now sits on my bench were I shoot at it all the time . Would n't recommend the purchase to anyone unless they have access to a welder .
 obviously returned by someone else because of poor fitscrew holes did not align
 I ordered the Do-All Aerial Assault Thrower and received it in a timely manner . First time at the trap range the motor failed . Called D0-All about the problem and they were very prompt in replacing entire unit . The second unit I received I have had no motor trouble ; however it started out breaking approx 90 % of the clays thrown . Once this issue was resolved a bearing screw bent and was replaced . The bearing screw bent because the bearing did n't ride correct on the mating surface . Once this was corrected the micro switch at the front of the machine broke and needs to be replaced . I have only gone through three boxes of clays total . I have only used the thrower for less the one hour of operating time on the machine . If you love to tinker with newly purchased items this is a great item to play with . If you want a thrower that 's works correctly you will need to spend the money to buy a quality thrower .
 These traps are the biggest piece of junk , I have ever spent hard earned money on . At one time I had two of these things , new out of the box , and neither one worked . I had to return four of these traps before I could get one to work . I constantly have problems getting it to work . It 's so bad , none of my friends will shoot with me . My friends just opt to hand pull with their hand pullers , so we can shoot on any given day . These things are complete jokes , and the company knows it . I 've called for knew parts on defferent occasions , and received parts that were rusted or completely different , with instructions to rebuild the old trap with the new parts . Please , please do not spend your money . The sad fact is , when I bought these things , they were $ 500.00 !
 I put it together and it worked great for about 30 birds then it broke . Do all sent another one with very little waiting time . But the about the same thing happen about 30 or 40 targets it broke same thing just stopped throwing it would rotate alright but would not throw . I just give up took the $ 400 money loss and went and got a different kind of thrower .
 When I received my package it was open and damaged . There was hardly any packaging inside to protect the wastebasket . It was a christmas gift and I had to return the item for a refund . I will not ever order again .
 Bought it for my son ! Looks nice at first , but rusts easily if it gets wet . I used it for my son 's bathroom and a few times my son did not put a plastic bag inside of it and I guess it got wet and rusty . Other than that its a nice size wastebasket and colorful !
 The dueling tree seemed like a good idea , but it just did n't work . I tried it on 2 separate trips to the range.When I first got it , I read the instructions , then I carefully oiled the spring collars and adjusted all the spring cams so that they seemed to swing . I could not make them take a uniform pressure to rotate , despite some cams adjusted to maximum tension and others to minimum tension . I also noticed a lot of rust coming out in the oil as I worked it into the rotating parts . But I decided to try it anyway.The first range trip , some of the paddles worked ok , others did not , then they all started binding and not flipping . When I retrieved the tree , I found that all the collars had reverted to the most fully extended setting . The problem with that is that the tree does not have enough room for all the paddles when they are on the minimum setting , and it causes them to bind.I shot .22 LR Federal High velocity HP rounds , -LRB- blue box -RRB- out of 3 automatic pistols , and 3 rifles . The choice of firearm did change the performance , but I did not have any .22 magnum or .17 HMR to try.I took the tree home , oiled it again -LRB- getting out more rusty oil -RRB- , and re-tensioned all the hex bolts . I went as tight as I could go without stripping the bolts , and took it out again . The same thing happened , all the tension collars worked out to their loosest setting , resulting in the tree binding again.I considered taking the tree apart and reworking it to remove the spring mechanism , and tilt it farther forward to work the reset , but for $ 50 I should n't have to do that , and then I would not have been able to return it -LRB- which I am doing today -RRB- . I have used homemade dueling trees with the v-notch and post reset system , with a spring over the flipper , and I think that works much better than the spring-cam that this tree uses . I think it is probably cheaper to make as well.I gave this 2 stars instead of just 1 , because the paddles are actually a lot beefier than I expected . I think that you could safely shoot smaller centerfire pistol ammo at this -LRB- 9mm , .38 , .40 -RRB- , but I do n't want to test my theory since I am returning it .
 I cleaned and assembled target , took to range and shot it , with 22 cal . pistol , with direct hits 3/4 of the targets wo n't swing over to other side , box says 30 yds . min . for pistols , thats too far , at 30 -- 40 feet they still wo n't flip to other side , tried WD40 , still wo n't flip when hit with 22 .
 Bought this target a year ago . It worked fine for a couple of months . Adjusting screws loosens up after shooting a couple hundred rounds of .22 rimfire shots . Tried to adjust but the screws that adjust the tension are too short -LRB- 1/4 of course threads -RRB- and eventually all stripped out . Without screws tightening to rod the target is pretty much useless . So , I took it apart and hang the steel pieces from a tree on a wire and that is my new target . I know others with the same problem and do n't know why the company does n't do anything about it . Save your money for a better target . EDIT >> Okay , I wrote the DOALL company and they sent me a replacement and I am now trying it out and will repost if this one is better . For now , I give the company credit that they stand behind their products . Just remember to fill out the warranty papers when you purchase one .
 Would not buy this again , was bad as soon as we got it . Took it to the range to fire , and did not work , took it back home and took it apart , relubed everthing and still bad . Do not buy ...
 I have tried adjusting the spring tension . all are set as softly as possible . I am hoping the arm action will improve with use .
 Bought this for a youth shoot at our club ... thing just wouldnt work right . I tried to adjust per directions , and it had no impact . Targets wouldnt swing all the way from one side to the other . I ended up tearing it apart and making hanging swinging targets out of the `` arms '' . Dont bother with this unit.Raleigh NC
 I was honestly excited about this when I got it . I read other online reviews about it and there were great reviews and poor reviews giving it an average rating . I am kinda handy with making modifications if need to fix minor adjustments so I thought I would buy it.After assembling it the targets were very difficult to move from side to side . I adjusted the springs which are spring cylinders to match the lowest tension for .22 bullets and it was still VERY difficult to swing some of the targets from side to side.The steel work is very solid and the construction is good quality , the only issue is with the springs which should allow the target to swing to the other side when hit.I inspected the target to see if there was any way to maybe fix this and all the spring workings are internal . So there was no access to try and fix what might be broken . I am returning the product .
 This target was definitely not designed for a low energy bullet like a .22 . The springs that flip the Target from one side to the other are strong enough that it takes 2 hands -LRB- 1 to flip the Target , 1 to hang onto the stand -RRB- to flip the targets . The tension is adjustable but not enough to make any difference . It 's now laying on the work bench while I decide if I can build something better or just throw it in the scrap pile .
 This is definately not a $ 50 target . The steel is good but the hardware is cheap and the reset mechanism is garbage . Three of the eight targets will only go one direction , even when adjusted properly the arms walk up the shaft and bind against the ones above them . Even if I had paid $ 20 for this I would still feel ripped for buying a reset target that will only go one way and doesnt come back ...
 They had a good idea that just did n't work . The first time I shot my new target some of the internal parts broke . So I had some new ones made got it all back together and it still did n't work right . Some of the flippers do n't flip good and get hung up kind of a bummer . Its real heavy built and looks good but that does n't do much for how it works . May use some of the parts for another target .
 I bought a Clayhawk Trap locally . It was totally unassembled . It takes about 45 minutes to put together . They provide a box wrench and an allen wrench along with the box of parts . I had to use two of my own tools as well . I needed a 14mm open end wrench and a pair of pliers from my own tool box . The assembly instructions are incomplete and not all of the parts that are included are mentioned in the instructions . After everything was assembled it turned out that the trap still would not work . The aluminum throwing arm was about on an inch too long and because of this the release mechanism , or trigger , was not able to release the throwing arm . We used a saw to shorten the aluminum throwing arm and that did the trick.The box does not even mention that the unit is not assembled . It would be appropriate to call this a kit or a weekend project . Do NOT buy this product , it is a cheap Chinese import and in my experience it was not easy to assemble or and it was nearly impossible to make it work .
 I had such high hopes that this time I 'd find the right size but this mouthguard is a disaster . not only is it huge , even though I am an adult and ordered the junior size , but it 's so hard it made me gag really bad , made my gums bleed , and gave me a nasty jaw pain I never experienced before . yet another total waste of money , I 'd have happily shipped it back if it would n't involve additional international shipping cost . what a waste !
 Product is much inferior to the pro Model -- Much better to buy the professional head for another $ 75 and be done with it . The cocking head assembly is very tricky to adjust . It breaks clay birds if not set precisely .
 We purchased this trap , to use for our church . one of our members found a do all trap at a garage sale , and we decided that a second one would be great . I priced shopped and found Amazon.com had the best price , so I ordered it . When it came , my husband assembled it , and we took it out with the church that weekend . It threw about 10 clays , and the 3/4 return mechanism stripped out . Amazon.com was great to deal with and I got a full refund . The difference between the garage sale one and this one was that on the garage sale one the 3/4 cock mechanism was fully enclosed , were this one was n't . Do - All does make some good traps , but Iwould suggestion buying at least the next step above the Backyard line . Hope this helps .
 With the thin straps I should have realized that this thing would slide all over my head . The gear protected my ears , but keeping it in place was distracting .
 During My 1st match , The headgear kept on moving around and eventually fell down to my neck . It is comfortable around the ears but NO STABILITY ON THE HEAD what so ever ... DO NOT BUY IT ! No matter how tight it will be on you it will slide off ... that 's the only guarantee about this purchase .
 The frisbee broke within the first couple weeks of using it . It hit the ground with a force normal to throwing a frisbee and now the lights dont turn on .
 so thin , when it rains it may be a good choice if u do n't have a raincoat .
 I loved the concept of the product but it cracked withen four uses , this product has nothing to do with the seller its the manufacturing of it . Maybe its just the one I got you never know .
 I ordered this mug for my husband . He is a Brown 's fan and he loves freezer mugs . He started using this mug in February and it just broke this evening , at the end of May . A crack appeared down the side of the mug where the handle is . This sure did n't last long . I have one myself , a Bengals mug , and so far so good . I have only had it for a couple of months , but I fear mine will crack also . Maybe we just happened to get a defective mug , regardless , my husband is bummed .
 Do n't waste your money unless your workout is sitting on the couch . This monitor is sold as `` providing unobtrusive reading of your heart rate during your workout '' . Since you have to stand still to get an accurate reading one has to wonder what type of workout Reebok did to substantiate this claim . Get a strapped monitor for working out . While this is a great idea the design does n't match the intended purpose .
 This product was dificult to get a heart rate reading on unless you are walking , would not give a heart rate even at low running speeds . I used this product 4 times and both heart monitor buttons fell off .
 The HR monitor buttons got stuck in the down position on 1st use , no use any more . Also the shape of the back suggests it is designed for small wrists , not at all comfortable on mine .
 Right out of the box , I had a lot of difficulty getting a heart rate reading . Tried all the tips -LRB- wetting your wrist below the watch , etc -RRB- and nothing worked . Sent it back for a refund . Bought the Sportsline Analog strapless heart rate monitor and so far so good .
 I purchased this item and it never stated a size on the description . It came and was made for a woman . I tried calling the company over several days left no answer only allowed to leave message on a machine . I never got called back had to contact amazon to resolve this matter .
 love a lot of their products but this one did n't last long . The battery fell out of the center and I had to tape it in .
 I washed it one time the white puma mark get darker and small white spot appears on the shirt.Do ' t buy this product . this is not original puma
 I prefer mechanical clocks ... maybe for sentimental reasons ... and I bought this one because is looked nice . I like that it has a large face . However , the buttons started jamming intermittently right after I received it ... and it sits on a shelf now instead of in my chess bag .
 This clock looks good and is in a sturdy housing . However , there are definite QA issues . The buttons are plastic -LRB- I think the Yugo era was metal -RRB- and protruded through two holes in the wooden housing . They were jamming out of the box . I rasped the holes a touch wider and they functioned fine after that . The setting dial was working fine on one side but sticking/jumping on the other making very hard to set precisely . I oiled -LRB- with WD40 -RRB- and the ` bad ' side works a little better now and the ` good ' side started working a little worse . I would have sent the clock back but I have already opened it up , rasped wood , etc. . . It is functional , just hard to set . I do n't have a lot of experience with chess clocks , but intuition tells me you could spend your money better . I suspect someone could get a real lemon -LRB- worse than mine -RRB- and another person may get a good one ... perhaps they were better under communism .
 Purchased three . Way to small for my three 9U players . Too flimsy , all three broke in a week . I figured 20 dollars would be good for 9-year-olds , but I was mistaken . Should of shelled out more for descent pair . I usually give good ratings , but unfortunately 3 out of 3 sunglasses failed . I would not recommend . My players did not contribute to the glasses breaking . All three frames bent .
 The box it arrived in was a a very weak manufacturers box . It had clearly not been opened in transit to me but had various rips in it . The product was absolutely used as it had wear marks all over it . The package that contained all the nuts and bolts was cut open and nuts and bolts that were loose in the box must have fallen out of the holes.Due to being an overseas customer and the hassel of getting another box that would hold this well used -LSB- supposed to be new -RSB- product , then going through the refund proccess , it was easier just to take it and try to buy the spare parts . Ive sent mail about this to the seller and Amazon to no reply . DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT HERE AS DISAPPOINTMENT IS MOST LIKELY .
 Item description says KMC 9-speed . But I keep on receiving single-speed ! What 's up with that ? The item I originally received was KMC K710 -LRB- single-speed , rasta -RRB- ; while I placed and ordered KMC X9 .93 -LRB- 9-speed , silver/black -RRB- . I filed for replacement thinking that they wo n't make the same mistake twice . Wrongo boyo ! They sent me the exact same item that I was trying to return
 This is crap ! It leaks . The black inside part comes right out . I will never buy another mug like this again .
 the cup was everything the add said it was and the green bay logo is great . i enjoy the cup very much and would buy another one if needed
 The picture shows the retro logo but it is the new logo . If I would have known it was the new logo I would not have ordered it !
 We were very disappointed with these masks . They did n't last anywhere 's near as long as the ones we 've previously bought from this company . Quality control maybe ?
 I 'm forwarding this review by Bob.I do not recommend Nu-teck airless tires they are very dangerous Nu-teck says that there tires are guaranteed to never go flat !! well that 's a lie , mine went flat , that did not bother me to much . until I asked for a new tire . they said that it 's my fault for using the breaks to hard . and I created soft spot . well I 'm 67 years old I have a small folding bike 20 inch wheels I only use the bike to go back and forth to the store , I do n't race or jam on the break . Nu-teck , just wants to get out of the guarantee . Nu-teck is a bad company to do business with , ricktig.dk is the same company , do n't do business with them , if you could help me so other people do n't get flim flamed tell your friend not to buy airless tires . and if you see Nu-teck ad please cut and paste let others know . this company is not honorable and does not stand behind it 's guaranteed , I 'm putting this company on ripoff.com and youtube , BBB and 7 on your side , plus , bob williams
 the tire fits in the rim of my dahon folding bike nicely , but it swerves side to side opposite the rim so when i try to ride with it it feels like the back of the bike is in a washing machine .
 For the price , I think a good pair of Zeiss binoculars , mounted on a tripod , is a far better package .
 This was a gift for my husband and son For their new trucks I was so Disapointed when my son put his on his truck and drove the emblem fell off on the street so my husband took a look at his to find that the steelers tag was attached with double sided tape so he superglue is emblem in place hoping it will work . Very Disapointed
 This was a beautiful rod and it arrived damaged ; a broken butt cap . The rubber cap is sheared almost off the rod . The shipping box has no damage so the flaw existed prior to shipment . How could anyone pack the rod and not notice the damage ?

 This table comes in two pieces . That in itself is a problem , because it is not secure , even as a tabletoop conversion . Just bumping into it , can move it out of place . It isalso very difficult to move because of the sheer weight of it . It certainly was not what we expected . We had to return it , and consequently eat the cost of shipping . It also did not come with the net and paddles that were a part of the package .
 The product description for this says `` Includes a net set , two hard rubber rackets , and three balls '' . However , none of that was received . Just two big pieces of wood , that 's all it is . No instructions or documentation of any kind .
 I ordered this product in plenty of time for Christmas ... kept trying to track package and there was nothing ... called company and they told me that it was on backorder and not available until after January 8th ... asked why they did n't let me know . . no explanation ... I cancelled the order ... communications not good at all ...
 This is an update to my previous review -LRB- which I have included below -RRB- . I am changing my rating from 4 stars to 1 star because I have discovered the lock is a complete joke . I `` locked '' this container , returned to it later , and forgetting that it was `` locked '' easily pulled it open , breaking the `` locking mechanism '' -LRB- sic -RRB- in the process ! It turns out the upper portion of what they claim is a lock is simply a small tab of plastic that breaks off very easily . This product is a great idea but the execution is comically awful . -LRB- If some manufacturer happens to be reading this review there is a great business opportunity here for a well-designed an executed version of this product . -RRB- -LRB- here is my previous review -RRB- I bought this specifically because it locks . I had recently purchased a set of very nice panniers -LRB- fortunately on sale -RRB- and after using them for only one day they were stolen off my bicycle . This cargo container attached easily to my rack and would be very difficult to remove without access to the inside of the container . The lock itself is low security but so far has deterred all thieves . I read in another review that one of the side latching mechanisms fell off . This also happened to me when I bumped the container against a post , fortunately it reattached easily and I have n't had any problems since . One virtue of this unit is that it holds a fair amount of stuff . I can easily stop at the grocery store and buy dinner for my family of four without worrying about having enough space to carry the groceries home . In sum , this is a nice `` bike trunk '' and I 'd recommend it , although it 's a little on the flimsy side .
 This product was not big enough to fit my text books in there . It also was not compatible with my bike .
 Using the watch for running and interval training worked out fine . However , when I decide to test the `` Ironman '' claim is where the watch failed . A dip in not ever a foot of water was enough to fry the watch for good . Even though the watch claims to be good up to 100 meters . I was either given a fake or this watch is not ironman ready .
 I purchased this watch for Father 's Day . I was very disappointed , when I opened the box and took out the watch I realized that the battery was n't working ! Imagine buying a watch and the screen is blank .
 This watch was great -- until my husband went swimming in the ocean , and the velcro strap did not hold . Needless to say , the watch is now history after wearing it for just a couple days and only a brief time in the ocean : -LRB-
 Our kids never play with this and it sat in the bottom of the toy box till I chucked it . The pin is to short and the stand is to small . The quality was simple at best . I was very excited about this indoor toy and it was a dud for us . Give the kids a box instead .
 I grew up in Florida where in our backyard was a homemade horeshoe ` run ' complete with metal stakes , sand pits , and real horseshoes . It was a fun game and our whole family enjoyed it . I purchased this item as a fun game to be played at my wedding . We purchased about 5 outdoors games that would be set up on the large lawn at the golf club we were married at . This was the worst . I opened it to set it up and realized that this was made for kids -LRB- 5 + -RRB- and would not suffice . It is too lightweight for anyone over the age of 10 to use . The stakes do not stand up properly . The entire set it made of rubber and looks like it would n't last long . If you are an adult looking for a game that you would like to have travel with you to other locations , say a camping trip , this is not the set you want . Would make a great first timer tots game - but other than that , not worth the time , the effort , or the money .
 The stick that you throw the horseshoes around is only about 6 inches high . Everytimes you throw the horseshoe , it falls over . Flimsy and cheap ! Do n't Buy !
 The item is fine but the shipping and handling cost was $ 9.95 for a $ 25 shirt ! will not order from this vendor again : -LRB-
 I ordered this watch when it was offered as a Gold Box deal.The first watch , when I set the date and time , the time would not advance , at all . I contacted Amazon , and they promptly sent a replacement to me , and I had the replacement within two days.I set the date and time on the new watch , and the minutes would advance , but the hour does not advance .
 this product was not as describe , the cover was not the size mention the cover did not fit and the parts were not correct i am not satisfy with this company it seems like they don , t know what they are doing.they show one thing in the picture and send something else .
 The price was reasonable and the shipping was as stated . But this experience was down hill after that ! The enclosure kit was much too small , no where near the deminsions advertised or on the box . Too short in length on all 4 sections and the from and back panels did not reach the ground ! The material was also extremely thin ! Ca n't see this holding up in a bad rain or wind storm . Very disappointed !!
 Originaly I thought the top came with the side and end walls . Was unhappy that I also had to order a top for the unit . There was no advertising that there was no top included . I thought the top fit my 2 '' frame , but it did n't and it is short on both sides . There was no advertising about what span was needed for the top . The material is paper thin . I do not recommend buying this product unless you know your frame and top measurments .
 Bought as a cheap rod -LRB- 4ft 6inch UL -RRB- to keep in the car for impromtu fishing trips . Rod sections jammed in place the fisrt time the rod was extended kind of defeating the purpose of a telescopic rod ! Returned for refund .
 I am really shocked with the poor quality of this rod , as I have other Shakespeare rods , I never expect they produce such bad ones .
 Had perchused one of these 15 years ago in a combo pack . That was a great little rod , i had cought up to 4ib smallies , then last summer it finaly broke . So I ordered up a new one . At fisrt was impressed by the revisions to the guides . much wider than my original one . I did relize that the pole was only 4ft not 4 ' 6 . I threw on my little Daiwa Crossfire . I get to the lake to pick up a few sculpin and brim . First cast the rod snaped in two , right in the middle . Didnt even get to reel in the line . Just splintered and snaped in two . Only had 1/32oz weight .
 After reading the good reviews on Amazon , I decided to buy this . I wanted to replace another broken telescopic rod that I have for 1 yr . I was using this for crappies . On my first try , a small one took the hook under the rock . I tried to pull it out , my first light yank broke the rod in half . And no , it did n't get stuck under the rock . It is worst than the ten dollars rod that I bought in Best Buy . Yes , you heard right , Best Buy . They are not a sport retailer and they sell better cheap rod . I was so upset that I took the broken rod and tied a line and a hook to it to continue fishing . I ended up catching 10 crappies that trip with a broken rod . But seriously , BUY SOMETHING ELSE !!!
 Do n't buy this product ! I just received mine and neither the description nor the picture matched what I received . The handle is different and the guides are chrome without ceramic inserts . Beware .
 I thought this would be an awesome rod to keep in my truck so if I wanted to stop and fish after work I could just pull this out . Well the second time I used it it broke . What I thought was a beautiful cast ended with the top two feet of rod flying through the air . Do n't buy it cause if you do you will regret it .
 Pros : - super-light and sleek design - pretty good action - nice handleCons : - not very durable - it broke during the first bend -LRB- at about semi-circle , which should be more than OK for carbon rods -RRB- - Shakespeare warranty is pointless , as the they want you to pay for shipping the broken rod and attach check for $ 9.95 to send replacement . This way they get away with cheaper rods never replacing them , probably . People like me will go and buy a new one of needed.Overall - good for beginners , kids or when you need packing flexibility , but if you 're serious about some bigger fish that will bend your rod to a semi-circle when fighting , do not buy this one .
 This is a flimsy little rod . In the description it states that it is a medium action rod . In my personal opinion it is way more flimsy that any medium action that i have used . On a good note , it does break down very small , so it is easy to fit in a suitcase or under the seat of a car . Would be good for the occasional fisherman or a child who is learning how to fish . I would not recommend this product to anyone looking for a quality compact rod .
 I just received my 4 ' 6 '' ultra light telescoping rod . I ordered it to replace a similar rod that I have used for many years but lately had delaminated at the tip . This rod is nowhere near the quality of the previous one , although it should have been an exact replacement . As soon as I extended it , I could not get the last segment to retract . I have tried everything I can think of short of breaking the rod to get it to push back into the next section , but it is stuck like glue . Certainly not ceramic inserts in the guides . That is just false advertising ! Very cheaply made . I do not recommend it .
 My wife and I use `` telescopic rods '' for fishing out of our kayaks . This rod collapses to a good managable size , and is only 4 ' 6 '' extended -LRB- perfect for our use -RRB- . The problem is this item is described as having `` stainless steel guides with smooth ceramic inserts '' ! It absolutely does not have inserts , ceramic or otherwise !! This was one of the main reasons for buyingShakespeare Telescoping Spinning Rodthis rod over Eagle Claw 's `` Pack it '' . Very disapointing as this was bought for specific trip ; too late to get something else .
 Even the guides in the picture are not ceramic . They are very thin and look like they would put a lot of pressure on the line . I got an email back and they said I could pay for shipping both ways and they would give me my money back - not worth it.That was a couple months ago and they have still not changed the description . The rest of the rod is great but the guides ruin it .
 The description states : The Travel Mate comes with a seven-piece , 6-foot-6-inch medium-action telescoping rod , along with a size 35 graphite spinning reel with a single ball bearing and line . The rod and reel cast just like one - and two-piece rods , but collapse into a 15-inch footprint for storage in the handy Travel Mate case . The case also includes six built-in , adjustable storage compartments for your tackle , so you do n't need to bring along a separate tackle box.When ordered I only received the telescoping rod.NO size 35 graphite spinning reel with a single ball bearing and line.NO handy Travel Mate case.NO case that also includes six built-in , adjustable storage compartments for your tackle .
 I never got a chance to use this as the threads cracked off when I went to put my trigger reel on it . Made of very cheap plastic . Possible it was a defective unit and others may have been okay . I just did n't want to waste anymore time on it as I found a nice 2 piece rod to replace it .
 Cool idea and I was thrilled to find something for my husband to organize his stuff but it does not stay put with leather car seats -- the base slides out .
 Being an avid bass fisher and having owned this rod for one fishing season and having used it for several outings , I have to say that this is one of the very few casting rods on the market that meet all the following criteria
 At $ 39 buck , this is neither the cheapest or most expensive . But the quality is typical . Made in China stuff . Nice box , but the stuff inside is Junk Quality , parts are loose and flimsy . Worth only $ 19.99 in my mind , so this only a 2 Star rating.Setting up the Net , was easy but the stretch line holding everything together BROKE . I should have taken the Product back for exchange , but I repaired it . I give this product a few months of use , before it falls apart . Also , sticking it in the ground was difficult . It should have a GRAB handle or foot support to assist applying pressure to stick it deep in the ground . HOLDING the shaft with you hands and pushing is not easy ... dumb design . Too Basic for a $ 40 buck . ** Star
 This is a total hunk of junk . Does not stay in the upright position and is poorly made . DO NOT BUY
 Do not even try ... horrible costumer service trying to return this item . Finally contacted by a very rude person that kept on lying to me about their attempts to contact me . They finally did once I filed claim .
 Knife bent back completely at pivot point . Edge was so dull that it could n't cut through an apple w/o stabbing the tip in first . Light flickers when on , has poor battery connection . Sometimes turns off without warning .
 The rod title does not match the picture . The picture shows a casting rod not a spinning rod as stated in the title and The the model number is not a Shakespeare number . The correct model number is UCSP110280 . The review from October 2011 states the description and picture do not match . Amazon has had eight months to fix this problem and has not . I 'm getting tired of doing Amazon 's job by encountering these inaccuracies , researching the manufacturer 's websites to find the correct information and trying to get Amazon to fix the information so I know I 'm ordering the correct item .
 The text says it 's a spinning rod , but the photo shows a casting rod . So which is it ? This is obviously a mistake , but should have been proof-read more carefully . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 I just received this can , and while it is nice enough , it does not remotely resemble the image posted here of a black can with a large A symbol.It is red , with a bat and baseball background .
 I bought this cushion to start practicing meditation once again . I remembered from many years back that I had used a round thick cushion that helped me avoid my legs from getting numb . So this cushion looked similar and the reviews suggested that people thought it was comfortable . Unfortunately , the cushion is too firm . It feels like sitting on the floor with no mat . My butt has gone numb every time I tried using it . After reading a review that said you could take out some of the buckwheat to make it more comfortable , I adjusted it twice but still got the same numbing result . I 'm returning this cushion and will look for some softer , thick option .
 I purchased two of these , put water in them , upended them , and watched the water drip out the sports top . I do n't need yet another leaky container . A total waste of money .
 With all the recent coverage on how China does not regard our safety in the least , I find it incredible that a product designed to keep us away from plastics and `` safe '' is made in China.I 'm getting a SIGG bottle . I will not support a country that could care less if my kids are safe or not !
 I LIKE THIS ITEM , BUT SWEATS WITH COLD WATER , ALSO DOESNT KEEP WATER VERY COLD . . BUT IF YOU JUST WANT WATER IN STAINLESS STEEL INSTEAD OF PLASTIC ITS A GREAT OPTION .
 The lock itself works as expected but the EZ Mount is not `` EZ '' at all . Removing it is a pain -LRB- that is if you manage to get it off without breaking it -RRB- . It also keeps the lock kind of far -LRB- about half an inch or so -RRB- from the bike , which will be very inconvenient depending on where you install it . I returned it and will look for a model with a better mount .
 I bought this bike lock two times . The first time it was great , the size was perfect . But I stopped using my bike in winter . When I came back to my bike in the spring the lock had frozen . Since my bike does n't fit with the regular dimensions I had to buy an 11 '' bike lock again . I got this one again , forgetting to read the reviews , and when I came back to it again after my winter break it had frozen again . Do n't waste your money !
 Bought this watch 34 days ago . Just 4 Days after return period expired the watch died . Just stopped working . Now I have to work thru the product warranty to get it fixed or replaced and that is a much more complicated process . Very unhappy for this type of watch to die in 34 days .
 ... . purchased this for college student gifts ... . all said , `` hey , send something else , these do n't work . ''
 I was under the impression that I was ordering a NEW book . This book has definitely been used . The binding is worn , the corner of the book is bent and the pages look old . This was supposed to be a birthday present , and will not be given as one .
 The photo shows princess Jasmine but the product we received did not have Jasmine at all . Jasmine was the only reason we ordered these as our daughter is obsessed with her and specifically told Santa she wanted Jasmine big girl panties . She was disappointed when Santa did not leave her any Jasmine panties .
 The worst I 've seen . Sprayed around the house , carpenter ants still come in . I sprayed directly on ants , and the ants seemed dazed for a little bit , then shook it off and back to walking at normal speed . It says `` kill on contact '' , but it does n't work for me at all . I do n't know , maybe if I spray enough on the ants , it will drown them ? I am going to try another brand . I just hope the ants have n't build a nest in my house .
 I ca n't believe this product is still around . I 've tried it twice at triple the strength recommended on the label to kill carpenter ants . I sprayed it directly on them and they swim in it , then still go about their business infesting more.Worst pesticide on the market.The only thing this will kill is the money in your wallet.LESS than 1 star . Is zero available ? Bayer should stay selling aspirin or maybe this is their secret weapon to get you to buy more . Because if you try to kill ants with this product you will need bottles of aspirin .
 I just got a pair of these Cheng Shin tires for a Schwinn Breeze 3-speed and they are the worst ! They absolutely will not mount properly . The bead will not sit right so they are , no matter what we do , lopsided . I got a set of Kenda 's 26 x 1 1/4 tires , on the other hand , and they are very good for the money.By the way , I 'm not just ragging on Cheng Shin tires . I have a set Cheng Shin tires for my 27 '' Schwinn and I love 'em . It 's just the 26 x 1 1/4 one that suck .
 Low quality that out of the box did n't ride right . Never could get brakes or gearing to work properly . Rusting on all exposed chrome areas . Spend the extra money and buy a Schwinn . I should have done that originally .
 What a waste of money . There was a problem with the bike initially ; had to bring it to a bike shop to get it put together because of that ; turned out there was a part that was stripped . Had the part sent , but had to pay an extra $ 70 to get it put together . Was ridden once after being fixed , and another part broke . Had THAT sent , and another $ 70 to get it fixed again ; same thing happened the second time it was ridden . NOT worth the money to purchase . Ugh .
 AT PURCHASE TIME
 After purchasing this watch as a replacement for one of my other watch 's I kept it in a drawer for a few months before my other watch died . I love watch 's with both analog & digital time keeping capabilities . As an EMT I love the second hand on watch 's . However after my first watch of 3 years died -LRB- a walmart special -RRB- I put this one into use . After 11 days I noticed it was broken . Apparently while I was washing my hands the button to set the analog watch fell off and water made it into the watch . For 100 m water resistance it did n't last a simple hand washing let alone anything at depth . Very upset especially after hearing Timex 's logo for years . My first and last Timex I will ever buy .
 I have had three of these . everyone of them broke with in 3 months.first one , the digital went wacky and wouldnt work properly any more . i did a walmart exchange in it and got another this one had the analog adjustment pin fall out and fill with water . thinking it was just a fluke , i got yet another one via walmart exchange and again , the adjustment pin fell out.also the plastic adjustment bezel paint flaked off with in 2 weeks on ever one of them ive had . it wasnt a big deal because the color plastic its made of is the same color as the paint , but its still worth notingi love this watch and wanted very desperately for it to be good , but alas , it disappointed me not once , not twice , but 3 times before i finally said screw it and gave up on the exhanges .
 I bought this Timex Expedition to replace an Expedition that I 've had for 6 + years . My old one was sturdy and surprisingly took more than one bump I never expected . This one lasted less than a week before I broke off the crown -LRB- to set the time -RRB- when I was simply reaching into the refrigerator . I thought about making a warranty claim , but the apparent impact was just hard enough to scratch the plastic barrier designed to protect it . I could n't believe it . My last one did n't have the barrier , likely because it did n't need it . Timex has seriously sacrificed quality in pursuit of keeping prices low . I ordered a Casio G-Shock to replace my Timex .
 Ordered a Timex watch . Watch broke after one month . Emailed the company with no response . Will never buy from this vendor again . Big waste of time and money .
 I have always purchased Timex watches for my husband . He has always preferred them to any other watch brand . This watch was terrible , it does not keep time at all . He says that the watch is the worst ever . The Velcro does n't even stay shut and it feels cheap .
 The watch feels like a cheap $ 5 Walmart special and the band is very uncomfortable . It does it 's job , but really is n't the best option out there
 Velcro band has very small area of contact , so comes undone when swimming.I had this for about 6 months & it died . Only used in the pool , does n't appear to have any moisture in it , never depressed buttons underwater , does n't appear to be flooded or have moisture in it.Has features desirable for swimming & diving -LRB- SCUBA -RRB- such as large , easy to read dial , digital `` back-up -LRB- yet again , digital , back-lighting & analog quit all at the same time , so glad this happened on land -RRB- & that I never used it for diving.I 'm going to look for the old-style , single-button Casio watches that last roughly 5-6 years with extensive diving to 160 ' , routinely to 70 ' . I may have gotten a defective watch , but not impressed that both analogue & digital died together . I 'll be looking for a watch with a true back-up function or a very plain , simple watch again that 's more reliable for a back-up for my bottom-timer .
 This watch had everything I could need in a watch , but after changing the time for daylight savings the digital wo n't work anymore . The light button wo n't even work . I have had this watch for barely 4 months and now for 5 days my watch stays on 3-7 SA . The alarm goes off every morning at 8am . I never set it to . I ca n't change anything but the analog time . Thankfully it still runs .
 This is NOT a man 's watch ! The watch and the band are so small they would not even look masculine on a Homunculus ! And unlike the picture , the band is not a cloth weave . It is that cheap nylon with Velcro `` fur '' all around it . Looks stupid and is uncomfortable as all get out !
 I had this watch for about 2 years then the digital stopped the hands tick but the digital stopped not button response ... nothing . I thought timex were supposed to keep on ticking >> > LOL . I also feel that the hands were a it wide hart to see the digital part from any thirty . . i.e. . . 4:30 , 5:30 , 6:30 . . The hand block alot of the tiny screen . I like the band as others stated it was very comfortable . But he the whole watch feels chincy . the silever part that spins on top is very plastic , I wouldnt reccomend cause it broke . But maybe as a kids watch ?? /
 Timepiece delivers in terms of accuracy and wearability , very light . . Easy to read ... not that easy in the dark , the Indiglo has n't a very good performance ... Digital interface is not friendly at all , very hard to handle.I got to the pool , no buttons pressed and it got a lot of water inside , in a way that when wearing it you could see drops on the inside of the glass ... If you can afford something better -LRB- or a Casio -RRB- go for it . .
 Advertised as mens watch , but band was a max of 7 '' long.Watch came unmounted & loose in the box & with no instructions of paperwork.I rate this purchase a dead zero .
 overpriced for a cheap watch , feels cheap and the digital did not work upon receipt . Much better timex watches available for lower prices . this one looked rugged but was light and cheaply made . embarrassing for timex Im sure , must have been a chinese knockoff .
 My son uses this for his school books and by the 3rd day , the fabric had frayed and the rope came through the hole .
 These sound like something you would want in your arsenal , with all the supposed amazing scent-releasing stuff , but in my experience they basically suck . The 3 '' model with a even a small jig head has zero tail wiggle , and it 's not because of the jig head . Just stiff . It 's like dragging a little stick through the water with no fish-like action -- and no fish caught . The 4 '' model is slightly more flexible , but performs the same , mainly because these are not rubber , and they develop a `` memory '' while in the package , so if the tail is in a twisted or off-center position when in the package , it 's twisted/off-center when you take it out , with no wiggle at all , and it stays that way . Basically a larger stick-like thing.I 've tried several Gulp products , but have never caught a fish with any of them . -- This is a follow-up , since I usually find my first reaction to things like this to be wrong . However , in this case I still hate these things after trying them a few more times . They are going in the trash . I do n't mean to condemn all Berkley products ; I like the PowerBait pre-rigged little fish-looking things at Wal-Mart -LRB- caught a lot of fish with them , especially the ones with some color to them -RRB- , and I know people who claim some success with various Gulp ! products , but I still say these particular lures suck out loud , despite reviews I read online about how great they are . OVERPRICED STICKS WITH NO TAIL WIGGLE is what they are .
 These bottles are a cheap knock off of the Klean Kanteens ... and are selling for the same price as the original that is of much better quality ... . DO NOT BUY
 I bought this rod for exactly what it is supposed to be for ... catfishing . It turns out that although it is long enough for long casts it is way too weak to do it . It is also very awkward to retrieve a large fish with it as it flexes so much . If you really want a rod that will do well from Shakespeare look at the Ugly Stik Tiger or Tiger Lite . These rods are well worth the extra money and still very affordable .
 Nippers blades didnt line up . The ad fails to mention that these are only 12 inch nippes , and best used for minis or small ponies . I do not recommend these be used for a riding horse or anything larger . Even though I havent used my nippes yet I doubt that they are as sturdy as the ad says because they dont line up . Like I said they would be good for a mini .
 The pic of the blue pair was wrong ... I recieved a red and black pair ... but other than that it is a great product .
 I purchased six of these chairs in August for myself and my friends before the start of the college football season for tailgaiting . They were all made by this manufacturer -LRB- North Pole -RRB- and had different NFL logos on them -LRB- I only bought one through Amazon , the others were bought through different companies due to availability issues -RRB- . At the first game of the season , my chair -LRB- Steelers -RRB- broke . At the second game of the season , two more chairs -LRB- Bengals and Broncos -RRB- broke . They were not misused and no weight limits were exceeded . They all broke in the same exact place ; the plastic pieces at the base of the legs all cracked . Therefore , 3 out of 6 broke within probably less than 3-5 hours.Needless to say , at $ 25 - $ 30 each I would recommend prospective buyers to spend their money elsewhere .
 I bought the light because it gets dark before I leave work . I commute 3 miles each way . I did n't want to use batteries so I tried this thing out.It is very difficult to figure out how to install the generator and light . The instructions are next to useless . I eventually found a blog article with some details , but it seems very few people have written about how to install it . Actually installing it is n't that bad , but it takes a long , long time to unravel the puzzle . I really do n't understand why they could n't include some instructions with pictures that made any sense . Also , the mounting hardware it comes with is minimal . If you can not hook up the light in the standard configuration , you will have to go buy some more brackets and such.The lights have no standing lights . That means when you stop , the lights go off . I have some blinking head and tail battery operated lights I use to be seen . It is a good idea to have backup lights , but basically it would be dangerous to use these lights alone because they go dark when you stop . Part of the idea was not to use batteries.The tail light mounts to the generator bracket -LRB- at least that is how I ended up installing it -- I ca n't tell from the instructions . -RRB- This makes it sit on my left side of the rear wheel . This gets blocked by the pannier bag on the right side of my bike , and if I put the other pannier on the left side the light would be totally blocked . I need to move it to a more sensible location , but I need to figure out how to mount it somewhere else -LRB- and buy a bracket , some wire , etc. -RRB- The generator does add a bit of effort when you engage the device . I have n't ever tried the expensive front hub generators , so I do n't know what to compare it to . It 's just adding a fair amount of work is all . I guess I am getting a better work out.It also makes a hideous sound that I would find unbearable if riding for fun . Right now I am too distracted by wanting to get home and out of the 20 degree F weather to care that much , but it would pretty much ruin a fun ride during the summer.The light itself projects a small rectangle bright enough to spot ice , pot holes , branches leaning into the bike lane , etc. . I have mine project about 20 feet in front of me . So it does do the job in fact -- just not when you stop.I looked into the front hub generators , but then you are looking at about $ 40 for spokes , $ 40 for labor to change the spokes , and $ 100 or more for the hub . Then you have to buy the lights . They are supposed to be silent and more efficient which would make up lots for the faults in this product . But that is a lot of money to spend . I might instead look into buying LED based rechargeable head lights now .
 I used this product on my light colored mare for cuts & scrapes . Although it worked ok on the scrapes -LRB- nothing special -RRB- , it WILL NOT come off ! I have tried everything to remove it to no avail . It has left crusty hard residue on the areas that were sprayed . My horse now has large dark , DIRTY looking spots all over her and no amount of washing with shampoo seems to phase it . Unfortunately , I would not EVER use this product again .
 My son uses this for his school books and by the 3rd day , the fabric had frayed and the rope came through the hole .
 Paying nearly 800 dollars for this is downright sinful . There is no possible way anyone should waste that type of money on a bait casting reel . Perhaps if you were out fighting world class tuna and marlin this would be a price to pay , but for the type of fishing this is made for , 750 dollars is robbery.I 've had calcuttas before and have owned this one , but only paid 175 dollars for it . Seeing this on here for 750 dollars makes me a bit upset.Sure Calcutta is a wonderful reel and is one of the best bait casting reels on the market , but 750 bucks ? Gimmee a break.There are other Calcuttas on this site in the 170-200 range that are just as good as this reel . I smell a scam in the making here , so do n't get robbed , go find a cheaper reel .
 When I received this package , I felt cheated . There is only 16 hooks in the pack of what 's supposed to be 25 .
 i live abroad , for that i could n't make a complain at time , my surprise was that i bought mtb grips in RED and they sent BMX grips in BLUE !!!! obviously i stored in one closet because i do n't know what to do with them ... i prefer think that was a mistake ... the product was wrong ...
 When I received this product , the grip was already dirty and it is very hard to put it on a bike . It get dirty very easily . I do n't recommend this product .

 Nothing wrong with the wobbler itself ; however , the amazon ad did n't make it clear that it would n't work on the Do-All automatic thrower .
 I have never seen such cheap manufacturing practice as in this product . I liked the feel and the color of these sweats but the ankle was a little tight so I decided to make them straight leg . Upon opening up the seam I found a rubber band on both legs . What happened to elastic ribbing ? About a week later the draw string came unstitched in the back and came out making me more irritated . I tossed these sweats . I remember Russell having good quality back in the 90s ! What happened ?
 Not correct size . I have several pairs of these sweats . Gave to friend . Will not order items from this store again , because they may be selling rejects . Do n't know for sure .

 A Previous review stated that this item is `` way small . '' I would instead say that it is terminally miniature . When I got my box from amazon I though that they had forgotten to pack my new targets because , I thought , there is now way that it could fit in such a small box . I was wrong . It can because the package is about the size of a medium sized hard bound book . That means that the actual targets are even smaller and smaller they are . The packaging says that you should stand 30 yards away as a minimum shooting distance . I would be surprised if you could even see it at that distance let alone hit an individual target , which are the size of a large peach pit . If you actually can shoot the eyes out of a cow 100 feet away with a pellet gun using only your iron sights then you are the one man that Chuck Norris is afraid of and probably do n't need this product for practice . In summary , It 's small -LRB- 9x12 inches -RRB- , the targets are smaller -LRB- 1.75 inches across -RRB- , and its cheap in quality -LRB- I think it 's metal but I do n't care because it flops around in a way that makes me feel cheated and it looks like it was painted by grade-schoolers . -RRB- The picture on the web page makes it look big , like you have to drive it into the ground with a large hammer when you could probably just push it in with your foot . I gave it 2 stars instead of one because -LRB- 1 I really should have known better and done more research before I bought it , and -LRB- 2 if you get closer than the box says is safe you might have a chance and it might be fun instead of tormenting . Bottom line
 Way small you have to lay on the ground to shoot . Poor choice My son didnt care for it at all it is still in the box not used
 Could n't believe how toy-like this target turned out to be . It 's very small . Very . And the if you place the sides into the ground , you 're down at squirrel level trying to aim .
 This product was very misleading due to its picture ... this item was very small and does n't hold up very well after a couple of shots paint and the cheap stickers fly off ... the only good thing I got from this target was better aiming because it was super tiny ... lol
 Sweatshirt faded in the first wash and the band around the bottom of the sweatshirt is extremely small and does n't match the actual size of the sweatshirt . Lettering is already starting to crack after one wash . Wo n't be wearing the sweatshirt . Money down the drain .
 Got this for my 11 year old son for Christmas , and made him so frustrated . Looks great , has cool appeal to it , the bezel is giant - but when it comes down to it , the months are near impossible to read.The grids are distracting . The rotating face blocks the hour and or the minutes . It seems this is a `` night sky guide '' with no way of getting it lit in the dark to see where to turn the bezel . As a compass ? Well , if you were lost in the daylight ... good luck since the watch is made as a night time constellation guide . He wants to send this back asap . Might be cool for a student studying the sky , but not for a kid , who thought this could be a cool and useful tool .
 Was cool , really . I thought it was , anyway . But yeah , it sucks . The clock is kind of off , the planishpere thing sucks too . If you really want to know what 's in the sky , there 's an app for that DROID phone where you can point it to the sky and it 'll tell you which stars/planets/celestial bodies are . Way neater than this . Do n't bother buying this unless you have cash to spend and want to check this out.Honestly , I just gave this away instead of throwing it away .
 I do n't see the point in having a reset arm if they dont stay up anyway . We had it mounted on flat ground . We could n't stake it down so we used a steel beam which held it down firmly . Shot about 150-200 rounds at it and all of the paint came off.Again , at most you might get 2 arms up before they will all fall down . They are n't machined well , sometimes they will overlap or just flick sideways when you shoot em instead of flipping . The instructions were very small and confusing . Ended up figuring it out on my own.Overall , I like being able to see when I hit it , if it does n't go up , it at least swings back amd forth . It definitely does n't work as well as described . Not bad for $ 25 . I would much rather have one of the $ 60 - $ 80 trees but I bought a red dot sight instead .
 After 3 shots all the roll pins fell out.Spend a few extra bucks and get a setup of higher quality !
 Doesnt work very well will not reset tried adjusting cleaning different ranges and bullets built very well just doesnt work .
 Using Thunderbolt .22 LR at about 25 yds ... First time at the range , several roll pins came out . Called the company . They sent me only four extra roll pins and told me to use Loctite on them . Second time at the range a couple more came out , and I ca n't find matching roll pins at the local hardware store . Metal appears to be rather soft as well . Waste of money .
 I bought this item about a week ago . I took it out for target practice and after about 50 shots the piece to keep it from flying all the way around on each one has broken . the metal is bending and paint is chipping fast ! dont even bother putting the yellow stickers on they will be gone within the first few shots
 I received this target for a gift after placing it on my Amazon wish list . It was easy to assemble . I placed it at 30 yards and shot it with a 10 round clip from my Rugar MK III Comp . It fell to pieces on the very first use . The pins used to keep it together were laying on the ground around it as the target arms fell to the ground . I took it to my shop and pushed them back in attempting to secure them a bit more than they had come . Once again I took it to the range and unloaded a clip . Once again it fell apart . COMPLETE JUNK .
 There is a part missing in the package , without that particular washer you wo n't be able to assemble the target to function in a satisfactory way . I have called their customer service number but no one answers the phone . I have already sent Two emails to their customer service department and no answer yet . Stay away from this POS company and buy something better .
 The numbers matched up to what I purchaced but the picture did not . The picture and discription was a different product . I emailed the seller with pictures and description and they never got back . I paid $ 20 for a $ 14 product I could of gotten at Walmart .
 I had high hopes for this target , but it proved to fail to excited my crowd consisting of myself , my wife , my two boys and several neighbors .
 this target is very small . However the quality of the system is ok and the metal used seems very durable dont be fooled by the legs . its only 16 '' high .
 This is okay , except it is very small , much smaller than it would seem in the picture . I was disappointed when I saw the size . It probably says the size somewhere , but the picture sure makes it seem bigger . I bought this at Christmas and am writing the review in May , so I do n't have it here to measure , but I think it was about the size of a laptop .
 This item is not at all what I expected . It is so small that it almost rests on the ground and jumps in the air and falls over when hit . The individual targets are also very small . Looks like it would be better with a bb gun than a .22 . I think it is overpriced for what it is and does n't do the job it says it can do .
 This is , by far , the biggest POS target system available on the market today ! All the bushings were very sticky even at the lightest setting . Brought it out today for its first test . Two of the six targets broke their welds after the first few shots . Do n't waste your time or money on any Do-All target products . I can only imagine all of them suck as bad as this one .
 Followed all their restrictions and it still lasted one outing before it had to be welded back together . Do n't bother . The designated pistol 38-44 is built heavier then this one . One of the paddles came completly apart with a cast bullet from a .45 auto at 30 yds .
 First day of use at a little over 100 yards with soft nose 115 grain bullets out of a 7.62 x39 -LRB- a lot milder than the advertised 9mm to 30-06 -RRB- a round hit the tatget a little on the inside and it cracked like an egg at the hinge , destroying the bushing that holds the target to the tree . . I wrote Amazon and I am expecting to hear from them as far as warranty or other remedy , hope they do honor to their name .
 It is advertised to withstand 30-06 , but after two boxes of soft-nosed 30-30 @ 100 yds two of the targets had fallen and the rest were showing extremely heavy bending and indentations , just about to be perforated by the bullets , a 30-06 will for sure pass through these like cardboard ... . Guess it is only for .38 spl , .380 and alike ...
 We were excited to try out the dueling tree but the first round in dueling using 9mm @ 25yds , we shot off one of the petals . Looking at it , 3/4 of the cross-section at the fracture was already rusted so it had to have been cracked before I bought it . Ok , I 'll have to get it exchanged . It was the second from the bottom so we decided to still shoot a couple rounds just using the upper four petals . After 2 or 3 rounds , we looked at it again and two petals had there welds broke where the petal attaches to the base . Also one of the tubes that the petals are welded to was cracked . So after about 50 rds of 9mm we had broke two different welds , cracked a tube , and broke off a petal . 9mm @ 25 yds would n't even consistently spin the petals at the lowest spring setting so I 'm not sure how this is expected to hold up to the advertised caliber sizes .
 I made the mistake of thinking `` I 'm just going to shoot a .22 lr at it ... even if all the reviews are true , it should hold up to that ! '' . False . Even when I was puting it together right out of the box , I snapped two of the bolts in half while tightening them . Everything -LRB- the feet , the bolts , the spring and cam mechanism that makes the targets swing properly -RRB- is made of the cheapest metal Do-All could find to build something like this . I 'm pretty sure my pellet gun would destroy this target . Do not buy anything from Do-All if this is any indication !
 Not worth it at all . Took it out once , shot it with the approved lead semiwad cutter .45 s and .357 s and it sheared almost every pattle on the back . The little bolts came out and have sheared as well . Better suited to shoot a .22 at and just watch the paddle wiggle .
 Purchased this a few years ago and it has never worked correctly . Does not flip with 9mm , 10mm , 40 , 45acp , 45 long colt -- only moves half way and not a full reset flip . Not enough tension adjustment to make it work . Tried multiple different oils to free it up -- nothing helped . Do n't waste your money on this !
 we received the box on a wednesday ; assembly took about 15 min . and was fairly easy to do . the next saturday we took the target out to the desert to shoot . we shot only pistol rounds at the target beginning with .22 s and going up to .40 S&W . the target functioned as designed about 90 % of the time ; sometimes when a bullet struck the paddle the paddle would not rotate to to the other side and would stay in the middle , requiring stoppage of firing and hand re-setting . after we shot 500 rounds of 9mm and .40 s & w rounds we changed the tension of the paddles so we could use .22 s and noted three of the six paddles had cracked mounting hinges . the cracks are wide enough to stick a fingernail in and run the length of the hinge ; since the paddles and hinges are 1-piece all three paddles need to be replaced . i do n't want to see what the hinges look like after another 1000 rounds of usage so this bad boy is getting returned and we 're buying a better quality target . happy shooting !
 I have never seen such cheap manufacturing practice as in this product . I liked the feel and the color of these sweats but the ankle was a little tight so I decided to make them straight leg . Upon opening up the seam I found a rubber band on both legs . What happened to elastic ribbing ? About a week later the draw string came unstitched in the back and came out making me more irritated . I tossed these sweats . I remember Russell having good quality back in the 90s ! What happened ?
 Not correct size . I have several pairs of these sweats . Gave to friend . Will not order items from this store again , because they may be selling rejects . Do n't know for sure .
 Arrived incorrectly assembled and with no obvious way to correct it . Manufacturer does not respond to email requests for assistance . Instructions specify that target must be at least 30 yards from shooter . That 's an absurd restriction on what is supposed to be a handgun target , where typical practice or competition distances are less than 50 feet .

 This thing is deceptively small , like less than 2 '' wide . It wears out very quickly ... you might get a few days of sparks , then it 's gone .
 The first time I used it ; I put it on and swam a few laps , And then one of my friends said `` hey look at your cap '' . I took it off and it went from a color white to an stained awful mustard yellow ... I do n't recommend this product for anyone .

 PROS : - Good looking watch.-Fairly easy to use.-Love the fact that the watch face is twisted to make viewing it while I run easier.-The watch 's wrist band held up well , unlike the Swiss Army watches I 've had crack on me.CONS : - After only a month 's use , the plasic wrap that encases the watch itself started to detach and warp . It appears as though it was simply glued to the metal part of the watch . It 's now so warped that it looks terrible and makes it difficult to press the buttons along the side.-At 18 months , the watch has bugun to collect moisture inside . From diving deeper than its 100M rating , you ask ? No , from sweat and shower water . The digital display is now failing and I 'll soon have to throw the watch away like a piece of trash . That 's just unnaceptable , Nike .
 I like the watch and I use it on all my runs , but I never use all the features because the directions were so complicated that it 's hard to remember what button should be pushed when running on top of the fact that the reset button is poorly places , so once you get everything going as you want you stand a good chance of erasing your progress . Perhaps , I do n't really need this much watch , but it would be nice to easily use the features I 've paid for . The watch itself however looks nice on and is comfortable .
 This watch did n't work when I got it and then Amazon did n't have anymore of them when I returned it . Stay away ; get a Timex Ironman instead .
 I bought this item in hopes of an easier/faster cleaning experience but it proved to be not the case . There is still plenty of grim between my chain links although the outer parts of my chain are quite clean . This chain cleaner cleans only slightly better than using a rag to grip your chain only because the brushes would occasionally scrub off some grime so I can not recommend this to anyone who has to clean their chain regularly . Stick to quick daily rag wipes/lube or take the chain off and use a cheap stiff brush after some soaking in your cleaning solution .
 I 've owned three of these cleaners . They do a real nice job of cleaning the chain . The biggest problem I had with all three of the units is that they start to fall apart after only a few uses . Two of the units either the hinge point or latch point or both for the two metal clips break away leaving you unable to lock the top to the body . I only use the Park brand of chain cleaner . The third cleaner the actual cleaning brushes fell apart.I 've ordered the Finish Line chain cleaner . I 'll post a review of that product after I have used it for a period of time .
 I 've used chain cleaners before , so I was very disappointed when it broke during its first use . It does thoroughly clean the chain , but the clips that hold the lid in place are ` WAY too tight . If you buy one , you may want to relax the wire clips before use . I will replace it with Nashbar 's chain cleaner . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 Are those 5 star reviews are real ? I made a decision to buy this product based on the reviews . This is a piece of junk . This is so poorly made . Both side of hinge points for the two metal clips broke making me unable to lock after 1st use . This means i can not use this any more . Yes I used this only once for less than 5 minutes . I do not recommend this product to anyone at all . By the way this is my first review at Amazon . I felt obligated to warn potential buyers how poor this product is . I buy stuffs from Amazon all the time , and this product is the worst I have ever purchased through Amazon .
 It works so so , but you could obtain the same results just by spraying on a solvent and using a $ 2.00 parts cleaning brush . I also found that just spraying the chain with an autmotive brake cleaner works just as well . This item is a waste of money .
 I have owned two . They work well , but if you drop them from ~ 3 feet -LRB- the height at which you will use it on a bike stand -RRB- they break . Each broke on the first drop . This would be a good product if they simply made it out of a less brittle plastic . It is a tool and tools get dropped .
 I do n't know , maybe having nylon bristles sticking out of your chain will help with traction on gnarly inclines ... personally , I do n't need it.Yes , this thing cleans chains nicely -- it leaves them nice and bristling , rather than glistening.After enough uses , I wonder whether there will be enough bristles left on the cleaning wheels to do the job.Caveat emptor , big time .
 I like Park Tool ; most of their tools are top quality . I had a much older model Park Tool chain cleaner back in the early 90 's . It was messy and the retaining spring broke after a few uses.I had a Pedro 's Chain Machine
 Can not complain about the saddle itself . It fits nicely up against my M2 and holds shells well . I had zero problems with the install and it was a nice touch having the right allen wrench to install all the hardware -LRB- 1 large bolt and 6 smaller ones -RRB- . However , after no more than 100 rounds , the large bolt holding the saddle onto the gun was sheared off from recoil . I am a little disappointed that I now have to take a trip to the hardware store to fix something I feel should have held up a little longer.Would recommend this product , but do n't be surprised if you actually use your gun and the hardware does n't hold up .
 While I like the fact this is an all cotton fleece and its full-zip design , the cloth is too thin for a fleece .
 This bike was absolute junk . It took 2 college grads about 2 hours to put it together , since the instruction book was very poor . The bike was very POOR quality & flimsy . The chain fell off almost immediately b/c the back gear was bent . The brakes would not work properly . Just very poor quality . Fortunately , our local Toys R Us store honored it as a return & we were able to exchange it for something else . Do not waste your time or energy ! We had a very disappointed little boy before we made the exchange .
 We bought this directly from the retail Toys R Us store -LRB- $ 79.99 -RRB- . Our 3 and 5 year olds loved the store display model , so we were happy to get the last one . But , the night before the 3-year old 's birthday party , we opened the box and tried to put it together . It had been previously returned , it was missing the instructions , the bag of small parts had been ripped into , and several pieces were missing . We now have to scramble to find something different . Shame on Toys R Us for re-selling items that are missing parts !!!
 I am not very pleased with this item . It works fine , but when I received it , it looked like it was a used whistle , the chrome paint was peeling off and did not have the appearance of tha new whistle . Sorry , just not pleased with it .
 was mounted properly and broke off at the handle bars in 6 days ... five of those days were rainy so what Im saying they broke the first day . .

 Do not even try ... horrible costumer service trying to return this item . Finally contacted by a very rude person that kept on lying to me about their attempts to contact me . They finally did once I filed claim .
 For the price , I was expecting a dozen lanyards , not one lanyard . I 'm not sure why green lanyards are so much more expensive than any other color . Very disappointed .

 After 5 months the back light went out . I 've had mine for 18 mos. , and the battery has gotten to where it wo n't hold a charge any more without being in full sun most of the day.I decided to give it another go because I love the atomic time feature . The new one fills with moisture . I 'll be looking for another brand . G-shock leaves a lot to be desired !!
 The Casio G Shock used to be a great watch !! I 've owned at least 5 of them over the years . -LRB- I climb telephone poles and go into manholes , so I 'm very hard on watches . -RRB- This one is a piece of JUNK !! So what , if it keeps Atomic time ? It requires light to charge the cell . I 'm not sure if an artificial light source will charge this watch . It did n't seem to charge mine . But , I do n't care . I 'll never buy a solar watch ever again !! The cell is less than a month old and it 's dead . Wait a minute , it 's charged up again . No , it 's dead again this morning.Someone else said it , `` there 's no countdown timer . `` The buttons are recessed , so unless you are a dragonlady with long fingernails , GOOD LUCK with the functions . Then there 's a feature that turns on the light in a dark place if you flick your wrist up to read the watch . The light comes on at all kinds of bizarre times when the lights are low and I 'm trying to watch something on TV . Then when I flick my wrist up in the dark because I need the light , it does n't come on . I have to push the light button . Someone said you can turn this feature off . That feature does n't work , because now the watch IS DEAD !! CASIO is NOW a BOTTOM LINE company . Their watches have gotten cheaper in quality over the years . The bands always need to be replaced and the watches are becoming JUNK !! I wo n't be buying a G Shock ever again !! Neither should you.BUY A TIMEX !! That 's what I did .
 I have owned G-Shocks for the past 13 years . This is my fourth watch . I found that with each new watch the quality of the product got worse and worse . This GW300 has been with me for the past 2 years . I love the watch but the back light is not working . So much for the solar panel ... This will be my last G Shock . Disappointed .
 Though rock-solid -LRB- I 've been bouncing it off my office wall for the last half an hour and it 's still not broken -RRB- the G-Shock 's solar batteries barely outlast the -LRB- one-year -RRB- warranty period . That 's not to mention that the replacement battery costs more than most watches . Now you see why I 'm bouncing it off the wall?Forewarned is on time
 Do n't bother . Got this for my son . Beeman has always meant quality air guns to me . This is garbage with the Beeman name on it . If you have a barn , and stand real close to the side of it , this gun will hit it . Outside of that , good luck .
 The problem with one-size-fits-all is poor fit for most . This helmet was too small for me and too wide for my teens .
 This helmet at first glance looks like a great value until ... you try to put it on , if you have a head that 's bigger than , say , a peanut . `` Universal Sizing '' is NOT universal in the case of this awfully designed product . Do n't buy it .
 I have never seen such cheap manufacturing practice as in this product . I liked the feel and the color of these sweats but the ankle was a little tight so I decided to make them straight leg . Upon opening up the seam I found a rubber band on both legs . What happened to elastic ribbing ? About a week later the draw string came unstitched in the back and came out making me more irritated . I tossed these sweats . I remember Russell having good quality back in the 90s ! What happened ?
 Not correct size . I have several pairs of these sweats . Gave to friend . Will not order items from this store again , because they may be selling rejects . Do n't know for sure .
 Trash !!!!! Junk !!! not worth the cardboard box it came in better off using the box and throwing the drink holder away .
 The fabric feels fake and it makes me itch , and the the inside material sheds for numerous washings -- I will never buy 50 50 blends again , 80 cotton 20 polyester is my new minimum -- The hoodie looks good but feels terrible .

 The SF keychain I received looks completely different than the item I ordered . The one pictured looks metal and the ring is attached to the side . What I received is rubber and the ring comes off the top . Definitely not worth the money I paid .
 I 've had the Nike Triax 100 for 6 weeks now and love everything about it . But while taking the watch off the other day , the wrist band strap came off from the watch . An examination shows that the plastic wristband is fastened to the watch with two tiny screws that while still secured to the watch , have pulled completely through the plastic wrist band . There was no reinforcement on the band ; just plastic . Of course this occured after the 4 week refund period . And the guarantee covers everything excep the battery , crystal and strap ... In the future I 'll examine Nike watches to make sure they have a real strap connected securely to the watch ...
 Just as the other reviewers said , the steel cross bar broke through the rubber band leaving me with a great pocketwatch but a poor wristwatch . The watch itself is great , and I 've had other great Nike watches , but the band is awful .
 I was very excited to find this watch because of the ` target ' time feature . The watch worked great until the watch band broke . I glued it because it was a great watch ... until the other side broke . Nike created a consumable watch . One year and you have to buy another watch . Terrible R & D.
 This whistle is junk . It is n't loud at all and you have to work a little to even get noise . I would not recommend it for self-defense , that 's certain .
 I received my whistle and `` Rescue '' is written in Red on one side . There was no information stating that there would be words on the whistle .
 Since the suggested retail for this Rapala fillet knife was about $ 30 I thought the knife would be exceptional -- longer than their usual fillet knife , more comfortable to work with , better quality or unusual appearance ; but that does n't seem to be the case other than a blade that is a bit more flexible . It is a fine fillet knife , but not much better than their standard knife at about half the cost .
 i bough this set of golf clubs , and they scratch very easily.the top part of the header on my driver flew off one day when i was hitting the ball . plus the shaft is not good at all either.not worth , the money , used clubs would work better .
 This is the article I ordered but received a old green Brewers shirt , I am in the process of sending it back . Please send the right one . I ordered a Milwaukee Brewers Navy Mock Turtleneck by Majestic , size medium with the -LRB- M -RRB- on the collar . The one I am sending back is from 10 years ago the logo is different and this shirt is green .
 Towel texture and design were great , but I was disappointed the towel was orange and not blue like the item image . The seller needs to change the image so buyers know what color they are buying .
 Nice looks and functions but due to the shape and button placement , the watch often changes functions from simple hand movements and that 's a problem when I 'm timing a run . The alarm bell is n't loud enough to wake me up even if I 'm wearing the watch . The little bump at the end of the band can make it a hassle to take off the watch .
 I placed an order on July 18th for Mau Jim Ka'anapali sunglasses though HDO sport , your only option on Amazon for Mau Jim . On the 21st I looked to check the status of my order and got a message from HDO saying I 'd get a response in one working day and asking for my ticket number . You are not issued a ticket number when ordering through HDO . Long story short on July 30th I got the first of several messages thanking me for my inquiry but with no response to my inquiry as to the status of this item -LRB- I was in the unfortunate position of not having sunglasses which was the only reason I looked quickly to get an order status -RRB- . On August 4th I got the first confirmation that my order was being shipped . Having not heard from HDO since the 21st I 'd already purchased the same sunglasses at a local store paying the same online price . The HDO glasses arrived August 7th . On that same day Amazon sent a Rate This Product note . I responded about the poor customer service from HDO by this time I was well into the process of waiting to get return order information and getting the non-response , response that my inquiry would be answered in ONE WORKING DAY -LRB- do n't believe it -RRB- . Within hours of submitting my rating I got an online respone from Alasdair McClean-Foreman , who seemed well intentioned , then came a call . Mr. McClean-Forman apologized for the poor service and asked if he could correct the problem AND would I be willing that day to change my Rating as it poorly reflect on his company with Amazon . I relayed my concerns about changing my rating until the problem of returning the sunglasses for a refund had been finalized . Mr. McClrean - Foreman offered to refund the price of the sunglasses AND offered a 25 % discount on any item I purchased that day . He was going to hand the matter himself . Again long story short . The credit was applied to my cc . I changed my response . I ordered a pair of Serengeti sunglasses then got a call from Alasdair that even though this product was shown as instock online HDO in fact did not have Serengeti sunglasses in stock -LRB- the same problem with my original order -RRB- . He asked that I purchase another pair of Maui Jim 's which I did . As of today August 26th I have a full price charge for the second pair of sunglasses on my credit card and am still in possession of the original pair of Maui Jims because I can not get a response from HDO to my request for a prepaid return stamp nor instructions as to how to return the product . There online customer service site is lacking.My direct inquiries to Mr McClean-Foreman are now being returned as undeliverable . My last note was sent August 20th asking them to respond to their latest EZ Service note telling me I would be contacted within One Working day . As of today August 26th I have one pair of sunglasses -LRB- original purchase price credited but unable to return -RRB- a second MORE EXPENSIVE pair of Maui Jim sungalsses charged to my credit card without the 25 % discount Mr. McClean-Forman promised to handle himself -LRB- he specifically directed me to place the order directly to him so he could handle the matter -RRB- . I 'd like to return both pair of sunglasses from HDO but am getting no response to any communication.DO NOT BUY FROM HDO SPORTS ! In good faith I changed my rating against my better judgement before the problems were resolved . I should have trusted my gut.STILL LOVE MAUI JIMS
 I purchased this watch on 8/6/08 . I am currently in Iraq and I needed a backup . I already own one similar to this one . I just wanted one on standby in case my battery died or another mishap . This watch that I purchased on Amazon died on 9/7/08 . It does n't work at all . I do n't know what happened . I only wore it 2-3 times because my other watch still worked . Watches are supposed to last longer than 30 days and this one did n't . I 'm not sure if its because I did n't buy it directly through NIKE or because I took the short cut . Nevertheless , I 'm still out of $ 40 + and I do n't have anything but a worthless watch to show for . I do n't recommend this product .
 RegrettablyI bought several CD Sports and all work , but this CDHave tried in every way to run it , but unfortunately it did not workYou experience the DVD player CD player on the computer and all the same it does not work
 Received `` plain wrap '' darts that came in a small white envelope . I intentionally ordered the ones in the photo -LRB- with Union Jack on them -RRB- .
 These set of darts look great on the picture and box . I do n't know too much about darts so I have no idea what kind of quality I was buying but for the amount I paid for the two set that I bought -LRB- which I do n't think it was cheap for a piece of plastic and metal -RRB- first day using them , one of them broke , falling from the distance between the dart board and the floor ... is it that high ? the plastic shaft just cracked right on the flight part -LRB- that dart has no use anymore -RRB- last night I played with my brother in law , seriously he broke three more exactly the same way and in the part of the dart . Very cheap materials . I never leave product reviews and never take the time but I was so dissapointed that I leave a review on this one.Sometimes they say `` what you pay is what you get ? '' not really because we went to Walt Mart to get a set since we could n't play anymore -LRB- since we broke four of the six I bought on the first day of using them -RRB- . We found a box of Halex Darts for $ 3 we used them all night and they lasted and did not brake . We also dropped this guys , did n't brake ... my little nephews also played with them , hitting the wall more than the dart board ... did n't brake . I guess the end story is the cheap darts did better than the more expensive ones . Do n't buy !
 this was n'ta good purchase . the skewed design made it feel like a big watch and it was constantly trying to prevent full flexibility of my hand backwards . it ended up breaking the pins . shame a sport watch to be cumbersome
 Tireflys has the worst customer service.I used to have a set for my car and bike , but the plastic broke so I settled forreplacing them with new ones.The new Tireflys did n't even work so I thoughtit was the battery , so I took it apart , and replacedthe batteries , but now the thing wo n't shut off ... All 6 of my Tireflys do not function correctly , and Tireflys refusesto contact me.They have become `` cheap '' in every way .
 Problem # 1The design stinks . It is impossible to move your hand without putting the watch into a reset mode , and loosing all of your settings.Problem # 2The watch I got broke 8 hours into use.Problem # 3The customer service on this watch is horrible . The company my watch was purchased from -LRB- This was not Amazon itself , but through Amazon to the company named WatchZone -RRB- was the worst I have ever seen.Here is WatchZone 's return policy
 The Doctor J shirt I ordered came as a Wilt Chamberlain shirt . Not happy with this at all and could n't return it because it came just before Xmas . Made do with what they sent me but wo n't buy from Amazon again .
 Bought them for recreation table tennis play . The rackets are a joke . Even for beginners they are pretty bad . Only a small patch in the middle has some bounce , rest of the racket is plain dead . Total waste of money . The rackets are going back .
 This set was supposed to come with eight 3-star 40mm ping pong balls but it did not . There were places for them in the plastic packaging but they were empty . The odd thing was that there is a plastic security cord that keeps the zippers closed so this error must have occurred at the factory . Returned for refund and ordered another one . Fingers crossed .
 If you are looking for high quality product , this is not it ! This is strictly for little kids ' entertainment to hit back and forth . The balls will not go very fast even if you hit it hard and it is hard to put any spin on the ball . Basically , the ball just goes flat . But considering the price for the set of 4 , it is a good deal . Just be aware of the quality you get for that price !!!
 I liked these paddles right out of the package . Looked and felt like a pretty good deal . Got them at Christmas time and they have been used a handful of times . We 're not thru February yet and the rubbers are peeling off the paddles . I was n't expecting great quality , but peeling after a few weeks is not acceptable . In the set of four paddles we have only used two of them and they are both peeling . It 's not a good value if it is trash this quickly . I guess paying more for better quality might end up being cheaper in this case .
 I received a 8 oz flask instead of the advertised 6 oz flask.The leather is cheap-looking . The regular , ground shipping cost was high , so I felt it would cost almost the same amount to ship it back as the product itself , so I kept it.However I wanted a smaller flask than received.I e-mailed the seller directly about these problems , but never heard back from them .
 This ad is very misleading I have written the seller and amazon so hopefully they will correct the information that will lead you to believe that this is a lure kit of some unknown quantity when in fact it is only one jitterbug and it 's the small one at that . The shipping is n't worth it .
 These skates was a size way to small . I call the company many times , and sent e-mails no one call back or e-mail me . I sent the Skates back , and guess what have n't heard anything . .
 The description of the product says it 's leather but when I received the product I discovered it was vinyl.Very Disappointed ...
 My buddy bought these hooks for our workouts to replace a different brand that had worn out . It took 4 years for the previous ones to wear out . These ones did n't make it one session ! The web site claims 1000 lbs EACH but I lifted less than 500 lbs and the hooks ripped from the wrist part.The company was quick at communicating with us , fortunately . We were told it was a manufacturing error and that the next ones would be stronger . Well , they came a few weeks later , and they were a little bit better.But they still ripped . And nowhere near 1000 lbs -LRB- or for two hooks , that * should * be 2000 lbs total -RRB- . After almost 2 months of not being able to work out at our max , my friend and I had enough . I will say that the company was very good at customer service , but this product just is n't ready for prime time .
 The picture indicates that you are buying a card of 10 lures at 99 % off the $ 299.00 price for $ 2.75 , I ordered 4 cards . What I got was 4 lures 1 '' long . The fact that they state original cost is $ 299.00 would be a lie if they were solid gold . First time I have ever been had by ordering from Amazon.They should sure dump this company .
 This might be a really good product . But we will never find out . Because it comes with `` directions '' that consist only of numbers and arrows . Apparently words are at a premium , because there are n't any . The arrows leave me spinning , and my tech-savvy children ca n't figure the directions out either , including on such basic processes as how to set the clock function . Which makes this product , well , pretty useless . It does have that cool Nike swoosh , though , and every evening at 10:28 p.m. it will look just perfect .
 i was vary appy to git this thing cuse it got to hit it wid a hamer win i got it it was cool win i got it . i got anudder after dat . after i loost all o da spits i fild plaztick bags wid my one spit . i dink it werkd bedder .
 I 've had this for over a year now . I bought it looking for wind protection and am very disappointed with the breathability of this product . It traps moisture inside and I end up with a visibly damp shirt and have to turn the jacket inside out to dry . That 's what happens in dry weather . The fit is comfortable and it 's otherwise conveniently designed . The fabric in white is quite see-through . Later I purchased Turfer 's `` Womens 's Light Weight Endurance Jacket '' for $ 14.95 and that 's been the perfect windbreaker . It 's now up to $ 19.95 and I 'm ordering another color .
 The way the add looked you were getting two LEATHER halters , you only get one . Plus it is not all leather .
 For the same price many other reels are much better than this one . In a month its drag was all gone . Backlash is normal no matter how experienced you are ... I will not buy Okuma again
 My son uses this for his school books and by the 3rd day , the fabric had frayed and the rope came through the hole .
 Despite their claim , these do n't float , and that 's the only reason I bought these . Lost one the first time I went out and I 'm still peeved .
 I got this as a fun gift for me and the wife . From the reviews , my expectations were low . When I began assembling it , the pieces that lock in the handlebars to the bike frame were broken . The actual pieces were machined incorrectly and the pieces were broken . I have to disassemble the bike and return it . Thank goodness Amazon made the return easy ... but this bike really was poorly made .
 Bike came mostly assembled . Could not get the gears to shift . Took it to a bike shop and he said that the cable to the rear derailer was twisted inside the cable . It was replaced and it seems ok now .
 We purchased the Kent Tandem Bike from Amazon.com , the bike came with a seriously bent rear wheel . We were not able to use the bike at all . After leaving several phone messages and e-mails -LRB- they never did answer my e-mails or return my phone calls -RRB- I finally contacted Kent . I was told I had to pay for the shipping of the bent wheel to them , then they would replace it after they received the bent one , and I had to pay for shipping the new one to me . I was not happy with this reply and was told by the company it was an Amazon.com problem . Cheers out to Amazon.com , they picked up the bike and refunded my account within a week !! Stay away from Kent International .
 The tire and inner tube of the bike arrived with a hole . It is obviously that there is no quality control before the bike is shipped . The company promised to ship a replacement set but a wrong one was sent . It has been four weeks and I am still waiting!The Assembly Instruction manual was a joke ! It fits may be 90 % of the parts actually received . Luckily , the assembly was rather easy .
 I ordered this bike for Christmas . It arrived on the 22nd and the pedals were missing !!! So sad . Called Kent customer support and they told me the would not Fed Ex me them for Christmas . One on the main reasons I bought the bike was the two day shipping . I ca n't beleive they would n't try everything at their disposal to send me the missing parts . Kent is not a good company . I will return the bike .
 This bike came without the handlebar for the back passenger . After calling the company 4 times I finally was told that they did not have the part and they did not know when they would . I was told to call back every month to check . It has been 3 months , no handlebar .
 upon receiving my bike the carton had been opened . After looking inside , the rear wheel was bent like a pretzel . Someone had obviously dropped the item on end and looked inside . I called for a replacement and had to pay for the damaged one to be picked up . We are still waiting for the second bike . Portland , Or .
 The bike arrived with black body in the center bike frame . It 's totally different color that what I expected from the photo , which is silver . After putting the bike together , I rode around the block and the front tire exploded . Bought a new tire tube and replaced it . I did n't bother to return the bike since there is too much hassle in packing and sending it . Overall , the ride is good , but the promised advertisement is misleading on the color . : -LRB-
 I still have high hopes for this bike , but was disappointed when I received it to find that the front forks were already bent thereby preventing installation of the front wheel . The plastic piece that would normally be inserted to protect the front forks and keep them aligned was floating freely in the box and was damaged itself -LRB- which is why it probably did n't stay in place to protect the bike . -RRB- I had to lug the large and partially assembled bike to a shop where they are attempting to fix it .
 Was it too much to expect that new bike will be flawless ?! Will not bother you with detailed story . Just shortly - knocking noise from the back while driving on specific gear -LRB- 4 -RRB- . Paid $ 80 to find and fix the problem in a bike shop -LRB- first I though it just need tune up -RRB- . No reimbursement from Kent for that , customers service just got me upset.Do not do the same mistake as I did . If something seems to be wrong after you assemble it , just send the defective bike back and hope the next one will be better . Do not pay for their bad quality assurance , let them pay !
 First bike arrived with the rear wheel bent at a 20 degree angle to the side due to damage during shipment . Returned it immediately and another was sent my way . When it arrived and we assembled it per the instructions , several things did not seem correct . We muddled through the terrible assembly instructions and then took it out for its maiden ride with only one rider . Upon shifting through the gears , the rear derailleur sheared in half and locked up all the rear tire , nearly throwing me from the bike . According to the bike mechanic at the local shop , the derailleur had been installed upside down at the factory -LRB- this was pre-assembled so not a part that we had to install -RRB- and led to the breakage of the part . It also bent the chain requiring us to purchase not only a new derailleur , but a new chain and labor for the mechanic to go through and check everything . He stated that the rear brakes were also installed upside down and he had to correct this as well -LRB- also pre-assembled at the factory -RRB- . I could and probably should have sent it back for a 3rd bike but did not want to put off riding it any longer so I went ahead and had them repair and correct the issues for an additional charge of $ 55 . Long story short , if you get this bike , take it directly to a licensed professional to ensure that it is safe for you to ride . I am very lucky that I was not thrown from the bike when the derailleur sheared off .
 When the bike came my son and I took it out of the box and began setting it up . When we came to airing up the tires part the front tire leaked big time . We took the bike to a local bike shop to have them check out the rest of the bike and they discovered that the rear rim was bent beyond repair . I contacted Kent and they would n't do nothing to correct the problem . I then contacted Amazon and told them what happened and they credited my account for the amount of the repair parts . High fives for Amazon and % ^ & # $ * & # to the Kent bike company .
 This is not a review of this bike in particular but it is a review of `` Kent Bicycles `` This was supposed to be a great Christmas gift for my son . I will condense the story so not to bore anyone . Took bike out of the box and began minor assembly -LRB- petals , handle bar , front tire -RRB- no big deal except there was a missing nut for the front wheel -LRB- now a big deal as the weather is beautiful and my son wants his new bike -RRB- -LRB- who wouldnt !?!?! -RRB- . Wait a week . Received incorrect parts -LRB- seriously ???? -RRB- . Installed a matching nut from a friends old bike -LRB- problem solved -RRB- . We took the bike outside , aired-up the tires and let him go -LRB- HOOORAY !!! -RRB- . He rode approximately 50 ft and shifted down to 1st gear to climb back up a small hill and a horrible crunching sound was heard . The derailer -LRB- sp ? -RRB- -LRB- the thing that changes gears on the rear wheel -RRB- caught on the spokes an now is twisted sideways and is lodged in the spokes . Called the manufacturer again . They said they would be happy to replace the damaged parts . I 'm not a mechanic no do I intend to learn to be one . I can handle some assembly but if the factory ca n't handle proper derailer installation , what makes you think I can ????? I told them this was not acceptable and I would like to return this bike for a replacement . The person on the phone said someone would call me back `` right away '' . They have my phone number and address and they have made no attempt to contact me as of this note -LRB- I have waited a week -RRB- . To sum it up , DONT BUY THIS BIKE !!! - DONT BUY ANY `` KENT '' BIKE unless you 're a mechanic and do n't mind fixing manufacturing problems .
 Received the shamino bicycle and in bold letters on the box MADE IN CHINA . I started to not receive it and have it returned . I took it home and was doing the minor assembly and noted the machining of the fasteners was terrible and the nuts were loose on the studs/bolts they were fitted on . Packaging was just ok ... there was a loss of paint on the seat post from rubbing something . the tires inflation is rated for 45 to 60 lbs . I was pumping up the rear tire after doing the front tire and got to the 45 lbs ok ... then got a loud pop and the tire blew out very loud . As i write this I do not think this bike was advertised made in china ... if you want a good dependable shamino bike buy a used one that was made in the USA . Amazon should not sell substandard made in china items ... I learned my lesson about Amazon and you should also .
 I just got the bike when I noticed that the back wheel had a little bent but did n't think it was anything that could cause a wreck . So my son and I went on I ride and we crashed when the back tire fell of . So my son got third degree burns from the tire scraping against his arm . I broke my Arm , Leg , And back and is now paralyzed . I can hardly do anything and i tried suing the company but they said that in the terms and conditions they mentioned that they are not responsible for any wrecks .
 I bought this watch for my son , who is almost 12 . It is nearly impossible to set it ... the instructions are VERY difficult to understand , and virtually worthless . I even took it to get a new battery and the guy told me it was one of the most diffcult watches to program he had ever seen . A cool watch ... but needs to be much easier to use , especially as it is aimed at kids .
 I received this watch for my birthday in June and it has already stopped working . It would n't stop making this buzzing noise . Something seemed to be stuck . When my mom took it to get it looked at it was going to cost more to fix it than to get a new one . No thanks ! I would n't get another .
 loved the idea of using this for my youngest daughter who is still a bit afraid to free swim/snorkel . It looked as if it would allow me to pull her along for a ride while all the time seeing a great view below . well right out of the box the window section leaked not allowing for extended usage -LRB- air bubbles collected in the window section -RRB- eventually the window that was leaking mostly popped out . this was all with kid-gloves light usage trying to protect the leaking window . I suppose that I could have glued the window at some point but ... never mind . the good news is my daughter learned to snorkle on her own ! I can thank the defect in this item for that ! Mine may have been a QC problem and the rest are fine but be forewarned , test yours immediately upon reciept for leaks/defects . Great idea spoiled by poor quality .
 There is a rubber strap around the top that holds the bottle in place . A tall bottle will not stay in the rack while riding without this engaged . Mine broke completely at about ride 10 . The hole in the rubber that you must use to catch in this hooked pin begans to rip out almost immediately . This whole operation is difficult to do while riding.Topeak is usually a decent brand . This product begins to break on the first use.Sure , after it breaks you can rig something that will kind of fix it if you 're handy but really the design should function without that for at least a year or two .
 My son uses this for his school books and by the 3rd day , the fabric had frayed and the rope came through the hole .
 I bought this for the same reason anyone buys this product and I was quite satisfied with the way it worked . HOWEVER -- please , save yourself the trouble I had and use it around a leg or an arm first . I had a severe allergic reaction to the neoprene and ended up in the emergency room .
 I am happy that the waist trimmer does burn the fat around your tummy and make you sweat but the overall package might last you about a good week before it starts to come apart . The price is under $ 10 but I still expected there to be better quality in the product . If you are looking for it to last , this is not what you are looking for .
 Based on other reviews of pannier bags I had read , my main concern was securing the bags to the rack . This item does relatively well in that area . The 4 attachment points were reasonably secure , though not the speediest , but I suppose that 's the trade-off . The major disappointment in this item is the lack of rigidity on the inside , and the pretty weak means for securing the side to the rack to prevent sway/flopping . The problem could be the pairing of the pannier with the rack I bought , but I did n't see any racks with sufficient pannier support to prevent the bag corners from wrapping/curving around and tangling with the spokes.So on my first ride using these bags this morning , the little bungee cord on the inside popped off the securing D-ring -LRB- these hooks are too wide-open -RRB- , caught a spoke and ripped through the cord -LRB- better than losing any spokes though -RRB- . Now the bag on one side was flopping freely . This condition resulted in the rear inside corner tending toward the wheel , and ending up catching in the spokes . The result
 I made the wrong decision when I bought this bag . This bag is not rigid enough to be placed on the side of the bike . Nearly caused me my life because it caught on the spokes of my bike and I fell while a car was approaching behind me . I thank all the gods that the car was slow . To top it all , Niagara Cycle blames me for putting it on my bike . The construction of this bag is so bad that Sunlite only thought about the cosmetic value of the bag and not the safety of the rider . They thought that just because there is a cardboard on the sides of the bag it will be good on a bike . What a waste . Please buy another bag . Save yourselves
 These are great in principle . They 're roomy and easy to use . But , they fall off ! Just ask my laptop that went flying down the street . On the other hand , the Targus slip case that it was in inside the panier protected it beautifully !
 I purchased a pair of SunLite 's C-Sport Fortress Front Panniers . They 're good build quality , but the hardware would n't hold the panniers onto the rack . Even with bungee cords , the hooks would let go over pretty small bumps . Obviously , a simple locking hook would solve this problem.After contacting SunLite 's customer service , I was given the run-around . They refused to address the issue , offering only to let me return it to them at my expense . They said they would fix it if it was a warranty issue , but offered no hope that they would address the obvious design flaw . If they saw nothing wrong with it , they would simply return the unusable bags back to me.I love to give glowing reviews , but I simply ca n't recommend a company that hides from responsibility like that . I just want to try to save others from wasting their money on a potentially poor purchase from a company that clearly does n't value service , or their products .
 I liked the idea of these bags and is why I bought them . However , there is no way to really attach them to your bike aside from the under part . I had old bike shoe straps I used and the bags still slid to the back . This was followed by the bags getting caught in my wheel spokes and fixed by me attaching a clipboard to the bags so they would have a hard , flat surface ! After a couple of weeks too long of frustration , I have given up on them and am shopping for new saddle bags to commute to work with !
 It was a very tight as described and in two weeks of stretching , it was a much better fit . However , the front sight catches on the holster when drawing inhibiting a quick , unobstructed draw . I would not recommend this holster to anyone because of that issue .
 Really nice looking bike , but from the chainwheel up , it is cheaply made . The one I got was the midnight blue color . The instruction manual is just as cheaply & poorly put together as the bike . Once I got done assembling the bike , I took it for a couple of short rides , but just did n't feel comfortable . Thank God for Craigslist
 Purchased this tube after a seeing a great review . Expectations were not met . No directions indicating if kneading the contents are nessecary . So , contents came out seperated . I recapped & kneaded . Followed directions completely . Next day I was able to just pull the stuff off with my fingers . Waste of time & money .
 First , the clip is mild steel - not spring - held by the smallest torx screws . It distorted to the point of being worthless , and a special driver had to be purchased to remove it.Then , the design is backward , with the pivot at the opposite end of the clip . This holds it upside-down , so it can open in the pocket , the sharp edge just waiting for your hand to reach in.All in all , it is an unreliable accident waiting to happen . Keep this only if your medical insurance is paid up .
 I bought this stand on amazon after checking the reviews.got it 3 days later.And had it assembled in about 30minutes , so that was easy.but the frame is crooked and where the `` V '' shaped brackets are welded on to the axle shaft . The brackets dont line up properly.So once the tubes where attached the welded brackets had to be rebent the stand still sits a little crooked.and it makes the motor pull to one side
 I ordered 3 of these and all three were bad . The tubes looked like they were squashed and warped making it difficult to impossible to dump the balls . Two thumbs down .
 i ordered balltube from them , but when my balltube come , i found that it already be folded , i cann ' t believe they can send this kind of product out .
 I can not tell you how disappointed I was to receive this item `` used '' . How dare they send a used item and charge me the price of a new balltube . I purchased it as a birthday gift for someone in my office . When the item arrived , I did not have enough time to return it for an exchange so I went ahead and gave it after I did as much cleaning as I could to remove scratches , dust , and dirt hoping the receiver would not notice -LRB- although , I 'm sure she did -RRB- . The delivery service was great , but I would not trust ordering anything from this company again , ever .
 My son uses this for his school books and by the 3rd day , the fabric had frayed and the rope came through the hole .
 Bought this as a birthday gift for our nephew for his 13th birthday who is a frequent hiker/traveler . As tiny plastic compasses were similar in price this seemed like a wise purchase . Mistake number 1 . No instructions nor manual of any kind came with this compass . Zero , zilch , nada which was assumed when chosen via web site . Mistake number 2 . Other than the standard packaging for shipping ; the compass arrived in a filmsy white box . I was incredulous , thinking surely I 'd overlooked instructions of some kind glued inside perhaps ? Nope . The most rudimentary directions would have been most helpful paraphrased from a Cub Scout manual . This made for a disappointing and embarrassing gift to send a beloved young man . As we 'd purchased a Survivor book also we thought redemption was possible , but no compass reading directions in the book purchased either . So , we have several months until Christmas to try and not bungle our gift for the same nephew . He did n't mind and was his usual sweet self , but his aunt and uncle surely did . Unless you want a compass that looks great and will slide nicely on your belt and you already know how to use a high precision instrument do not purchase this one .
 I have spent weeks dealing with the rude customer service at Powersport Superstore . Any savings you may gain from using them is not worth it . BUYER BEWARE .
 The M3 is probably a great watch , but the manual is so minimalist that I 'll prob never figure it out . It really needs a menu hierarchy/map so you can figure out where to find the various functions .
 Incredible that a manufacturer can produce a watch that is not backlight . That means at night the watch is not illuminated hence the watch can not be read . It requires you to push a button for 2 seconds and then the watch will illuminate for a whole five seconds before it goes dark again . I thought they invented this technology in the 80 's . The watch was a pain in the ass to use at night and almost worthless and I ended up sending it back .
 Terrible experience . The watch never worked and I HAD TO PAY TO RETURN IT !!! I wish I could comment on the actual product but since it was defective I ca n't . However , I can comment on the terrible customer service and way they conduct business by not accepting responsibility for their defective products.Great doing business with you !
 Honestly , for me , the watch is a disappointment . I should have paid more for a better model from a different company.Cheap construction and a bad sensor for the temp . They should put a crystal in the face , or atleast some higher quality material . I have had it for a month and it is already a mess.I have always had my eye on a Suunto and when I finally bought one it turned out to be a waste of money !
 I am pretty technical , but this watch is very very difficult to use . I just wanted to check my altitude for skiing , and even when I figure it out , I have to read the manual the next time I ski
 Since its been a month and the store has yet to send me the watch its a little hard to rate a non existent item . Im sure the watch is awesome , but the store sucks . Dont buy from it
 I have a Suunto t3c and like the watch so I thought I would like this 1 too . I was soo disappointed in the watch 's looks . I opened the sweet looking box and saw this lump of plastic looking at me , and I put it right back in the box . I knew I was going to return it next day . Well , as it sat on the table it kept saying `` dude come over here and at least try me on I will look better on your arm '' . My curiosity gave in , and I went and tried it on . Now it 's just a big lump of plastic on my arm . I went to print out the Amazon forms and saw I would eat a $ 5ish charge and I hate to waste money ! So I said maybe watch is n't so bad . I went over and looked at it again , and even took it to my chick and asked her about it . I told myself if she said it was ok I would keep it , and I figured it would grow on me . She agreed it sucked hard , so I ate the $ 5ish charge . But at least I do n't have an ugly watch on.If you were wondering what I expected from this watch , I expected a metal bezel . Even the back is plastic !
 I bought this watch approx the end of May last year . At the first of January the numbers would fade away when I pressed the light button . I assumed the battery was going bad and replaced it . The problem was that I was home on leave , my last day . I returned to Afghanistan and the watch started to zero out . I would wear it for a few hours and the time would go to zero and flash . It will no longer keep time . I have not abused the watch as the price I paid for it is a little steep and I would not take the chance on destroying it.When I looked online to return the watch , I found that I have to send it to the nearest service center with the receipt for purchase . I am in Afghanistan , this is not an easy option for me . I loved the watch when it was working , but now it just sits in a footlocker . Way too much money for gear that you cant use !
 The watch generally works okay for backpacking and higher altitude hiking -LRB- my uses -RRB- until it fails . One quirk
 ... and buy a GPS instead . I agree with previous reviewer -LRB- Dave57 -RRB- , I WOULD NEVER BUY A SUUNTO AGAIN . Worst than Dave , I simply got caught in heavy rain during a hike and my Vector was full of water , could n't even tell the time . I send it to Suunto Finland for repair and they say that it leaked from the housing and `` kindly '' offered a repair for 140 Euros .
 I had a Suunto for 10 months . The face scratched VERY easily which was disappointing . However the worst thing is after swimming in a pool that I could stand up in the watch FILLED with water and died . On returning to Suunto they refused to fix it under warrantee because swimming is not covered ! They say the forces created by swimming are to much for this watch and it was never designed for this purpose , despite the sales literature saying it is water proof to 100m . I WOULD NEVER BUY ANOTHER SUUNTO PRODUCT . Whatsmore the shop I bought it from say they have lots returned for the same reason and non of them were fixed under warranty either . It is also very difficult to use and you can not hear the alarm at all .
 I got a vector 3 years ago and was very pleased with it most of the time . The altimiter is not very useful because it is based off barometric pressure so your reading will vary wildly and you need to keep resetting it . The big flaw with this watch is that in 3 years the face has broken twice . The first time the bezel broke off . Luckly it was still under warranty and they replaced it . Now the faceplate has cracked and is letting moisture in . I do n't use the watch for any crazy sports , it 's just my everyday watch so the fact that it is broken astounds me . Sunnto have a minimum $ 85 repair charge , which could go up , so at this stage I 'm bowing out with two watch failures in 3 years .
 23 years of Army service and 4 Suunto watches . Cheap G-Shock watches have lasted much much longer ! I have had to replace 5 bands all in the period of 4 -5 months . I have had 3 of the 4 Suunto 's shut down in less the 30 feet of water . -LRB- Suunto claims they are water resistant to 80 meters on thier advertising however when you return them after they stop working in less then 10 meters they claim the warranty does not cover swimming . Hmmmmmmm swimmers and divers usually look at the water resitance of a watch to mean they are water resitant while swimming . Unless I am messed up and doing it wrong ... do most people wear the watch on thier wrist or do they just drop it down in the water and go back to check to see how deep it is or how much time they have spent in the water . Anyway , enough ranting on a cheaply made but exspensive watch that the company does not care enough about it 's customers to replace or fix it under warranty . Thanks Suunto........G-shock has won my service back.Suunto Core Wrist-Top Computer Watch with Altimeter , Barometer , Compass , and Depth Measurement
 I bought this watch with the HR monitor addition . I 'm in the Army and I thought this watch would be a great asset to have with me on the Medevac . I could n't be more wrong than if I went into war with empty mags . The heart rate sensor worked only once and that was indoors with no sweat involved . The day I got it was the last day it ever worked . The compass , now that 's an issue that that is unacceptable . It constantly quit regestering after walking only 10 feet . I was trying to be patient and give the piece of junk a minute to get it 's bearing . It did , I think , I did n't have a second compass to verify at the moment in my yard . I walked a few feet in a strait line and once again it went blank . I 'm too pissed off at this point to even consider trying any of the other functions . I now have a 400 dollar stopwatch that might be able to tell me if I 'm running up hill or down , who knows.That lens protector that they offer , and yes I bought it to `` protect my so-called do-it-all watch '' , is the dumbest crap I have ever seen . It 's a 1/4 '' thick piece of clear silicone that sets on top of the display . It 's hard to see the data being displayed on a good day when it is dry and clean . Everything can get under it and cause more damage to the crystal and makes it impossible to read anything on the watch.I have to say I 'm sorry that I bought into the hype and listened to my fellow soldiers who are also starting to have the same issues with their Sunto 's as well . Finland , you should be ashamed to have your name on this klind of performance .
 I love the upper metal bracket . However , the bottom retainer that came with it does not yield enough space to prevent it from resting on other electronic parts -LRB- little capacitors , transistors , etc. -RRB- installed on the back side of my motherboard . -LRB- I had to use my original bottom retainer plate . -RRB-
 The flag itself was very good material and very nice , but the plastic poles were terrible . I had n't traveled more than 30 miles before the flag snapped off of my car . Very disappointed that I spent money on two of these flags and I got to see them in use for a total of an hour .
 Not pleased with product because it broke off after only about 25 miles of driving . Flag material is very good , but plastic pole and mounting material is inferior .
 The fabric feels fake and it makes me itch , and the the inside material sheds for numerous washings -- I will never buy 50 50 blends again , 80 cotton 20 polyester is my new minimum -- The hoodie looks good but feels terrible .
 Clamp for mounting to seat rails does not fit standard bicycle seat rails . If you want to mount this to a bicycle , make sure the bicycle is made in China , too . Poor fit of clamp to seat rails will eventually cause clamp to break or fall off of bike . Also , bag fits too close to seat , allowing the bag to rub irritatingly on legs during pedaling . America demands low prices , but I demand durable things that work properly . This does not work properly , so I will never learn if it is durable .

 I purchased this arm sleeve a while ago and it keeps slipping off my son 's arm . He is a pretty big kid too . These sleeves would be good for anybody with really big arms , otherwise I recommend buying a different sleeve in youth size .
 I bought this product to remove the chlorine from our swimwear after we use the indoor pool at our condo . I know that smell is a personal preference , but I do n't like the fragrance of this product . To me , it smells chemical . I 've used other products that have a more pleasant fragrance , so I wo n't choose this one again . It does help remove the chlorine , however .

 Based on all the glowing reviews , I eagerly bought this whistle thinking that it would be loud and easy to use . Not so . I need to blow really hard to produce any adequate level of sound , which is basically just a high-pitched squeak . I was expecting the whistle to make a shrill but booming sound like the ones that referees use , but this whistle does n't even come close . Severely disappointed in this product .
 not loud enough ! sounds silly ... . not a real whistle . I had to get another metal one but the color was cute .
 These are absolutely useless . We shot them from 4 feet to a wall and they still did not break . We then tried to break one with a hammer and after 4 tries finally got them to break . Do not waste your money on these they are glorified red sticky pellets and nothing more .
 BOUGHT THESE FOR AN ACTIVITY WITH ADULTS.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FOR THIS AGE GROUP , AS THEYWERE SO THIN YOU COULD LITERALLY BEND THEM THEY SNAPPEDIN TWO ; NO EFFORT REQUIRED .

 When put on the mag . this extension is very easy to pop off , the groove is not a tight fit . I threw it back in the drawer and considered it a lesson learned . Stay away from it !
 Towel is not thick enough . The logo looks like it was an iron on . It 's good if you do n't plan to use it .
 Over the past few years , I 've begun transitioning all of my reels to fluorocarbon . I bought a spool of this line in 6-lb test to compare against Berkley Vanish and Stren brand . Upon spooling my reels , I found it to be every bit of 8-lb mono diameter , possibly 10 . It was very , very thick as compared to the other brands of 6-lb fluorocarbon . I realize this line is n't pure fluorocarbon , however , I can do without the added diameter . I also found this line to have high memory compared to the other brands .
 just bought the 6 # test.spooled up my reel and went to hit the lake . turns out this line has so much memory , it wouldnt cast more than 15 feet . line twisted all over the place . i even respooled 3 times thinking i could get the memory out but same thing every time.seems pretty tough no doubt but definatly not worth the hassle.fine your self some decent berkley dont look here
 Size is a big disappointment . They measure 3 &#34; x 6 &#34; , not much bigger than an index card . The quality is fine and holes are pre-punched but if you are expecting these to be the size of a small race bib , order something else .
 Tear resistant race numbers are fine for an informal race or event . Check some shoe company resources or other sponsors .
 I got this watch from amazon with the battery almost dead . I send a request to Amazon to exchange the watch but they told me that the watch was sold out and they can just return the money . I ask about if was posible change the battery with nike warranty . I never got an answer . Too bad Amazon ...
 The product description is false . The mounting plate is not universal -- it has a bolting pattern of 3.5 '' W x 2.5 '' H. That 's kind of important .

 I ordered a USA made Macgregor B90 through Amazon . Esportsonline took the order , but they sent a CHINA Rawlings MPH.I called the returns dept. at Esports they claimed to have over 300 B90 helmets in stock so he placed an order for another one emphazing he would not substitute on this order . He even paid the freight and said I could keep the helmet shipped incorrectly ! ANOTHER Rawlings showed up ! Now I have two helmets I did n't order . I did notice on the upc sticker on the helmet it said B90 . Has Rawlings bought out Macgregor ? Was the helmet mislabeled ? Either way it 's false advertising . I ca n't even use the helmet because Chinese sizing is 1/4 size smaller than US . I 'm done with these guys .
 I bought the DockLock to lock up my stand up paddleboard . I placed it on the leashplug with a fat padlock . The clamps on it do NOT clamp tightly and I was able to pull it off the leashplug with a very small amount of effort . Get a Lockjaw locking cable instead of this worthless product .

 I have owned not one , but TWO of these watches.Pros :1 . Absolutely beautiful styling2 . The band holder - the band holder is a wonderful innovation from Nike . Never again will a band move because it pops out of the band holder .3 . Being able to reset back to the time mode by holding the mode button down no matter where you are in the sequence of functions - another nice innovation by Nike .4 . The band - this is a very comfortable , soft rubber band that wears easily on the wrist all day long.Cons :1 . Stopwatch takes a relatively long button press to reset2 . This watch is poorly made and simply is n't durable3 . Case is easily scratchedOverall I really love the styling and functions of this watch . HOWEVER , the buttons on my first Nike Lance 4 became screwed up after about four months of wear . The second Nike Lance 4 started to reset itself after about three months of wear.Two chances are all you get - I switched back to Casio for reliability !
 Received watch , removed from packing and found out that the watch did n't work . Seller told me to return and a replacement would be sent . Setter received and told me it would take a week or longer to mail replacement . I told them I thought this time was not fair , they had my money and I had no watch . Shortly after they informed me they were out of stock and would refund my money . They did!End of story I purchased a Timex from Fred Meyer
 Before I bought this watch , I did a lot of research on the offerings from Suunto , Polar and Nike , and finally ended up choosing the Lance 4 watch for my cycling-specific activities . And I have to say , my disappointment began within 2 minutes of opening the shipping box . Here are the three major ways this watch -LRB- and Nike itself -RRB- have failed me :1 -RRB- This is a complicated , multi-function instrument . But if you 're expecting a detailed instruction manual , forget it . What you get is an elaborate pictograph that illustrates which buttons to push . It skims over the setup procedure and many of the most important functions , and omits many features entirely .2 -RRB- Relative to the above complaint , I contacted Nike customer service about the setup . Since I 'm a cyclist , I was particularly interested in the altimeter function , and dismayed by how thin the `` manual '' is . The instructions say you can select a 60 - , 10 - or 2-second sampling rate of the barometric pressure in order to determine altitude . What it fails to mention is what the ramifications are for choosing one over the other ? Is one more accurate . Does one use more battery power ? We 'll apparently never know , because Nike 's customer service failed to answer the question . While they admitted that they had received several complaints about the manual -- and were considering writing a new one -- they simply sidestepped my question about the altimeter function in their email reply .3 -RRB- And then there 's the performance of the watch itself . In most cases it 's impressive -- that is , in every case except the one for which I purchased it

 I agree with other reviews , that this is a difficult piece to master . The altitude dirfts from -150 to +250 feet per day . I live at 5005 feet in elivation and have to set the watch at least once a day to keep it accurate . The temperature function is always off . The compas seems to work well . All of this is nothing compared to the time when it became necessary to replace the battery -LRB- less than one year with both watches -RRB- . I did n't have the necessary special tools to replace the battery . Replacing the battery was a major accomplishment . I could not get the first watch to work after replacing the battery . The second watch quit working when the factory battery failed and I finally threw it away , as I had done with the first one . If you want to buy a watch that will work for the life of the factory battery only , this is the one for you .

 Good quality sweatshirt , but I agree with the reviewers who commented that the sizes seem to run large . This was true for my order and it was returned .
 I just got two clothes one week ago . I am extremely disappointed . One cloth has very sharp cuts on the front and the logo color is different from the image on the website . The other cloth has the same problem of logo color which makes the cloth looks very ugly . I have to return the two clothes which cost me 9 dollars . Be very aware !
 Item was HUGE , not suitable to wear to the gym for a workout . Item was returned .
 I normally wear a large size sweatshirt , but after reading several reviews which indicated these run large I ordered a medium . Apparently I should have ordered small , as the medium is too large in the chest and shoulders , and the sleeves come nearly to my fingertips . They 're 4 '' longer than a size large Izod sweatshirt I own . I 'm 5 ' 11 '' and weigh 175 , so unless you 're larger I suggest you order the small size . Other than that it 's a decent sweatshirt for the price .
 I love this product , but only when everything works as it should . Although there are some flaws in the design that can make it difficult to use in certain circumstances , I 'm generally happy with this product . Until things go wrong.Suddenly , for example , the heart rate monitor lost connectivity with the watch . It was n't the battery , which I immediately replaced . So I sent it in to Nike for repair -LRB- per their instruction on their site -RRB- . Almost $ 300 on a product , and no contact whatsoever from them about receiving and working on my product . I had to call twice to find the status of this product . 1 full month later , I 'm still waiting for it to be returned to me.Really , paying for a Nike product does not mean high quality . And it CERTAINLY does not mean any customer service to speak of . I am highly disappointed in this entire experience.If only Timex would make a footpod for measuring distance rather than a GPS systerm , this would be over . Unfortunately living in a city does n't make the GPS system a viable alternative for me , but I 've found the Timex HR Monitor to be far superior to both Nike & Polar .
 Received watch and it would never sync . Watch completely stopped working . I returned the watch to amazon by priority mail , and for some reason they seem to ca n't find the package . I 'm still waiting for them to return my $ 195.00 to my account . Which seems to be taking forever . I would not recommend anyone to purchase this product from amazon . Yes it may be less expensive , but just pay for it from the nike store and get better service .
 I owned the watch for about 30 days and the unit worked fine . Took watch off one day and put it in my pocket and the watch reset and then neither myself or Niketown store manager could get heart monitor sensor to link again . Received replacement and manager linked at store , took home and tried to enter heart rate limits and watch reset and again I could not link sensor . I believe there are better units out there for the money they are charging for this watch .
 A feature rich product offering Mac OSX compatiblity , distance and HRM data combined into graphs . Overall I found the product let down by quality control issues . The first watch I got had to be returned due to the USB pod simply not working at all . Kudos to Amazon for replacing it promtly . The second watch worked for a while - about 200km - then started to give intermittant HRM readings . Overall I found the HRM strap needed to be tighter than my Polar and that the reading did require that I wet the pads everytime before starting my run.The other thing that the Polar range has over Nike is that when you run at night it 's easy to just bring the Polar up to your chest and the light comes on - not with Nikes best - It requires you know which of the 5 buttons to press , to get the light on - easy if you do it right , but you can accidently stop the run recording if you press the wrong button in the dark while running.Buy lots of CR2032 batteries because you need to change them often . I have already changed the watch and the HRM battery in the first 175km , and the watch was set to power saving mode.Although it works OK with OSX 10.4.9 the Nike software has not been updated since 2004 - that 's 3 years - of no new driver or feature support - pretty good indication that Nike has moved it 's attention elsewhere . The monitor area is poorly used with a small 9 '' window opens up on your 20 '' Mac which can not be enlarged - then you get small little graphs you can hardly see . My advise is , if you buy a few spare parts like a HRM , footpod and USB unit then it should give you good data - otherwise expect to take it back under warranty - while you can .
 The fabric feels fake and it makes me itch , and the the inside material sheds for numerous washings -- I will never buy 50 50 blends again , 80 cotton 20 polyester is my new minimum -- The hoodie looks good but feels terrible .
 Over the past few years , I 've begun transitioning all of my reels to fluorocarbon . I bought a spool of this line in 6-lb test to compare against Berkley Vanish and Stren brand . Upon spooling my reels , I found it to be every bit of 8-lb mono diameter , possibly 10 . It was very , very thick as compared to the other brands of 6-lb fluorocarbon . I realize this line is n't pure fluorocarbon , however , I can do without the added diameter . I also found this line to have high memory compared to the other brands .
 just bought the 6 # test.spooled up my reel and went to hit the lake . turns out this line has so much memory , it wouldnt cast more than 15 feet . line twisted all over the place . i even respooled 3 times thinking i could get the memory out but same thing every time.seems pretty tough no doubt but definatly not worth the hassle.fine your self some decent berkley dont look here
 Never received watch and have not received credit for product or shipping yet ... Ordered for Christmas
 I figured it was about time that I bought myself one of these . I was really excited when the package came only to realize that the black used to make the print was smudged everywhere on the gold . I 'm quite disappointed in the quality of this towel .
 Like the idea of a terrible towel beach towel , but the quality of the towel is poor , very thin . I guess that would explain the low price .
 My towel came in time for Sunday 's big game BUT it is ripped and shredded much like Green Bay will be after the Steelers are done with them this Sunday !! Too late for a reorder !! I would n't buy it again !!
 the NFL towels are not Steeler terrible towels . Pittsburgh towels were created by Miren Cope an part of the money go to atheistic children.last Steeler super there was a big stink about NFL cashing in on the towels . Unless things have change ?
 At first I got it and I loved it , but then I started getting these weird feelings toward my guy friends ... im sure its just a phase ... also i took an IQ test and noticed my IQ dropped 35 points . Now technically my IQ is below 70 . .
 It has been 10 days since I placed my order , still waiting to receive it .
 made mistake should have never bought this . The towels at motel 6 are better quality and cheaper , would not buy again
 I know my Terrible Towels ... I 'm from Pittsburgh after all . And the writing on these towels looks too big ... takes up most of the towel with the writing . But I guess no one 's really looking at the size of the writing as you swing it over your head at the stadium !
 I purchased the bike rack as a gift and just found out the hardware -LRB- which says is to be included -RRB- was not included with the rack .

 We bought the seat for our Schwinn Air-Dyne , since the original seat had flattened out over many years.This seat was very uncomfortable for my husband . It was too wide in the front . We only used it a couple of times but the company would accept no return if the packaging had been opened . -LRB- Huh , how do you know if it is comfortable if you do n't try it ? -RRB- For myself , I did not feel any comfort as the ` gel ' was too firm for me.We would not recommend it for those reasons . We took the seat off one of our bicycles and are using that , it is much more comfortable and that bike had sat outside for over a year . Should have done that to start with and saved the money.Hope this helps ,
 Loved this seat for four-and-a-half weeks until the springs started squeeking loudly on fourth ride . Tried lots of measures to stop squeek to no avail . This included retightening all bolts , oil , grease , silicone spray , WD-40 , etc. . Nothing stops the squeek.Unfortunately seat is one week outside Amazon 's free return policy . Attempted to contact seller with no response after one week . Amazon appears to use a number of Fulfilment Sellers for this seat so your mileage may vary if you have a problem . My seller , CatchaBuy -LRB- Bike Depot Inc -RRB- was non-responsive . If you get a seat that does n't squeek you will love it . If you have a problem you may not get support .
 After a 5 & mile community ride , my backside started to ache . Today I ordered the Large wide cloud 9 seat . I plan to either return or sell the seat . The seat might work better for a rider with less backside , but since I am well endowed it is a bit uncomfortable .
 I got my Cloud 9 seat about 2 weeks ago . It 's much larger than my old seat which is a definite improvement . However , when I saw the words , GEL SEAT and CLOUD 9 in the description , it gave me the impression that this was a large seat with a substantial amount of GEL padding . This seat is NOT SOFT ! And while it does have some gel in the seat , it 's nothing like what you might think if you 've ever purchased a gel cover for a previous bike seat you 've owned . It is a very hard/firm GEL , which in my opinion does n't feel any different from almost any other seat I 've ever owned . The positive for me is that it is LARGE , and I did need that , so it 's still a good seat in that respect . But for those of you out there who may be considering purchasing this as a softer seat , DON `` T BE FOOLED !! I 'm not sending it back , because that 's just a big hassle for me . But I will now need to purchase a decent quality GEL cover for this seat which will likely cost an additional $ 25 to $ 35 . In fairness to the seat itself , I would have given it a 4 star rating had the company been more honest in their advertising . But when you name your seat , `` CLOUD-9 '' , and then futher advertise it as a GEL seat in the title , it 's easy to see that many buyers will be under the impression that what they are getting is a seat with a very soft and comfortable GEL padding -LRB- similar to a GEL seat cover -RRB- built in . This is not what you will be getting !! Which is why I give the Cloud-9 seat a `` 1 star '' rating , for deceptive advertising !!!
 I do n't get what all the glowing reviews are about here . I had a smallish seat on my commuter bike that was hard as a rock on my posterior . I figured a nice BIG cushy gel seat would solve my woes . I ordered this seat , and ... yes , I mounted it correctly and ... yes , I have the height and angle adjusted correctly . It 's just as hard as the last rock , just bigger . It may hold more of my posterior , but it sure is n't any softer and for me it 's , at best , only marginally more comfortable.If what you are looking for is a soft ride , keep looking.UPDATE
 My husband ordered a Sunlite Cloud-9 Cruiser Gel seat which is very comfortable . So I ordered one , but they 've changed the design as well as the padding/gel . It 's hard as a rock !
 I would n't have known how thin the fabric is had it not arrived from Amazon.com with a fairly large tear on one side . I 've learned to look over items carefully when they arrive , even if I 've no plans to use/install it for a while .
 I bought this seat at Amazon week ago , It looks great and very easy to install but its not as soft as I thought `` Cloud '' , made of hard rubber , bumps on horn and rare of the seat are very uncomfortable constently slides the rider toward the front of the seat.Now I am buying Gel cover for this seat to reduce the discomfort .
 This seat looked and felt so comfortable - its probably a great saddle . Unfortunately , it wo n't fit onto my Schwinn 3-speed Cruiser . The seat post in this -LRB- new -RRB- cruiser model is a pivotal post with 2 chrome bolts ; I thought I would be able to remove the Cloud 9 's seat post clamp and mount the seat directly in the post by using the rails . -LRB- This is how the factory saddle seat is mounted . -RRB- No luck . The seat rails are set about 1/4 '' wider than my post will accommodate . No amount of clamping would bend the rails to fit . I guess this speaks to how robust the seat is . In order to use it with my cruiser , however , I 'm going to have to purchase a new seat post and standard seat clamp.Definitely make sure to closely examine your seat post & clamp before purchasing .
 I guess I should n't always trust reviews on Amazon . I have been looking for a comfortable bike seat ever since I bought my new stationary bike 6 months ago with its god awful default seat and it has been such a hassle . This seat is seriously hard as a rock . I ca n't stand to sit on it on its own . I have to put a pillow on top of it , but even then it still is n't very comfortable . I 'm just dealing with this seat -LRB- and giving it 2 stars instead of 1 -RRB- because out of the other 4 seats I tried out it 's not AS bad . It 's still terrible though .
 I think the `` comfort '' people report here is largely in their heads . They buy the seat , they want to believe it 's better than the old seat , so they believe it is . I bought two of these , and neither of us liked it . I describe it like this : The discomfort usually felt on your bottom on a standard bike seat is reduced right in the center by the Cloud 9 seat , but it transfers the discomfort to the rest of your bottom . So instead of being sore right in the middle , I was sore across my whole butt . In addition to this , the extra wide seat rubs on the back of the legs while pedaling , making a very uncomfortable experience . There is a reason good quality bikes do n't come with double wide seats
 I do n't feel this seat is any more comfortable than the stock seat it replaced . Build quality is A-1 , but lacks in justifing money spent to replace the original seat . if I did n't have to pay return shipping , I would return it ...
 Then just looking at the picture , if you go any distance , you 'll have a very uncomfortable prostate , as there is no support for it -LRB- if the pictures are correct -RRB- . FOR MEN
 This is great bike seat . Cushy , springy , and comfortable it really absorbs the shocks of the road . I have a `` crank forward '' bicycle which means I am actually sitting on the seat more than riders of regular bikes do , so I know what 's what in the cushy tush department . I ride almost everyday , logging at least 10 hours a week on my bicycle . And compared to the previous seat I had , ooh la la , this babee is a dream . And the Amazon vendor from whom I bought it was great as well .
 This is a big really wide bike seat . I mean this seat is really w i d e . When you sit on this seat , your legs can only pedal on one side !! If you took this seat on an airliner for some reason , you would have to purchase the aisle and middle seats ! Only one person in my entire neighborhood has overwhelmed this seat . She is Bertha winegold known locally as `` big fat enormous behind bertha '' She is only 5 feet two inches but she has to weigh 400 pounds ! What she is doing on a bicycle I will never know ! Before I could stop her she got on this seat and I promise you , totally obliterated it ! It was as if the clouds had suddenly obliterated the sun !! Still if you need a w i d e bike seat , you know , if your tush is so wide it seems to move in a different direction as if unattached to the rest of you , than this is probably your best bet at least until someone puts out a sofa with pedals
 It was not possible to attach this seat to the Schwinn AD2 Airdyne Exercise Bike . It was shown as an alternate seat for the Bike .
 Could n't wait to get this seat in the mail , as it looked like a great option . Once I received it , I installed it and no matter how hard the nuts were tightened , the seat `` tilted back '' when I sat on it ... as in , the angle of the seat went from horizontal to vertical . I now have to take it to a bike shop to get it to work with my bike . I could have returned it , but I plan on sticking with the seat and hope it was worth the effort .
 Based on the recommendation of Amazon , I bought this seat to `` upgrade '' the basic seat of the Body Rider Fan Bike - stationary exercise bike . This seat is likely great for a traditional bike but it simply is not compatible with this exercise bike . I find it completely irresponsible of Amazon to make a recommendation that consumers buy them together .
 Good feeling seat for about 45 minutes . Started cracking after about 6 months . The Vitesse Deluxe Cruiser Seat may be a better choice . This is my second bad experience with Sunlite products
 This saddle was not as soft as I thought it would be but it was still a bit better than the stock seat on my Fuji bike . Definitely harder than expected . The only thing that eats at me is the health warning on the back of the product packaging , stating in tiny print '' `` WARNING
 Let 's face it , I have a cheap beach cruiser . A Huffy from Walmart . The seat was killing my behind and I ordered this one after reading all the reviews . It came and I had hubby install it right away . Took the bike for a 3 mile ride this morning and am disappointed . First of all , I am not tall . It makes my bike seat too high and it can not be lowered any more . Then the comfort level was not there . I thought a gel seat would be softer . NOT this one ! This is also smaller than the standard Huffy beach cruiser seat . My neighbor has a nice beach cruiser with a nice comfy seat and I guess I just need to buy a better bike ! Sending this seat back and using the Huffy one till I can afford a new more expensive bike .
 I ordered this product for my bike . I have had so much trouble with getting the screws tight enough to have a long bike ride . The moment I think I 'm good , I hit a bump and my seat will tilt up or down . I have tried so much that the bolts look like they have been through a battle . So , still trying to work something out . Comfort wise for the seat itself ... it 's good . Just the fit is a problem .
 The bicycle seat does not fit the bicycle . The seat requires a post to attach it to the bike . The present seat is attached on a plate and 3 bolts .
 First off the seat was delivered with a cut on the front edge . The viynl seems very thin in this area.The back area of the seat has almost too much padding , pushing you forward andmaking the front area where your crotch area is uncomfortable.Overall it was very uncomfortable no matter how it was adjusted I would not recommend
 The thong is too thin and does n't cover the entire top tube of the frame so I use a throw towel anyways . I read reviews about not spending money on a bike thong for an indoor trainer but decided to get one anyways . I could now easily do without one and use a towel instead since I use a towel anyway . The best part about this bike thong is the pocket you can put in front , which can hold my phone , controller , GU 's for a long ride , etc. .
 Have n't found a good position to install this so it does n't irritate my hands while working out ... it catches about 60 % of the sweat and almost all of the drops that would have hit my bike .
 After using this product , it seems more of a gimic versus something really necessary . I take care of my ride , so sweat is `` no sweat '' for me.Happy Holidays , Smacka
 I was disappointed when I got it because the thong is not wide enough and sweat still falls on the frame , the elastic band that goes around the seatpost is also too long and the thong feels loose.Also , it interferes with my computer mounted on the handlebars !! The part that actually holds the remotes is completely detachable from the thong so I have opted to use that piece only -LRB- had to secure it by manually tying velcro straps to bike as they will only stick to the underside of the thong -RRB- .
 Does n't work well to wrap around an aerobar setup where my head is farther forward than the actual sweat protector . remote holders are a joke on my setup as well .
 My son uses this for his school books and by the 3rd day , the fabric had frayed and the rope came through the hole .
 Bike arrived damaged and missing front brake cable . Eventually received missing part , but have had problems with bike operation . Gear shifter sticks and gears often slip or do not change smoothly . Bike squeaks and makes a lot of noise . People keep asking me of there 's something wrong with my bike . Embarrasing . Noisy brakes also . Left pedal crank shaft keeps loosening and falling off . Tried to give the bike a chance , but should have returned immediately . Now it 's too late . I would n't recommend this bike .
 What 's with the missing parts that I and other reviewers have experienced ? What 's going on in their packing and shipping section ? I 'm afraid I did n't get the royal treatment that another reviewer got , whereby they shipped his missing parts overnight . It 's been nearly three weeks since I first called , and I ca n't ride my bike properly because of a missing front break cable . They replied to one of my emails after I called , but usually they do n't bother to reply at all .
 Lets see No instructions , no pedals , and no front brake cable . I called the number on the bike and they helped pretty fast . I got everything except the instructions . After getting it put together , I will say it 's a nice bike.It 's the most comfortable bike that I 've ridin . They just need to package it better . Here 's the customer service # 866-462-4535 in case anybody needs it .
 Why Cadillac would put their name on this piece of garbage is beyond me . The first one I received failed inside of 6 weeks . The hub never did shift all that well , sticking in gear or shifting on its own . After about a month it would only shift into every other gear -LRB- if you were lucky -RRB- . While waiting for its replacement to arrive the rear swing arm snapped while going around a corner at less than 10 mph . The rear spring loses most of its load carrying capacity in 2 or 3 weeks and is an off size unit that can not be upgraded . The second bikes rear hub started failing after just a few days , the swing arm snapping a few weeks later , again going around a gentle corner at less than 10 mph . The bottom bracket on the first bike started grinding and popping after about 15 miles , the second one after about 3 miles . Neither of these bikes were abused , I used them to commute 5 miles each way to work on city streets and a paved bike path . The only reason I gave it one star is you ca n't give a negative 5 star rating . That would still be generous .
 The fabric feels fake and it makes me itch , and the the inside material sheds for numerous washings -- I will never buy 50 50 blends again , 80 cotton 20 polyester is my new minimum -- The hoodie looks good but feels terrible .

 Works quite nicely until the battery runs down , which is after a couple of months . Replacing the battery will require taking the watch apart completely , including take the electronic boards out , which disconnects it from the display . The display connection is without wires , but near impossible to reposition correctly outside of the factory with the right equipment . In other words
 This is the 2nd Sportline stopwatch I have gotten . The first worked for a little while but the buttons were quite temperamental ; in other words , sometimes they worked , sometimes they did not . The second one only worked a few times before the start/stop button became impossible to push . Do n't waste your money on this ; instead , spend a little more on a better one .
 I tried two different Sportline models , including this one . Both had the same problem
 Same problem as others . Buttons do n't work reliably . I use them to time at swim meets , and tried swapping one for another , but they 're all crap .
 ultimately a very frustrating product to use ... just wanted a reliable , not too expensive stopwatch to time sprints . the commands for the three buttons are confusing -LRB- comes with an user manual -RRB- and it is difficult to get the buttons to respond the way the manual says they will to activate different modes / use different functions . the stopwatch also has a clock / alarm function , which I did not need -- and somehow the buttons to activate the alarm would get pushed in my sports bag , making the alarm go off at inopportune times in my sports bag , while hanging on a door at home , etc. -- and then it would be difficult to figure out how to disable the alarm ... . there must be better products out there than this ... . the only silver lining - when I could successfully get the stopwatch into timing mode , it seemed to work well / accurately . never could figure out how to use more complex functions that it supposedly can do , like splits , two competitors , etc. .
 With a stopwatch you want to be certain it will stop whenever you want it to stop , and start whenever you want it to start . I bought three of these because they were cheap , and all three of them does this thing where either pressing the button does n't work , and when it does work it double clicks and sometimes it works properly . These stopwatches are not reliable .
 With the first one of these when I pressed the start/stop button it would not engage/acknowledge such -LRB- ie . timer would not start , or if already started , would not stop -RRB- . So , I 'd press it repeatedly and it would work sometimes.So , I returned it and tried another one . The second one was EVEN WORSE ! The first one worked for about a month . The second did n't even last a week before it started doing this same thing even worse than the first . Waste of time , money , and thumb energy .
 I use this stopwatch once a day . Within a week the buttons do not respond and you have to push them numerous times before they will respond . It is extremely frustrating . Find another stopwatch to buy .
 I bought this stop watch and for about ten minutes it did exactly what I needed it to do
 I have a Denali jacket that I LOVE and have been wearing it all the time for the past 2 years -LRB- can wear 3 seasons in New England ! -RRB- ... that 's why I decided to purchase another one . Buyers be aware that the new Denali jackets are `` recycled '' materials . If you had an old version , you will notice the difference ... if not ... maybe not ? The jacket seems `` cheaper '' and not as plush , thick , soft , or warm . I was n't sure if it was a defect or a fake or what ? But , it has all the North Face tags . This was my favorite jacket and it is unfortunate that they cheezed out on it . I will not purchase another .
 My mom brought me this jacket for Christmas in hot pink since she knows that 's my favorite color . I 've seen lots of girls wearing them and heard things about it being the best jacket and having an insulator that keeps you warm . I was very disappointed when I put it on and felt how thin this jacket was . I wore it outside in the cold winter as well as the breezy spring now and it has not kept me warm ! I 've had to wear a jacket underneath it and yet I was still cold , but than again I am cold blooded , but for a $ 100 plus jacket , it should do what it says and keep a person warm for Gods sake . - __ -
 I open the package.It smells terrible.I try it on ... it is not what i expected for a jacket that goes for over $ 100 in North Face stores.I thought it 'd be amazing and the warmest jacket I own as everyone rants and raves.Thinner than authentic jackets.Tags are real , but I researched this and one thing that commonly happens is when factories get the design , they make authentic ones , but at night when most go home , some untrustworthy people make the same ones using cheap , non-authentic materials and that 's what we call FAKE . Which was exactly what mine was . Very upset : / Wont be buying brand name things online anymore.Not trustworthy .
 The baton arrived ahead of schedule in a HUGE box ... a total waste of packaging . It is really a heavy baton , not lightweight at all and it is not even remotely balanced . The balance point on mine was about 5 inches away from the handle . I will most likely not use this unless I need to throw my baton at a musician -LRB- only joking about the throwing part -RRB- .
 I purchased this watch as a gift for my husband . The first time it was shipped , the LED light cleared the display . I called Nike and they said it sounded like a movement issue , so I sent it back to the company that had shipped it . They sent me a `` new '' watch . It had the exact same problem . Nike was n't aware of the issue with this watch , but it was the second time with the exact same problem . The store now has the watch on close-out so I will be unable to give it to my husband . Overall , I 'm just very disappointed .
 This watch is basically a timex in a Nike case with a stupid watch band . The watch sits up very high -LRB- too high -RRB- for this type of band . The watch sticks out from your wrist and catches everything.Watch functions are basic stupid timex type . Chrono , timer , dual time , date , and data.Just a stupid watch . I was hoping for much more - not sure why , but I was .
 I was excited to get this watch . It had everything on it that I wanted . Unfortunately the Velcro started to wear out immediately and the worst happened after five and a half months ... It died . If you like it beware of the Velcro but may be you will have better luck in getting one with a longer lifespan .
 Well , it looks great , big numbers on display , good size and cool design.My big complain it 's about the fragility of the wristband . If you dont take good care , it will break ! And an original Nike wristband it 's too expensive , almost the price of a brand new watch.So , if you want a resistent watch so you can pratice lots of sports and activities , look for some other watches ... maybe a G-Shock . . that 's what I done !
 This watch looks and functions great but DO NOT put near water . It will drown and leave you with a $ $ $ sinking feeling . Watch Out for this one ! Bought a Timex next and still ticking , water and all !
 Size is a big disappointment . They measure 3 &#34; x 6 &#34; , not much bigger than an index card . The quality is fine and holes are pre-punched but if you are expecting these to be the size of a small race bib , order something else .
 Tear resistant race numbers are fine for an informal race or event . Check some shoe company resources or other sponsors .
 Product was poor quality , tough to assemble and overall was a real waste . I would seriously considering going another direction for a should holster . I bought it because it was cheap and I thought what the heck but there is a reason for this ... duh
 Though the item is good , THE SELLER `` The Sportsman 's Guide '' IS BAD !!!! I have dealt with these guys before and they accept the orders and charge your card , but the products are always back-ordered for about a MONTH ! Not worth it to me ... you can go to CheaperThanDirt.com and get it for $ 10 cheaper .

 The item description stated `` Fits most destroyer style steering wheels '' , which I 'm sure is a true statement but it was just my luck that it does n't fit the destroyer wheel for Mako bay boats , which I have . Otherwise , all went well ; prompt shipping and good packaging .
 I have used similar product before and it was fun . However this one is not with the same quality , the dart can barely stay on the board if you throw it from two meters away . More than half of the time the dart will simply bounced back and fall to ground . Even it stays , it shifts a lot . You have no idea where the dart will actually stays at .
 The board is not durable . It has already many scraches on it when I got this . So I returned this immediately!Don ' t buy ! this is not worth over $ 20 .
 Purchased this dart board recently . Unpacked box to find that some darts were bent -LRB- manufacturing defect . -RRB- Then proceeded to mount it on the wall -LRB- they did not include mounting supplies -RRB- . First dart to hit board caused board to fall to ground and the lower mounting point completely broke off . I would n't waste my time with this toy . I am looking for a better , more durable dart board for kids now .
 The reason this thing sticks so much better than the other felt dart games is because of the hard surface . Because of this , this thing is LOUDDDDDDDDD !!! I bought this for my office and ca n't use it at all.I bought a cheaper $ -LSB- ... -RSB- felt dart board and use these magnets on that surface instead . I recommend that approach in an office environment . Also , the cheap felt dart board has a darts game side and a playing cards -LRB- for poker , blackjack , etc -RRB- game side - so there are more possibilities there .
 I ordered this as a gift for a good friend . When it came i was shocked at how small it is . I would have never given this to anyone . I sent it back .
 I bought this for my grandfather as his Christmas gift . When it arrived it looked that a child 's rod and reel kit . It is tiny . I returned it because it did n't seem appropriate to give this to my grandfather . Speedy shipping and return though
 I recently received the Daiwa mini spin travel pack , I love its features especially its size and pistol grip handle . I was so excited that i found a combo that I could fit into my hydration backpack . I 'm a mountain bike enthusiast and always look for places to go especially where fishing is feasible . The case was broke in three places when it arrived , o.k. I blame USPS for their poor packaging , called distributor and of course its on back order -LRB- 3weeks -RRB- no problem i was still anxious to bike to the river and cast . After a 3hr ride i arrived and set up the pole , seemed well enough and durable . AFTER 3 CASTS THE REEL WENT RIGHT INTO THE RIVER , o.k. I manually retrieved it by pulling the fishing line , disappointed but still liked the pole about 2 more casts and again it happened , i inspected the pole and found that very little effort was needed to pull the reel out . I decided to pack it up and upon breaking it down the last part of the rod broke while disassembling it , dammit . Now I 'm upset and hope I just got a defective one , since it 's made in china that happens i suppose . It 's features are the only reason it got more than 1 star , AND I DID N'T CATCH ANY FISH !
 This kit is OK , nicely fits under my car seat , good for light fishing.It would have been much appreciated had the rod been a bit stronger and more solid .
 I would never buy any product that advertises its self as ultralight and then does not list its weight . I have searched at least 20 sites trying to find the weight of the rod , the reel , and the case . If your going to advertise a product as ultralight it seems very poor judgement to have no information of the actual weight anywhere . Obviously shipping weight is not a useful number . As an avid ultralight camper , fisher , hiker , and rafter , I would not trust any company who does not list the weight of gear advertised as ultralight .
 Pros
 On Dec. 7 I ordered a Franklin Dallas Cowboys youth uniform ... plenty of time for Christmas . They never gave notification that the item was out of stock until Dec. 20 . I had no time to purchase a new one for Christmas . The one item that my 6 year old wanted never came .
 Love the IDEA of this fan . Size , bright colors , soft fan blades are great.Wanted it for our trip to Disney World so the kids could each have their own and it would be small for our backpacks . We ordered two and , in short , it 's a great fan if it works but they have serious quality control issues . We ended up returning them but here 's the good and bad of our two fans .1 -RRB- The mister is fantastic . Works like a squirt gun -- push a lever and it squirts out one `` squirt '' worth -- but it 's the tiniest mist you could imagine . Both worked the same way . Nice .2 -RRB- The fan on one was great . Quiet , fast , surprisingly cooling . Cute . But sometimes it would turn on and sometimes it would n't . Frustrating for me , unacceptable for a kid . Maybe 3-4 stars depending on who you 're buying for .3 -RRB- One fan did n't work at all . Then it did , but was weak and only worked if you gave it a push to start it twirling . Then did n't work again at all . Changed the batteries , etc. . Nothing . 1 star.FYI , we went with a family size `` Windchiller '' -LRB- sadly not sold on Amazon -RRB- . Much bigger -LRB- 11-12 '' tall -RRB- but the kids loved it and we were happy to have it . Continuous mist and fantastic fan worked great . One bummer it turned itself on once or twice in the bag . And if you go get one , do n't pump the canister too much or the mist itself comes out like a squirt gun in the face ! Once we got the hang of it , though , it was nice.Just did another search to find the Windchiller and it looked JUST like this one but branding was different.Continental Electric Hand Held High Velocity Ultra Fine Misting Fan , WhiteSide note on Disney World and misters , we went in late September and it was hot but not crazy hot -LRB- high 80s -RRB- . Frankly , I probably did n't need to buy one at all . That said , if you go in the summer , have family members who get uncomfortably hot , or spend LONG hours in the park -LRB- we went home for naps , etc. -RRB- , it 's a smart idea ! And if you 're not sure and/or you would never use it again , you can gamble and just buy one in the park only if you need it .
 Received a battery operating portable fan -LRB- model # 1041 -RRB- instead of the misting fan . Emailed the company , will post back once I know how they corrected it . Hoping they do !
 These shirts are a great price . My husband is a 4xlt and with one wash they shrunk drastically . Mostly shrunk in length . While they were a great deal - with only wearing them one time . . they have now become too short for him . I followed the instructions for washing also ...
 I do n't know what body type this hoodie is modeled for , but it sure is n't the average person . I bought this , tried it on , and it clearly did n't fit properly , so I had friends of various sizes try it on as well.This sweater fit no one.It 's incredibly huge in the chest area and the arms , is extremely long , and gets narrower toward the bottom.Unless you 're literally shaped like a slice of pizza , this hoodie will not fit .
 i was going to buy it but i learned that you cant buy it in california and it jams so often
 this item was the worst item ever i hate it it said that it would ship in 5 day but it came in a 30 days and it was broke right out of the box do not buy ths and never shop at amozon buy somthing from a store it coast more but u dont get ripped off
 I hear this gun is good , but then i found out ... . it can not be purchased in california . real big downhill part . So for you people who do n't live in the states stated in the important information area , lucky you , for us unlucky fellers , :[ -LSB- -LSB- -LSB- -LSB-
 M40 is the United States marine Corps Designation for their Remington 700 's which are chambered with 7.62 mm NATO rounds . the MP40 SubMachine gun here is most certainly NOT an M40 , thank you : -RRB-
 It broke on the first day i got it.Double Eagle MP40 WWII Spring Airsoft Machine Gun Rifle Airsoft Gun
 dont buy . hop up makes it curve 20 ft to the left and hurts finger to load it Sucks dont buy
 First of all , the title should already alarm you when it says `` M40 '' and `` RIFLE '' . It just screams `` PLEASE BUY MY PIECE OF CRAP I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT ! '' Before i begin , i will remind you this is a `` MP40 '' and it 's actually a sub-machine gun -LRB- not a `` RIFLE '' -RRB- . What can i say but that this airsoft gun is very cheap . In a bad way ! The plastic is cheap , it only shoots an average of 20 feet and the plastic snapped the first day i got it -LRB- not to mention it was damaged when i got it -RRB- So between the lazy , inaccurate name and the complete disregard for costumer satisfaction , i would give it a perfect NEGATIVE five , if i could . Even if you do n't want to spend too much for a `` MP40 '' airsoft gun , steer clear of the `` M40 '' !
 This product got great reviews so I bought it for my granddaughters for Christmas . The optical quality is nil . You might as well put a bug under any piece of plastic . I dont recommend this product . Too bad . The design and idea is great but due to poor optical quality , it does n't do a thing .
 This is a great idea , but the magnifier does n't work well enough to hold the attention of my seven year old nephew . The images are fuzzy and only a little clear when dead center field . I was hopeful , but disappointed . We took it to a family reunion and just left it at the beach house when we went home because it just was n't any good .
 No matter how I attached this to my glasses , I could see nothing worth seeing . The mirror sits very close to the head . When I adjusted it so it was aimed behind me , all I could see was my ear . When I moved the mirror far enough to the left to see around my ear , it was so far to the left that I could not move my eye far enough left to see it . If I turned my head to see it , of course the mirror moved too , so I could n't see what I wanted to.I let the deadline to return it pass so I guess I 'm stuck with it . I 'll sell it cheap or give it away .
 This item is about 1 inch square . MAybe it 's me but I ca n't see anything , I was expecting a mirror but this looks more like reflective metal without a good image .
 This mirror is okay . Fits over you sun or eyglasses ok , but is a bit small and does n't extend out enough to safely check behind you while watching ahead of you at the same time . It is also a bit fragile while attempting to adjust and could be dangerous if you need to adjust while in motion due to wind knocking it ot of adjustment while riding .
 some people love it . I found it very awkward and unsatisfactory . I like my road bike handle bar mirror better . The product is now in a drawer .
 Although this item was a gift , I was very disappointed in the quality . It is very flimpsy and cheap looking . I read all the reviews and most raved about it except for one person whom I agee with . However , the recipient of this item was ok with it .
 Mirror requires fine adjustment . Every time you put on your helmet , you are going to have to adjust the mirror . And the difference of 1 mm means that you wo n't see what you want to see . Falls off easily .
 I bought one of these , but it came with no directions , no photo of it installed and my husband and I are mystified about how to use the darn thing . HELP !!!!!!!!
 When I bought the compact model , I assumed the mirror alone was smaller as to create less of a dsitraction . However , I now realize that the entire body is smaller , and more importantly SHORTER !! So , unless you have an eyeball where everyone else has their temple , you too will not be able make the compact version viable . Am returning for original size .
 Very nice concept and well made . The major negative is that it does not work on thinner wire frame glasses . The spring action is too tight and bends the frame . It is also too long and droops . It only works if it is taped to the glasses - a major inconvenience . Now sits in my box of unused bike items .
 Oh , Man ! I really screwed up on this . First of all I ended up ordering 2 -LRB- when I thought I had only ordered one ! -RRB- THEN , I find the mirror goes ON YOUR HELMET OR GLASSES !! I just could not get it to work.Total waste of $ $ , for me . I guess I need to read the description more carefully , next time . I thought it went on the bile HANDLE !
 Not sure about all the glowing reviews here . For me , this mirror is no good at all . I do not have a bill on my helmet so I do not know about that config , but clamping to my eyewear does not work . I have tried every possible angle and combination , but mostly I am looking at my shoulder and only with strain can i occassionally see something in the road behind me . Quite useless
 ... but this thing seems to add a hazard to my ride . I ca n't really see much using it . I 've been used to looking over my shoulder as I ride , and while this is not the safest thing to do , I get the whole picture when I do it . I did not feel comfortable using this -- AND I ended up looking over my shoulder , anyway . Like I said , maybe it 's just me . If you like mirrors on your helmet or on your eyewear , well , disregard this review ... Either way , be safe out there , brother and sister riders !!
 I know many people find this product helpful , but I found it distracting and uncomfortable to use . I have been using handlebar mirrors for years now , and I could n't imagine riding without one ; it 's like riding blind . I gave this a try to see if it would enhance my rear vision , but was seriously disappointed . I experimented for days with slightly different positions , but I always found that it obscured my view of the oncoming lane . What good is it to see behind you if the mirror creates a fuzzy blind spot on the road ahead where a car may be turning , oblivious to you ? With a handlebar mirror I can still see the whole road in my peripheral , but the Take-A-Look requires your eyes to focus on a tiny square , which makes anything hiding behind the mirror -LRB- in front of you -RRB- very difficult to see at the same time . On a busy road , a split second adjusting focus can mean life or death.This mirror might be right for you ; it 's just a personal preference . The design for clamping onto the helmet works well and it 's not a bad product . But you have to decide if it 's worth giving up the little square of vision in front of you for a view behind . I would recommend a handlebar mirror over this , but I 'm glad I tried this and I think any mirror is better than no mirror .
 These do not work that well . They are difficult to install . They move while riding at higher speeds . I rather use Italian Road Mirrors on the ends of the bike .
 For years , I 've used a wide side mirror attached to my left handlebar with velcro - $ 6 at Walmart . Works great and a rear-view mirror is essential to bike safety.But having sometimes seen spandex wrapped bikers whiz by me with eyeglass clip-on mirrors I thought it looked like a good concept . Having tried it on about 20 rides it 's now in a drawer . It does n't compare in view or convenience to the handlebar mounted mirror.I found it difficult to focus on the postage stamp size piece of plexiglass mirror . And , our eyes being linked together , both must focus and look in what I find to be an unnatural position -LRB- left and up a bit -RRB- , which distracts from the course ahead . And you have to get it out far enough to see around your helmet -LRB- according to the instructions it can be mounted on the helmet , but no hardware for such an installation is included -RRB- . If you use your dark glasses for anything other than biking you 're stuck taking the mirror off and on , which is n't easy and requires adjustment each time . Meanwhile , I adjust my handlebar mirror instantly with my thumb and index finger as needed.Maybe some people do `` adapt '' to quickly adjusting and looking through this tiny clip-on mirror . But there was no adapting period for my regular mirror . It just worked , it was cheap and it 's always easy to use . As for the clip-on I quickly found myself asking `` What 's the point ? ''
 Stated that it can be used either side but it can not only any good for using where traffic in on the right
 This mirror fits the glasses frame nicely and is fairly easy to install . It is , however . much to small . It is very difficult to see behind you because the mirror is so small . I never was able to get it adjusted so I could just glance at it without having to move my head to see the rear view . Over all it is a real pain to use so I replaced it with a bolt on rear view bicycle mirror .
 Seriously do n't waste your money . Difficult to install and mirror scratches way too easily . Ok if you ride once a month and have a nice clear shelf to store your helmet .
 These shorts tore in the seam between the legs within a few weeks of having bought them . And there really was n't much use given to them -LRB- certainly nothing that would cause a tear -RRB- . I like Adidas shorts overall , but I ca n't recommend these .
 It works ok , but think mine came with a damaged drinking spout . I have been unable to make it work without covering a significant portion of the spout , which is n't convenient when running .
 WARNING READ FIRST !!! Airsplat is not the company to but from . This company is known for sending broken gun or completely the wrong gun to your address . I haved ordered from them and received a broken gun . When you try to get another one they make you pay for another and make YOU pay to return that one . AIRSPlAT is a joke DO N'T by from them !!!!!
 Fine , average BBs , absolutely awful shipping . I ordered a book a day three days after the BBs and it came 6 days before . I also ordered a pistol and it came in two days , whereas the BBs came in 12 days . 12 days for 2000 average BBs . Absolutely awful , will never buy again . You should n't buy either . I wish when I was going to buy this there was a review as informative as this . Just to state it again
 We were so excited to get this for our son 's first birthday . We hoped it would not only be a great all-purpose wagon for him , but an heirloom as well . When the box arrived we opened it immediately and started to assemble . Unfortunately , the hardware -LRB- bolts and nuts -RRB- were loose in the box and half-way through , we noticed there were some nuts missing . After a trip to the hardware store , we had everything we needed , however some of the pre-drilled holes on the wagon were mis-aligned - the construction seemed less than precision , even by hand-made standards . Nonetheless , we finished assembling and went for a test-ride . Our son loved it and it seemed to provide a smooth ride for him . On only the third or fourth ride , however , three of the bolts in the steering mechanism fell out completely.We 've decided to keep the wagon and just make a few adjustments -LRB- re-install longer bolts in the steering mechanism -RRB- and continue to tighten all of the nuts every so often . We love the look and ride of the wagon but we are really disappointed in its overall construction .
 The fabric feels fake and it makes me itch , and the the inside material sheds for numerous washings -- I will never buy 50 50 blends again , 80 cotton 20 polyester is my new minimum -- The hoodie looks good but feels terrible .
 Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy this DVD , as much as I love Rodney this is the most disappointing yoga DVD I have ever bought and I am very sorry . The workout is very slow too much talking and boring and the gloves are so uncomfortable , I tried to use them with other workouts just to get my money worth but they are big and uncomfortable just impossible to workout with them on . Do n't waste your time if you want to try some yoga workouts with weights try ironyoga .
 This video is truly terrible . It seemed as thought the model doing the yoga was enjoying Rodneys instruction and constant touching too much . So weird . The gloves were uncomfortable . I have a lot of yoga dvd 's and this one belongs only in the garbage . It is so bad I dont think I will even buy another Rodney Yee yoga dvd . I cant believe I paid for this . I wouldnt even give it away . Sorry but it is that bad .
 I ordered 3 and one of the three had imperfections in the center of the bow -LRB- small dents and voids like might normally be found in wood -RRB- . After trimming to proper length I bent the bow for installation and it broke at the imperfection . I did not try to wrap it into a circle it broke well before any excessive bend . The other two worked out fine.I was surprised that they shipped each one in a seperate tube . The packaging was poor since the bows were falling out of the tubes when they arrived .
 The Product is stated as Hardwood . It is not Hardwood . It is Pine . Do n't waste your money . In this case you get what you pay for .
 The fabric feels fake and it makes me itch , and the the inside material sheds for numerous washings -- I will never buy 50 50 blends again , 80 cotton 20 polyester is my new minimum -- The hoodie looks good but feels terrible .

 The Plastic cross piece on top of the pole is cheap . I used it once and it bent down on both ends . It stayed in that shape hours later after removal . I did n't over tighten the straps . If it was thicker it might not be as bad . You could use a wooden piece under it and screw the plastic piece to it . I think I 'll go with a bow system next . I guess this is a case of going cheap instead of going for value .
 I researched this product pretty well , and thought I would give it a try even though my boat was a the upper end of the recommended range -LRB- which is 28 ' -RRB- . My span is 24 ' . Boy , was I disappointed.I keep my boat on a lift and I use a mooring cover to keep it clean and reduce annual waxing effort . I install my cover by starting from the inside of the boat , and draping it over both sides.The straps are a pain to step over or scoot under , not to mention that they are a bit of a safety hazard at the swim platform at the back of the boat -LRB- easy to get your feet tangled in them -RRB- . After finally getting it adjusted , I have to say that it just did not keep the cover tight , and the straps did not seem to provide enough support to keep it tight over the whole length . I fiddled with it by moving the pole back and forth , and using the windshield as my `` extra support '' , but I was still a bit uneasy about it.We left on a 2 week vacation , and it rained very hard while we were gone , and I came back to two very large collections of water in my new cover -LRB- about a foot deep each -RRB- ; one in the main area of the boat and the other in the bow . The water apparently collected at such a pace that it pushed the straps apart from the middle , and then as it continued to collect , it stretched the straps and deepened the problem.When I finally syphoned the water off the cover , and got under it to drain it , I found that the pole was bent at one of the joints.I replaced this contraption with 3 vents and poles from boatvent.com , and I am very pleased to report that we just survived a torrential downpour with no water pooling . I can also report that the cover is much easier to put on since I do n't need to step over or scoot under the straps . I can also say that the support poles from boatvent.com are among the best I have used , and I highly recommend them.I can not recommend this product to any boat owner .
 I would warn caution with this machine . I am a healthy female ... I excercise regularly and am in very good shape . I can do sit ups and crunches with no problems . I was very excited with this product . I got it because I get bored with plain crunches . . It DID work I must say ... only somehow it tore one of my rib muscles on the right side . It took about 6 months to really heal . My chiropractor said it is a simple muscle to tear , and it was very painful and annoying because ... who knew that one tiny muscle would effect so many moves that you do with your body ! So 6 months of pain thanks to this product . If you DO get it go VERY slowly and if you feel ANY `` bad '' pain STOP RIGHT AWAY ! Good luck -LRB- ps , I prefer the 6 second abs machine ... that really works and I like the 1 . .2 . .3 click down and 1 . .2 . .3 click up.The 6 second ab machine comes with 55lbs of resistance ... in a band - the machine is n't heavy only about 1 lb or so ... you can also order the upgrade of 75lbs resistance band ... You could of course do plain old crunches but I find those SOboring everyday , but I do n't get bored with the 6 second ab machine.BUT this ab slider machine REALLY sucked ... I am glad that my muscle FINALLY healed . I would advise AGAINST the ab slider , persoanlly . ~ Stephanie Thiess
 prompt delivery and i got what i ordered . what i didnt exspect was the awful chemical smell . i have had it hanging outside for a month and it still reeks . I wont be able to use it for a deer blind . because the deer will smell it from the next county .
 The game is rich in concept . However , in our experience , portions of the game are essentially unplayable because of severe inconsistencies with motion detection during short game and especially putting . Consequently , it 's impossible learn the right way to do some things because the exact same motion will be interpreted differently -LRB- or wo n't be interpreted at all -RRB- by the system each time you do it . Our Wii works great with Wii Sports and Wii Play . No problems with the remote -LRB- s -RRB- with those games . So our conclusion is that the experience is subpar -LRB- but not under par -RRB- with Tiger Woods 07 for the Wii .
 I am going to keep it short and sweet . It should be easy to make a good golf game with the wii remote . Here is where EA went wrong I think .1 . Graphics are lacking even for the wii .2 . No left handed option . You can swing left handed , but your ball will slice right a lot . I mean a lot .3 . You need to watch the screen to hit the ball . very counter-intuitive for real golfers .4 . the menu system is very unintuitive.That game is not unplayable . Its actually kind of fun once you get to the course and your able to hit with the power that you want to hit with and everything registers okay . unfortuatly the other half of the time it is very frustrating .
 I 've had this game for about a week now . At first I was really thinking I kept hooking my shots to the right because I was n't swinging accurately . So i was really excited about being able to improve with time and practice . But after many hours of concentrating , and watching the remote swing perfectly , still , 9 times out of 10 it hooks to the right . At this point it 's much more common for me to be hitting from the rough on my second shot than it is from the fairway . So that 's my first BIG complaint - I ca n't hit a straight shot for a life of me , and when I finally do it seems completely random and without reason . This last game I started only holding the remote with one hand , and as I bring it down to swing , I twist it in towards my body like I 'm bowling , and then it hits straight . There 's something very wrong with the controls here.My second HUUUUGE complaint is that about 25 % of the time when I 'm putting , the game will think I 'm swinging forward when I 'm still bringing my club backward !! AHH !!!! I 've lost the same event two times in a row against a computer controlled character because of this . I just got so frustrated about 5 minutes ago I almost threw my controller at the TV.The other thing that really bugs me about this game are the graphics . I understand it 's the Wii and not the 360 or PS3 . But they put gratuitous things in the game like animals running around in the background , and they took seemingly NO care with them to make them look anything beyond terrible . Why put a deer in the background if it 's going to make the game look bad ? Add it if it 'll enhance the atmosphere , but if you ca n't make it look good , take the stupid things out . The golf characters all look pretty good , and the grass and trees all look pretty good . I bought the Wii for gameplay though , not graphics . For that I have a nice PC.I LOVED Wii Sports Golf . But it was really short and way too easy . So I was excited about the prospect of a content-rich golf game using the Wii remote . But this game makes me want to throw it out my window and put in Wii sports ... at least that 's fun !
 But something needs to be said . The reason I 'm writing this review is that Tiger Woods uses deception to trick people into voting against things that they , in fact , support . Before examining the present situation , however , it is important that I tell it like it is . Lest you think that I 'm talking out of my hat here , I should point out that he twists every argument into some sort of `` struggle '' between two parties . Tiger unvaryingly constitutes the underdog party , which is what he claims gives him the right to promote the total destruction of individuality in favor of an all-powerful group . Now that I 've said what I had to say , I should remark that this review may not endear me to some people . Indeed , it may even cost me a friend or two . However , friends do not let friends get trampled by batty tightwads like Tiger Woods . The truth is the truth and we pay a steep price whenever we ignore it .
 A detailed game of golf played with the Wii Remote ; it sounds like a winner , does n't it ? For the first hour or so it really is -- then the problems start to become more and more apparent . First of all , the game is very , very hard . That 's not necessarily a problem . I 'm a big fan of hard games . However , a lot of the things that make it so hard just should n't exist.The biggest of these is the `` phantom '' or `` ghost '' swing as most people call it . You 're in the process of drawing back the Wii remote , getting ready to clobber the ball , when suddenly the game decides that you 've followed through already and you end up hitting it far right for a measly 65 % . There is nothing like already having committed 40 minutes to a tournament only to have it all go straight down the drain because of one fluke swing . There are plenty of `` fixes '' out there for that problem , but like cures for hiccups , none of them work for everyone.The second is the way the game chooses the difficulty level for tournaments . If you do well in the first round , you 'd better play perfect in all the rest because the CPU golfers certainly will . It 's very unforgiving and the solution seems to be to intentionally play horribly the first round , but honestly , where 's the fun in that ? How do you make sure you do n't overdo it so the AI gets too easy and you just end up cheating?Another problem is the actual power on your swing can be seemingly inconsistent with what the game tells you . I wish I could tell you exactly what the problem is , but I honestly do n't know . It does n't seem to have to do with accuracy , the rough , the wind , or the extra 10 % on the power meter . Sometimes the ball just wants to go a lot farther than it should . Also , with putting , it seems to automatically limit how much power you can actually use based on the distance to the hole . This can make long puts impossible if they 're uphill at all , because the game will often refuse to let you go over the required distance.Other complications include the incredibly short and useless manual , the annoying commentators that have absolutely nothing useful to say , and the inexcusably bad menus that are an absolute pain to navigate through . All of this adds up to an incredibly frustrating experience that makes me want to recreate my remote throwing days from when I was eight years old . If they end up doing Tiger Woods 08 for the Wii the way they should have done 07 , I 'll buy it in a heartbeat . Here 's hoping , but I 'm not holding my breath .
 Being a software developer , I understand a thing or two about how hard it 's going to be to make a really good golf game for the Wii . This game has obvious bugs that can not be ignored , and if EA was n't so interested in rushing it out the door for an ` on time ' delivery they could have done a really good job.The Good : The game -LRB- when the controls work -RRB- is so much more fun than any other console golf game.The Technical Bug : The widely talked about controller glitch . Even setting the swing difficulty to ` easy ' does not completely alleviate this . The best way to avoid this is to take a fast backswing . The slower your backswing the more likely this annoying ` feature ' is to show itself.The Annoying things that EA could have , and should have fixed : The menu is maddenly frustrating to navigate because they decided that the Wii-mote pointing should trigger the scrolling of the menu . . this results in your menus scrolling out of control because you moved your wii-mote to the wrong area of the screen.I 've yet to find a way to set the power on my putting guage . Similar to other golf games , you have short , medium and long putts . In TW , I think they forgot to give you control over which one you 're using . It 's unsanely frustrating when you have a 55ft flat putt and can only make the ball go 50ft -LRB- tip
 I 'm a low handicapper and avid golfer . I bought a Wii for this game . All I have now is disappointment . It just is n't fun . Bottom line , I leave frustrated after every round.I 'm mad at Tiger Woods . He did that ad . He 's played the game . It 's his name and he let his good name be tied to a crappy product . EA ported this onto the Wii without putting enough effort into it . Wii Sports golf has better play control than this.What 's wrong ? 1 -RRB- the play control is just plain terrible . I 've got a good golf swing and I have to abandon it to contort myself out of it to play the game .2 -RRB- putting is a joke . If you actually take a real putting stoke , most of the time it does n't even register .3 -RRB- the B button is a bad choice for the button to hold to swing . The A button -LRB- like Wii sports -RRB- allows you to press the button more easily without messing up your swing4 -RRB- graphics are n't great but I can live with that.Wii sports golf is better . Perhaps the EA monopoly on golf games can be broken by someone actually making a serious golf game that is actually fun to play -LRB- Golden Tee guys where are you ? -RRB- . Testing notes ... the game only really seems to register the angle of the Wii remote but not the position . I get the best results by not swinging at all and instead just swiveling my wrist alone . Moving the Wii side to side while keeping it vertical does n't seem to do anything.Seriously , Tiger , if you ever read this , let 's talk . You need someone to do some QA on anything that has your name on it . The majority of your earnings come from your brand and you 're polluting it by letting products like this get released .
 Unless $ 50 is pocket change to you and you are a video golf nut , pass on Tiger Woods ' 07 . I bought this game after playing the Wii Golf -LRB- in the Wii Sports package -RRB- and really enjoying it . Of course , Tiger Woods is great in the way that you can outfit your character , play real courses , play different modes , etc. . But the main reason for the Wii to exist -- swinging the Wii remote `` like a golf club '' needs IMMENSE improvement.I have had the game for almost a week and have played quite a bit . It is still EXTREMELY difficult to hit a good , solid , straight shot . It can be done , but I find myself having to swing my arm so hard in such a herky-jerky manner that my arm is literally in pain . I do n't know about you , but I do n't really want to have my right arm sore because of a stupid video game . I should say that I am a reasonably athletic 30 year of man and a decent golfer . I 'm not some total pansy , but swinging the Wii remote for Tiger Woods is MUCH more difficult than swinging a real golf club.Second and worse are the horrible glitches in the game . It takes quite a while to get the hang of the swing -LRB- you have to be COMPLETELY still before you start your backswing or else the remote will read it as a swing and hit is about 50 % -RRB- . This obviously screws you if you are playing in a PGA event . Even with lots of practice , I still get the glitch quite often on my putting . So if I play a round of 18 for a PGA event , I lose probably 5-6 shots because of glitches in the program -- not cool.I think that golf for Wii has a ton of potential and I am very hopeful that EA will sort out the problems with this game -- make it glitch free and less physically demanding . Again , unless $ 50 is nothing to you , pass this one up and hope for either A -RRB- improvements to the '08 game or B -RRB- Nintendo to produce a game similar to the Wii Golf but with more courses , types of games , etc. . Either that or just stick with the Wii Golf ! I probably should have spent my money on the `` Super Swing Golf '' which looks silly , but at least I would n't have myself headed to a Tommy John surgery with the stupid Tiger Woods ' 07 .
 For some odd reason the golfer will randomly swing at the ball -LRB- duffing it way off couse -RRB- while the Wiimote is pointed straight at the sky with the B button FIRMLY pressed . Highly frustated !!!! The controls in the menu screens are really hard to use as well . This game had potential to be freakin sweet , but it fell short .
 I assumed this game would have the same controls as the golf in Wii Sports , maybe even better , and that 's what broke my heart . Everything else about this game is great , but the controls just kill it .
 The Tiger Woods Golf is one of the worst things to happen to me this week . After playing and loving the Wii Sports golf , I was pretty excited to buy this one , but would now like my money back.The graphics are awful and make everyone look like a hideous monster.The controls are touchy , erratic , and sometimes possessed.The game is unnecessarily complicated.You ca n't choose your course.You can only use one Wii remote.You ca n't opt to do a shorter game.The remote somehow would be hitting the ball before I finished my backswing.We put the game away , forever .
 If you 've played Wii Tennis , you know how accurate & sensitive -LRB- hitting the ball left / right , topspin / backspin -RRB- the Wiimote can be . Why could n't they have put -LRB- at least some of -RRB- the same technology into this game ? If you are an avid golfer , you will be disappointed . Save your money & play Wii golf ...
 ... and I 'm usually not very critical but they controls were awful . I 'm a huge fan of the past offerings of this game . This one just did n't cut it . Using the nunchuk is tons better than using the wiimote but it still lacks considerably compared to say the 2004 ps2 edition . Putting , OMG , and hitting a half-swing shot is impossible with the wiimote . I 'll give it a two because it 's there first offering with the wii and honestly I 'm glad that they released this game for the wii but I ca n't deny that I was dissappointed . Like and earlier post , I was worried that I 'd mess up my real golf swing trying to adapt to this game and it 's inaccurate controls . I have n't sliced a ball in God knows how long but I was a regular `` hack '' on this game . My advise would be to rent first even if your a long standing fan of the series . Approach with caution ...
 Graphics are real grainny , poor quality gets old real quick . Needs work should be really cool in a couple of Versions . But now my guys dont even bother with it .
 Terrible game play as usual from EA.Poorly implemented conroller action .
 The controls of this game are broken.When you start to swing and take the Wiimote back , even just a few inches , your game character already does a full backswing.Sometimes the game character swings on it 's own , specially when putting.I 'm sticking to Wii Sports Golf .
 I was VERY excited when this game was released for the Wii , so I ran out and bought it immediately . Madden for the Wii was such a great , new interpretation that I thought this , my favorite PC game for years , would be a gaming breakthrough . After several hours of attempted gameplay , I have been severely underwhelmed . I applaud the effort to take advantage of Wii 's novel interface , but the control algorithms and utilization of the Wii control 's sensors for this game are very buggy . Many times during a normal swing the system registers a swing either starting during my backswing -LRB- resulting in 50 % - ish strength shot in some random direction -RRB- , does n't register my swing at all , or is quite erratic in how it registers my swing when it picks it up as you would normally expect.I will be trying the old-style controls with the nunchuk controller , but this takes away the game play advantage of the Wii - I would much rather play this on a game system with better graphics if forced to use old-style controls.Save yourself the $ $ and frustration and buy the Tiger Woods version for your PC , Xbox , or PS3 and enjoy endless hours of gaming - the Wii version is a poor effort . It makes me very , very sad to say this as I was looking forward to this being the `` coolest thing ever ! ''
 This game is absolute garbage . I have nothing good to say about it . The controls are so messed up it seems like they spent about 4 minutes writing that part of the game . It finishes your full swing about half way through your back swing over half the time and gives really , really low power.When you do manage to do well in a tournament , it 's all over if that was your first day . You ca n't win it . If you 're in first place after the first day , the other golfers start having insanely good scores -LRB- usually around -16 to -18 -RRB- . If you get lucky and have a good first day , you are better off not saving the game - you 'll never be able to beat those -16 to -18 scores the game thinks it needs to give your opponents.As everyone else has said , the graphics suck . Not just how poor they look at any given time , but the frame rates are terrible too most of the time.The sound is also horrid . I 'm amazed they could get that wrong , but it seems that every golf course in the world is completely surrounded by hundreds of air ports and dogs . The commentators are equally annoying . If I made a mediocre shot -LRB- like getting within inches of the hole after a 55 foot putt -RRB- I doubt it 's the `` worst putt '' you 've ever seen . Good thing these morons can be turned off.I think it 's clear that this game was rushed and that EA did n't bother to do ANY play testing at all before shipping this out the door -LRB- having the developers play-test does n't count - I mean real testing with real gamers that do n't know the game already -RRB- . The tournament scoring thing is about the worst bug of them all . It 's clearly intentional and it completely prevents winning first place if you do well on day one . No one finishes -18 . The people in this game are finishing with 53 , 54 , or 55 as the norm . This makes Wayne Meyers ' 57 at Southern Oaks look like a joke .
 This game at first looks seems amazing , but as you play it , you bump into the swing bug . If you want to play the game where you actually use the controller as a golf club , you `` lose '' swings . Occasionally , -LRB- about 4 times in a 9 hole round for me -RRB- , the game misses your swing . You take your backswing as normal , but when you bring it around for the hit , the game jumps the gun and hits it too early . This results in a weak , off target shot.I ca n't think of anything more frustrating than to play a good hole right up to the short shot and then have the game mess up in this way , causing you to lose the hole and possibly the match.In short , this game is bugged . Do n't buy it !

 I experienced the same issues with the shipping as many others have . It took 3 times to get all the parts arriving at the same time . I also was very excited to give it a try . I tried it in all snow conditions and also had my malamute hooked up to pull as well . It was a piece of junk , rip off 300 dollars down the toilet . It just would not do any sliding at all . I also bought the floats they too would not stay on . I do not recommend this sled to anyone . BEWARE it is a flimsy piece of junk .
 I read the reviews on here and was excited to get this sled since I have 2 huskies . I figured they could pull me around on this thing . I just got the sled a few days ago , first off the packaging was not the greatest , the parts were all over in the box and I was missing bolts and nuts . Then I discovered that one of the handles was already broken when I pulled it out of the box . I proceeded to put the sled together anyway , I got new bolts from the hardware store , I also got some wood glue and fixed the handle . I noticed that the sled was kind of flimsy once I got it put together , I also got snow floats and they did n't stay on very well . I had to modify them with extra zip ties to get them to stay on . Now I was to the point where I had the sled ready and it was time for some fun , or so I thought . I just got back from trying to use this piece of junk . The best way to describe this sled was flimsy and poorly built . I tried to let my girlfriend ride on it while I pushed and my dogs pulled . This did not work very well , the sled was not sturdy enough for this . It was n't even sturdy enough for me to ride by myself . When I was trying to push with one foot on a runner the whole sled was flexing and bending , even when I was just trying to go down a hill by myself the thing did not feel sturdy , the runners constantly bend and flex back and forth . The snow floats did n't seem to help it go through the powdery snow either , I do n't think they are wide enough . I am very disappointed in this product , I would not even recommend buying it for 100 dollars , let alone , the 300 I paid for the sled and the floats . Please do n't make the same mistake I did , do n't buy this thing .

 For the price of $ 14.99 combined with other things to get free shipping , it 's a good deal . If you want the red of Spiderman to look red vs. orange , you wo n't be happy - hence the warning about the colors not being the same . The graphics on the bottom of the board are defective and it 's peeling straight out of the box . Since this was bought as a gift , I 'm not taking it away from a child since they 're happy with it . It 's good for a beginner , but the grip and graphics will need changing pretty fast - so if you 're buying it for a cheap board , great - if you 're buying it because it 's Spiderman ... it 's more like a peeling Pumpkinman .

 I bought another pack from this company -LRB- BeltPac -RRB- , and while I did test the pack as described in the instructions , the pack leaked when I used it in the sea , destroying my phone and my mp3 player . I contacted Aquapac , as they claim to have a warranty if the pack if used apropriately , but they refused to refund me the pack or the content that was destroyed -LRB- MP3 player + phone -RRB- . BEWARE WHEN YOU BUY ON OF THESE PACKS
 I just received this case and was intending to use it on a cruise that I am taking for underwater photos so I wouldnt ruin my $ $ camera . The plastic that it is made out of seems very durable but it is so thick and unmovable that my hands can not adjust any of the controls on my camera . I just about fit the camera through the opening of the bag . There also is a lot of excess room in the bag -LRB- once you get it in -RRB- that the camera does not stay in place and you have to try to readjust it -LRB- which is almost impossible -RRB- . I have not yet tried to actually use this case for photo taking but I think that it is still going to be useful just to keep my camera dry while taking it to the beach and on ship excursions . I would recommend this bag to someone who wants to keep their digital camera dry but not for picture taking in the water .
 I bought the AquaPac based largely on the glowing reviews I read from all over the Internet but I was very disappointed . I tried it first with a Canon G6 and it barely fit ; when it was securely in place and the camera was turned on the bag almost prevented the lens from extending . I tried pictures indoors with a flash , which produced an image of a large , white blob , then without the flash , which produced out of focus images . My G6 never properly focused while in the bag , so I tried my Minolta Dimage X60 , which fit very well but gave the same results . I tried the bag with the X60 in bright sunlight and out of about 6 pictures only one was acceptable , but even it had a bluish haze . The other photos had a more pronounced haze and not a single one was in focus -- and this was in bright sunlight ! I 'm not sure what I can do now beyond paying nearly $ 200 for a camera-specific waterproof case , but the AquaPac is definitely not the solution .
 I bought one in L , and although it said L on the product as well , it was more like XXXL . Simply put , I was unable to wear it.The quality of the product is very good , but beware of the sizing issue . Go Yanks !
 I used a similiar AB machine in the gym . The AB roller/trainer design does work the AB muscles well while protecting the lower back . A number of different AB excercises can be done . My issue is this model . It 's made of very cheap materials . The design is too low and too wide . $ 60.00 for a product of this low quality is completely unacceptable to me . Find a better quality item . The concept works great but I recommend you stay away from this one .
 I 've used professional models of these ab trainers , and this item appeared to be comparable in the photos . Upon opening the package & inspecting the parts , the metal tubing used seems to be adequate , and the hardware looks to be typical `` Made in China '' junk . The armpads & headrest are vinyl-covered pieces of foam over wood backing , poorly stapled & finished . The assembly instruction book is horrendous . Vague and tiny hand-drawn diagrams with confusing , poorly written instructions . I was shorted one screw , and supplied with four plastic spacers that do not appear in the assembly diagram , and are not mentioned ANYWHERE in the instructions . A big disappointment .
 Do n't purchase this item ... it shipped without the hardware fitting and the directions are idiotic . Additionally , it is made for someone who is n't short ... so make sure you know the measurements of how you will fit in it . I am angry I spent good money on this .
 hurting neck like crazy.tried to exercise . . now looks like I might have to visit chiropractor if neck pain does n't go away . total regrets evening trying it once . how could they put this product on the market ?!?!?
 I write it all off as my fault , but before I purchased this ab roller , I was looking at where your body would bend and how your arms are STILL moving with all the rest of your weight . So imagine not using the ab roller ... your arms STILL move with your weight . I should have gone with my initial thoughts that your arms ca n't assist in relieving any stress since all your weight moves the same as not using it . There is very little difference using this thing . Sure your head has a pillow , but somehow I thought there would be some relief for my lower back . There is none , so this product is worthless to me.Thanks , KarlSpring , Tx .
 first all the work equipment that is simaler or exactly same design as this one here do your self a favor save your money & do not buy it i tried this it does not work i got past 30 reps using this machine or another just like this one with differnt design types i felt nothing.dont buy this and other machines that have handle bars on each side with the wheel in the middle tehy dont work either i have yet to find one that really works & does not put strain on my neck
 Terrible experience . I ordered two sleds for my granddaughters . When the sleds arrived , the shipping cartons were in tatters , and the sleds were not the model ordered . I was required to pay the return shipping cost of $ 115.98 . The second shipment contained a badly damaged sled -LRB- the front of the sled was completely split in half -RRB- , and the second sled was a different wood than advertised . Once again , the shipping cartons were in shambles . Once again , I was required to pay the return shipping costs of $ 97.75 . Amazon advised they would credit my credit card with the original puchase price -LRB- $ 468.96 -RRB- , but would not reimburse the return shipping costs . I 've always had a good experience with Amazon until now , but then it was just books and cd 's primarily before . Think I 'll just stick to books and cd 's from now on .

 I bought these for my 4 year old , knowing he would n't be able to wear them long , but thought they would be a good beginner skate for him and then we 'll get him new ones for his birthday in a few months . He wears an 11 1/2 , and the shoe would n't even fit in his skate . We pulled out 11 's , and they did n't fit with his feet in the shoes , though we could cram them in without his shoes on his feet . So , they will go back tomorrow and we 'll just get him regular skates .
 This item is not a good product . The adjust ability is okay but you will have to shop for special flat shoes in order for the shoes to fit into the front end of the skates . My son wore them once .
 The sizing is way off on these skates . The package says size 6 - 12 shoes , but my son 's size 10 sneaker has to be jammed into the largest skate setting and it still does n't rest on the bottom of the skate . We tried the same skates out a couple of months ago when he wore sandals , but a thicker shoe just is n't fitting . We like the fact that you get the pads and skates together , but we 'll have to return the set since we want to use the skates longer . Unless your child has a small foot , I would n't recommend these skates .

 I am still frustrated by how slippery my mat continues to be after 16 months of regular practice . I have cleaned it , let it set in the sun , cleaned it a different way , let it get sweaty , cleaned it yet another way . It is still slippery when I sweat a bit . I continue to be disappointed . Not worth the $ 90 I paid , even if it does last a lifetime .
 I 'm an avid yoga practioner . I used a mat that cost me $ 10.00 at a chain pharmacy that was way better than this overpriced and awful product . My cheap mat died after 3 yeras of service . So , I decided to upgrade and buy a new mat . So , I begun to research the field and Manduka mats was point out as one of the pros and in every site have rave reviews . So , I order it . I was so excited when I received my new mat . The excitement disappear as soon as I started to use it and do n't came back . Basically , it failed in its golden promise of no slipping , among other failures . I do n't stop slipping in it to the point that is mere impossible to hold a downward facing dog . I have better traction with my cheap mat.So , recently , I started thinking that people gave this poor quality product awesome reviews to convince peolple to buy it because they do n't want to be the only ones stupid enough to trash this insane amount of money for this joke of mat . I do n't write reviews often but I really want to help others and advice them to not waste your money in this mat ; better spend it in yoga classes at your studio or yoga dvds or a cheaper mat or donate the money . Whatever you do with the money you will love it and more importantly you will not hate yourself for spending this insane amount of money for a product that is not worth it . So , my final recommendation is buy a cheaper mat and a microfiber towel for i , if you want , and you are totally good to keep it going .
 I bought this mat because it had excellent reviews and it is supposed to last a lifetime . At the beginning of my practice it does stick quite well but after only about 5 to 10 minutes my hands and feet have begun sweating and it does n't stick at all . It was not an exaggeration in the other review that it 's like practicing on ice . I have done 6 practices on it and cleaned it twice with no improvement . So , if you 're the kind of person that does n't sweat then this mat will probably be great but if , like me , you sweat quite a bit then you will be better off with a $ 20 mat you can find at Target .
 I wanted a high quality yoga mat that was long in length because I am a tall person . I thought I had picked the perfect mat when I ordered this one . I did n't have a problem with the length -LRB- although it smelled that new plastic stench -RRB- but I did have a problem with the weight . This mat is HEAVY ! I knew it would be HEAVY when I purchased it and being a person in somewhat good shape I did n't think I would mind it but I did n't realize that it would be cumbersome . The last straw that made me want to return it was when I was in a yoga class ; sweating and I began to slip on the mat . If I am going to spend this amount of money on a yoga mat I do n't want any problems . To Amazon 's credit I was able to return it and they paid for postage . If I would have had to pay for the return postage myself it would have cost a lot because of how HEAVY it is but I would have paid it anyway -LRB- that should tell you how much I did n't like it -RRB- . I am now looking for a long mat but lighter and toxic free . I want something that will be biodegradable . The problem now is there are so many mats available -LRB- too many choices can be just as frustrating as too few -RRB- .
 In many ways this is a nice yoga mat . It is built from a sturdy rubber . You can tell it wo n't disintegrate over time like most of my mats have . It has a nice weight and thickness providing good cushioning from any hard floor without being too spongy or floaty.But my main reason for buying this mat was to reduce or eliminate slippage due to sweat . I generally do a pretty hardcore yoga session for about 1.5 hours and produce a decent amount of sweat . My hands and feet get sweaty and sweat drips off my torso onto the mat . My cheapo Target yoga mat is decent . It has a porous foam base to it and the sweat gets absorbed away from the surface.The Manduka is clearly a closed pore rubber . There 's no where for the sweat to go . It sits on top of the mat . And thus , no surprise , it 's incredibly slippery . Ice skating rink slippery . I simply can not hold moves and I have almost slipped and fallen as I was prepping for the starts of moves . It 's a complete non-starter . Clearly others have run into this problem -LRB- just check out the 1 and 2 star reviews -RRB- but you also see it in some of the 5 star reviews if you look closely . One lady who gave the mat 5 stars admitted it was slippery but rationalized that it would make the yoga workout that much better.But what really annoys me about this mat is the ` break-in ' instructions . The mat , once shipped , needs to be cleaned of a film on the mat . The company has some instructions on their site and other people have commented on various techniques they 've used . I followed the company 's instruction . FIVE times . To no avail . But I have to ask . When I 'm spending over $ 100 on a piece of rubber , why on earth am i , a Manduka mat novice , being asked to perform what obviously seems like a hit or miss break-in procedure of the mat ? Why is n't the company doing this ? The mat presumably lasts forever so what special property does this film have ? It makes no sense . The company even sells a cleaning fluid . How about you just clean your mat before sending it to your customers . Does n't that make sense?At any rate . This is going back .

 This net rotted out in less than 6 months . It is nylon , as was my last net , but my last net lasted a couple of years . This net completely disintrigrated . I will go with a metal chain net .
 I bought this heavy and impressive knife about 2-months ago after reading positive comments here at Amazon.com . I 'm a retired engineer , and I used to read reviews of former consumers before I buy items from Amazon.com or eBay.com . However , I 'm so disappointed today when I was using this beautiful Tomahawk Bowie Knife the handle broke from the body . I 'm sure this is an American design but manufactured in China , made of 1/8 '' thick stainless steel . I had used this for trimming around four branches of my overgrown tree of around 2-inch diameter ; and that was smooth cutting with this sharp machete . But , today Friday , April 13 , 2012 , I was chopping St. Augustine grass sods into smaller square plugs , the handle broke while I was on my sixth grass sod . I noticed the `` neck '' that connects the body to the handle is just 1/8 '' thick by 3/4 '' wide stainless steel , and I believe the metal is brittle . I took few photos of the broken handle , and I wish I can upload it here or send them to Tomahawk for engineering analysis . They can make the neck wider into 1-1/8 '' from their present 3/4 '' , and then test it again before marketing . I hate to see this beautifully designed machete broke . The handle , by-the-way looks like wood , but it 's a nice and hard plastic . I have no complain on the nylon sheath , 'cause I do n't go camping nor hunting anymore .
 It looks very cheap when put on your car . I dont feel like I was cheated at all I am just not happy with the quality of the product .

 When i got the chain it looked nice seemed a good buy for the price . and then after installing it and trying to adjust my new rear derailleur the chain kept skipping ... i thought it may have been the wrong size -LRB- i have a 12 speed -RRB- but come to find out it 's not one but 2 barrings in the chain that are seized ! i ended up swapping out a couple of links from my broken chain . will not buy again and recommend that you do not either .
 At 5 ' 6 '' and 133 pounds the size medium in these coldgear tights was FAR AND AWAY too uncomfortable to wear . I see other reviews commenting on the tightness of the ankles but the waist band is nothing more than a small bit of elastic string that literally digs into the top of my hips and stomach while I run.For my money , Target makes a pair of cold weather insulated tights in their C9 line that are fantastic . Skip the under armor , and their lofty price tag and get thee to Target for a much more comfortable , affordable option .
 The material for these supposedly `` frosty tights '' are too thin . Not a great material for Chicago winter running .
 Product is meant to be compression tights but it is a bit loose . I 'm 5 ' 8 and of average built and it is loose from the hips down . I ordered two of different sizes , one for my friend and the company sent two of the same size . When I contacted them requesting for a change as they were the one who made the mistake , they told me I have to bear the cost of the shipment as I live outside US . I emailed them several times but they refused to bear the cost . I am very disappointed as that was my very first online purchase from Amazon . I have expected US companies to have excellent customer service but apparently , this is not so . Disappointing experience .
 The crimper is not the one you expect in the picture , it is substantially cheaper . Mine was delivered without the torch and I would have to return the entire kit , just to have another shipped . This is ridiculous . Ancor and Amazon should be ashamed.I 'm considering not buying another Ancor product ever . Also , not being able to get anyone from Amazon on the phone or chat box that can fix this without going through a full return process is painful .
 Before you buy this kit , be aware that it does not contain the Ancor 701030 Marine Grade Electrical Double Crimp Ratchet Tool , which is a good tool . Rather , the crimper is a less expensive version , the butane `` torch '' is essentially a lighter -LRB- mine did n't work -RRB- and you would get more useful connectors by buying the Ancor 220020 Marine Grade Electrical Twin Kit Electrical Repair Kit ... for only $ 56.00 ! This must be mispriced ... I ca n't believe I bought it ... do n't make the same mistake ... gary
 For my team we all ordered these socks . I found the only good thing about them is that they have an Under Armour logo . wearing them is a totally different story . They are uncomfortable and thin . They cause feet to sweat even before any physical activity . In a 30F game my feet still sweat . After you sweat in them they will just get slippery and cause one to slide in the cleat , loosing speed and agility .
 these socks are hot , not exactly comfortable for work in combination with tennis shoes.Your feet will likely sweat . Im going to go back to clima-cool .
 These socks are n't as good as my other ua products . I wear a size 10 in men 's shoes and have narrow feet . In all my other ua socks , I wear a lg . The toe box area in these socks is too loose and the material is n't as comfortable as ua normally is . My calves are med sized , and the top of the sock is too tight and does n't expand that much . Overall , subpar -LRB- by ua standards -RRB- product . Would buy again at a clearance price . The seller on the other hand was good . Fast shipment and great updates . Thanks again amazon for a very good buying experience .
 I ORDERED NAVY SOCKS AND GOT WHITE SOCKS ... MY HUSBAND NEEDED THESE SOCKS FOR HIS FOOTBALL GAME AND THIS IS WHAT HE RECIEVED . THANKS
 these were -LRB- just -RRB- ok , although socks are socks ... these socks are very slick on the outside . If you are at a higher level of competition and make hard cuts , these will give you blisters even if your soccer boots are well broken in . I gave them 5 good washes after the initial use , and then used them again , and still I got blisters ... . I do n't get blisters with other brands -LRB- in the same shoes -RRB- , sorry under armour I wo n't buy your soccer products again !!!!
 I ordered Under Armour Allsport Socks size Large and Navy blue . I received white XL socks . I 've worn the white socks once and -LRB- of course -RRB- they are stained from the infield dirt .
 If you 're a large man and get excited when you see `` extra large '' , just settle down . XL for whom ? They went back . And , as always with Amazon , we paid the return freight . But from this vendor , we also had to pay incoming freight , so two freight charges + no gloves = $ 14.58 . FOR NOTHING !

 Unfortunately , none of the images show the inside of the waistband which is exposed elastic -LRB- as opposed to the similar product by Russell -RRB- which I found irritating and uncomfortable ... enough so that I ordered theRussell Athletic Men 's Cotton Performance Baseline Shortwhich was larger -LRB- despite the same size labeling -RRB- , longer , had pockets , and is more comfortable to wear.The Champion shorts are fine , serviceable , and quite adequate ... just not as good as the Russells .
 I bought 5 pair of these because they looked like the longer knee length I wanted but turned out to be only mid thigh on a young man who 's 5 ' 9 '' . Even though they 're made of jersey knit , they 're rougher than others I 'd bought of the same material . For those 2 reasons , my son wo n't wear them . It 's not worth the expense of returning them so they sit unused in a box in his closet . I 'll probably just donate them to charity .
 I did n't get what was advertised the pants did n't fit good at all , it did n't even look like the picture shown.I wuda rate it &#34; 0 &#34; Rubbery
 Upon receiving these shorts , I was disappointed to find that they have no pockets . The website description did n't mention pockets at all , so i assumed they were there .
 Unfortunately the open space within the frame is n't large enough to reveal the letters/numbers on my license plate . It even covers the registration stamp in the upper right . The clearance is only 4 '' from top to bottom so I ca n't use it with my California license plate . Measure before ordering .
 The fabric feels fake and it makes me itch , and the the inside material sheds for numerous washings -- I will never buy 50 50 blends again , 80 cotton 20 polyester is my new minimum -- The hoodie looks good but feels terrible .
 When this item arrived a week ago , I was disappointed that there was only one pair of socks despite the description of three pairs . I contacted Amazon customer service and they promptly sent a replacement , again only one pair of socks . Since the two pairs of socks that I did receive were high-quality , I requested that I keep these as fulfillment of my order . Three emails later , Amazon refused my request and indicated that I should return the items at their cost . While I am not out any money , it was a hassle to return the items . I order a lot from Amazon , once or twice a week on average . They have the best customer service department of any website that I have dealt with . However , they let me down on this one and I am disappointed with Amazon . They need to change their website . If you order this item , you will receive one pair of socks .
 Do not buy this unless you are going to be in the best of weather . It will not survive any sort of wind . I spent one night in it and the next night found it torn to pieces by the wind before we ever made it to bed . There are not enough guy points -LRB- a nearly identical $ 200 model by another manufacturer has twice the guy points -RRB- and the guylines and stakes provided are inadequate . The pole had gone through the floor and the pole was bent in half and the pole joints were jammed together . One of the guypoints had also torn out . Mine was tossed in the dumpster on the way home . It 's a good tent if you are certain the weather is going to be calm or you can do as I did , beg a bunk in a friend 's motorhome .
 It was some funky presta valve tube . Had no idea what that meant , now I do !
 Slime in tubes is like eating fast food . It sometimes does the trick , it sometimes makes you sick . As a professional bike mechanic , I have pulled thorns out of tubes with slime and it sometimes holds the air and sometimes a small green puddle hisses at you , almost making fun of you for filling your ties with something that looks like antifreeze and has the consistency of snot . There are more effective and lightweight latex tire fillers commonly used on tubeless tires that I have pulled countless thorns out of with no leakage , but to me the best possible fix are Rema patches . Never once , when properly applied , have I had one of those fail .
 I 've used about four of these things and have n't noticed an appreciable difference between a good regular tube . I have had two blow immediately -LRB- one within a couple of days and yesterday after five hours -RRB- . When the second one blew it left a large amount of bright green slime all inside my tire and over the inside of the rim . Real fun to clean off on a long ride . Wo n't be purchasing these again , feel it 's mostly hype .
 Amazon has a picture of Slime Lite tubes , but shipped regular slime tubes . And it 's hardly worth returning them considering the shipping cost.Slime lite tubes are a great product . Slime tubes are very heavy , but OK if you are not concerned about that .
 I 'm not sure if it was just a mistake of an emplyoee , but I received a bike tube in a white box . There was no brand name and explanation ; just a tube in a while box . I just did not return the item because I was just lazy . So , I warn you that you might receive something you did not expect .
 Many a time have I pulled out the tube to find green liquid hissing from pinholes far smaller than 1/8th inch , leaving nothing but a Slime-y mess . Do n't bother .
 Heavy , relatively expensive and messy when it splits open - I do n't know there 's any argument here.But that 's OK - if it really prevents a flat . I do n't know , I 'm staring at one now after biking through thorns last week . Apparently a slow leak that 's gone flat over a week . But , is n't that what the slime tube was supposed to prevent ? I guess the argument is it could have gone flat on the mountain . Kinda like the absence of something happening is the value statement for why you should believe in something that appears to accomplish nothing good . A faith-based belief in Slime.I 've used them on my MTBs for a long time , but I 'm done with their products .
 I have not had much luck with these tubes actually performing as they say . They do n't really seal small punctures like a mesquite thorn or cactus . I 've had way too many times where I have come out and found the tire down , green slime running out on the floor and all there was was a very small puncture . I 've finally switched to Stans No Tubes .
 No visible thorns or punctures , my new tube developed two tiny , tiny pinholes within the first 5 miles of use . The slime did not seal these holes at all . The holes were so small , I was just dumfounded at the difference between the claims of this product and the actual , miserable results . There might as well have been water in the tube . When I tried to fix the holes with self stick and then normal patches , the slime prevented the patches from adhering to the tube . A waste of time and money using these awful tubes .
 What can I say ... too late to return this . I was trying to replace a punctured tube on my mountain bike and this tube would not hold air . I thought it was just the valve sticking until I put it in the tire and mounted it on the rim . That 's when to my surprise I found that the valve stem came loose from the tube . I 've never had this happen with any other tube . I 'm not buying the slime tubes again . In fact , I 'll stick with local dealers so I can return defective products more easily . All I can say is I 'd be livid if this happened while I was 20 miles from home -LRB- of course I 'd still have a patch kit with me -RRB- ... Update October 2011
 ve been stranded twice by these tires . Sure it can fix some flats but if you get a pinch flat -LRB- common in the rockies -RRB- it does n't work . Worst of all the slime makes it so you ca n't patch the tire effectively -LRB- no matter how carefully you clean -RRB- . Avoid the gimmick and just use your $ 1 patch kit and do n't be stranded .
 The first thing you will notice is how heavy these tubes are next to a standard tube , but that is to be expected for the most part . If you are concerned about weight , stay away from these . When filling or checking pressure , the valve must be rotated to the top or you 'll shoot slime out of valve and in your pump -LRB- it is easy to forget this -RRB- . So far , I used the tube for about 100 miles of very rocky single track MTB with no problems , even aired down to 25 PSI . All the cons noted above are worth putting up with if it prevents even one flat . I have yet to prove the self-healing feature , but I am confident it will work.UPDATE 8/12/12 - the tube was punctured and the slime did not work . I will not purchase one of these again .
 First snake bite and it was gone . What an overweight and overpriced piece of crap . Not worth the cost , the time , or the heavy weight .
 I would give this zero stars if possible . I 'll just cut to the chase , THESE DO NOT WORK ! Do n't waste your money . After patching a tiny puncture the patch failed immediately after applying only 30 lbs to the remounted tire . Removed tire and re-patched using another Skab . The exact same thing occurred . Failure of the patch . These may be cheap and light but they suck at what they are supposed to do , patch an inner tube . I 'll probably avoid any Slime brand products from now on .
 I 've got a couple of these scab on a couple of tubes and I see that most leak . At first they work , but they do n't seem to handle inflation and deflation very well , they do n't stretch with the tube.All the other types of patches I 've ever used worked.Not worth the trouble .
 I had a small punture that was about 1/3 cm wide . I followed the instructions and used the patch after I roughened up the area . It looked like it was sealed properly , but within 12 hours the tire was flat again . I tried it again and this time I gave it a day to stick before I inflated the tire . It worked a little better , but still got flat . The only reason why I gave this product 2 stars is because the tire levers included makes it a whole lot easier to remove and replace the tire .
 Have used it two times , one leak after a few hour of rideanother after a few days.Bubble will form under the patch and eventually reach the edge and leak.Difficult to remove to use normal patch . Will just torn to pieces.Good for temp fix .
 Tried to use yesterday on a bike ride . Tiny hole . Would not hold air after 25 pounds . Do n't buy . Lucky I had spare tube with me .
 Tried this to patch a road bike tire , and it did n't work . Tried using glue with it and it still did n't work . It does hold a little pressure for a little while so it might work in an emergency to get you home , but if I take the trouble to pull the tube out of the tire I want to use a patch that will actually work !
 Absolutely terrible , leaked right away , i tried repatching it 3 times . The hole was not that big , the last time i tried using 4 at once all overlapping , did not help .
 I gave this product two stars because the tire levers work very well to pop the tire off the rim , and are much handier than , say , a pair of flat head screwdrivers or some other alternative for unseating the tire.However ... the patches are absolutely useless . I went through ALL of them trying to patch a small hole -LRB- actually , more like a narrow slit about 1/16 '' long -- no larger than a typical thorn puncture -RRB- in my daughter 's 12-1/2 '' x 1.75 bike tire tube . Although that tire only needs a relatively low 30 psi of pressure , the patches simply would not stay adhered . I tried roughing the spot -LRB- with the included metal scraper -RRB- more and more with each patch attempt until the tube looked VERY rough . No matter how rough the surface , nor how clean -LRB- I even tried mineral spirits to ensure there was no grease or debris preventing adhesion -RRB- , each time I pressed a patch in place , it would lift the instant I tried to inflate the tire . Usually , this happened before I could even pump 12 psi into it . I tried pumping in some air while plugging the leak with my finger and then adhering the patch -LRB- as a reviewer here recommends , even though that flatly contradicts the instructions -RRB- and it still did n't work . I tried letting a couple of the patches sit for an hour and six hours respectively , but it made no difference . -LRB- The instructions suggest that you can pump up the tire immediately , but I thought some drying/curing time might help the patch stick better . -RRB- I even tried two slightly overlapping patches , using one to cover the corner where the other patch was lifting . Nothing worked . Each time the patch , or patches , lifted somewhere to let the air flow freely out again.It gets worse ... on the last two attempts with these patches , I tried squirting Slime sealing fluid -LRB- sold separately -RRB- into the tube also . Even the two combined did not work , even though the bike shop assured me either product by itself should patch a hole as small as the one in my daughter 's tire -LRB- they told me these are rated to repair up to 1/8 '' round hole , which is much larger than what I was attempting to fix -RRB- . Ultimately , I ended up spending $ 5.99 to get a new tube , had to disassemble the rear axle , chain , and sprocket in order to put it on the rim . I had wanted to avoid that , which is why I bothered with two different Slime products . However , in retrospect , I wasted a lot of time and a little money on the Slime brand of patches and sealing fluid . The only thing I got any benefit from was the tire levers packaged with these patches , which were very handy for unseating the tire the six or seven times I took it off to try yet another patch.If you need a patch , get a more traditional patch with a large rubbery surface area and a tube of rubber cement or vulcanizing compound . If I had been able to find one , I know it would 've patched the hole in my daughter 's bike better and easier than fooling with this Slime product.For what it 's worth , I do n't usually review products I dislike because often I dislike it as a matter of preference , not because of some defect . But in this case , these patches were so inept at performing the simple function they were designed to do , that I feel obliged to warn people away from them .
 These work about half the time , which is no fun on the road . The rubber cement style patches work better , but take longer . Use the Park Tool patches . They are far better .
 I bought a pack of these once , and it was one of the worst purchases of my life . In short , after applying an entire pack of the things to the same leak the tube still would not hold enough air for me to move more than a few meters and I wound up walking 8 miles with loaded panniers -- not an experience I 'd recommend . Go with a proper vulcanizing patch set . The time you save in applying these you 'll lose many fold in repeated attempts to patch the same leak before finally giving up and walking .
 These just do n't work . I noticed them at the bike shop and decided to give them a try instead of carrying around a normal patch kit . Luckily I decided to test one on a slow leak -LRB- very small puncture -RRB- before I relied on them when out and about . The only thing they did for me was help relocate the leak -- the damn thing was leaking again before I even finished pumping up the tire . I took out the tube again , removed the skab -LRB- which had removed 1/3 of itself already -RRB- , cleaned off the spot , tried to texture the tube even more , and applied another . This time I put a bit of air -LRB- < 20 psi -RRB- into the tube and watched before putting it back into the tire . Sure enough , a small air bubble appears very quickly and within a few minutes the air bubble has reached the outside of the skab and the tube is flaccid . Aside from the fact that I was n't even trying to use these on a high pressure tire , I had two of them fail within a few minutes without even filling the tire ! I can think of no constructive use for this product .
 Used as instructed and could not even get back home , had to push bike for 2 miles in the middle of the night . Not fun at all , got home and used some old patches with proper liquid vulcanizer and presto , fixed.Do not ever purchase any type of bike flat repair kit that does not include liquid vulcanizer , there is simply no way to get around using it for a proper fix .
 Great idea , but they do n't work . I applied scab to a tiny puncture . Tire held air overnight . I rode to work but when I came out to go home tire was flat .
 Like a scab you would get on your arm or knee , these `` patches '' are likely to leak when the tube swells with air pressure just as a scab would crack and bleed when you bend your arm or knee . They are good enough for a temporary fix to get you out of the woods , but no further . Not one patch I used -LRB- and I used them all -RRB- held air for more than ten minutes . Absolutely not worth it , unless for the tire levers .
 I was initially enthusiastic about these `` scabs '' . I followed the instructions carefully but in two repairs , both failed . Do n't let these strand you somewhere -- they may seem to be working at first . It took 2 weeks for my repairs to prove futile . Oh well , back to the drawing board !
 I 've used 3 of the patches and they have never been able to maintain a seal . I would look for either a better pre-glued patch or go for the ones you have to add the glue .
 These are a waste of time and money - tried using them to repair a 1mm hole in the inner tube for my road bike , but to no avail . Tried applying them , and immediately inflating -LRB- after putting tube back in the tire -RRB- . Tried waiting before inflating . Either way , it did n't matter , because these did n't fix the leak . I 'm just lucky I was n't on the road when the repair was needed , and that I had the time to test out their reliability , of which there is NONE .
 Followed directions and when I inflated sticker immediately leaked . Same results after trying again . Never buy Slime products !
 I used these to fix a flat , it held up a few days until we used the bike for basic street riding . After words it went flat . I noted the air was leaking around the patch , which had failed . I scraped off the glue as best as I could and cleaned the area with goof-off , stuck another patch on , again compressing it tightly per instructions , it held up while not being ridden , rode it to the park and it 's flat again . I 'll go back to glue patches .
 OK , Used these patches on two seperate scooter tires . Followed directions and the patch seemed to stick perfectly . As soon as air pressure was applied the patch let go , and this happen twice !!!! Also tried using one on my son 's little duck bathtub , the next day the duck was dead . Horrible product . Stick with the old glue and rubber patch , you ca n't beat it .
 In a perfect world I would give this compass a five-star review . I have been using Brunton/Silva 70p compasses on my sea kayaks for over 10 years . I have probably purchased 7-8 of these compasses over the last decade . They are the standard for kayaks that have the appropriate compass recess on their foredeck.I know I will get beaten up for this because my issue has nothing to do with product performance , but a rather bazaar Amazon policy that potential buyers need to be aware of . I recently purchased a new kayak . My children thought it would be a great ideal to buy me a new Brunton 70p compass for my new boat , as a birthday gift . Regrettably I already had a 70P compass for it . No problem , Amazon has a great return policy right ? Well not in this case . It took several emails and a couple of phone calls to ascertain why I could not successfully print a return label for the gift compass I had just received and was still unopened.Simply put
 I ordered this for a Christmas gift and was very disappointed to see that the football I received was not the one pictured . Not only is it not the same shade of green as in the picture , it is also not the SOLID color pictured . The one I got is green and orange with colors alternating in each quarter of the football . If I had wanted that style , I would have ordered that style . It 's too late now to return it and hope for the one pictured , which probably is n't even an option because I would assume if the one pictured was available there would n't be so many reviews on here complaining of the same problem . Typically I read reviews , but I figured it 's a football , what could be wrong with it and it had a 4.5 star rating so everybody must be pretty happy with theirs , but I 'm sure not . Oh , and as an added bonus I enjoyed reading this on the side of the box - `` BALL TECHNOLOGY - COVER
 I received a football that does not look like the one in this picture here . Apparently this has happened to other buyers as well . This is the only reason I could not give a average + rating.For 10 dollars though I was happy with my Junior Football
 Its a temporary fix not a permanent , I even patched my tubes and they leaked air when I left the bike stationary . It only works when wheels are spinning .
 I followed the instructions through step four , where I allowed the tire to fully deflate . Step five is to attach the hose and install the sealant , but I could not proceed beyond attaching the hose . The sealant would not flow through , and actually ended up on parts of the wheel and on the floor . I tried clearing out the first bit of it , then shaking the bottle to mix the contents thoroughly , then removing the the tube from the tire and rim so that I could give it one last go . I gave up after fifteen minutes of trying to fix the punctured tube and decided to instead replace it with a brand new one.I 'm not sure I 'll try this again any time soon .
 I got this stuff at Wal-mart thinking it would prevent flats , but instead it caused a flat . I followed the instructions just like it said and the first ride I went out on it was flat by the time I got back . I looked at my tire and found the hole . All the slime did was ooze out like snot . I thought maybe it just needs to dry to seal it but even after a few days it is still slimy and no good . Now I have to by a whole new tire and throw out the one with the slime I just put in it . This stuff sucks . I posted a picture .
 Warning , this product does not work with Presta type tire valves . This is not stated in the description . Fine if you have Schrader valves
 I do n't know if I 've ever given one star to a product before . I REALLY wanted to believe in these . I read the reviews from others about how they did n't work and told myself that their expectations must have been way out of line . Not so.A little over two years ago , I moved from Central Florida to Southern New Mexico and was introduced to the bane of cyclists - the goat head . These ubiquitous multi-pronged thorns always present a thorn sticking up . As a heavy rider -LRB- 200 lbs -RRB- , I have an unusually hard time with flats . Riding my Rubino Pros with conventional tubes , I seriously alternated days riding with days patching tires . I became VERY frustrated , and started looking for solutions :1 -RRB- Fill your tubes with a sealant such as Slime or Stan 's . You need to buy removable core tubes to inject the sealant , and until recently , I did n't know of any -LRB- my old shop back in FL pointed out that Vittoria markets them in the US -RRB- . Or buy a tube with the sealant already installed such as this product .2 -RRB- Get extra heavy tubes , extra thick tires or insert thick protective strips . Even if you 're not a weight weenie , -LRB- and if you are , rotational weight is the worst kind -RRB- , these products really add to the rolling resistance . I did n't buy decent high thread count tires to ruin the rolling resistance with tire strips .3 -RRB- Probably the best option , but very expensive , is to convert to tubeless with a sealant . Stan 's Notubes has a kit to seal conventional road rims and install a tubeless tire.My research indicated that sealant like Slime -LRB- vs. the latex sealants -RRB- have fibers that should seal better , and do n't dry out in the tube needing replacement . The Slime tubes seemed just like the answer . The goat head holes or tiny . If the Slime wo n't seal those , they wo n't seal anything.In short , I 've been trying to give them a chance for almost six months , and I 'm done with them . They get flats as frequently as any other tube -LRB- although that was to be expected -RRB- , but never sealed up while on the road . It 's kind of like bleeding - you have to bleed out some before the coagulation sets in . So when you get a flat , you ask yourself if you want to stop every mile and reinflate the tire , hoping that it will eventually seal , or just stop and change the tube . My experience quickly indicated that I was better off just stopping to change the tube . On one or two occasions , I could play with the tube over a few days out of the tire in the garage , reinflating it and sloshing it around , eventually getting it to seal on its own . Most of the time however , I just patched it . I think another reviewer said that the most useful thing the sealant does is mark where the hole is.I believe that the tube is just too flexible to seal , as even the smallest hole stretches open under pressure . Tubeless tires are supposed to be working well with sealant , but I suppose that because the tire tread is thicker and less stretchy , allowing the sealant to work.As for the actual product , one plus is that it DOES have a removable core . I checked the brand to see who they acquired them from , and they were branded as Slime . One disadvantage is that they only come with a long stem , which looks lame if you 're not running deep profile rims -LRB- but obviously reduces the number of different products they need to provide -RRB- . Other than not working , a bad feature is the mess they make every where . I 've had trouble with the valve not leaking because of the sealant in it , and am getting sealant in my pump head despite trying to follow the instructions for positioning the wheel when inflating . Another distraction is when I patch the tire , and want to roll it up to put back in my seat pack as a spare , and the sealant , of course , wants to push up to the valve with the air and out of the valve.As expected , most of my holes have been the tiny goat head holes . If these wo n't seal those , I do n't see how they will work with anything larger . I really wanted these to work , but am utterly disappointed . Maybe the non-lite version works better . I do n't know.The finance committee -LRB- wife -RRB- finally noted my frustration , especially when riding long rides with a friend and having to cut the rides short as I dealt with flats . She agreed with my trying the Stan 's Notubes conversion kit with the Hutchinson Intensive tires . I 've been riding at least one converted tire for two months now -LRB- on the rear , where I have the flats nine out of 10 times -RRB- without any problem , including riding the Santa Fe Half Century -LRB- where I got a goat head flat on the FRONT where I still had the Slime tube and my old Rubino Pro tire -RRB- . After that ride , I converted the front , and for the last two weeks , it has n't caused any problems.I would like to say that your experience may be different , but I doubt it .
 I ride 100 + miles per week . There are times where I 've had 4 flats per ride . I figured I would try the slime product . This slime lite tube does n't work very well . Also , one rating commented on how the green slime marked where the hole is so it was easy to find the leak and patch it . However , that rater also noted , that they cleaned the area and patched it , but the patch did n't hold . This leaking of the patch was my experience as well . If you end up with a hole or puncture and the slime does n't work , and then attempt to patch it , the slime eventually pushes under the patch . Then the patch does n't hold . The patches I used were slimes own green self stick patches ! Years ago , I found that the Parks clear patches work very well . I just found them again and appreciate how well they work . I recommend the parks clear patches . The big difference is that patches are inexpensive and you can put a few in your wallet . The slime is not effective . This idea is nice , but unfortunately it does n't work well.In general , after a few flats -LRB- say about 10 -RRB- you get very good at patching a hole in a tube . I can usually find the hole and patch with out even taking the wheel of the bike . It takes maybe 5 minutes . Years ago , -LRB- 35 -RRB- sears roebuck used to sell a heavy duty tube . As a kid I was tough on bikes and the tubes held up . I think you may be better off trying heavier gauge rubber tubes rather than waste money on this product .
 Over the course of 45 days I went through 4 slime lite tubes . 3 of them split , 1 other worked for about 30 days and then that split . I DO NOT RECOMMEND slime lite tubes . I would recommend either get the regular slime tubes , deal with the minor extra weight -LRB- or -RRB- get the slime pro , deal with putting it into the tube -LRB- videos on youtube or -LRB- ... -RRB- and keep on rolling . Do n't get me wrong , I 've bee running Slime Tubes for years and without too much issue at all , but these slime-lite tubes are BS .
 This is just a horrible product . It works no better than a standard tube . When it does flat and one tries to repair it the slime will come spewing out of the tube when pumping air into the tire to find said puncture . DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS JUNK ! Also the glueless patches do n't work either . The worst part ? I bought 6 of these tubes and each failed as described . This product DOES N'T WORK , DOES N'T WORK , DOES N'T WORK !
 After four rides of less than 100 miles on relatively smooth road , I got a flat on my rear wheel . When I looked over the tire , I found no punctures or cuts . Upon removing the tube I was surprised to find that the rear Slime Lite tube leaked at the valve stem base . Green slime all over my rim and hands and no way to repair the tube . While these tubes may have been a good idea , the downfall of this product is the poor quality at the valve stem . Sorry I never got to see if these would withstand the test of road debris . Definitely not worth the extra expense .
 On the back of the box it says to Fully inflate Smart tube to proper PSI ! Proper psi was 100 and did n't even inflate to 50 psi and they ruptured . No problems with the shipping just the product . Was excited to try it out , and did n't even get to put my tires back on my bike and ride .
 Great concept , but anyone who rides regularly , especially with road bikes , will need to periodically -LRB- weekly -RRB- refill their tires to get back to optimum pressure . Slime tubes make this INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT . Makes sense , since the tire is designed to not let air out , why would it suddenly be easy to let air in?Despite the slimeness , I still find I lose like 15-20 psi over the week . This is also true for all the non-Slime tires I 've had . To get it back to `` normal '' means trying , and trying again until the valve will finally be clear of slime and let the air enter . Sometimes it takes a dozen tries before the valve will clear . Also , if you insist on having/using this tube , always store the bike with the valve stem at 10 or 2 o'clock position or the slime sealant will fill in the valve and make it that much more difficult to pump -LRB- it 's difficult enough at the 10-2 position -RRB- . I like the idea , have ridden a few hundred miles on these and so far not a flat yet , but if you are a regular rider pumping these tires back up will prove to be very frustrating .
 So , i was installing tube with tire levers and it popped a hole . I then patched it up with the no glue patches that came with the levers . It held for a while but when i woke up the tire was flat again . I took the tube out of the tire and not only did the patch not hold green slime was leaking from under the patch . hopefully i can get my money back or a replacement .
 Three Slime tubes have failed in one day . First one had a slow leak , so replaced it with a new one and it blew out right along the seam . I did keep from falling . I then replaced the blown one with a new tube and it had two leaks in different places as it was being inflated . Installation was performed properly . You may make your own conclusion about buying Slime bicycle tubes . As for me , when you are paying close to $ 9.00 per tube , they should at least get you out the door and some sort of replacement guarantee should be in place . I have one more Slime tube , what do you predict will happen with it ?
 When this item arrived a week ago , I was disappointed that there was only one pair of socks despite the description of three pairs . I contacted Amazon customer service and they promptly sent a replacement , again only one pair of socks . Since the two pairs of socks that I did receive were high-quality , I requested that I keep these as fulfillment of my order . Three emails later , Amazon refused my request and indicated that I should return the items at their cost . While I am not out any money , it was a hassle to return the items . I order a lot from Amazon , once or twice a week on average . They have the best customer service department of any website that I have dealt with . However , they let me down on this one and I am disappointed with Amazon . They need to change their website . If you order this item , you will receive one pair of socks .
 Not Really Happy On This Purchase . I Shop Here From Time To Time And Was Very Happy With Your Service . This Time Around I Purchased The Item Above And Received The Same Team Plate But It Was Way Different Than The Picture I Thought I Was Getting . I Tried Numerous Times Trying To Get A Hold Of Someone @ Amazon , But Came Up Short . I Called The # That The Invoice Had . They Stated '' That Amazon Messed Up And We Didnt Ship That To You And That They Have Been Doing That From Time To Time '' So Now What Am I To Do ? I Know Its Not A Big Price Purchase But Still . '' I Kinda Wan na Get What I Payed For '' Ya-Know '' I Still Have It In Its Original Shipped Package Put Aside . It Was A Gift . So If You Whoever Get 's A Chance To Read This , Please Let Me Know What To Do ??? Im Still Gon na Shop Here , But Crossing My Fingers It Dont Happend Again Because I Really Like What You Guys Have To Offer . Thanks For Your Time - Alfonso Garcia
 Bought this halter because the headline said `` Yearling '' halter . NOT MINI YEARLING which is how it arrived . I 'm so angry they need to be very specific with their advertising whether these are actual HORSE size or miniature horse size .
 We have a baby -LRB- 3 year old -RRB- shire who keeps breaking out of his halters , and any replacements we find are all too small ... I was pleasantly surprised that this piece was too big for our little guy - we made a new hole for the buckle under the chin , and have no complaints . Even though the description says 1100 + pounds , it 'll fit your 1600 + Draft with no problems . : -RRB- Edit
 Not a fan of this tube at all . Low quality and not durable at all . The green stuff is very messy too . Lasted only 2 months in a 5 year olds bike who rides the short driveway and sometimes street when I take him riding . Very cheap feeling rubber
 I was tired of buying inner tubes for my son so I thought the extra $ would give me the better service . NOT with the product . They popped just the same as the other and were really messy . No recommendation here .
 i bought two of these slime -LRB- ball -RRB- tubes just for use in a garden cart which sees only use to haul wood about 20 feet several times a year . low use . no nails , thorns etc in the way.one tube lasted a few months the other made it to 8 months . when they leak the LEAK , and it IS VERY messy . it is impossible to repair the hole due to the goo . the tube seems to deteriorate especially at the seams . and when there is a leak the hole is rather large , about 3/8 inch ; and the area around the hole seems to be again with the deteriorated rubber.i had hoped paying more would have saved me troubles ... but the cheap walmart and kmart tubes have done far better.i would never ever buy any tube that had ` self sealant ' ... these are impossible to patch ... they go , you toss .
 I was unimpressed with this tube , I was under the impression this was a heavy duty tube , it 's not , when you get a small hole in your tire is spews green slime that isnot very easy to clean off and is quite messy .
 My kitchen towel hem fell apart after the first time i washed it . The `` ravens '' is a decal and faded easily .
 Watch out about these tire liners . They are thinner than other brands I have used and tend to slip around in the tire as you install the tube . This can cause the tube to slip behind or next to the liner and when you pump up the tube you lacerate the tire . The liner is n't rigid enough to manipulate and becomes frustratingly problematic . I lacerated two different tubes trying to install these liners until I decided to abandon them for another brand .
 It will cut the tire in 30 minutes . The cut is about 1.5 inches long , looks like made with a knife or a blade , along the tube . The cut is where two ends of the `` protector '' meet . I am an engineer . I read the reviews about how this product actually causes punctures , but I thought it was from incorrect installation . So , I made sure I followed instructions . Common sense tells me that where two ends of this product meet , they create extra thickness . That extra thickness creates extra pressure on tube , and also there is a sharp edge of the product in exactly same area . All conditions are perfect for creating a cut in your tube.The manufacturers of such `` products '' always post reviews about their products
 Product is great at first until the colors start to fade away . Then its just a black and whit plate .
 It would be a perfect gift if it did n't look cheesy . It 's a bit bulky and , as the description says , plastic .
 The Livermore , CA 94551 Postal Service stole my package and I never received my license plates . They said they 've had to wait for my complaint , and never got back to me . I 've talked to him on 3 occassions , and they said the courier on that day delivered it to my home , when infact HE did not . They stole my license plates . I never got them .
 Not necessarily , I bought all 5 segways at once , this Spring , thinking it would get us better service . I shipped 3 all-terrains to a client to use on his wildlife lodge overseas and 2 for my brother and me . My brother 's got left out in the rain for 3 minutes and is in for repair -LRB- ignore what they say , about being able to clean them with a hose - its the handle barsthat ca n't stand a bit of rain - they should give you fold down rain cover.As for mine , my charger did n't work for about 7 days - the charger line is REALLY short , and easily disconnects in your garage , and now it wo n't recharge . There were a couple in shop for similar problems when I went for my training , so assume this is a common problem . I ca n't take it in for servicing because it 's too heavy to put into my car , and my carrier never arrived.I actually loved mine at first - great dog chaser - except for the ease at which the handlebars swivel off center , sometimes while you are riding , which makes it quite dangerous . And when you panic , you never get over the counter-intuitive way the handlebars turn . It 'll take you right into the mud so do n't forget your knee pads and helmet . Surely way they came out with new handlebar treatment -LRB- 3 months after we bought , with no abilit y to upgrade - what luck -RRB- to remedy the problem.Remember when you fall , the natural tendency is to hold and and pull the handlebars toward you as you fall . But if the Segway does n't stop , as happend to me twice , the machine runs back on your body and flattens it . From my pain , I 'm guessing it can be deadly dangerous . Think weight + velocity to imagine my injuries.Now to my biggest gripe
 We 've used the cover for about 2 years before finally having to toss it away . It looked cool once we got it over the standard size grill , however one side easily ripped even though we took a lot of precaution . -LRB- its an extremely tight fit so measure your grill first -RRB- Within the first year and Winter outside , the white became a dingy yellow and cracks from our dry Summer formed all over -LRB- even though it stayed mostly in a shaded area -RRB- . By the 2 year mark it looked pretty bad and had to go
 Looked good when new , however after 3 months all of the gold plating has peeled off . Would not recommend if planning on using on a daily basis .
 This would be a great wallet if it was constructed of better quality materials . The outside nylon has held up fine , but the thin inside lining started tearing and shredding after about 3 months . Now 7 months later , it 's unusable . I 've replaced it with a leather Packers logo wallet from another source
 These shorts tore in the seam between the legs within a few weeks of having bought them . And there really was n't much use given to them -LRB- certainly nothing that would cause a tear -RRB- . I like Adidas shorts overall , but I ca n't recommend these .
 Everything about this product seemed so great until we actually charged it up and tried to use it . On the first day of use , after charging all weekend , one to the units contsantly turned itself off . Upon arriving home and looking closer at each unit , both were hours off on the time that was set iniatally , I have proceeded to reset time and lock in units just so we could use for communication on the job , day after day , just hoping they would kick in and work . Each day it 's more problems , one or the other will not even relay or play sound when in use . The alarms will not go off when set and maybe once a week will just go off at some unusual time . I really tried to say ok , yours always turns off , but I am the one you are calling , so just turn yours on each time , but then mine got to where no sound came out when I got called but you could hear what I said on the other one . All in all , we either got defaulty units or they are all horible and do n't work at all , not even one day . And we charged and reset time every night for a month trying to use them . I just hope they will replace or refund .
 The size ca n't be better , but if you are planning to be apart by any distance with trees and even small hills the connection will be spotty at best . We had trouble within 1/2 mile which made it useless for mountain bike on different trails .
 Just received a set of the camo pro action mossy oak breakup XXL yesterday . They look OK . -LRB- I like the camo pattern -RRB- I normally wear XL size , I can tell you that the XXL Jacket is not what I would consider a generous cut -LRB- like some of the others may have implied -RRB- . The stuff sack that comes with it is totally useless since it is far to small to accomodate the XXL jacket and pants -LRB- it might be OK for a small or even a medium -RRB- the zipper appears to be plastic -LRB- at least it wo n't rust -RRB- and the snaps do pull apart very easily in the vertical plane . They seem to be a bit more sturdy in the horizontal plane.I think if you are looking for something for very occasional use in light winds they will probalbly be OK .
 I purchased this rain suit after doing a lot of comparison shopping . I decided that for the price , it was a great deal , but it turned out to be a great disappointment . First of all , the material is very unusual looking for being waterproof . Think fortified paper towel . I did n't even bother to test how effective it was though because the jacket fit like a hot air balloon . The chest area was fine , but the sleeves were large beyond reason . Generous fit is one thing , but I probably could have fit my body through the sleeves . I had to send it back .
 The very first time I took mine out of the package and tried it on , two of the seams separated . I used the contact form on Frogg Toggs ' website to request a return authorization . They did n't respond . I then phoned the company . They gave me a second number to call . I left a message there . Once again , no response . I wo n't be buying any more Frogg Toggs products .
 The jacket is too short . Needs to be longer , even a parka style with cinching waist would help , just to provide extra coverage . An XL on a 5 ' 8 '' male and ca n't sit down with out the jacket lifting in the back leaving an area to get wet . Ca n't lift arms over head for any normal activity with out jacket raising up as well . Cinching does n't help either . No pockets in jacket or pants , which stinks but is probably for waterproofing purposes . The jacket on the zipper also seems to leak pretty bad , left a wet spot all the way down the front of my shirt . The compactness and weight are great .
 My husband had a pair of these and the zipper broke . I got ready to buy a good rain suit and thought it was probably just a fluke about the zipper . BUT - the third time I wore mine , the zipper on MY jacket broke.Loved them at first - they were lightweight and did n't make me sweat inside them , and they blocked wind and water . Shame about the zipper because it negates all the benefits!I wo n't buy anything made by them again .
 I purchased these spurs and they do not fit a standard boot . Very disappointed .
 I actually received the wrong item . I ordered a plain Saints frame and a Superbowl champs plate , and I ended up with both Superbowl champs items . I tried to contact the customer service number to get it changed and never heard back from them . I did n't try again because it was n't the end of the world -LRB- ie if they had sent me a Falcons one I would have keeled over ... -RRB- but it was a bit of a disappointing experience that I could n't even get in touch with them .
 The paddle I received did not have the hooks as displayed in the picture and called out in the item description.Returned the first paddle expecting the correct paddle to come in the second time , but unfortunately that was n't the case.Taking the good with the bad , lower price but automated process that does n't allow for correction in some cases . Amazon gets it right most of the time , but not with this product.If you 're looking at this product , go ahead purchase the one that 's almost like it , but is $ 4 cheaper because that 's the one that will be shipped .
 These things are awkward to handle and simply do n't work well . Shell out the extra five bucks for some foam grips .
 The hard plastic with the finger scallops just does not feel natural in my hands . Go for foam or rubber grips without finger grooves and you 'll be much happier . I do n't mind working out but these are just a pain in the ass .
 The plastic hurts after five reps , buy foam , quality is good but size is kind of small , definetly reccomend foam
 Absolute garbage . In fact I do not believe anyone can use these effectively . The design is flawed , they hurt the hand . I have been using grip exercisers for 35 yrs and have worn out many after years of use . You will never wear out these Valeros because they can not be used !! The grip design is so bad it is painful to use . I returned mine . Paid return postage and a RESTOCKING fee . Look elsewhere .
 I should have looked closer at the picture and noticed how skinny the grip handles were . The ones that I 've used in the past had thicker and rounder handles so that the pressure was more evenly and ergonomically distributed . This one is skinny and pointy and hurts the hands when used a lot . I think I 'm going to have to tear up an old tshirt and tie it around the handles to make it more usable . I was expecting one grip but it comes with 2 which is nice I guess . Overall , I 'm disappointed with it but I should have known it was crap from the price . Anyhow , I 'll make it usable with the tshirt trick but if you have n't bought it yet , get something else .
 u Basically have to hurt Yourself in order to get a good workout & the plastic bends so its so stupid !

 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .
 I am dissapointed ! I ordered what I thought I would recieve a NEW Patriots License plate and to my surprise it was used ! Scratched and faded ! Not what I thought I was paying for ! If I would have known it was used , I would have ordered a more expensive plate and got my moneys worth !
 I would not buy this product again . It does charge my GPS but I have to put a rubber band around it get it to make contact .
 This does n't work very well . The Forerunner 305 does n't fit well on the cradle and requires me to put something on top of the Forerunner to get the watch to charge . I would suggest trying a different model that fits better .
 Not identical to the original product . I have to tape the forerunner -LRB- 305 -RRB- to the charger every time I use it . It seems to work if I am accurate enough about positioning before applying the tape . What a hassle . I ended up buying another one from Garmin - it works fine .
 I have never received this product although the company insists that I have - Therefore I really can not give it a review . This needs to be resolved - I told them over a month ago that I had not received it.Garmin Charging Cradle for Forerunner 205 and 305
 I bought it . It looks and feels like the one I lost , but when you snap it in it does not stay attached . I managed to hold it on with a twist tie to charge , but its not as good as the original .
 I purhcased this because it was brand new . The charging cradle looks and feels just like original . However , the manufacturing specs are not quite right though . The clips to hold the watch in place are about 1mm off . This does sound like much , but it prevents the watch from locking in place . This cradle requires a rubber band or other fastener to hold down the watch in cradle so it will charge . Do n't buy this . You are better off buying a used one so you know it works .
 These shorts were bought because they advertised a 5 '' inseam . The inseam is 6.25 '' , a 25 % longer inseam . I have always had good dealings with Amazon but these shorts are misadvertised .
 When the dumbbells arrived on my porch , I could smell a rubber/chemical odor eminating from the packaging . I took them to my basement gym and opon removing them , I was impressed with the construction and durability of the weights . But that odor . After a few hours , it filled the house , giving my wife and I a headache . So I moved them to the garage . After 6 weeks , the odor has ceased and they are back in my basement . The compounds used should be reconsidered .
 Product itself is top notch ! Great polish , works well , very expensive but worth it - HOWEVER - Amazon item description states that this is a 2.2 lb can - the can that arrived was 2oz short , only 2.0 lbs - considering Amazon sells a 1.7 oz tube for almost $ 10 - I feel VERY shortchangedShipping package was inadequately padded - the metal can arrived totally dented up and I 'm amazed it did n't burst open in transit .
 The intended use for this was to buff out scratchesin a clear Stratoglass enclosure on a boat . Also purchased thekit with their large buffing ball and and a 3000 rpmdrill , as per instructions . I believe the kit package stated thiswas its intended use . Scratches did not buff out.Later tried it on some fading red gelcoat but it did notdo a very good job their either . I used it on somemag wheels and there it worked ok , but not as goodas Mothers Brand . I tried it on an anodized aluminumTuna Tower that 's been turning from silver to white.There it worked good ; however after about a weekyou could see it was back to turning white . In fairness , neither my professional detail people nor I have everfound a product that worked well and lasted more thena few months at most on the aluminum and we have tried many . In hindsightI should have returned this . Probably would cost moreto do that then its worth .
 All of Pelican 's marketing photos show a Macbook Pro fitting perfectly in this case with the pick and pluck foam but it DOES NOT . Beware !!! I pulled out a section for the Macbook and the foam is 2 '' thick while the laptop is only 1/2 '' thick . So you can imagine the giant hole that your laptop will be swimming in with no additional protection . PLUS ... because there is no top foam , there is nothing to hold the bottom foam in place . So the laptop is actually able to slip between the bottom cut out foam , and the thinner piece of foam that lines the bottom and it hits the side of the case !! I own 10 different pelican cases and this is the ONLY one that I have that was not designed to adequately protect the item it was intended for.I tried to call Pelican about this and they would n't help AT ALL . They said the foam was not covered under warranty -LRB- which has nothing to do with it , this is a DESIGN FLAW -RRB- and that nothing could be done . So I am stuck with this worthless case that offers no real protection for a Macbook Pro.I do not recommend this product at all . And I am seriously reconsidering doing any further business with Pelican now . Their service is crummy at best .
 The black holders at the bottom all were n't glued on and I went to try it out and when I left I did n't notice they all fell off until I got home . Then it has some metal weights in the middle which I though okay at least I have those , next time I try it out again all of those fell off , and I thought I 'll glue it together . Then I was thinking NO i payed $ 30 for this product it should be in good condition and not falling apart . I mean I guess it 's usable , but I have n't used it since . It 'll probably just fall apart on the next few kicks if it can hold the ball up still .
 Bought this for my son , a HS varsity kicker-it broke within the first 10 minutes . Very poor weld that holds the ball holder arm . Save your money on this
 My son was so disappointed when he opened the box , only to find that the leg tips had fallen off . I have n't had time to figure out if there 's a way to reattach them but I 'm irritated that I even have to consider the possibility . Not at all impressed .
 My son is a varsity high school place kicker . We have purchased two of these holders and both have broken within a few weeks of buying them . I made one for him out of PVC tubing based on instructions I found on the internet and it works as well as this one and has n't broken .
 I have ordered this twice in the past two months . Both times the description said it was in stock . Both times I received an email a few days later from Champs Sports saying `` we 're sorry ... the item you have ordered is out of stock '' . What a huge disappointment to my son ... he had specifically asked for this item from Santa . And was disappointed on Christmas morning when he did n't find it under the tree . :-LRB- If it 's not in stock , then the company needs to update their description !
 These shorts were bought because they advertised a 5 '' inseam . The inseam is 6.25 '' , a 25 % longer inseam . I have always had good dealings with Amazon but these shorts are misadvertised .
 This tent is very light , for the trip I was planning weight was a huge factor . The fact that it was on the cheaper side made me like it even more.On the first trip I used it - only setting it up caused several holes in the fabric.The fabric is real thin and delicate it is only single layer and it is far from being durable - something we all expect from camping equipment.Unfortunately for me this was a stormy night and the whole tent kept trembling and flapping - Might be suitable for summer camping on a beach -LRB- soft surface -RRB- .

 i was so stoked at first when i got this ball , only to realize that it did n't feel like how it was supposed to . i already tested this ball out at my local sports store to get a feel for it and to buy it on amazon for way cheaper . first thing that struck out to me was the feel of the ball . feels like all the other generic ncaa indoor/outdoor balls . they use some cheap glossy material to make it seem ` moisture absorbent . ' after that first clue that led to me skepticism , i compared the ball to the picture . the logo is off and the ` solution game ball ' was n't where it was supposed to be . i mean if you 're going to sell some knockoff , at least make it believable .
 This is actually a question to Amazon : I just ordered one for $ 38 and it arrived yesterday.It does not look exactly the same as the picture shown on the Amazon website.It does not have the `` INDOOR -LSB- W -RSB- GAME BALL '' label under the Wilson logo.Is it really the solution game ball ?? Or did I just bought an imitation ? Wilson NCAA Solution Game Ball Basketball
 We give both the product and the provider five stars.Truly , we had shopped several BIG-name sporting goods stores and could not find this basketball at either of them ... and then , we saw it on Amazon and it was delivered right to our door in perfect condition . It has already provided hours of free throws and ball-handling fun .
 This ball is below average as far as indoor balls go . I was torn between this ball and the Wilson Evolution and decided to go with the ball that 's a few bucks chearper . Mistake.I play basketball fairly competitively about 3-4 times per week . This ball is hard and does n't have the soft feel of the Evolution . Maybe it gets better with usage , but I 'd rather pay a few extra dollars and get a ball that works great from the start rather than risking -LSB- ... -RSB- on a ball and still not liking it several months later.I 'm going to be returning this ball and buying an Evolution as it is the ball that is used most often at my gym . For basketballs in general I 'd say it 's solid , but as far as indoor only balls go I 'd say it 's not a great choice .
 Made of sythetic material.It almost good enough to use indoors but not worth the money ... I would not but another ...
 this ball does n't hold air and needs to be pumped up again every day . how can i return it ? It is a defective product . I 'll be happy to return so you can see for yourself .
 I was really excited about getting the item . Paying less than half price for an official ball used for NCAA Championships , what a deal ! I waited until I got to the gym before even taken it out of the box , boy was I disappointed ! The quality of the ball was poor , you could see and feel the glue they used to put it together . You constantly feel the rough edges when using the ball . No way they would allow this item in this condition to be played with in a championship game of any sort . Upon further examination I also notice that the ball is n't like the ball in the picture . Everything is there but the words , `` INDOOR -LRB- WILSON SYMBOL -RRB- GAME BALL '' . I am having the feeling I was sent a reject game ball ! I am going to what was my first choice from the beginning , the Spaulding TF-1000 . I have played with the Wilson Evolution , thought this ball would be like it . I let the original higher price fool me . Stay away from this item !
 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .
 Complete waste of money ! They leak horribly ! Ended up throwing them out because what it was not worth returning them and having to pay postage , plus buy the stuffed envelope to put them in .
 I could not be more unsatisfied with these goggles . I thought the worst that could happen is the goggles would leak . I could not have been more wrong . All I did was assemble the goggles and try them on . I never even swam with them . After I took them off , I looked in the mirror and found a bruise surrounding my right eye . So far this bruise has lasted a week . I hope these goggles did not cause permanent damage to my eye . Beware !
 After reading that many swimmers like these goggles , I gave them a try . No matter how I position them , or how loose or tight I make them , they leak like crazy .
 I planned on getting a pair of goggles . I got PIECES of goggles and no instructions . NOT what I thought I was getting . No wonder they were CHEAP .
 Before I begin , let me tell you this . I am a hardcore fisherman . I do not skimp on my equipment . I own g loomis rods , and quantum reels , exclusively . These are my personal preference . I take VERY GOOD CARE of my gear . The 30 series of this reel is crap . I also own -LRB- from quantum -RRB- an icon 20 , ***** a Response Ti ***** , and a Catylyst 20 ***** . These are all great reels ! The 30 series , though , UGH ! the bail does not close correctly-EVER ! At first I thoght I just had a bad one so I took it back and got another . NO GOOD EITHER . I like quantum products and they serve well but stay away from the 30 series !
 I did n't really understand &#34; swedish swim goggles &#34; but I decided to order a pair based on the other reviews on Amazon . I did n't care for the flimsy nature of the goggles . . they did n't feel sturdy at all . I donated them to the local YMCA .
 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .

 Are there more than one color ? Also , the picture does not even represent the product . Never again on these bolos .
 At 5 ' 6 '' and 133 pounds the size medium in these coldgear tights was FAR AND AWAY too uncomfortable to wear . I see other reviews commenting on the tightness of the ankles but the waist band is nothing more than a small bit of elastic string that literally digs into the top of my hips and stomach while I run.For my money , Target makes a pair of cold weather insulated tights in their C9 line that are fantastic . Skip the under armor , and their lofty price tag and get thee to Target for a much more comfortable , affordable option .
 The material for these supposedly `` frosty tights '' are too thin . Not a great material for Chicago winter running .
 Product is meant to be compression tights but it is a bit loose . I 'm 5 ' 8 and of average built and it is loose from the hips down . I ordered two of different sizes , one for my friend and the company sent two of the same size . When I contacted them requesting for a change as they were the one who made the mistake , they told me I have to bear the cost of the shipment as I live outside US . I emailed them several times but they refused to bear the cost . I am very disappointed as that was my very first online purchase from Amazon . I have expected US companies to have excellent customer service but apparently , this is not so . Disappointing experience .
 My husband and I thought this was a great machine until the wheels fell apart and we are being told over and over that the replacements are on the way meanwhile a month later they are saying its out of stock !!! We have been waiting for over 2 months . Wow this machine 's wheels are sooo bad that they ran out of stock - I can only assume others have had similar problems . By the way neither my husband or I are over the weight limit .
 you get a good workout for the price until your 15 minutes into it and a wheel crumbles apart , i 've put 3 sets of replacements on and still there not holding up .
 This item is a piece of crap . It feels like it 's solid plastic , and is so stiff that I ca n't bend it the way it should bend with all the force of my arms , let alone with my saddle . There is NO give to this item and I ca n't imagine how it could possibly make any saddle more comfortable for a horse . What 's worse is that the company who sells it is so uncooperative that it is going to cost me more to return the item to them than it cost me to purchase the item plus shipping . Very unhappy .
 The edges on this pad are so stiff and almost sharp - painful even . I would never put this on my horse . This is extremely disappointing because I have an older riser pad that looks just like this that is discolored and I wanted a new one to show in . This goes in the trash . I am not even returning it because I would hate for it to get resold - the edges are too rigid to be comfortable on any horse .

 I will be returning this controller because there is a problem with it . It quits working in the middle of playing with it . It works for a while then it quits and works agian for a while then quits . I bought three different ones and this is the only one I am having trouble with .
 It does n't work well . It is inexpensive so I did n't return the product . Someday I will through it to trash or a yard sale table . I do n't recommend it to others . It just leak air too quickly .
 I purchased this air pump to fill up a large pool lounger by the same manufacturer . Upon opening the box , I was dismayed at how light and flimsy it appeared to be , but I decided to give it a chance . I spent an hour attempting to fill just one of the three air chambers on the lounger , but finally gave up . I imagine that this product would be fine for smaller items like beach balls or inner tube floaters . I immediately ordered a larger air pump and am hoping that it will be able to do the job .
 I bought this hand pump for my air bed so that I can get that firm feeling . I have a battery operated pump , that does a good job at filling the bed up with air , but it ca n't firm up the bed without a little lung help . This pump does not have various attachments for different size intake valves , for me it 's virtually useless . As far as I can tell , it can only be used for blowing up toys , or balloons -LRB- not athletic balls -RRB- .
 Thought they would be a mixed bag of quality and patterns . But all are sub quality and the patterns and colors are none that I would be seen in . I 'm not too picky but these are pretty bad . Gave them away .
 These socks are suppose to wic , but they still cause me to sweat a lot . I thought that with such a large mesh portion , they would work at alleviating sweat a lot better . Also , of the 6 pairs I received , 3 are already fraying at the edges without ever being worn by me.On top of all of that disappointment , the socks come in random patterns and not the black shown in the picture . I actually had one pair that was blue and neon green . It is very strange that color ca n't be chosen ...
 When this item arrived a week ago , I was disappointed that there was only one pair of socks despite the description of three pairs . I contacted Amazon customer service and they promptly sent a replacement , again only one pair of socks . Since the two pairs of socks that I did receive were high-quality , I requested that I keep these as fulfillment of my order . Three emails later , Amazon refused my request and indicated that I should return the items at their cost . While I am not out any money , it was a hassle to return the items . I order a lot from Amazon , once or twice a week on average . They have the best customer service department of any website that I have dealt with . However , they let me down on this one and I am disappointed with Amazon . They need to change their website . If you order this item , you will receive one pair of socks .
 I bought a Wilson team gear bag for my high school age son 's baseball equipment -LRB- catching gear , batting helmet , bats , shoes , etc. -RRB- . The bag lasted less than one week before the seams started to separate.Obviously , I wo n't buy another Wilson equipment bag . Wilson A2000 catcher 's mitts are very durable , the bags are not .

 These socks were much inferior to the previous ones I have purchased . They were ultra thin and very tight , no give to the fabric !
 I got my package today , and it was supposed to be fulfilled by Amazon . The bag the buttons were in looked like it was played with a lot , and 3 of the buttons are subsequently missing ! All I got were the Dealer , Small Blind and Big Blind buttons . I did n't get the Reserved , Kill , or Missed Blind buttons . Quite disappointing for a product that 's supposed to be new , and it looks like it was n't . I want to exchange it for another one , but since it 's sold by Chips and Games and fulfilled by Amazon , I ca n't do an exchange . I can only return it for a refund , and then would have to buy it again , and find another $ 20 in items for free shipping . Thing is , shipping will cost more than this item is worth.Overall , not very happy .

 This shuffler does n't shuffle very well . I put a new deck of cards into it and after 5 shuffles there was still a string of 10 cards in a row . Also , it does n't really save you any time since you have to hold the button down to shuffle the cards .
 I purchased this shuffler to make game night more fun , however all I got was frustration . Although the base was sturdy and the appearence pleasant , this unit did not work . Each time I tried to shuffle a deck , the cards would be dispersed from one side and not the other . I tried this several times using old and new cards with the same results . I exchanged the unit , thinking that the problem might be due to a defective unit , but the replacement was worse ! The wheels turned when the button was depressed , but when you put the cards on , they did not move to be shuffled . I recommend you look for another card shuffler , this one will only leave you upset and disappointed .
 i bought the mag 2000 and it broke down before i even had the chance to wear the paint off it . then i had it fixed and again before i even a chance to use it , it broke again , this time i bought a new one so far so good
 My son was having problems dropping his elbow and maintaining a 90 degree angle . I was very hopeful this product would help , and eager to try it . Unfortunately , there are a couple of problems with it . The positioning of the brace itself is not instinctual and it is difficult to position properly . The picture instructions were not helpful . More importantly , though , when we did have the brace in the right position -LRB- at least we thought we did -RRB- , my son found that the most comfortable position for his arm was straight and that the 90 degree angle it purports to encourage was actually more uncomfortable . We stopped using it before he changed his mechanics for the worse .
 A waste of money in my case . The product was not very functional and was repeatedly reapplied before giving up less than a week after it was received . Great in theory , but ONLY in theory .
 The product is fine if you are looking for a display shield . The product title and description are incorrect as you are not buying item UC1416 United Cutlery Argonaut Sword but rather item 1416 Classic Medieval Round Shield . The pictures for the item are correct and if a shield is what you are looking for the price is very decent .
 The sizing on this glove is completely off - what is labeled small is actually a large . The materials are cheap . My son 's fencing instructor actually laughed and asked where I bought this piece of garbage . So spend more money on something that is worth it . I ended up paying $ 35 for a much better glove . Sorry I wasted my money on this one .
 They do not reply and respond to email sent to them.Items were not descripted properly and once orders , it is difficult to reach for solution.One start is too high of a rating but that is the onlyway to get this posted !
 Let me start off by saying that if I had a turd car I would have kept this Wrap Rack . It works really good and looks nice . The problem I had was it was on my Volvo XC60R with flush rails and it took the paint off one of them . Not Happy . This happened after the first use and scratched my roof . It is not the product but more just the design . . Salt water , sand ,25 lb paddle board sitting on your roof rubbing back and forth on every bump and turn . It was a no brainer to send it back.I ended up buying a THULE complete rack system w Paddle board carrier -LRB- $ 700 bucks -RRB- but my car will not get damaged .
 I bought this rack because my old Da Kine soft rack one I had for 12 years had worn out on one of the rack straps . I mostly wanted to use it to transport 1 or 2 windsurf boards 9 ' 6 and 10 ' 6 . I put the 9 ' 6 board on , it is shaped about like a gun and I quickly realized that the strap tightening mechanism can slip just from me pulling on them ... not good . I ended up tying one set of straps to the other to make sure that if my board did slip It would n't completely loosen up . Also the straps were just barely big enough to fit around my board which is only 58cm wide at the widest . I am scared to put my 10 ' 6 board on and drive on the freeway the 9 ' 6 '' rattled around a lot more than on my old Da Kine , at 50 mph + + . The strap down system needs to be much better and the straps need to be longer . The pads are nice and did not dent my car . This would be fine for 2 short boards but do n't buy for anything longer than 9 feet !! I will probably use the one good rack from my old set if I need to transport both boards at once.Not recommended . I would get a new Da Kine one but I ca n't find it online .
 This is the first game that made me so mad I physically destroyed the CD . Here are the most infuriating problems with NBA Live 2004 : In-game : - A lot of shots by guards get rejected because you just ca n't shake the defender-When a shot gets rejected , it 's a guaranteed fast break for the CPU which usually results in a thunderous dunk.-Fast breaks for your team are nearly impossible because three or four players for the CPU always manage to get down court before you can -LRB- complete opposite of what your guys do . -RRB- - Ca n't a guy pass without leaving his feet ? Players pass the ball with their back to the basket -LRB- and the receiver -RRB- most of the time , meaning they jump and throw . And maybe this is owing to my lack of skill , but why ca n't I control who the pass is going to with a single-stick controller ? - If you inbound the ball after a turnover on your own end , you get called for a backcourt violation . I eventually had to turn that rule off to stop that.Out of game problems : - Trading draft picks
 I do n't normally write reviews , but this game was so bad that I felt as if I had to send a warning to all those out there that are considering buying this . This is the most infuriating and broken game I have ever had the misfortune of coming across -LRB- let alone shelled out thirty bucks for -RRB- . I was rather pleased upon reading the reviews that I am not the only one who has physically destroyed my CD 's -LRB- for the record , it felt REALLY good doing so , and I recommend it to all frustrated buyers of this game . Sure , you 're basically throwing away your money , but the game is atrocious anyway -- your money was wasted as soon as you got NBA Live -RRB- . A few of the reasons why destroying it was one of the most satisfying moments of my life :1 -RRB- As soon as you miss a shot , the opposing players are back on the other end for a -LRB- usually uncontested -RRB- fastbreak . Not only is this unrealistic , but it 's maddening for any gamer because there is nothing that he/she can do to stop it , no matter what his skill level is or who he 's playing with .2 -RRB- The CPU regularly comes back from 40 , 50 , even 60 point defecits , and strings together 20-0 runs before you can blink an eye .3 -RRB- Six foot point guards like Steve Nash suddenly become shot-blocking fiends -- more than a few dozen times have my guards gone up for jumpers to have them sent back -- to make things even more ridiculous , the shot-blocker almost always gets control of the ball afterwards ... then goes on to lead another fastbreak .4 -RRB- Graphically , it was a lot less impressive than some reviewers have claimed it to be . Players ' jerseys often had the wrong names on them -LRB- there 's something unnerving about playing against the Spurs and seeing `` Nowitzki '' on Tony Parker 's back -RRB- .5 -RRB- Control-wise , it was annoying that the steal and layup buttons were the same . Many times have I tapped the steal button on defense , only to have my player immediately launch a sixty foot floater immediately after taking the ball away.I am currently planning to send an envelope to EA containing the shattered remains of my game and an angry letter demanding a refund . It 's truly a pity that the only NBA game available for the PC is this disaster . For the sake of your nerves , your time and -LRB- most importantly -RRB- your money , I STRONGLY advise everyone to stay away from this . I also recommend to fellow unfortunate or misled souls who have already taken the plunge and gotten it
 Do not buy this game Nba Live 2004 ... It 's not good at all , IT SUCKS ... Players do n't look good ... User 's Players ' are not faster as Computers ' ... You will probably miss an easy open shot when you need it ... Players do n't dunk good ... I hated this game so much ... NBA Live 2003 is an awesome game ... In NBA Live 2003 Your players are faster and good shooter and also good dunker ... NEVER EVER BUY THIS NBA LIVE 2004 . . I like NBA Live 2003 better than this one ... I think EA Sports are getting worst as time goes becuase I tried NHL 2003 and NHL 2002 . . but NHL 2002 is much better than NHL 2003 . . I also tried FIFA 2000 and FIFA 2002 and in this case FIFA 2000 is much better than FIFA 2002 . . EA Sports needs improvement in their games especially in NBA Live 2005
 I bought this game last week and there is a serious virus attached to CD 2 that comes out when loading ! The virus causes the game to lock up your system-ctrl-alt-del and task manager do not work during the lock up . I unplugged the system and tried to reboot and get a blank black screen now . My ststem will not load up in safe mose or any of the other default boot modes . I scanned the disk in another computer I have access to and found there is a virus detected on disk 2 . The EA tech support board reflects this problem as well if you do n't believe me . This game just ruined a brand new system-do not buy this thing whatever you do !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 1
 OK , a previous reviewer said that this game is `` terrible '' , do not buy it , smash the CD into pieces etc. . Well , he was right.I own NBA Live 2003 too . That one was terrible too . Did I think that 2004 would be an improvement ? No . It was clear ever since that the people who develop this are no real basketball fans . So some things in the game would change , but no overall improvement would be made . I knew it . I was right.Let me give you an example . Have you ever gone to a concert of a favorite band and see many people who only know a couple of songs , and that 's all they expect to listen to ? Well , this is similar . These guys do not really know basketball . I doubt they 've ever played it , even as amateurs . They have only watched it on TV . No , not whole games . Just the highlights.So if ALL you like of basketball is the fastbreaks and blocking dunks , then this game is for you . Otherwise , stay away.Sure , some things have changed since Live 2003 . Defense is slightly better . The freestyle system is worse . Player motion is worse . The Dynasty Mode is even worse and more arcadish than Live 2003 's Franchise Mode . There are huge bugs in it too , and no patch for them yet.Anyway , a good inclusion was the brand new `` slider system '' , where you can actually adjust things like fouling frequency , block frequency , double team frequency etc. . This is good , but even tampering with everything is not enough to create a simulation out of this parody-of-a-game . It is just not a simulation.The new `` 10 player awarness '' thingy has actually done things worse . Players usually choose to move in completely counter-intuitive manners . And of course , they refuse to mark their man and stop the fastbreaks . I mean , it 's really ridiculous.A last comment . Have the developers done all these `` mistakes '' on purpose?Yes , most of them . I can not believe that they ca n't program the damn thing not to go on fastbreaks all the time . I refuse to believe that they could n't make a game where scores would be realistic in the `` Simulation Mode '' -LRB- scores are too high -RRB- . They are just unable to appreciate real basketball -LRB- or do n't care enough to -RRB- . But there are also mistakes that show programming incompetence . The `` 10 player awareness thingy '' -LRB- or whatever they call it -RRB- is just poorly programmed.So ... why did I buy this game again ? Oh , yes , there is no competitor for PC , and wanted a basketball game to play . Too bad for me , I guess.In conclusion , if you hated Live 2003 , you are going to hate this one too . If you have never played Live 2003 , you are a lucky man , do not play this one either .
 My husband bought this as a replacement for a friend 's that he had borrowed and then accidentally lost at a music festival . The mold is horrible and there are cracks and bumps and chips ... but since it was to replace a friend 's , we gave it to him .
 The hole will hold a red solo cup but a can and a bottle go right through it . My daughter made it work by putting a thinner cozy around the can or bottle first then it fit . She did n't want to return it because she liked it .
 I purchased these to replace a pair of Zipp valve extenders I was using on a set of 404s . I found that the Zipp extenders did n't allow the pump to attach securely , so topping off the tires was always a two person job . Reviews of the Topeaks -LRB- like the ones here -RRB- suggest that pumps will attach securely . Sadly , this turns out to not be the case , and I 've tried it with a number of different pumps . And the valves , once the pump is attached , will release nearly as much air as your putting in . I understand that some people have no problems with this , but if I were in the market again , I 'd just buy 80mm tubes -LRB- which I have since done -RRB- . I recognize that that is n't an option for people running really deep rims .
 I could not get a good seal between the valve stem and the Topeak extension . I had to pump fast with a good floor pump just to stay ahead of the leakage . I tried tightening the extension , but it did n't seem to help . The package claims that there is an O-ring seal , but it did n't come with an O-ring , and there was no mention of an O-ring in the instructions . I inspected the extension with a magnifying glass to see if there was an O-ring inside of it , but there was not . The valve extensions that came with my Mavic wheels use a small O-ring that you place on the valve stem before you screw on the extension . They work very well and I have never had them leak . The down side is that the O-rings are very small , fragile and easy to loose if you drop one on the side of the road . I bought the Topeak extension hoping it would work without having to use an O-ring , but unfortunately it does n't . I plan to look for some small O-rings and see if the Topeak valve extensions will work with them .
 I rarely write reviews but felt compelled to do so for this product.I have been through about 5 of these in the last few years , the latest pair went yesterday when I was about 5 miles from he nearest train station and i got a flat , bothe extenders failed and broke . I wonder if topeak will refund me the price of a new pair of cleats?It seems that the bit that attaches to the valve stem splits very easily.I 'll be using 80mm valve tubes from now on .
 The extender looks good on the outside , but the threading inside the extender is a plastic insert -LRB- too weak to hold a seal or hold on the bike over time -RRB- so if you Teflon tape and then try & really snug it down the treads will pop in the extender , thus making a bad seal and something that will likely fall off later . You want an extender with a machined thread , not a cheapo plastic insert .
 was trying to replace the valve on my evos and thought this was a valve in itself . Why else would I buy this thing . It is heavy because it has a shaft the runs down the middle to engage the existing valve . for the extra weight gained over my zipp extenders I get the benefit of being able to let the air out easier . For me not a value . In fact it is already in the trash ,
 Was not able to use this to inflate my tubes because it did n't seal properly.I 'm not sure if my unit was defective or if it was n't compatible with my tubes . Regardless , this product was a waste of $ 7 and is going in the trash .
 I tried three of these in different sizes for my HED wheel and could never get the seal between the extender and my valve to work well . You can not tighten these hard enough to get a good seal or they strip the threads . I ended up buying extenders where you could take out the core and put it into the extender . They work great ; as long as your tube has a removeable core , I would recommend this approach .
 It does n't seem as good as ones I 've had before . The indents were ripped and you can just tell the poor quality of the cheesehead .
 The Cheesehead is a classic item and this is the original and not a knock-off , which is great . However , the item arrived dirty and slightly torn . I do not doubt that the product I received is new , rather it looks like it was possibly damaged during shipping so it does not look like it is brand new . I understand that the material of which it is made makes it easy for it to tear and get dirty , but I feel that perhaps more care during packaging and perhaps some kind of protective wrapping could have prevented the damage . I purchased the hat as a gift and now have a dirty , torn birthday present to give .
 The cheese head does n't fit very comfortably on most peoples head because the hole is shallow . The foam can also easily tear if you 're not careful . My son really wanted it for Christmas so I bought it but if I had seen it in person first I probably would n't have bought it .
 Ok smith went cheap when the start making there knifes in China ! So you do n't get a great U.S.A. made knife anymore . All swat knifes fall apart and do n't stay sharp for than a week ! They rust and break , plus everyone on here wants to much for these cheap knifes ! You can go to the gun show and get these 2 for $ 20 . If u want a good knife spend your money on a Benchmade knife ! Trust me its worth it when its the last knife you ever will buy ! But dont get me wrong if u find one made in the U.S.A. buy it ! It will say U.S.A. on the blade .
 I love the look and brightness of this light but you may get 2 dozen uses if you 're lucky on each $ 8 battery . You also ca n't find the camera battery just anywhere.I have to buy another light just to afford my ride into work . I am replacing batteries every month and i 'm never feeling comfortable riding unless I have at least 1 spare in my bike pouch.I 'd love to keep it but ca n't rely on it turning on every time .
 this light is brit but the battrey does not last very long at all in it so try to buy the rechargle battrey for it that will help u out !
 This is an all around horrible gun . It breaks balls , is not accurate , and does not work in bad weather . DO NOT GET THE SPYDER XTRA !!! get the Spyder Sonix , Spyder TL-R , Tippmann A-5 , or Tippmann 98 Custom instead
 I 'm going to have to add my voice to the chorus of others here reviewing this particular rain cover . I thought maybe those people just got a defective cover or something but they did n't . First and most importantly , this cover does n't fit the Topeak EXP trunk bag at all . It supposedly has those side covers shown in the picture for the panniers but they do n't even remotely fit . You could n't have the panniers down and actually covered with this cover at all.Ironically , I also have a Topeak EX Trunk Bag -LRB- a smaller version of the EXP without the panniers that is 13.8 by 8.3 by 7.5 inches and 8 L in capacity -RRB- that I ordered a rain cover for at the same time that I ordered this one . It turns out that that rain cover fits both the EX and the EXP with no problem . The panniers wo n't be totally covered on the EXP but it will cover enough to give some rain protection.On their website , Topeak shows the rain cover for the EXP as a larger silver one but I have n't been able to find that one anywhere -LRB- it 's always out of stock -RRB- . I think that 's the proper cover ; it 's definitely not this one .
 I commute alot so getting a rain cover was great . So when I got it and tried to put it on , I was very disappointed . The picture is very misleading . It looks to be a perfect fit , but hardly the story . The cover might be able to fit over a purse or book bag , but not your typical trunk bag . Would not recommend this to anyone , complete waist of money and time .
 The image should have put it to scale with a bike . This product NO WAY fits typical panniers or least the ones I have . To give you a perspective , it fits nicely on my bike seat as a rain cover for transport , but not good for anything else . Well made product , but the ad was inadvertently deceptive . Perhaps the incredible shrinking man can use it after he transits the basement screen entering the garden at the end of the film .
 I have waited 5 weeks , and I still have not received my order . The item costs $ 420.90 . I am completely displeased with this seller . Do not order anything from them .
 I LOVE FOOTBALL , so i was excited to see towels from my favorite team . WRONG ! these towels are of poor quality , and the silk screening is already coming off -- they have n't even been used yet ! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM .
 My daughter is a big Packer fan . Every time they win a game , she puts one on her car antenna .
 This light , was cool at first . I mean , it looks cool and works cool . But , the problem is , the water can easily leak into the light and cause it works in a weird way , which means the waterproof was bad with this light . It will flash itself when the water goes in especially during the rainy day until the battery dead out . Or , the push button on the top of the light ca n't work well.Conclusion , unless you have lot of money , do n't buy this one and waste your time ... I am one of the victim ...
 In theory it is a superb idea , 360 ' of light visibility.In reality , the light is a novelty.-The batteries used to power it are not common . It lasted almost 8 months of daily commuting , then when I went to replace the batteries I discovered they use a R1-N battery type....lame-The LED output is far lower than equivocally priced rear bicycle lights.-As noted in other reviews , the yellow lights are useless.-I never had a problem with the plastic bracket itself , though the rubber band that holds it on has had to be replaced after being exposed to the elements . Also , the bracket is such that it does not easily attach to the rear of any other racks.All in all I would not recommend this product , nor will I be looking into other Topeak light systems .
 Hopeless light - not very strong . Also the 2mm hex key that opens the casing is n't distributed when you buy the light . I am now looking to buy a new light after just less than a year : -LRB-
 This tail light was not nearly as bright as I thought it would be . The size at night will make people misjudge the distance . During the day ? Forget about it , it 's almost invisible . The mounting bracket is a joke , loose as a goose on fiber . Uses odd sized batteries , might have a problem getting them just anywhere . Look for Cateye products , much better . More pricey , but can you put a pice on safety ?
 Dont trust this seller . THe product arrived with damaged packaging , missing instructions , and missing parts . Im surprised Amazon lets this seller continue representing their brand
 This light wo n't stay clipped on to the back of a Topeak rack -LRB- one of the major reasons I got the light and the rack -RRB- . Everytime you hit a bump if the light does n't fly off the batteries bounce and the light is turned off . Took off my Topeak rack and went back to my little seat bag and my Planet Bike flashing red light . What a waste of time and money .
 Okay ... first warning
 It fell off the clip on second ride and is lost forever ... Ca n't return it without the light !!! Do not buy this .
 The light unit itself is ok ; it 's good that it has LEDs on the sides as well as the back . -LRB- Be warned , though , that opening/closing the light to put batteries in requires taking out bolts with a 2mm hex socket , requiring a 2mm hex key which is n't included . Also , the batteries are of the uncommon `` type N '' , although at least a new one includes batteries . -RRB- However , the clip that the light attaches to is badly designed . For one thing , it 's EXTREMELY difficult to remove the light from the clip -LRB- it requires pulling back hard on a flexible plastic tab while simultaneously pulling back on the light unit -RRB- . Secondly , it allows adjusting the angle by way of a single pivot point , with a bolt to be tightened to stop the pivot point from pivoting ; problem is , the bolt is n't always sufficient to hold it in place -- even when the bolt is tightened , it may gradually be tilted down by the weight of the light unit while the bike is being ridden . Thirdly , depending on the angle and width of the upright cylinder that the clip is attached to -LRB- with the elastic band -RRB- , it may swivel left/right while the bike is being ridden .
 I was in dire need of a `` cheese '' hat for Halloween and I thought that a cowboy hat would be perfect . It was GREEN felt ! Not `` cheese . '' Needless to say I was less than impressed with the product .
 I ordered this thinking it would be a foam hat but I and received a green hat made of felt material not what was described .
 I bought this as a gift thinking the cheese hat would be awesome for a Greenbay fan . I got a green felt hat . Luckily I got refunded !
 my worst choice in amazon , someone send in opened box one first of all . i regret i didnt return this very first time . noticible screch on the body.break line gear line , bolts , nuts werent tight , handle was twisted , not stright , so i have to adjust from local store which damaged another 25 dollers . this bike totalllly made in china so you can imagine the quality . now it sit on my living room , whenever i saw this i feel sick and tired of it . disguesting , , , i 'd reconsider amazon.com
 About a month back I was in the market for a folding bike . I needed something I could take on the train and fit into the truck of my small car . After researching online I found the Mobiky Genius . It sounded perfect . So I ordered it off Amazon.As usual , the Amazon transaction went off without a hitch and the bike arrived exactly as promised . The packaging looked solid without dents or holes.That 's when the problems began . Even though the packaging was un-damaged , when I opened the box I noticed the front brake assembly was bent . I 'm guessing at happened at the factory before it got into the box but who knows . It was bent to such an extent that I could not lock the bike into its unfolded position . Rather than dealing with hassle and delay of returning the bike I took it to my local bike shop and paid $ 80 more for repair . They actually had to bend the caliper back into shape by hand because they could not locate any source for replacement parts . The brakes are now weak but adequate . I thought they were weak because of the kluge repair but , based on the other reviews on this page , I 'm starting to think it might just be how they 're designed.Oh well . A small price to pay for all the time this cool little bike was going to shave off my commute . And it did exactly that ... for the first week.Riding to work one morning I noticed the right pedal starting to wobble . I pulled over and found the main screw attaching the pedal assembly through the frame was loose and starting to strip . So I found a hardware store , bought a wrench , tightened it and went on my way . That night I got home and took apart the pedal assembly . Turns out a washer was missing which caused the rotation of the pedals to unscrew the assemble ! So I did kluge fix # 2 having to do with blue thread locker and an old washer . Not exactly what I expected on a week old $ 600 bike.Another week goes by and the thing is great . Easy to fold and unfold . Fast . Nimble . And saving me a ton of time . Then I notice a little wobble in the back wheel when cornering . The first couple times I thought it had to do with lack of traction . But the wobble kept getting more and more pronounced until yesterday when the whole back wheel stated to bend on my ride home . F@#$! What now . Turns out some of the spokes started to separate from the wheel hub and break . Once a couple spokes break it puts more pressure on the remaining spokes and they go too . Long story short , I took it to a couple bike shops and , you guessed it , nobody can locate replacement parts . The rear wheel is not repairable so the bike sits in my garage and I walk to work.I tried contacting the manufacture several times via email and phone . No response . My bad luck.Very frustrating . It 's the perfect solution for my commute dilemma . The design and frame quality are really outstanding . But many of the components are sub-par , the assembly is of poor quality and the manufacturer support sucks.The bike has been a real disappointment ... mostly because it has such promise .
 Mobiky Genius Folding BikeThe bicycle was a work of art and I loved the way it folded and unfolded quickly and easily . But it arrived with a very large hole in the box that caused a pedal to wear a hole all the way through the carry bag and out the box . I also immediately noticed that when I held the handlebars straight -- it turned to the right ! I took it to a reputable bike shop -LRB- that had never seen a Mobiky before which caused me some concern -RRB- , and they confirmed that the handlebars were welded wrong , the bike was defective , and would have to be returned.I tried to contact the manufacturer but it was impossible to reach a live person and they never responded to my call or follow-up email . I loved the bike and wish the manufacturer had been more responsive as I 'm afraid to order another one without full assurance that I can easily obtain `` routine replacements '' in the future.Amazon phone staff were great . They were patient , helpful , and reimbursed me for a new box . While I 'm still waiting to hear they 've received the bike , which was picked up from the bike shop a week ago , they 've promised to reimburse the purchase amount .
 Way to small for a tailgate trash can ! Did not pay attention to the size when we ordered it -- it is a hassle pulling out the bags all the time
 SwissMemory 0.6071.26 G1 was sent instead of SwissMemory 0.6021.26 G1 , and amazon 's customer service gave me the wrong vendor to contact.SwissMemory 0.6071.26 G1 is only a thumbdrive , with zero other `` Swiss Army Knife '' features , except the cross on the outside cover . Not what I was expecting.My 15 year-old son is using this `` knifless '' model , since it is permitted by his high school as a key chain . Otherwise I would rate the SwissMemory 0.6071.26 G1 thumbdrive -LRB- only -RRB- as a $ 62 Eunuch.However , the model # 21.26 G1 has a traditional Swiss Army Knife blade and scissors and other standard features on a Swiss army knife , plus a thumdrive , which fits on a keychain . Much more useful for an adult.However , you can not get help from Amazon to fix this error .
 I have owned this pump for about 2 years now . It certainly is the smallest , lightest pump out there , but it can only inflate a road tube to about 60 psi -LRB- I 've seen riders bend stems pumping away with this little wheezer -RRB- . Thats ok to limp home on from a training ride , but it 's not good enough if you are self suppporting or want to finish a long ride after dealing with a flat . You will be better off with a more substantial pump or CO2 . Recommended as a back up only.Follow up - Got a flat tire mountain biking last month -LRB- tube type set-up -RRB- . Thought I had my larger pump along , but it turned out to be this one in the camelback . Turns out it pumped up the mountain bike tube just fine -LRB- lots of pumps required of course , it does n't move much air -RRB- . Apparently this pump is ok getting pressures in mtb range -LRB- 55 psi in this case -RRB- , but ca n't get a road tube even close to 100 . So now this pump is in the mountain bike repair kit .
 Bushnell Nighthawk # 26-0900Don ' t waste your time or money on this one . It 's just a cheap B&W ; video camera with IR LEDs . It takes advantage of the CCD sensitivity to IR so you can see in total darkness only with the IR LEDs turned on . Without the IR LEDs , the low light sensitivity is very poor . You will be able to see better in low light without this device . The display screen is completely black under low light conditions where you can see clearly and easily without assistance . With IR LEDs on , you can see about 10-15 ft , but the LCD display is blindingly bright . This device does not have a photomultiplier so it is not true night vision . It makes claims that it does not live up to . I returned mine immediately , since it is nothing more than junk .
 The item pictured IS NOT a range finder - but the Bushnell `` NightHawk '' night vision device . Apparently they have mixed up the photos . Please be aware of what you are buying ...
 These shorts were bought because they advertised a 5 '' inseam . The inseam is 6.25 '' , a 25 % longer inseam . I have always had good dealings with Amazon but these shorts are misadvertised .
 Of the first 6 balls I received , 3 warped within the first three weeks . The folks at Amazon have been nice enough to replace those three with the promise of replacing the rest if they do the same -LRB- They have not been put into use yet . -RRB- So far the replacement balls have not warped and seem to be doing well . They are used on a daily basis and are a nice combination of good grip , weight and durability . If they continue to not warp I would raise the score to 4 stars .

 Had played `` cage ball volleyball '' growing up as a kid , and thought for our outdoor barbeque for about 100 college students it would be a fun game to play . $ 150 seemed a lot , but figured we 'd get good use from this.Was surprised when the package arrived that the inner balloon is literally a balloon . I thought it would have been a bit stronger material for a ball of this type . Well we blew it up , , tested it out with three taps . It bumped a branch from a tree and popped.End of story.So for the 10 seconds of use we got out of it , it was definitely not worth it .
 these are cute but they are huge ! the earrings are attached in a way so that the cheese faces in a weird direction so i had to bend them to not stick out so far .
 We were disappointed in the quality of this earring . They did not sit right on our ear . The cheese piece did not meet our expectation of quality . I could not recommend this product to purchase : - -LRB-
 No touch or feel with this ball . It is like a piece of white and yellow plastic . C'mon Wilson , let 's move on to a new model . Cuz this one sucks .
 The watch is quite beautiful . Would have been better if it worked . The second hand kept sticking on the 34th second .
 The hat is exactly what I wanted ... almost . The flag that is embroidered on the back is messed up . It has gray where there should be white and the blue is not where it should be either . Most people wo n't notice . That 's why it 's so cheap though .
 My son uses this for his school books and by the 3rd day , the fabric had frayed and the rope came through the hole .
 The ball came within the time frame indicated at sale , but looked old/worn/dirty when I got it . I do n't want to go through the hassle of sending it back though , but I hope the one I sent my friend for her birthday looked new !
 Well the item did n't get delivered from my understanding ! The money was credited back into my acount what I would like is for the merchandise be sent to the following address 8171 Norris RD Dunn NC , 28334 . If there is any issues with this please e-mail me back thank you for my time .
 I purchased this IT band to use during long distance hikes . First , I tested it by walking around my home . However , when I removed it , a rash had formed on my leg under the band . This surprised me , but I assumed that I had wrapped it too tight . On my hike -LRB- 25 miles -RRB- , the band would not stay in place -LRB- obviously , I was sweating -RRB- . I tried several adjustments , but eventually gave up and it slid down close to my knee cap . At the end of the hike , I saw that it had rubbed a sore on my leg -LRB- about an inch long -RRB- . So , in the area of comfort and staying in place , it fails on both accounts . The product description specifically says that the band is comfortable and stays in place . This was not the case with me.Nevertheless , the band held my IT band in place , so I 'll rate the item with two stars . I 'm returning the unit to Amazon .
 This band did not do any for me in activity other than restrict my range of movement . I did have a very tight IT band from dancing for years . It might be better for runners . What worked ? A super firm black roller and stretching out the hips .
 Pro-Tec Athletics IT Band Compression Wrap-I ordered this strap as a replacement for one previously purchased from Pro-Tec online . Though the packaging is the same the quality and design has change.The strap is thinner and the square pressure point pad is much smaller than the strap I bought previously . I was very disappointed . Wanted to return it but had thrown out the packaging . Appears they are going with a cheaper manufacturer . I would not buy this product again .
 If you have an over developed IT band I do not recommend this product . I got mine in the mail today and could n't wait to go for a jog ... After about 30 mins I started feeling the infamous `` IT band ache '' . I removed the compression wrap and felt the worst pain I have ever experienced since I started having issues with my IT band 7 years ago . I can barely bend my knee right now .
 I got this hoping it would help with my IT band issues . Not only did it not work , but I had to constantly adjust it on the run as it has a tendency to bite into your leg if it 's not perfectly positioned.I think the company paid Scott Jurek to use his image using it , that 's about the only good thing I could determine about this product .
 I tweaked my IT band 3 weeks before marathon . Purchased this product in hopes of getting some relief since I was not about to stop running and rest the leg -LRB- until after the marathon -RRB- . The product did nothing positive for me . After a week or so of experimenting with it during training runs , I completed my training and ran the marathon without it .
 I do n't feel that this was any help at all to the IT Band , I would not recommend this product .
 I bought this item and , after trying it once , promptly returned it . Not only did it do NOTHING to help my IT band , it had velcro in crazy places that kept catching my pants and snagging them . I can only imagine what it would have done to me if I 'd been wearing shorts .
 I had ITBS and was grasping at straws to find anyting for relief - so I bought this product . It did absolutely nothing.Money would be much better spent buying a foam cylinder to roll on Foam Roller - 6 '' x 36 '' Round or go to a health food store and buy an ointment called TraumeelTraumeel Ointment 100 Gm Tube . The high density foam roller , though painful at first , definitely helps . So does the ointment - much better than Ben Gay or equivalents , although they do help a little.Don ' t waste your money on this band .
 I walk about six miles a day on my job and I do n't believe these are intended to wear for an eight hour shift -LRB- 40 hours a week -RRB- . The material next to your skin is rubber -LRB- does not breath -RRB- and causes irritation and break outs that take forever to go away . Itches like crazy ! This product does support and relieve leg pain , but I would not recommend this brand to others who need to wear on a regular basis . Another employee bought these also and had the same problem that I did , so it 's the product , not the user . I recommend a product that ` breathes ' as a better alternative to these .
 I found a pair of stretchable Velcro bands at Lowes for $ 4.97 and it does the job nicely . So compare the price
 I 'm a novice runner and hurt my IT band for the second time . Was hoping this was my solution but I think I 'm just not cut out for running . This IT Band Wrap did n't help me at all .
 I had problems with my ITB and this thing did not work . I knee brace with a whole for the kneecap worked much better . Do n't waste your money .
 It did n't work for me . It arrived in a timely manner in good enough packaging . The quality seems fine . I only used it once , because it did n't work for me . Your experience may be different . I did wind up in physical therapy , because the IT band pain became too great , so my condition may have been too severe for this to work for me .
 Band is well made but did not help with the problem I am having which is pain down the left front ofmy left leg . Stretching seems to help the most .
 I purchased this for my 15 year old grandson for Christmas.This is a semi-automatic . He played with it once , it seemed to be ok . Next time out he had to cock it each time.I tried to return it but because of the C02 its against the law to ship it back . I was ` nt aware of that , so I 'm just giving you heads up if anything should go wrong . Your stuck with it .
 I would not recommend this product . The brush is very small which is ok , but youre not getting a great quality for the price . The bristles are starting to wear down after just a few months . Go buy a better and cheaper brush from your local hardware store !
 The ball came defective . I send it to my niece in Mexico and she put some air but an hour after was flat again . I did n't bother to send it back for replacement or refund because I was going to spend more time and money than what I paid for ball .
 The soft touch ball I received has what appears to be a tear on it . I can see the underlying fabric of the ball through the tear.I am wondering whether it is a defect or actually an inflation hole . It does not look like the inflation holes of my other volleyballs . Can anyone help answer this question here ? Thanks !
 Yes I must admit that my daughter loves the car , but it is a really really low quality car . I do n't think anyone reading the reviews would imagine how low the quality is . Yeah it costs almost $ 25 but it is probably worse $ 5 . Find another car for your child . It is nt worth the money AT ALL !
 I bought this as a Christmas gift to my Grandson.A part was missing , and the information I received so far is , this is not a returnable item.Due to this fact , I am unable to retrieve money back for this purchase .
 My son uses this for his school books and by the 3rd day , the fabric had frayed and the rope came through the hole .
 Size is a big disappointment . They measure 3 &#34; x 6 &#34; , not much bigger than an index card . The quality is fine and holes are pre-punched but if you are expecting these to be the size of a small race bib , order something else .
 Tear resistant race numbers are fine for an informal race or event . Check some shoe company resources or other sponsors .
 this item is no a good product at all . it gets stuck too often and does not work all the time . the only way to get it to work perfect is to extract it fully and that leaves extra cord everywhere . nobody should buy .
 I do not own a folding bike , but rather a Breezer Citizen , one of their commuter bikes . If my experience with this bike is anything by which to judge Breezer , I would counsel against buying from them . The bike has gone through three bottom brackets in less than a year of extremely light use . It seemed like the moment I got the bike home , it began to fall apart . I 've gotten about 1 week of trouble free use from it . To add insult to injury , Breezer customer support will not respond to my requests for information . Steer clear of these guys .
 Came used . Not bad for the price but not good either . Not sure if I really want to use it , considering how worn it is .
 this blanket is not worth buying . it is not triple thick , and it is not wash safe . i followed the directions on how to wash and dry it and when i pulled it out of the dryer it was unraveled ! do not order this from any company because the blanket is all the same no matter where you go . i bought it for my boyfriend for christmas and now i have to get him a new gift .
 My son uses this for his school books and by the 3rd day , the fabric had frayed and the rope came through the hole .
 I 'm not going to waste your time with a detailed description on everything this video lacks . I 'm just going to give a quick list .1 . Intensity
 Hi i really want a pair of the XL max-4 bib overalls when will you have some more available ? Thank you .
 They are not for cold weather . Although , I 'm not sure why you would want bibs for tepid weather . My husband was dials appointed with the insulative quality of these bibs
 I bought this specifically for the gym . It really looked good and felt good at first but only to shrink about 4 inches after the first wash . Now I am no longer able to wear it . as it is just too short . I was expecting a quality product but I guess I was wrong .
 I do n't know why these pants are so expensive , cheap material , they will shrink cold cycle or not , not impressed at all
 If you think you need this bit , you need to learn how to ride and train a horse better . There is never a need for such severity .
 this light is not all what it claims to be ! it is ok as a spare one but not as your only small light .
 These shorts were bought because they advertised a 5 '' inseam . The inseam is 6.25 '' , a 25 % longer inseam . I have always had good dealings with Amazon but these shorts are misadvertised .
 Was very disappointing . Very thin and cheap made . I will use but dont think it will last long .
 I bought the Streamlight 51002 and was immediately impressed by the construction and how it felt in hand . The honeymoon was over quickly as I pushed the switch -LRB- too stiff -RRB- , experienced the beam -LRB- not bright by today 's standards , three modes
 This light is build very well but the output is disappointing at best . LED out is quite blue in color and not very bright by todays standards . The xenon is also dim and not focused . Not useful outdoors as light output does not project well at all . Looking for a CREE or K2 mod .
 I purchased this item specifically for its claims of long-lasting light off a single pair of D batteries . My most recent experience is that the advertised battery life of 80 hours for the 5 LED setting was reduced to about 5 hours in ~ 15 Deg F temperatures . I got the light for use in overnight trail running where I did n't want to have to carry spare batteries , and was nearly left out in the dark . I 've heard other complaints about the 3-way switches giving out , so that may be what 's wrong as well . I 'm hoping to be able to return it.On the plus side , it does make a nice amount of light , although I do n't really see any difference between the 10 LED 's and 1 xenon bulb to be honest .
 Liked Mag Lite , got tired of replacing batteries , and its a bit over large . Streamlight sounded good , more efficient design with LEDs and traditional Xenon combination and with aircraft alum construction.Realiy is that the construction is indeed great , equal of Mag . Problem is that the LED light is really strange flourescent-like blue that does n't project much light at all . What it does project is off color and tends to distort colors of other things . Find myself going for more light from the xenon quite often -LRB- and in process loosing the LED efficiency benefit -RRB- , but the way this designed , with 10 holes to accomodate the LEDs the reflector weakens the xenon into a short , limited beam . `` A '' for construction quality , but other than that this product does n't satisfy if you are seeking real brightness .
 i concur with what someone else said , that the xenon bulb is practically no brigher than the led , very possibly the led is brighter than the xenon , therefore there is really no point in having a dual purpose flashlight . i did n't want to leave a `` bad '' review ... but i returned this light for refund . i do think streamlight makes quality products and intend to someday buy a different model
 Without a doubt one of the worst new wave flashlights I 've ever tried . Yeah it is built like the proverbial brick house but the spot is weak , the flood is weak , it eats batteries . There are a ton of way better and similarly priced flashlights available on Amazon . I would not waste your money on this one .
 Did n't even outlast the first set of batteries before the thing just stopped working . I did n't bother contacting the company because I was so disappointed -LRB- and would n't even want to use it anymore -RRB- . I will never buy anything from Streamlight again . Performance is poor , the LED light is blue and the Xenon is a joke . $ 45 bucks tossed into the recycling bin -- wasted money . See my other reviews for a far superior light .
 And I did n't really feel it thoroughly washed the suits or even took out the scent of chlorine . I would not buy this again .
 it does not fit rightit is hard to adjustable it around your ankle `` even though i have huge legs `` it caused me couple injuries with no noticeable benefitsince it does not adjust around your ankle you could tell it is joke to think it will adjust around your wrist.i am not one of those people enjoy writing negative review about the others in fact this is the first negative review i write in AMAZON.for how bad was the product i will stay away from any similar products .
 They are large and inconvinient to wear , the sand bags -LRB- weights -RRB- bulge so much that it 's impossible to tighten them on our legs . They will always slip down . Sand bags are hardly adjustable . Worse of all , just after 2 day , small holes appear on each one of the ten sand bags . I would not waste my time typing all these commands if it 's not true . I do n't know why does it has so many 4-5 stars , but take my advice , DO NOT BUY THEM , the return shipping will cost 20 $ !!!!
 They were way to bulky and not very comfortable . I have seen a lot better on the market that work a lot better .
 We got these weights for my wife . You ca n't adjust them tight enough around her ankles , so they slide up and down . There are no instructions at all , on how to use them , or anythingThey 're way too big -LRB- to wrap around the ankle -RRB- for a woman and they 're too big even for me.I ca n't imagine them being used on anyone 's wrists
 My 12 year old son is doing Physical Therapy for a loose patella . I was told to buy adjustable 20 lb weights . The idea being that he is 12 and will be bigger and stronger over the years and I might as well get them for the long haul.So we get the weights , my son puts in two weight packs - 4lbs . He attempts to tighten the velcro straps . They can only tighten so much do to the design . They have a fixed minimum diameter that is much bigger than my kid 's ankles.And that leaves him with ankle weights that slide up ad down his leg as he attempts to do these required leg lifts.I am 5 foot 2 inches and I could n't get them to wrap around my ankles either.I did not try all 10 lbs in the pockets as that defeats the point of having adjustable weights.Seriously . Do they actually try these items before they manufacture them?Another suggestion
 Even with some of the weight packets removed , these are extremely difficult to get secured when using as wrist weights . They slide down and you have to hold them at the edge with your hand to keep them in place . I do not recommend them for use as wrist weights .
 After reviewing other ankle weights , I was hopeful this product would give a good workout while being comfortable . Unfortunately , the metal D-rings used to secure the velcro strap are at just the right spot that they dig into my ankles . My ankles are a normal size , but this wrap did n't get all the way around them . Then , at the open part , the D-rings dig in painfully . Tried to put some athletic tape over the D-rings for padding , but it still was n't comfortable.In order to get the wrap secure enough that it would n't slide around , it needed to be super tight , and really was uncomfortable . Probably would be OK if you were doing some leg strength moves , but was essentially impossible to do running or any plyo strength moves . The wrap just slid around too much.The weights are adjustable . They are plastic sandbags . I think that those bags could be easily punctured when not in the wrap , just need to be careful when taking them out.I 've only used it for one workout session and ca n't see myself using it again .
 I returned this item as soon as I received it . When I purchased `` Adjustable Ankle Weight '' , I planned to start from 2 pounds and add up the pounds as I trained myself . But when I took out the 4 bags of 8 pounds , the strap did not tighten up to my ankle . Strap was n't made up to be adjustable , after taking out the weight . I got so disappointed by this product !!!
 I was n't impressed with these , they were bulky and awkward even after removing some of the weights . I do n't recommend them .
 Will wear through quickly , but at least as good a deal as solid bar weights from Everlast at half the cost
 What a shame . The ankle weights are smooth against the skin and look like they are made to be comfortable . The problem however is that these are HUGE ! They are not made for average sized people let alone smaller people like myself . I can guess that these would n't even fit a man . You 'd have to be buff to wear these and your calves have to be huge . They 're totally falling off . Also , the weight is distributed into too small parts and does n't feel like ten pounds but more like ` five . If you have fitness goals , these wo n't help you reach them .
 I 've been weight training for years and even do competitive stairclimbing . I bought these with the idea that I would use them to train for stairclimbing.I 'm not a small woman ... 5 feet 8 inches , 135 lbs , but these weights were almost impossible to keep on my ankles ... they just do n't seem to be made for an average woman 's ankles.I may pass these onto my husband who is 6 feet 2 and 220 lbs . I would not recommend these for an average sized woman .
 These weights are heavy . However , if you are a female with small ankles , these weights will be to large . Would not recommend for small ankles . I can not even wrap them around my wrist because they would fall off from not getting tight enough .
 i liked them although they were very bulky , but somehow it ripped and now one of the bags always falls out : -LRB-
 The box is labeled `` 20 lb Adjustable Ankle/Wrist Weights '' . But you 'll get a pair of 10 lb adjustable weights if you order this product . Otherwise they are as advertised .
 When the dumbbells arrived on my porch , I could smell a rubber/chemical odor eminating from the packaging . I took them to my basement gym and opon removing them , I was impressed with the construction and durability of the weights . But that odor . After a few hours , it filled the house , giving my wife and I a headache . So I moved them to the garage . After 6 weeks , the odor has ceased and they are back in my basement . The compounds used should be reconsidered .
 The ad made it sound like there would be MANY balls , not six . The balls look fine , but they were not a real deal . I am happy , except for content .
 this hammock is too small to fit my standard size hammock -LRB- which previously held a pawley island hammock -RRB- . not sure if they sent me the wrong size or if the dimensions are wrong in the description . also the hammock itself is a single layer of unlined fabric . i 'm returning it .
 Very happy with it for the first 2 months of summer by Aug had to but it in the garbage . . it lost its shape and was dangerous for my kids to be on . . Could flip very easy . . on well
 This was such a terrible hammock that I wan na see if I can return it . I got the stand too and it 's even worse :-LRB- not happy
 the cue was shipped quickly . i was a little disappointed when i received a big canton with two sticks loose inside . the package was very poor . the plastic was broken . somebody had opened it.but the cue is quite good . helped me in a few games .

 Bought this for my husband 's birthday . I was appalled to find out , by reading the warning label , that it contains lead and can cause cancer , birth defects and reproductive problems . It also says to wash your hands after handling . I returned it but had to pay the return fee myself . Not feeling too warm and fuzzy about this purchase !
 My husband threw a 20 `` x9 '' flat mailing bag at me and said `` I hope this is n't your new winter coat . `` Argh.In Wisconsin this would be considered an early spring jacket . It literally weighs nothing , and is thinner than denim when pinched . If it had fit , I 'd have warn it today -LRB- 28 degrees on March 19th -RRB- and probably been comfortable walking dogs.I am 5 ' 3.5 '' , 128 # . I got the medium because reviews said this coat runs large , but I wanted enough room to put many layers underneath . I tried it on , and the waist is as snug as it could be for me to still zip it . My husband said it looked funny because it was too tight . It was the right length for me , so I think it would be too short for a tall person . The rest of it fit fine - so if I went a size bigger the sleeves would likely be too long . No way I could put layers under it.The outer material is extremely thin , and seems like it would wear or even tear very easily -LRB- no proof of that . Hard to return if I rip it ! -RRB- . It is an awesome color . Purple , but just barely on the side of maroon to tone it down . The cords are purple and white swirls . I had no trouble with the zipper . It feels very soft and cushy.I 'd say it could be a terrific lightweight winter jacket for a skinny , average-to-short woman in mild snowy weather . Otherwise find a coat with different dimensions.I wish I could find a true arctic / sub-zero woman 's coat !!! How come only the boys get to stay warm ???

 I thought this product was a good fit for my needs - an inexpensive wireless heartrate/speedometer . As it turns out , the directions for setting the unit were very difficult to follow and then the heart rate monitor stopped working within one week . now the battery is running low after about a month . I would have been much better off spending a few extra dollars up front to avoid the frustration and battery costs , not to mention that i now have a unit that does n't function as a heartrate monitor . very disappointing . the upside is you get to learn from my mistake rather than making it for yourself .
 terrible instructions and a bad install setup - do you really want to be driving a set screw into your spoke ? then i never could get the transmitter and head unit to sync . the main brands are so much easier to get working why bother ?
 I used this imitation of bicycle computer for a little more than a month with terrible results it just never work , I really do not have words to describe this nusty mistake I made buying it . I finally replace it with a real computer that cost me about $ 25.00 dollars a cateye by the way this nusty product -LRB- the sigma -RRB- cost me $ 120.00 dollars sorry I do no give it not even a star . it end at trash can .
 If you stop to talk to friends this bike computer will lock up and get in a state that no longer registers speed . The only way to reset it is to take it out of the mount and put it back in , not very safe when you 're trying to ride along . The rubber band mounts did not fill me with confidence and I came back to my garage one day to find the sensor on the ground . good job that did n't happen on a ride . The provided bands are not big enough to go around mtb suspension forks . Try a VDO MC1 .0 Wired Cycle Computer instead it 's much better -LRB- but no Heart Rate Monitor -RRB- .
 I bought this Sigma computer with HRM and Altimeter prior to riding in the Bicycle Tour ofColorado in June 2009 . I liked everything about the computer except the way the transmitter affixed to the front fork . There were problems from the start with the transmitter being too close to the spokes and hitting spokes after potholes . I was constantly adjusting the distance of the transmitter . Finally on a steep bumpy downhill the transmitter battery cover went flying off never to be found . Being a hard head I bought another one and affixed it to the fork using the second installation option . It lasted for 15 minutes of riding before that one went flying off never to be seen again . Maybe Sigma can find a better way to install the transmitter . I have had many cycle computers over the years and have never had the transmitter or part of it go flying off the bike . Nice computer bad installation design . Maybe they 'll send me a new transmitter so I can go for strike 3 .
 I purchased this for my father who recently suffered a heart attack . When I attempted to mount this on his Trek Madone I could not find a good place to mount the sensor . Once mounted the bike computer seemed to function well . However , after a few rides the computer did n't work . A local bike shop managed to temporarily fix the unit during a routine service . Time will tell if this will continue to work . I would not recommend this product due to the installation requirements .

 We ended up returning these ... they just felt strange and did n't fit quite right . Return policy was easy peasy though .
 I have had this bike for about a year . I rode it through the winter and it served as my primary means of transportation . I purchased it because it is aluminium , it is comparatively cheap , it has a full suspension , and it has several gears . It has a few problems . When folded it flops open and is awkward to carry as a result of that and its significant weight . It can not reasonably be carried on the bus , but it can slightly more easily be taken in a vehicle , compared to a full size fixed bike . Many of the parts could not last through the winter even with good handling . The derailer comes with recessed screws which are impossible to adjust when they get a bit of rust on them . The brake cable housing is rusted thoroughly . The joints are getting harder and harder to keep together and rust is creeping in the joints . The biggest problem is that the steering tube is now broken . This bike has many good qualities as I mentioned , but it has a long way to go before it is a viable commuter bike .
 I bought this since my daughter and I go to the parks often . But was very unsatisfied with the product . We use it for a couple of minutes and had to put it away . My daughter is 16months old and every time she tried to stand up she would slip and fall on her bottom ! The Fabric kept on moving under her and making it slippery for any one to try and sit down or walk accross it!Would not recommend it to anyone to purchase !
 I 've bought $ 20 blankets at Target that kick this one to the curb . The fabric is cheap and it is not very travel friendly -LRB- the case is really a sling and cumbersome to carry -RRB- . Save your cash and buy one of the emergency blankets at Target / K-Mart that zip up nicely and are water resistant as well .
 I read all of the reviews and decided that this would be the best blanket for my weekend picnics with my family . The 1st time I ordered this blanket it came with a small hole on the fabric , so I returned it and decided that I would research other outdoor blankets on Amazon . After researching , I decided that I 'd give this blanket another shot , so I ordered it again . It came today with ANOTHER HOLE IN IT ! I really need this blanket for this weekend , so Amazon will be shipping me another one before then . Lets see if 3rd time is a charm ! If not , I will never buy any more products from TUFFO again !
 The blanket is so light-weight that it 's impossible to use it when there is even the slightest wind . Even if you try to anchor the corners , it still all gets lift up by the wind . I am not sure I see any use for the blanket unless you know there will be no wind -LRB- which is NEVER . -RRB- A total waste of money !
 Label on attached to blanket says top is 20 % cotton , 80 % polyester . Filling and back lining are 100 % polyester . The blanket feels thin and cheap . Sending it back .
 Amazon did a great job getting this blanket to us in two days . However , when we opened it the blanket had grass stains and white paint on it . There was no packing slip so no way to return the thing . What a nasty surprise . I wo n't buy from Tuffo again .
 Poor quality blanket . Cheap fabric , not worth the price tag . I should 've read the reviews before ordering , because Babyride 's poor return policy makes it cost 50 % of the cost to return . DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT unless the price drops to $ 20 .
 I bought this thinking like the rest of you - yay ! A waterproof blanket . Just what I was looking for me and my two year old . But , this past week we had an Easter Egg hunt ... unfortunately it rained off and on that morning , so the grass was wet . When we sat down on the blanket , our behinds got all wet . I was VERY disappointed on this $ 40 dollar purchase !!
 This blanket drives me crazy . The nylon bottom makes it slippery and it constantly bunches up . My toddler gets tripped up in it and falls . I put it in the garage and use it to cover the BBQ in the winter b/c it is useless as a blanket . I would give it 0 stars except the blue floral fabric is quite pretty - just do n't sit on it !
 I chose this outdoor blanket because of the cute pattern and the price was right . I was debating between this and the JJ cole and I wish I had gone with the JJ cole ! The fabric on this one is very cheap and a bit too lightweight ... I find I have to weight it down when I use it - in constrast to the JJ cole with is a little more heavy duty . Also , I have a 8 mo old and we do a lot of park playdates with other babies - this fabric stains very easy whereas the JJ cole is wipeable . Lastly , I find the carry case worthless because it is seperate from the blanket , so I often forget to use it or do n't like doing the extra step after I fold it ; the JJ cole one is sewn into the blanket , so one less step.Just wanted to say that I wish I had spent the extra money and purchased the JJ cole ... at least for my purposes .
 too slippery -- due to the plastic -LRB- nylon -RRB- water resistant bottom , it slips on grass and on wood -LRB- our deck -RRB- -- thus we used it just once or twice and now do not use it anymore
 i was disappointed with the size and the thickness , especially considering the price . the size is rectangle shaped so it does n't fit well under the playyard and it is too thin so you can feel every little pebble or twig underneath it .
 My son uses this for his school books and by the 3rd day , the fabric had frayed and the rope came through the hole .
 Argh . Same thing happened to me as for the other reviewer . The item described is a DIGITAL Air Pressure Gauge , and I received an ANALOG Air Pressure Gauge .
 The device they kept sending me was an Analog gauge from Tachikara . After two trys , I gave up and sent back the wrong gauges to Amazon . I bet the Digital one is real nice .
 This watch looks really cheap and is HUGE - my husband wo n't wear it because it looks like a kid with his dad 's watch on . The seller charges you $ 10.95 to return-it 's a `` restocking fee '' - unless you purchase another watch from them.Plus shipping and insurance , of course . I was dissatisfied with the beat up package , the watch , and the customer charges . Read their policy before buying . Lots of other sellers carry these watches , so I 'd play it safe and use on of them .
 This type of stand -LRB- there are others on the market -RRB- has a number of inherent flaws that make it inadvisable for a mountain bike . Besides putting pressure on the spokes , it is too low to hold the weight of a mountain bike , the support arms can hit the derailleur and throw it out of alignment , and the movable side -LRB- adjustable for tire width -RRB- usually moves over a couple of notches when you take the bike out . Furthermore , as they are made of plastic , they are very light and the footprint is not wide enough to keep the entire unit from tipping over with your bike . Also if you set it tight enough to hold the wheel straight it does n't release when you try to pull the bike out and you have to push it off with your foot . I own a Saris version of this stand and have had nothing but trouble with it . My bike has fallen a number of times .
 It is made of plastic , a little bit wobble and there 's no hole to put bolts when connecting the vertical bars to horizontal bars .
 Look no longer , fellow riders . From the most unexpected place , Husky Bicycles , comes a great stand . Check it out at -LSB- ... -RSB- . Quality materials , low price of only $ 15 and a perfect solution to keeping bikes securely upright without stressing the spokes ! I had to peel an unattractive sticker and it made it perfect . Recommend !
 When you place your bicycle 's tire in the stand it only rests the wheel against the spokes . It 's not possible to see this in the photo displayed ... basically , any place you set the tire , it 's going to put pressure on the spokes to keep from falling over . Have n't continued to use it for fear of damaging my spokes .
 Product received was not as advertised . This bike stand is only good for bikes with 20 '' wheels or larger and does n't state in description .
 Actually this stand would have been great if the seller had n't left out the screws to put this together . Very disappointed . My first triathlon on Sunday and now I have to search for screws to assemble a product that should have come with it . Not happy at all !!!
 this really should n't be purchased . yea its cheap and it appears it might work , but really it does n't . the bike wants to fall over and it leans against the spokes . spend $ 40 and get a good metal rack that holds the whole back tire .
 I read the reviews , especially the ones about pressure on spokes and decided to buy anyway . I reasoned that if the bike is kept upright the pressure on the spokes would be minimal and thus safe to ignore.Once I assembled the stand and put my bike in , it became clear that this is not the case at all . First , the bike * always * leans on one side or the other , there 's no way to balance it . Second , accidentally bumping into the bike causes it to bounce back and forth - this does real damage to the spokes . Bad buy .
 I purchased this bike floor stand to park my mountain bike in my garage . The product description mentioned that the stand is made of plastic ; which I was fine with , until I saw the actual stand . This stand WILL break eventually -- it simply is not rugged enough for the use I had envisioned . If I had it to do all over again , I would have purchased a more durable metal stand . The other complaint that I have with this product is that the metal screws did NOT ship with threaded bolts -- I had to purchase after market bolts from Home Depot -LRB- 9 cents each , no big deal -RRB- in order to make this stand work . In retrospect I should have returned this product -- it simply wo n't live up to repeated use . I got what I paid for -- a cheap plastic bike stand . Recommended for light use . But for more active bicyclists , this will not survive the test of time .
 Doesnt really work well . Bike falls over still . Pain to assemble . Maybe it would work for smaller bicycle . Spend the extra bucks and get a good stand .
 I have a 29er mountain bike and I can barely get the tire into the stand and the stand will not support my bike . It 's plastic and very unsturdy . It might work well with a light weight road bike but its useless for a mountain bike.I 'll end up giving it to someone else who might be able to use it .
 Only use for the smallest of kids bikes , not for a full size person mountain bike its not sturdy enough .
 Too light weight to properly hold a bike in place , and the maker did not include the screws . I would not recommend buying this product . It is not worth the money .
 My mountain bike does n't stand level in this stand . Since I have oversize 2.25 inch tires , the stand must be adjusted wider than the spokes for the tire to fit in . The bike tips precariously in the stand , only held by the spokes . Additionally , the unit is hard to assemble.I intend to dump it for something that works .
 The design is fundamentally flawed . The stand puts pressure on the tire spokes . Consequently , the tire spokes will break more often than usual.I visited the bike repair shop 3 times while using this . A total of 9 spokes were broken over 2 months .1 spoke broke . Got it replaced .2 spokes broke . Got them replaced .6 spokes broke . Had to buy a new tire because the tire frame bent too much by this time.All spoke breaks occurred on the back tire where the `` Gear Up Grand Stand '' held my bike.Don ' t buy this . I put mine in the recycle bin .
 Initially I thought the wheel base was going to take the weight of the bike . Now that I have a chance to you the stand in person , I can see how the majority of the bike 's weight is supported by the wheel 's spokes and not the wheel 's rim . For those with pricey wheel 's , it 's a concern . Especially when using the stand for repairs and cleaning when there 's a lot of stress and motion .
 this is a little misleading . You think you are receiving the whole box , you are getting one pack . You can get the hobby box with 18 packs for $ 45.00 on e-bay .
 ATTENTION AMAZON
 Damn , I wish I 'd read the other reviews before ordering . Yes , the suggestion is you 're getting the whole box -LRB- how can a single pack be worth $ 90.00 ? -RRB- , and instead you get one pack . Reminds me of the days of comic books when the ad made it appear you were buying model cars , but ended up with eraser-sized plastic molds . Why does Amazon allow this fraud ??
 this gun suks i dropped it and it snapped and it is uglyier that nar
 I bought this product for a Jeep Wrangler and I was informed by the seller that it would work on one . It does not ... not even close . It does work on some small cars but you have to be careful since the product can bend the insulation around the door and create possible leaks .
 For me , OTG goggles are a must . Having used Bolle X500 for the past 3 seasons , I dealt with my fair share of foggy eyeglasses . So when I saw this `` revolutionary '' fan-based defogging system , I thought of it as a must-have . I waited patiently for a sale as $ 150 was too much for ski goggles in my book . I wear a helmet -LRB- by K2 -RRB- , so all of the comments below relate to goggles/helmet combo.In comparing Smith Knowledge Turbo to Bolle , here are my thoughts :1 . Smith googles feel much smaller/tighter - I had to search for my old really-small-frame glasses and even those were pushed against my eyes and hurt my nose . As a result , they were not just foggy , they were WET - as if I just pulled them out from a tray filled with water .2 . A buckle is right in the middle of the band and was a very tight fit in the helmet clip . As a result , no one-hand `` easy off '' . The band itself is somewhat short , which probably contributes to the overall tightness feeling of the googles . Because of band 's shortness , I was unable to re-arrange it so that the buckle would be outside the clip . The clip was so tight I was afraid it would snap .3 . Fan - mostly useless against that much wetness -LRB- see above -RRB- . Helmet rim rested right on top of the fan , probably diminishing its usefulness . Silent in low speed , noticeable in high speed .4 . Lense - I got Ignitor Mirror vs Gold photo-something-or-other in Bolle -LRB- changes with the intensity of sun -RRB- - what a turn for the worse ! At one point I actually had to go on a differnt slope because the lift on the first one was going into the sun and it was just too bright and extremely uncomfortable - never a problem with Bolle.So , a good sale on a product that I thought was a must-have for me turned out into a disappointing waste of money . I will probably `` play '' with it a bit more , and give it another try before deciding whether to keep the googles or pass them on to my son who liked the way the looked and thankfully does not need the OTG aspect of them .
 If you use glasses with the goggles the glasses will fog . The goggle has a two-speed fan . Using in Hi does not improve the problem.The Smith Knowledge goggles have a top of foam around the small fan . I believe is to allow the forced air to escape with the moisture from inside the goggle . When the foam get wet it clogs and the moisture keeps inside fogging the glasses.I bought a no fog cloth from Smith also , trying to minimize the problem , wiped dry the glasses as per the instructions . It did n't made any difference , the glasses got foggy anyway.The Goggle in the actual picture does not match the product , the picture shows the OTG -LRB- over the glass -RRB- with no fan model.Not worth the more than $ 100.00 it cost .
 I ordered this for my 5 year old and perhaps shame on me for not reading the dimensions but it is TINY !!! It 's the size of my forearm ! And the gloves do n't even fit my 5 year old 's hands . It was really cute and seemed durable , but we 're returning it . Looking for something he can really use .
 Amazon failed to ship the fishing rod in a shipping tube . When I received it , the cardboard box was bent like an archery bow . The rod inside was broken . I informed Amazon and they sent me a replacement . It also came in a cardboard box and this rod was broken just like the first one . I returned both rods and Amazon credited my account . Sadly , the credit was only for the price of the rod . I had to pay for Amazon 's failure to ship the rods properly . Their email system did not allow me to respond to this ripoff .
 This was my second , more expensive Stiga paddle . It is a little better than the 14.99 paddle , but not much . The ball does not seems to bounce off the paddle in the right proportion to your exerted force . Since them , I had gone on to purchase many more paddles and there are much better ones out there for about half as much . If you search hard enough , you can find a five-layer with carbon for much less or a seven-layer with carbon plus titanium mesh for only slightly more expensive.Do your homework . Search around .
 Just an awful advertisement ! The sizing information makes no sense to me . The sizing guide does not relate to the sizing information in the ad . For example , 9 M US . What 's that mean ? I went to the Hodgman web site and found the same waders but the sizing information was only for shoe sizes . A shoe size is not related to a person 's body size . If the boot of the wader fits it might be wrong for the body . I also received an email from SportsMansGuide in which they said the sizing information was wrong and all waders came in regular sizes . But they did not tell me what they mean by a regular size . A regular shoe size ? A regular pants size ? A regular body size ?
 Picture showed 1 star Stiga ping pong balls . Received no imprint balls . I could have bought those for $ 25.00 less . I decided to pay more for the imprinted 1 star Stiga balls . Bait & switch . Disappointed .
 Two stars for the price , but overall these are not very good even for 1-star balls . They feel &#34; off &#34; playing ; bounces are inconsistent and the speed/bounce is low.For very casual play most people wo n't care and this is a good deal . But if you care about getting close to the &#34; 3-star experience &#34; without paying for it fully , there are better 1-star balls out there .
 This product is so inferior it should not be on the market . I have an outdoor table tennis table , and I covered my table for protection with this product . When I removed the cover , the table top had been ruined with a marbleized , oily-appearing pattern over the entire table . It does not wash off with detergent and water or with ammonia and water . This product has ruined the appearance of my table . It is very distracting for good ping pong playing . My other complaint about the product is that there is no protection for the corners . The material rips with the first use . I suspected this from reading other reviews , and I protected all corners with a pad to avoid this . But the oil-like marbleization is cause to go back to the drawing board with this product .
 Made in China . It lasted for exactly 2 days . Some gusty wind , just a tad stronger than the ` gentle brezze ' level , easily shredded it and blew it away one night . My wife found its remains 300 yards away , in the woods . Buy this and you WILL be sorry .
 Cheaply made . Tears easily . Invest in something stronger . Ours ripped the third night we put it on .
 The table tennis cover was advertised for our model of table . It did not fitwell and started to tear in the corners . Because of the tear we kept it , butwe are not pleased with the fit or the durability of the plastic .
 I agree with the chorus of complaints about this product . It is completely inferior , and Stiga should be ashamed to put its name on it . It tore in several places within a week of being on the table . Excessively thin and cheap vinyl is the problem .
 This quickly developed small rips and tears in it when we took it on and off . The only thing going for it is it can cover both a folded table and a table that is open .
 Despite the fact that the box states that it 's made specifically for the kind of table we have , the fit was too snug and it ripped after the first use . Do n't waste your money .
 I bought this product hopeing that it would help to protect the table which I bought . It did nothing to help . After the first rain , when i removed it , the rain had soaked right through the cover and ruined the table . We had to return the table and have it replaced . Do not buy this product.-Zack
 We just recently purchased two STS510 Stiga table tennis tables . They are folded and stored after each night of play . To protect the tables I purchased two Stiga T0801 Table Tennis Table Covers here on Amazon . I did n't listen to the previous reviews and instead listened to my wallet . That was a big mistake . We never even got the covers completely on the tables before they ripped . The material is extremely thin and the slightest snag will cause a tear . Unfortunately for us I trusted that they would work based on the name and had already thrown out the packaging and receipts . Long story short - if you are expecting a quality product to protect your tables - do not purchase these covers .
 The second time it was used to cover our table , it got a hole in it . It 's worthless . Do not buy this product unless you want to waste money .
 While the cover fits the table in the upright position , the corner ripped against the edge of the table the first time I put it on . It also does n't protect the bottom side of the table in this position .
 I have several different `` weight '' of the `` Darn Tough '' brand socks , and NONE of them are as fragile and thin as these smart wool socks . They do not cling onto you very snug , yet the foot size seems a bit small . The product is very thin and I had wool felt coming off on the heel after walking about half a mile in some good broken in boots . These are a loose , sloppy sock . I will be sticking with Darn Tough socks , they are WAY worth the 2 extra dollars per pair .
 First off , theses sunglasses are noticeably of poor quality once you put them on . Visually you can literally see through the not so polarized lenses . I would not recommend anyone pay $ 40 for a pair of sunglasses which lack in quality .
 THE GOODSMALL SO YOU DONT GET THAT AWESOME SoCal EYEGLASS TAN ON YOUR FACE.LIGHT ON YOUR FACE.DONT SLIDE AROUND ON YOUR NOSETHE BADVERY CHEAP MATERIAL!POLARIZED POORLY . NOT GOOD FOR WORKING IN THE SUN ALL DAY OR ON THE WATER.GLARES EVERYWHEREHAD TO BUY OTHER GLASSES , HAD HEADACHES WEARING THESE TO THE POINT OF GOING TO THE DOCTOR . HE ASKED HOW LONG I BEEN WEARING THESE SUNGLASSES , FUNNY ENOUGH THE SAME AS THE HEADACHES . WENT AND GOT A DIFFERENT PAIR OF POLARIZED SUNGLASSES FROM ANOTHER COMPANY . NO MORE HEAD ACHES .
 For those who play table tennis as a serious sport and use your own custom paddles , they 're likely not going to fit in this case . If you 're using a pre-made hobbyist paddle this 'll work , or if you 're using a penhold paddle this will also fit . Otherwise , stay away and spend the extra 3 bucks on a case that fits all . The protection is fine , just too short of a case .
 This does not fit my handshake racket - it should say if it is too small for a handshake racket .
 The paddle fits fine and the material is ok . However , the reason I wanted a case for my paddle is because I bought my paddle for $ 30 and wanted to prolong its life . I 'm a college student and it would get dented in my backpack from books and zippers and pencils and whatnot so I bought a case.DOWNSIDE - it 's not that durable . My paddle still gets little indentations because the case is not hard enough to protect the paddle from pressure . I need an actual hard metal/plastic/wood case lined with some sort of fabric to protect my paddle . I know there are hard cases for sale out there and I found one for $ 40 ... which is more than what my paddle cost .
 I have the Stiga Titan paddle , It barely fits in it.After I zip it , it presses on the rubber edge.Not good.If they made this cover half inch longer it would be ok.Buy something else for a little more.I know I will .
 Bought this product along with Paddle and both of them are packaged separately . Paddle was not available and hence Amazon cancelled the order . Cover without the paddle is useless but returning is a pain hence bought the paddle elsewhere and used this cover . Had more cancelled orders in the past year through Amazon
 My son uses this for his school books and by the 3rd day , the fabric had frayed and the rope came through the hole .
 This is cheap for its capacity , but the padding on both the shoulder and waist straps is significantly inferior to that of well-known brands . I upgraded to a Lowe Alpine Sirocco after suffering with this backpack for a six week backpacking trip , and the difference in comfort is huge.In addition , my torso is definitely less than 24 '' but after adjusting the shoulder strap connector for the longest torso length the hip straps still only come down to my waist.On the plus side it came with a suitably sized raincover , and seemed pretty sturdy .
 After thoroughly researching the DPMS Panther A-15 -LRB- made by Cybergun -RRB- I decided it would make a good starter gun for my son and I to get into airsoft . I was concerned when I received the first gun because the box did n't look right ... it was unlike the boxes I had seen depicted on several websites including Cybergun 's site . This box was mostly white with some red and some black on it . It had the correct item number -LRB- 17920 -RRB- though , and the specs on the box matched what I had purchased . Cool though ... maybe a newer version of the gun ... maybe even improved ! We 'll see . When I opened the box the magazine release was broken and the gun was completely useless . So much for newer or even improved.After speaking with the seller , we agreed that they would replace the gun as it arrived defective . I shipped the first gun back to them and when the replacement arrived it looked to be in more or less one piece . After charging the battery my son and I went out back to zero the red dot site I had bought for the gun . We did n't get the job done because the gun was constantly mis-feeding even though the magazine was good to go and seated properly . Problems with the gun firing in full automatic when the selector switch was moved also dampened our experience . In short , after several attempts at trying to get gun # 2 to work I contacted the seller again . After desribing the problems with the gun I was told that they had gotten a bad batch of guns from the manufacturer -LRB- Cybergun -RRB- and that several others had been returned . All had arrived in the -LRB- new -RRB- white/red/black box.As I write this gun # 2 is on the way back to the seller . I 'll update this review after resolution of the problem . Make no mistake - this review should NOT be construed as negative toward the seller ! Period . The seller from whom I bought my gun -LRB- s -RRB- is NOT the same seller of this gun through Amazon today . In any case , if you buy a DPMS Panther A-15 that shows up in a white , red , and black box ... buyer beware !
 Do n't waste your money . This gun was given to me , brand new , as a gift . I 'm pretty savvy with airsoft guns , and this thing is a waste of money . I would value it at about $ 40-50 , brand new . Definitely not worth what they 're charging.Very cheap plastic constructionHop-up unit is uselessHere 's a tip in the airsoft world
 My son uses this for his school books and by the 3rd day , the fabric had frayed and the rope came through the hole .
 So I had the Thule Peleton and that BROKE leaving me on the rode with a bicycle I had to finagle into my packed car . I drove to an REI and picked out a Yakima Copperhead which I found to be flimsy -LRB- very thin plastic head covered hex bolts that could just be removed and the rack , along with the bicycle if you chose , is yours , thief -RRB- . So I exchanged that for the Viper which seemed very much an upgrade over both models until you learn that the skewer is a problem ! Locked or unlocked , if your bicycle is not mounted , a thief could easily make off with your bike rack . All they need to do is unscrew the skewer , push the button and viola , it 's is yours , thief . So , in summary , the Thule Peleton is almost theft proof -LRB- with a locking core -RRB- . The Yakima Copperhead , along with the Viper are easily stolen -LRB- Copperhead with a bike , Viper without a bike -RRB- . I would look into Rocky Mounts , but then I 've have to buy expensive locking cores for that brand when I already own locking cores for both Thule and Yakima . So to protect your Viper , you have to screw the skewer so that it is tightly cinched onto itself when you have pulled off your bike , then lock the core . Then test it to see that you can not turn the skewer without unlocking it . It is NOT easy . I liked the Peleton in that regard , just close the lid and lock it and walk away knowing it 'll be there when you get back . Except its innards are plastic and my carbon fork obliterated it on a small hairpin in California.My advice , skip Thule and Yakima . They are clueless . Go to a store and look at these mounts and fathom which one is most secure AND relatively theft resistant . Ask questions in store . You will have to pay more , even if you come back and buy it on Amazon -LRB- good ones are not affordable -RRB- . I gave it a star because it holds my bike well and that has to count for something . If you live in low crime environs and do n't see why anyone would want to swipe a $ 130 bike mount , this may be the way to go . It does not have a strap cushion to hold down road bike rims in the rear like Thule mounts do . You could also by the Thule rear straps -LRB- sold in sets of two for like $ 30 -RRB- and whittle away at the plastic guide that slides into the Yakima tray . That 's what I did and I managed to fit it in nice and snuggly . It is actually now perfect back there . But I took off a star for Yakima 's lack of a rim cushion . I gave it a star back for trying what with less plastic and what have you . I think I 'll keep it -LRB- and not return it like I returned the Copperhead -RRB- , but having known what I now do , I would keep the Copperhead until I found an REI -LRB- b/c my bike is currently living on my car , b/c I 'm living in my car -RRB- that carried the perfect bike mount -LRB- Sturdy as the Yakima , theft resistant as the Thule -RRB- . Got it ? In no way should you buy the Thule Peleton -LRB- it wo n't hold your bike for very long -RRB- . Buy the Yakima products if theft does not concern you -LRB- i.e. you live in a world of puppies and rainbows -RRB- .
 The first problem with this pump is that while it can be used on presta and schraeder valves , they 've marked it so it 's never clear when the selector at the top is in the correct position for the type of valve . It 's as if they did n't contemplate what would be convenient for the user . The second problem , is that it 's hard to get a secure attachment to the valve . And the third problem is that the pump does n't give you any leverage . So this pump can take you 20 minutes to do what another pump can do in 30 seconds . A poorly conceived tool .
 This might be my mistake . Thought these would be good for my MTB cables , but they are way too large in diameter . I used one anyway but it 's obviously to big and does n't look right .
 Bought this item to protect my bikes . The design has a major flow based on installation the cable hardly moves when you try to push it back into the rack.if you install it on the left side of the pin then its just too loose . On my second day when i was not using the rack the lock dangled out of the rack and I pulled it all the way with my car only noticed that it fell hours later when it was completely damaged from drawing it on the road.Luckily i got a partial refund but decided not to get a replacement . Will upload a photo of how the lock was damaged maybe that explains more my issue .
 So I bought this lock package to protect both my bikes and my new Yakima DoubleDown rack . Unfortunately there is a HUGE design flaw with how this system works on the DoubleDown racks . Yes , you can lock the bikes to the rack and also the rack to the hitch with this product . Unfortunately , Yakima engineers did n't seem to think about securing the pivot bolt in the middle where the rack folds down . It is just as easy -LRB- if not even easier -RRB- to simply unscrew that pivot bolt and take the whole rack off as it is to take out the hitch pin . Imagine coming back to your truck to find that your bikes and rack are both gone , but the lower trailer hitch piece of the rack is still safely locked to the hitch . Seems like a very sloppy oversight to me . Go look at a demo rack in a retail store . You 'll see what I mean . The pivot bolt is not protected at all , and it would take only a minute to unscrew it and be gone with the whole rack ... despite both of these locks .
 As others have indicated , the bottletops leak ... which is annoying . BUT Fuel Belt has changed their bottle design . I 'm not sure if the new bottles are any better , but I recommend that if you buy this product , you make sure you get the new 8oz . bottle style ... because it can only be an improvement .
 I would only recommend this product to someone if they do n't feel comfortable with a water bottle carrier which is centered on their back.The even-distribution of the four bottles is nice , but the bottles are so small you will spend much more time at water stations , screwing and unscrewing tops and pouring water into the small mouths of the bottles . Also , it takes two hands to fit the bottles back in their tight pouches.However , if you are only going to fill these at home and not have to refill them on the run , these problems might not matter.On the plus side , I like the elastic cords which keep the bottles in place and the nozzles are fine to drink from . But after a couple outing I got a 20oz Ultimate Direction water bottle carrier and I never use my fuelbelt .
 It 's nice to have 4 bottles with different fuels for a long run -LRB- water , isotonic , C-vitamin , etc -RRB- , but the elastic that holds the bottles very quickly looses it 's pressure , making the fuel belt practically unuseful .
 I wanted the item in the picture with the deep nylon pockets to hold the water bottle . This does make the bottles harder to remove while running , but they will not fall out of the pockets . The one I got has plastic pockets which are not as deep like the original . One of the bottles kept falling out when I was running . I had to hold it to complete the run.The one positive ... if the bottles would stay in the holder this would be a better design . The bottles are is a better position and is out of the way while running .
 I just bought the fuel belt !! I bought the pink one and it is really cute , but the sad news is it is way too small . I bought the size medium and it is way too tight ! Not good to have a muffin top over the fuel belt . I guess it makes you keep running to have to see that sight !! Great idea just remember to order a size bigger !!
 These shirts do look great , but the material is incredibly delicate and prone to damage . It will snag on anything , from a callous on your finger , Velcro , a small chip on the edge of a wooden table . Once it snags , it will all too often pull , ruining the shirt instantly . I just to two throw away because I was playing catch with my daughter , and the Velcro covered baseball we were playing with stuck to the shirt . When I removed it , it pulled a string straight out leaving an actual gap in the fabric where the skin showed through . I had only worn the shirts 2-3 times each . Very frustrating , as the shirts have an excellent look , fit , and feel . But the material is not friendly to daily wear . If you plan on using this for even light work or play , stay away .
 After 3 years the handle was very pitted and the safety lock was just flopping around.Not worth the money .
 This is just not something that someone six or younger would enjoy so no I would not recommend it . Maybe for a kid who is in gymnastics but it just bombed !
 WARNING
 Worst dive knife I 've ever seen . The sheath on this knife is a joke . It 's supposed to be 1 touch release . Instead , it takes 2 fingers with surgical precision to release it . Impossible to do while wearing 5mm mitts . I immediately returned it for a refund.Surpised LeisurePro would sell such a horrible knife .
 This is cheaply made . You get what you paid for . I bought hoping to use it to add a little air into my motorcycle and car tires . The first time I used it was to add some air into my sister 's suv tires before we went on a trip . The pumping did n't bother me as I expect to pump a lot , but the cylinder pop off of the base a few times as I was doing this . By the time I was pumping the 4th tire , an audible leak developed at the base of the hose where it connects to the wire.I probably try the more expensive sturdier look pumps available on Amazon .
 This pump is supposedly strong enough to put air in a car tire , but it struggles to put any air at all into anything under more than a few PSI of pressure . It sounds as if it 's leaking , but I was unable to locate the leak . -LRB- I suspect it 's an internal problem with the plunger . -RRB- Slow pumping , fast pumping , nothing helps . It is simply a bad pump , suitable for pool toys at best . Seeing as I do n't own anything that would only need minimal pressure , this thing is useless to me .
 I ordered a new tire pump , and received the shipment on time . But when I opened the box , there was a tire pump without factory packaging or a content list or a set of instructions . I lifted the pump out of the box and noticed the dirt on my hands . The product label on the tire pump was worn . I realized this was a used pump that Amazon sent me . This was unbelievable to me . How could their shipping department have sent me a used pump ? The only packing material to protect the pump in shipping was a sheet of brown kraft paper . I might understand if this was the busy holiday season , but it is the middle of January.The pump itself might be in excellent working order . This review is to show my disappointment in the shipping from an Amazon warehouse . I wanted to make potential purchasers of this pump aware that they might be sent a used pump instead of a new one .
 First use - perfect . Second use - destroyed . What a waste of money ! I 'd send it back but I already tossed the package . Buyer beware
 Do not buy . I was afraid of purchasing after reading mixed reviews and will be sending back to Amazon for return . Can tell cheap manufacture , do not recommend and no gauge !
 I looked for a product which was `` Made in USA '' and found this one.It does pump car tires , but otherwise is somewhat disappointing.As delivered , the cylinder is not well secured to the baseplate , sothat routine use can pull it out , if you are not careful . It isnot hard to push it back together , but I 'd rather not need to .
 This is a terrible product . It broke the first time I tried to use it ; the bottom cracked , letting the air escape , and rendering it useless . Do n't waste your money .
 It makes a popping sound when the metal tube separates from the plastic base it is inserted into , under 20 PSI of pressure.I do n't understand how those other people could have given this a product good review .
 My son uses this for his school books and by the 3rd day , the fabric had frayed and the rope came through the hole .
 this is no power lifting belt . there is no support at all as the inside mat ' l must be cardboard or something ...
 The lower extension cinch bolt worked loose while riding , and the lower extension fell out and is lost forever.The extension ought to have had a stop to prevent it from sliding all the way out of the upper tube . Having to keep a kickstand tightened to prevent half of it falling else is absurd - I 'd rather it just came long and they had me hacksaw it to length .
 Worthless rickety piece of junk . Presently looking for one of those sturdy one piece models seen on most kids bikes .
 WARNING READ FIRST !!! Airsplat is not the company to but from . This company is known for sending broken gun or completely the wrong gun to your address . I haved ordered from them and received a broken gun . When you try to get another one they make you pay for another and make YOU pay to return that one . AIRSPlAT is a joke DO N'T by from them !!!!!
 I turned to this retailer after going bust with another -LRB- the 6-deck shoe they gave me was cheap , scratched , and broken -RRB- . When I deal for private events , I like to use 4 decks so this dealing shoe appeared to be perfect . However , that was not the case . This shoe is the SAME SIZE as a 6-deck shoe , so you 're not getting a sleeker and more compact product just because it says `` 4-deck '' . The quality of plastic is probably slightely more durable , other than that you could not tell the difference between a `` Fat Cat '' dealing shoe and other dealing shoes on Amazon.It 's more of the same . Do n't be fooled into thinking otherwise.Don ' t get me wrong , I still use it . However , that 's because I refuse to spend anymore money on blackjack shoes especially with the garbage I 've been getting . It 's serviceable given that it is n't already broken once you receive it .
 I bought the flystepper because it was advertised as being consistent with the more expensive Sharper Image stepper . It was not . I had a sharper image stepper for over two years before it was broken in a move . I had the flystepper for three weeks before the plastic parts that made the stepper move broke into many , many pieces . The calorie/step counter no longer worked after five days . What a waste of money !! Next time , I will suck it up and pay the extra fifty dollars and get the Sharper Image stepper .
 I bought these to use on an older Schwinn bike I was fixing up . The stopping power was n't very impressive , and they seemed to wear down quickly . I ended up getting a nicer set of brakes for the rear wheel , and kept these on the front -LRB- at least for now -RRB- . In the end , they worked , but I would n't trust them in a situation where you truly needed them .
 My son uses this for his school books and by the 3rd day , the fabric had frayed and the rope came through the hole .
 I love Cathe but I returned this DVD , because it was just too similar to body pump . I did n't love it .
 I bought these red fins from the sports shop last month and took them back ... the size was perfect , but they are very stiff and gave me the most PAINFUL blisters ever . Plus , certain parts of the rubber just jab right into the bone of my feet , making the swimming experience extremely painful.I even bought fin socks ... did n't help ... I used to swim competitively , and bought these because it was the model recommended for speed and racing purposes , but I used them more for straight lap swimming and fast kicking ... maybe the blue ones are more comfortable , but I know that for me , these red ones just killed my feet.I guess the 're just meant to be worn for 5 minutes -LRB- or 1 lap -RRB- in the water , or something ...
 Nice looking , nice weighing . Marmot must , however , be a bit out to lunch on their gear field testing . The tent basically includes an oval `` rain catcher '' on the top which does not shed water and leads to water forcing the fly to sag a bit . Staking and tying out the sides of the fly is also critical because the tent not only touches the fly at the ends but it is also not fully covered by the fly , this leads to a condition called wet , down bag in a rainstorm . Because the tent is almost all mesh , where there is no fly coverage or close to no coverage -LRB- in windy conditions -RRB- , there is water . Also , it would be nice to tie off both the tent and the vestibule doors when they are open . There is some sort of cordage with a plastic clamp , but I have yet to figure out how it serves a purpose . If the `` tie offs '' are there for a reason it certainly does n't say so in the brief set-up instructions . The tent is tiny . Good luck manuvering in the thing , let alone sitting up in it . Luckily my girlfriend is 5 ' 2 '' , so we could use it as it 's stated `` 2-person tent '' . If , you happen to be average size , the tent is a `` one person '' tent . The zippers are junky and snag often . The pole configuaration is strong and nifty looking , it might serve it 's purpose better if it were used as a sculptural mobile . I give the tent 2 stars only because of it 's light weight and Bukminster Fuller theme .
 This is for a beretta 92 slip over front sight that requires precise drilling . If you want a cougar night sight buy trijicon . Also seller will not reply to messages . I am going to keep this for my model 96 . I have the equipment to perform the precise drilling necessary to mount this . If I only knew .
 Does n't fit the gun I ordered it for , very flimsy , and cheaply made , in my opinion . Others may like it fine , I do n't .
 I was disappointed with this product . It might have been the gun I carried or my particular pants , but I think most people are buying this for an LCP-type gun and I wear very normal pants/shorts . I carried a Ruger LCP in it for about two months . The only two things I can say I liked about this is that the holster completely covered the trigger guard and the holster looks to be of sufficent quality as to not fall apart immediately . The gun was not easy to pull out of my pocket , and more often than not , the holster came out with the gun . Not to mention , I basically lost the use of my strong side pocket while carrying . I 've since switched to a cheap IWB holster and it 's significantly nicer to carry -LRB- less noticeable , more comfortable , easier access , and I still have use of my pocket -RRB- . I 'll keep the Uncle Mike 's pocket holster for use in coat pockets and such , but it 's unlikely to see use again in my pants pockets .
 As with most uncle mikes products I 've seen , the quality of materials is passable , but the design is terrible.I tried this holster with both a Ruger LCP and a Bodyguard 380 . Both guns sit so far down in the holster and are virtually impossible to draw smoothly and quickly.Yes , it can be drawn . And if you only half sit it in the holster , you can get the time ok , but if you put it down in the holster as intended , You ca n't get that full hand grip as the holster covers where your first finger needs to go.The Desantis nemesis is a far superior holster for $ 10 more.If you 're looking to buy this holster , do n't . Keep looking .
 I bought this for a Ruger LCP w / LaserMax . It fits , but its too snug . When I pull the gun out of my pocket , the holster comes with it . I think this would still be the case w/o the laser ... unless you wear skin tight pants , this holster will not grip in the pocket . If you 're gon na buy , buy a size larger .
 I had a well used Uncle Mike 's holster of the same type and it worked well . After three years of daily use with my LCP I bought a new one . Unfortunately the dimensions were different and did not fit the same LCP and was too loose . I am very disappointed with their quality control as I now own a holster that does n't work with my weapon .
 I RECENTLY PURCHASED THE POCKET HOLSTER AND IT FELT LIKE IT WAS GOING TO FALL APART WITHIN THE WEEK . THE FABRIC OF THE MATERIAL IS FOAMY AND DOES N'T SEEM LIKE IT IS GOING TO LAST A LONG TIME . WHEN I RETURNED THE PRODUCT , LG OUTDOORS DID N'T RESPOND TO MY PHONE CALLS OR MY EMAILS . THEY SIMPLY TOOK THE PRODUCT BACK AND KEPT MY MONEY . LG OUTDOORS HAS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER DEALT WITH . HOWEVER , AMAZON WAS KIND ENOUGH TO REFUND MY MONEY . I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO DO BUSINESS WITH LG OUTDOORS .
 Just not a very good little holster ... all I can say about it is that I will not use it and that says it all .
 This product says it will fit most .380 s ; but , the Taurus TCP 738 .380 wo n't fit into it at all . It may fit smaller .380 s , but not the Taurus . Good feel , though . Returns to Amazon are very easy ! Thanks , Amazon !
 I got one of these for a small revolver , and it worked fine . I got this one for a small automatic , and it is impossible to grab only the grip . To extract the automatic , I must pinch the grip between thumb and forefinger and pull , and that brings up both the automatic and the holster , as the exterior material does not grip the pocket .
 Can you give less than one star?After ordering the hat , I got an email from Star Struck stating that they were `` sold out '' and made an error.They continued , `` If you find it in your heart to forgive this blunder and allow us another chance to delight you , we would like to extend the coupon below in appreciation of your loyalty and trust ... `` The funny thing is that the coupon code they gave me for a whopping 10 % off EXPIRED 2 months ago .

 The title of this review is what happened to the tent I purchased . During the night it rained and the tent became so water logged , I could not carry it down the mountain on my back . I left it with other hikers to use as a shoe matt during the night . The tent went from 3lbs. , which was a strong selling point to at least 12lbs . of a water logged waste . The rain fly covered the back of the tent , which you then expect the front and entrance to be water proof ... do not expect that with this tent . I guess the there is truth to old saying , `` You get what you pay for '' . The 1 star is for being only 3lbs .
 this tent doese n't work . It wants you to create stuff that doese n't come with it . Overall a waste of time and money . Spend 100 dollars and get yourself something decent .
 I used the Texsport Knollwood Bivy Shelter Tent when I went hiking in the cold mountains of France . When it arrived I was disappointed , a cheap looking Shelter if there ever was one . I took it anyways , paying the price later when it rained heavily . All though I had a good sleeping bag , the Shelter tore instantly in cold wind , the stakes snapped and rips were everywhere . By day 5 it was just a ripped up tarp and I had to sleep in my good sleeping bag during the cold rain storm . Invest in a good three-season tent for $ 200 - $ 500 .
 This was basically a one-use item for me , since the flexible rod which supports the smaller end of the tent split like green wood the first time I used it . I may get one more use out of it , but with the rod split , it was a little wobbly .
 Wigwam used to make great socks that fit properly and were true to the size on the package labeling . Even though my husband is a size 10-1/2 , the 9-11 size is way too large for him . The heel area goes all the way up to his calves . The socks bunch up in his shoes and start turning on themselves . Also , the inside stitching has more than 4 inches of loose , untrimmed thread just sticking out . Wherever these socks were manufactured they obviously do n't believe in quality control or workmanship . Another company goes down with the times !
 First time putting the socks on they were loose and after a couple hours wear they were falling down . Comfortable but the elastic is weak and I 'm not convienced about its odor resistant feature . Walmart socks have worked out better , not as much cushion but at least they stay high on the leg like they are supposed to .
 I ordered 2 packs of these socks because of the high rating , but on this one , most of the reviewers got it wrong . These are the worst socks I 've ever owned . They are way too big for a size 9.5 and retain all the sweat . They were incredibly uncomfortable all day at work . I thought things may change after a washing , but still , amazingly uncomfortable . I am going back to Hanes as quickly as possible .
 I was specifically looking for XL socks for work.OK , so I have big feet , shoot me.These are the tightest socks I have ever had . And I do n't mean `` tight '' as good or cool either.Give me a break ! My feet were so sore at the end of the day from these boaconstricters.Double checked the package , and says they are XL . Washed them with plenty of fabric softener thinking that might loosen them up a bit . Still too tight.It is a real shame too as I read on the packaging they are made right here in the USA ; Sheboygan , WI.Guess what , went to Wal-Mart and picked up some XL socks that actually fit , and sadly , these were made in Pakistan .
 I purchased a couple of these socks based on the reviews everyone has written . These socks are not worth the money or the reviews given to them . After wearing one pair of socks , they already have a hole in the heel and they have n't even been washed yet !! They were falling apart after wearing them once and they make your feet sweat . I 'm not sure what kind of socks everyone else was given , but mine were not the quality everyone else was raving about .
 The large says 9 - 12 . Amazon send me 12 - 15 . This socks are for giants . I hope Amazon will fix this problem .
 The fabric feel is rough , when I walk I can feel air going through them and to my feet , and I 'm a size 13 & the x-large size is a tad too big .
 Not impressed with these socks . $ 10.01 for 3 pairs -LRB- including Prime shipping -RRB- is n't bad , but pilling after only 1 wash?I have bought ` work ' socks from my local dollar store @ $ 4.00 / pair that are still holding up after 2 years . Maybe I should have spent a few dollars more and purchased the higher end Wigwams .
 These sox appear OK . But I never had a pair that shed so badly . The fuzz is on the carpet , bathroom floor , in the shower etc. . I went to the foot doctor and was embarrased with black fuzzy feet . It seams to bother my wife and that gets me into trouble . I will stick with a better grade nextime .
 These Wigwam `` at work '' socks sounded like exactly what I wanted , after reading all the amazon reviews . They 're supposed to be soft -LRB- they are NOT soft - they feel like the fuzzy side of Velcro inside -RRB- they 're supposed to be warm -LRB- they 're not - they make my feet sweat instantly , and then they get clammy , even in boots ! -RRB- . They are fairly evenly cushioned -LRB- not very thick , but not a dress sock thin -RRB- . I would n't want to walk more than a few blocks in these socks , unless I were also wearing very comfortable sneakers . They feel like I 'm wearing plastic bags on my feet - instantly soggy , synthetic feeling , socks . Gross . Would never buy these again , unfortunately .
 I wore these socks ONCE and they developed a hole in the toe . I bought a few pairs , it happened with every pair . I DO cut my toenails . I DO wear good shoes -LRB- Nike , Reebok -RRB- , and I also bought two other brands of socks at the same time as these . ALL the other socks are still great after many wearing and washings . I am not exagerating when I tell you that ALL the pairs of these socks are in the garbage . They look sturdy , feel great ! One would NEVER imagine that each and every pair fell apart in ONE or two days in use.I have no idea how others gave these socks a good rating .
 This `` classic '' does n't hold enough water to properly hydrate for even an hour long ride . I 'm not sure where the design came from , but all of the straps are about 3 times longer than they need to be so they flap around if you dont secure them . When the water tube is secured , you ca n't drink out of it because the tube crimps . There is n't enough storage space even for a small pump , keys , id , and cell phone . There is plenty of room in this thing , its just got too small of a bladder and too much extra straps .

 I never wear this top after having purchased it . The stripes have awkward stitches that irritate the skin touching them . The shirt itself hangs very awkwardly . I prefer fitted shirts for working out and this one kind of flares out at the waist on me and , therefore , is n't very flattering . I think I 've worn it once and will probably donate it soon . Generally , I have been pleased with Adidas products , but this shirt did not work for me personally .
 Unless you remanufacture your pins with some longer glow tubes this sight is garbage . The pins do n't glow AT ALL . The little tiny coil of material doesnt collect any light at all without an additional sight light , NOT INCLUDED IN THIS VERSION . I bought this sight after replacing my peep to get bigger sight housing to fix my sight picture . However as I said already , the pins do n't glow AT ALL . So I cannibalized my old sight to get the glow tubes out of my old pins and install on these pins . It makes the sight 100 % better , as it is unusable out of the box imo.Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere unless you have the time and materials to repair/remanufacture this sight.TLDR
 I ordered these because some reviewers claimed they solved the problem of the lighter weight BBs taking flight . Although these are not near as prone to that , they still do in my Mossberg M590 rifle which makes hitting my target nearly impossible .
 My son uses this for his school books and by the 3rd day , the fabric had frayed and the rope came through the hole .
 Beware , these boxes are too small for most masks . You might want to check the size of the box before ordering and compare to your mask or masks .
 Completely useless product . Wobbles and there is no adjustment for the leg shape/size . Instead , buy velcro type ASO ankle stabilizer WITH stays .
 I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT IT WAS SUPOUSED TO BE HERE WITHIN TWO DAYS , AFTER I CLICKED PLACE ORDER IT SAYS 5 DAYS ... 5 DAYS ?????????????????????????????? IM WAITING ... . WAN NA KNOW WHAT HAPPEN WITHIN THOS `` 2 '' , SORRY `` 5 '' DAYS !!!

 I bought this gun about 3 months ago . It worked fine for the first week . After that it just completely fell apart . It was probably the worst airsoft gun I 've ever encountered . I also talked to about 15 different people who owned this gun . They all felt exactly the same . Do not buy this gun .
 this gun sucks balls and is so bad i have had my baby sister shoot it and hit herself and she does n't fell anything . it would be better tohit somone over the head with this gun and see wtat they would do insted of shooting thema nd having them stand therte blinking and shooting u

 One reviewer noted that the watch was darker than the image . I am aware that color can vary from monitor to monitor , so I let it slide . However , when I received the watch , I could not read it in light ! The face is actually a metalic blue , creating a glare -LRB- image suggests a flat face -RRB- , and the numbers looked like raised silver , not flat white like the watch image alludes to . This was either photoshopped or taken under special lights , as I was not able to even closely get the watch to be readable like I thought -LRB- and I work in photoshop and photography ! -RRB- . Would have LOVED the watch if I could have used it , and it looked SIMILAR to image ! Had the face been flat -LRB- and not shiny metallic -RRB- , even darker would have been acceptable .
 This watch broke within 3 days where the pins attach to the case . the case is made of resin that is not strong enough for a sports watch in my opinion . It broke while cycling . I had another identical watch that lasted two months then broke when skiing . I think it 's the hand folding '' back '' action while gripping something that did it . My wrist is normal , I 'm 5 ' 7 '' . Otherwise I like the style and functions .

 This Walmart version of `` GET FIT BASICS '' Pilates System must come packaged with defective cords because no way was mine going to stretch to what I was seeing on the video . Oh and the video was all of 5 minutes , that 's it ! ... with absolutely no introduction to the usage of the cord system whatsoever . The video starts as if you 've already missed the beginning and when I tried to rewind it I found that it was already WAS at the beginning . This is a terrible product .

 I 've used it on 2 separate camping trips , and both times I woke up in the middle of the night to a drenched sleeping bag . The reason for that is not the rain -LRB- which never came down -RRB- but the lack of proper ventilation . It 's very light and portable but I 'd rather sleep under a tree than in this terrible product.I would not recommend this to anyone !
 The zippered door was very difficult to open and even more difficult to close . On a second night it did not work at all . Imagine yourself in a forest with mosquitoes and a very cold night ? This tent is a cheap and unreliable piece of garbage .
 This product needs stiffer poles or a change in construction so that the slightest breeze does not blow it over . I was very disappointed in this product . The folks at Texsport need to do a little more work , Great idea , just made to cheap .

 I purchased Adidas Campus 2 athletic shoes for my daily walks . I walk for perhaps 50 minutes each day . My walks are not strenuous activity , I 'm just going out for a walk on a paved path in a park . These shoes have caused `` turf toe '' which is a common sports injury . Turf toe is another name for
 The shoes described in the Amazon ad are Navy Blue , however , when my shoes arrived and I opened the box I found Steel Blue -LRB- Blue-Gray -RRB- pair of shoes . Navy Blue is a medium to dark Blue and these shoes are anything but ... they almost look like they might have been a darker blue at one time but then faded .
 I 'm really surprised at the reviews for these shoes because they are extremely uncomfortable . It is very disappointing too because they look awesome but I do n't know whose feet are shaped like the insole ? Especially men 's feet . I wear a size 12 and the arch support is too steep and they are narrow . These seem to be shaped more perhaps for female feet ?
 They are what I want but not that material . They are scratchy against the forehead - so I gave them to Good Will .
 The part of this visor that rests on the forehead is unbearably uncomfortable . I had to throw them away . They scratch the skin so badly that I could n't wear them .
 The jacket is warm , really smart looking , and sporty . My problem is that the yellow dye got all over what was being washed . Thinking all was ruined and had to be replaced was upsetting . Upon rewashing -LRB- minus the Marmot FlashpointJacket -RRB- the yellow dye came out . Still my whites and light colored fabrics were left dingy . In this day and age colors to run is usually the unexpected , especially , with a product such as this . As a precaution , wash by hand separately and let it hang dry , you still have to be careful with the &#34; drip dry &#34; in terms of what fabric you use to catch the drip . Laying down a light colored towel or bathmat would not be a good idea as these will get discolored.I bought 2 of the identical jackets at Christmas time . One as a gift , and the other for me . Learning ing how these jackets &#34; wash &#34; was a disappointment , however , wearing this jacket does feel exactly as described .
 This does not compare to any of the other ` headache free ' visors out there - it is literally something I could make myself from Michaels . Not to mention I got the wrong color shipped to me !
 Order placed on september 9 2011 , not received at the moment ... I 'll be back when the T-shirt will arrive.Paolo

 I read that a hard seat was good for the back . I found this seat to be too hard and it irritated my back . Returned the seat.I am 63 yr old and already had back problems so maybe it would be better for someone else .

 Bought this for my husband 's birthday . I was appalled to find out , by reading the warning label , that it contains lead and can cause cancer , birth defects and reproductive problems . It also says to wash your hands after handling . I returned it but had to pay the return fee myself . Not feeling too warm and fuzzy about this purchase !

 This New York group will forever be celebrated as the Classic group which gave us Silhouettes , Daddy Cool , and Souvenirs Of Summertime -LRB- a Classic in my book -RRB- . Hal Miller is a magnificent lead , very much in the style of Tony Williams of The Platters , and very much in his league ; in fact , Miller 's baritone-tenor is oftentimes amazing . -LRB- Especially on the dependable middle of the road , Rags To Riches ; and the doo-wop ballads , Old Devil Moon and Rendezvous ; on an interesting inspirational opus , The Man Above -RRB- . He probably would be the winner in a contest with Williams to decide who could take on Operetta . An unlikely scenario in the '50s , as Rock and Roll was quite busy getting established as its ' own genre.This CD has 27 tunes , no notes of any kind . Sound is somewhat flat , as if quality vinyl was used as the source . Informative , well-written notes ... by anonymous.What ca n't be denied is the mediocrity of the song writing . Arrangements are professional , sometimes unusual -LRB- Do Be Doo Be Do ; Elevator Operator - not the later Little Richard song -RRB- , but several songs are just cliches in search of a hook . My Steady Girl falls in this group.Magic Moon is of course based upon Claude DeBussy and I urge all listeners to first find a low-priced Classical set with the song . Something tells me this group would agree .
 The description was short and sweet . The picture looked nice , and it was only ten cents , so I bought it for my 9-year old . It was plastic . We threw it away .
 I bought this to use as an everyday lanyard and I can not put my keys on it and feel safe because the velcro at the end . I absolutely do not like it and will now be purchasing a new one else where .
 Read the reviews before you buy this product . Seems to be made of some sort of plastic , and has Velcro clasps that rest on the back of your neck . Look for something else .
 I really did not like this product . It velcroed in the back and got caught in my hair :-LRB- It was not a smooth feeling lanyard . I feel bad saying this , but it was just not for me .
 Item not like shown . Misleading . Should have had more of an accurate description so I would not have wasted my money .

 Well , this looks nothing like the review I wrote at the time I bought the reel . I used to be a big penn fan , but now I 'm sticking with shimano or maybe even branching out and trying some other brands . This reel is not all that smooth and does n't really cast that well for the price . It 's probably comparable to most $ 30-50 reels at best in my mind . The rest of the price is for the name , which it seems has become the selling point of these reels over the actual quality . The screw that holds the bail on this reel broke in half and the reel is basically worthless to me now unless I can find a way to get the broken off part out and feel like spending $ 5-10 on a new screw from Penn. . Already bought a $ 30 shimano to get me by for the time being and I 'm not sure it was n't at least an even trade . Disappointing product to carry the Penn name .
 The 420 Ssg spinfisher Graphite reel bar code 3132404203 is a reel with manufacturing problems . As manufactured it is missing part 95B Penn # 095B420 , which is a retaining plate , and 46B Penn # 046A420 , which is the retaining plate screw . Because these parts are missing the `` Rotor Cup Nut , '' comes loose such that thr entire rotor comes loose with first symptom of the problem being the bale does not function properly . Penn warranty person told me to bring it back to the store I purchased it from , yet this reel was part of a custom built rod set . I will try Locktite , if that does not work I will design a retainer plate , and worse case will be to epoxy # 38 , penn part number 038420G rotor cup nut to the # 19 0019 420 G pinion . I should have purchased a Shimano Stradic Ci4 , 1000 . Retailers should note these problems with this reel .
 The handle does not work . It does turn but it does n't move the spool , brand new reel right out of the box . Do n't buy it , avoid penn reels , their quality is going down the drain every new reel they make . Their new name is penny reels and fishing rods because that is what they are worth ...
 I though penn reels were made in USA . I have several and they are all made here . No more penn reels for me .
 The only reason I gave it two stars is that it 's cheap and magnesium is probably fun to play with . The description says Government issue ? I hope not for survival . I teach survival and know that a match or lighter has everything built in and takes seconds to get a flame , this takes minutes . Water proof matches weigh far less and work better in the wind , in fact nearly ever fire lighter weighs less . It is also tricky to get the pile to stay put while you strike , striking properly is a skill you need to learn especially in a cold wet environment . I am a fan of something that takes minimal effort and can preferably be used with one hand -LRB- I use the mini bic lighter or waterproof liquid fuel lighter -RRB- . The magnesium takes effort to shave , it also takes allot out of your knife , add the fact that you may be shivering makes it harder . When you do strike and the magnesium catches , it burns really fast so you still need kindling and small sticks , so no real gain there . Fire steel is fun to play with and use if you have a cabin with a gas or alcohol stove , it will last long and is reliable , but I would not suggest it , not if survival is at stake .
 I should have paid attention to the bad reviews and saved a few dollars . While you can probably start a fire with it , this product is terrible . The embedded firesteel does emit a good amount of sparks , but the magnesium bar is useless . The magnesium is too hard to shave . You 'll dull your knife or freeze before you collect enough shavings to make a flame . If you 're wanting to start fire without a lighter , just buy a quality firesteel and carry your own tinder such as jute cord or petroleum jelly covered cotton balls , magnesium is overkill .
 I bought 6 of these thinking they were actual Doan 's Machine and Tool bars . They were not . They are the same cheap bars availible at places like Harbor Frieght . They do not seem to have a good ferro rod and the magnesium alloy is not as good as a Doan 's bar . I learned my lesson the hard way so hede my warning . If you are looking for reliablity , durability , and quality , Go Doan 's .
 ORDERED 2 , RECEIVED ONE THUS FAR AND THE ITEM APPEARS TO BE THE CHEAP CHINESE VERSION NOT THE HIGHLY RATED DOAN PRODUCT WHICH WAS SHOWN IN PICTURE.SHIPPING WAS A COUPLE DAYS FOR THE ONE ITEM AND I IMAGINE THE OTHER ONE WILL COME TOMORROW.I 'LL RESPOND TO THAT ITEM WHEN I RECEIVE IT .
 I was fooled by the numerous positive reviews to think that this is an actual good fire starter . First
 I feel a little ripped with this thing . I like the design , comfort of useability , but my wife and I easily went through half our steels in one use . We are inexperienced and practicing , yes , but some salesman for these said they were supposed to create more fires that a whole box of matches . It 's a fun , primitive experience , but if you are going to go fire steel , I recommend a fatter open dowel one . Otherwise , if you are going for waterproof fire , just ziplock a bic .
 I would not regimens this product to any one who plans to use it constently , say for camping . It downy come with a striker so I had to use my leather man lacing awl to strike it when I wanted to use it . It wears down to quickly . It does get a fire going nearly as fast as matches , if you know how to use it right , but it does n't last . If I got lost out in the Bush then it 's great , if you do n't use it every voter day to light multiple fires .
 I bought this item based on it said it was 8 ounces . It was only 1 3/8 ounces . I would have been better off buying the Emergency Fire Starter by SE for a third less money and at least you get the hacksaw blade with it .
 -LRB- -LRB- The following info inside the double parenthesis was added March 28 , 2011 in response to a recent comment this review received . This was my first product review on Amazon , and I did n't realize that my review would show up on product listings from other sellers in addition to the seller my item was purchased from , and for that I apologize . My fire starter was purchased from Hobbytoolsupply . It appears that at least one other seller is selling the correctly advertised item , so the review shown below should only apply to the fire starters sold by Hobbytoolsupply . I added two pictures of the item I received to the main listing -LRB- pics added by Jeremy -RRB- so you can see the difference between what I received and the genuine item . I have not modified anything outside these double parenthesis since my original review -RRB- -RRB- I bought this fire starter because I needed one that would serve as a secondary emergency backup for me in the woods if my other multiple redundant fire starting options had failed me in some way . What I needed was a very durable high quality tool that was unaffected by rain or immersion in water , and after searching and reading reviews online I found that would be a government issue -LRB- Doan 's -RRB- fire starter.Doan 's is in fact the brand that the government issues , and a Doan 's fire starter is what is pictured in this listing , but that is not what I received . What I received was an unknown fake that was in a package that looked in every way like the Doan 's package except the package did n't say `` Doan 's Machinery and Equipment Company , Made in the U.S.A. '' along the bottom of the front like it is supposed to . In fact the box said nothing about where the fire starter was made , what company made it , etc. . The fire starter itself was obviously not the one in the listing picture , because the writing on the fire starter was just written on the magnesium instead of stamped into it like with a Doan 's . The real one has a NSN number -LRB- NATO Stock Number -RRB- on it to identify it as a true government issued product . This one has a different number written just like an NSN number but when I looked the number up on a NATO Stock Number search engine it was an invalid number . The real one also has `` Doan 's Mach . & Equip . Co. '' stamped in the magnesium and this one does not . The real Doan 's also has a P.O. Box address stamped in the magnesium . This one has a P.O. Box that is located in the same city , but it is a different P.O. number . It might not seem like a big deal that this is not actually a genuine military issued item -LRB- as advertised -RRB- or a real Doan 's fire starter -LRB- as pictured -RRB- , but it is a big deal in my opinion and it is offensive to me as well.The Doan 's fire starter -LRB- pictured in this listing -RRB- has been made and used for over 30 years and is the only one of this type that does not -LRB- at least occasionally -RRB- have problems with the glue failing causing the ferro -LRB- flint -RRB- rod to separate from the magnesium block under stressful , cold , wet , etc. conditions . If the ferro rod falls off and becomes lost the tool becomes useless for starting fires . That is not good if you are counting on this tool to actually save your life someday.I give this tool one star only because it does still work to start fires , but after looking into it I do n't trust it for woods carry , so instead of being in one of my packs it will be in a ziploc bag in the emergency kit in the trunk of one of my cars . In a ziploc in the trunk I do n't have to worry about losing the ferro rod and it costing me my life.After receiving it in the mail , this tool is not worth sending back for a refund , because the shipping cost would be almost the price of the product to begin with . I figured that instead of trying to get a refund on this product , that same amount of time would be better spent writing this review and by telling others that they had better look elsewhere if they want a real government issue Doan 's fire starter instead of this one , especially if they need a fire starter that they can truly depend on . A real one also costs about the same amount as this one.I am a private citizen that bought this product after careful research into fire starting methods and brands , because I believe that things you are going to possibly use one day to save your life need to be made well enough to be trusted to do so . I apologize if this review sounds harsh , but to me this is very serious and blatant fraud and copy of a great product done in a way that could cost someone their life just to save a few bucks by deceiving the consumer . I am also bothered by the fact that this product is clearly misrepresenting what it is and is marketed in a way that takes income away from the company that does make a great product and should be getting the reward for their effort . I have no problem with competition in the marketplace , but I do n't like being told I am getting one thing and then actually receive a different much lesser item.I should say that I am a private consumer and in no way affiliated with any company that makes or distributes anything to do with survival , camping , or hiking . My preference for a real Doan 's fire starter comes solely from the many personal and independent reviews found online that praise its ' durability and reliability , and the many problems that other similar brands have with the ferro rod falling off or becoming lost due to weak glue . Do n't take my word for it , those reviews can be found by anyone reading this with a simple Google search just as I did . There , I feel like I did my part and my conscience feels clear now , have a nice day everyone . - Jeremy
 A Chinese Made Fire starter was substituted for the genuine GI issue I had ordered . The product was totally inferior and did n't work . However ... the company was quick to refund my money when I notified them . Customer service was VERY good .
 They advertise `` genuine issue '' , but what I got was a Chinese copy . Plus , I have to pay to return it . When I called , they were not too interested in making me happy . Buyer beware !
 Used a flat knife to scrape and spark against the flint.The magnesium shavings were very small and difficult to produce even after 3 minutes of scraping.The environment was some not ideal wood and somewhat windy . But some of the magnesium ignited after about 5 minutes of striking the flint and never started the wood burning .
 I start alot of fires while camping to keep dry and warm and I wanted to see how this `` classic '' compared with the Firesteel I have bee using ... boy was I surprised ... how can the military issue this thing with such better tools available ... its a pain to use and if its windy , FORGET IT ! your shavings will blow away . It also appears to wear quite fast . I recommend Swedish Firesteel or another Firesteel product .
 I was wet , cold , and very tired that night I spent on the mountain . I shaved off a pile of this to start my fire . It goes `` poof '' when the spark hits it . I never got a fire started , all the wood around was wet . What I have used with 100 % success is Fire Ribbon . It is in a tube like toothpaste . It will burn while floating in water . It also burns along time . I now carry a half used tube -LRB- smaller that way -RRB- in my kit . It always , alway lights ... . Is about $ 3.00 at REI . Happy trails ...
 i took this backpacking thinking that it would save me space on carrying timber boxes and matches and lighters and so forth , turned out to be completely impracticable . I had 3 other people with me , each with atleast two different knives and not a single one , serrated or otherwise , did more than shave dust off of these things , we spent the better part of two hours trying to start a fire with these things -LRB- we had one each -RRB- . Either the wind would blow the shavings away , or after an hour of collecting shavings in a tent , we would bring it to the kindling only for half the shavings to light , and then only for the briefest moment , the kindling completely unaffected.Just for due diligence i tried again once i got home thinking , maybe i was exhausted or impatient while backpacking to use this properly . Again , 45mins to an hour to gather enough shavings , -LRB- about as much that would fit on a dollar coin -RRB- . I then rested the shavings on a bed of cotton balls , took it outside , and began to spark it . ... Absolutely same result , half the shavings lit , not even long enough to do anything but char the cotton balls , and to make sure it was n't the cotton balls fault i took out a lighter to burn the rest , the cotton balls went up immediately , leaving nothing on the cardboard -LRB- i was doing this on cardboard of all things -RRB- but the shavings of magnesium.i do n't know what everyone else who reviewed this was thinking but they are wrong.BOTTOM LINE
 Thought this tool would be a great addition to my survival kit for hiking and camping . Tried it out on a recent camping trip only to find out a few things
 I tried this firestarter ... it does n't work.Take a look at The All-Weather Firestarters!There is a New Generation of Firestarters at
 Yes , it works ; if you have a lot of time to scrape a quarter-sized -LRB- 2.5 cm -RRB- pyramid of magnesium off the rectangular mass , protect it from every little gust of wind , and then try again and again and again to get the weak sparks from the fire steel to light it . However , if you are using a device like this to start a fire , it probably means that you are in a survival situation , and do not have a lot of time to get a fire going . Consequently , I have dropped this from my outdoor carry gear , and replaced it with a good flint and steel device -LRB- one that produces a usable flare of sparks instead of the laughable little flickers this one produces -RRB- and some good , reliable , waterproof fire starting tablets . They work quickly , reliably , and well -LRB- I know because I 've used them -RRB- . This magnesium thing works slowly , after much time and effort , and only in ideal situations -LRB- I know , because I have tried it and given up in frustration -RRB- . The fact that the military issues this dog does not impress me at all . When I am outdoors and off the pavement , I need gear that works easily and quickly . This thing does not , so I 'm not carrying it .
 Try another firestarter as this one does n't do the job . Wears out quickly and ineffective .
 The firestarter works well enough , the 1 star is for the braniac that put a non-removeable sticker over the instructions , not hard to figure out , but come on ...
 It is impossible to get a pile of shavings from the magnesium with you knife and even if you do get a pile it will not light with the flint . The flint sparks great but the magnesium does not light I put a match to it and it burned for a mili second it is useless !!!!
 I 've had 3 unsuccessful use of this on 3 different occasion .1 . In an empty house that I was renovating . Spent 10 min trying to scrape the magnesium with an exacto blade and trying to strike a spark with a screw driver . It was so aggravating that I drove 7 min to the store to get a lighter .2 . My sons & their cousins tried to start a spark lit fire for practice in the back yard with this new fangle mag block that they purchased . Result ... damaged pocket knife , flint broke , and no fire .3 . I tried this with my sons in our driveway with my camping knife . Result ... dulled the knife , the itty-bitty flint dowel shattered , and no fire.May be if I had used a hack saw blade like others suggested but what 's the point of buying a tool if you had to furnish the other half of it ? And who wants to carry a hack saw blade with them on their key chain ?
 I remember back in Boy Scouts during Grizzly Adams training , and after a long lecture on how with this tool , your knife , and the clothes on your back you could stay alive practically forever . It always struck me that a much more logical tool for lighting a fire is a simple cigarette lighter . Instead of keeping a chunk of flint or magnesium in your survival kit , why not just throw in 3 or 4 plastic lighters ? I 'm not a smoker but I 've got lighters I bought in 1985 that still work like I just bought them yesterday . Why not teach a kid to ` flick his bic ' instead ? Are we afraid he 'll start smoking -LRB- oh dear -RRB- . Well , maybe that 's not such a bad idea . All these super-fat kids are the result of cigarette commercials being outlawed anyway . And if he was a smoker chances are he 'd never leave home without something to start a fire with ... namely , a LIGHTER !
 This review should actually be 0 stars ... I supposedly bought 2 diff mag fire starters ... This one , the SE brand , and the other being the ` original DOAN model ' from a diff product page here . One was approx $ 4.09 , the other $ 8.25 . I wanted to inspect the difference between the two.It just so happens that both came from Boho -LRB- steer clear folks or you 'll end up like me wasting time ` filing a claim ' and writing negative reviews -RRB- . What I rec 'd was EXACTLY THE SAME item x2 in a mailed envelope -LRB- that took waaay to long to receive also -RRB- . They are both a piece of sh*t ... I DID NOT RECEIVE either the SE or the DOAN brand ... . I rec 'd 2 chinese knockoffs.In the pkg I did open , the glue is half-a * sly extruding from the striking bar side and appears to hardly be holding in the striking bar . The pkging also cleverly hides the included striking metal piece behind the mag starter so that you do n't see it and it looks just like a genuine DOAN brand . However , upon opening -- there is not a single brandname imprinted on it.My reason for opening the pkg -- to hopefully find DOAN or SE on the backside of the mag starter AS THE PKGING ITSELF ALSO HAD NO BRANDNAME immprinted on it . I had also opened the pkg due to the fact that it LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE THE GENUINE DOAN pkging that I have prev purchased in the past.NOPE !! Just some 3rd world duplicate pkging in the end ... . everything but the brandname , whether it be SE or DOAN.Folks , there ai n't nothing genuine here !!! Steer clear ! Buy from another page ... And by all means ... . AVOID anything from Boho !!!!! ... my guess is that you 'll not get what you were expecting ... . what goes , comes Boho ... . so there !
 I had seen some of the other reviews noting that they had received a cheap knock-off . I looked at several vendoers and picked one that had good reviews and I hoped that I would not be ripped off . Unfortunately I also received one of the cheap knock-offs . Do not do business with Fire Starter . They are intentionally advertising one product and selling another .
 I am disappointed with the firestarter ! It was implied in the advertisement as being a genuine GI issue fire starter ! The GI isuue fire starter is made by the Doan Mfg Co. of Euclid Ohio ! This particular fire starter is a cheap knock off ! I am too busy to fool around returning sub standard merchandise , so in the future I will only order branded Merchandise !
 The jacket is warm , really smart looking , and sporty . My problem is that the yellow dye got all over what was being washed . Thinking all was ruined and had to be replaced was upsetting . Upon rewashing -LRB- minus the Marmot FlashpointJacket -RRB- the yellow dye came out . Still my whites and light colored fabrics were left dingy . In this day and age colors to run is usually the unexpected , especially , with a product such as this . As a precaution , wash by hand separately and let it hang dry , you still have to be careful with the &#34; drip dry &#34; in terms of what fabric you use to catch the drip . Laying down a light colored towel or bathmat would not be a good idea as these will get discolored.I bought 2 of the identical jackets at Christmas time . One as a gift , and the other for me . Learning ing how these jackets &#34; wash &#34; was a disappointment , however , wearing this jacket does feel exactly as described .
 I got this sword at a gun and knife show a little while ago , then I read up on it and found out it 's completely useless . Being the optimistic person I am , I decided to see if it was indeed absolutely useless.It is.I took it out and chopped down a tree that was an inch thick . The blade was bent before I had even finished chopping . I was able to bend it back . I decided then to just take it apart . The tang -LRB- the part of the sword inside the handle -RRB- was glued into the handle . They had not even bothered to score the tang for a better grip on the glue and the glue was hard and brittle . If you want to display this sword somewhere , it looks pretty cool . I think it 's a little overpriced for that , but then , I 've been spoiled by better cheap swords and knives . Essentially , to me , this is expensive scrap metal . Blech .
 The photo shows princess Jasmine but the product we received did not have Jasmine at all . Jasmine was the only reason we ordered these as our daughter is obsessed with her and specifically told Santa she wanted Jasmine big girl panties . She was disappointed when Santa did not leave her any Jasmine panties .

 The shoes described in the Amazon ad are Navy Blue , however , when my shoes arrived and I opened the box I found Steel Blue -LRB- Blue-Gray -RRB- pair of shoes . Navy Blue is a medium to dark Blue and these shoes are anything but ... they almost look like they might have been a darker blue at one time but then faded .
 I 'm really surprised at the reviews for these shoes because they are extremely uncomfortable . It is very disappointing too because they look awesome but I do n't know whose feet are shaped like the insole ? Especially men 's feet .

 Clearly I should have read the description a bit more thoroughly ; I was expecting a large zafu cushion only to find that this one is less than a forearm 's length long . It seems good quality and sturdy , though definitely not worth the $ 25 for the product + shipping . I 've learned my lesson .

 This item was supposed to be &#34; Water resistant to 200 meters assisted by the screw-down case and crown . &#34; The watch when received did not have a screw down case and crown . Water resistance was doubtful . Returned the watch .
 Purchased these shorts and first time I wore them the seam in the crotch chaffed me raw . My wife sews and was able to put tape over seam but one should not have to do that . Would recommend finding another short .
 Very cheaply made , One Washing , and the seams are already developing holes . Threads hang loose . They are comfortable and inexpensive , and ships quickly . Better to buy a higher quality all cotton short . LL Bean makes a much better pair of athletic short !
 I was not made aware that this short hs a grey stripe down the leg.That is not what I wanted
 I am 21 and just learning how to ride a bike . I was so excited when my husband purchased the wheels for my 26in adult bike so i could finally learn without being scared . They held up for maybe 5 minutes before the right side `` tire '' popped of the wheel and bent in half . The the left side bent in half not so soon after as i tried to get my bearings back . I was so excited but it was short lived . These are not as reliable as i had hoped .
 I would not buy this item . I was excited on getting training wheels on my 24 inch bike that was so hard to find , I never learn how to ride a bicycle when I was young and wanted to do so for the summer with my daughter . When I receive the item and install it on the bike , it was really heavy and was not able to turn the bike . I end up taking it out of the bike and learn on my own without the training wheels . This item was cheaply make and the wheels are so flimsy that makes it hard to even ride on a straight line not to mention turning . I will NOT recommend this item .
 Did n't fit my daughter bike with > 0.75 frame tube . Returned them to get Wald 10252 Bicycle Training Wheels -LRB- 16 to 20-Inch Wheels , .75 and 1-Inch Frame Tubes -RRB- . Why would make something that is not standard and fits all bike 's frame tubes size ?!
 Does n't fit on frame size over 3/4 '' and that is nowhere listed honestly on amazon . After i paid and ordered and tried to assemble , finally i saw that is listed on the box cover . Not fair , not fair at all . We have three bikes and none of them is compatible with this product . . Oh well i contacted the company asking my money back , and i 'm still waiting . . Other day in paradise . .
 It is nice and heavy duty . However , it does n't fit the side of the bike with the gears on it . Not meant for these types of bikes . I was going to bend it , but the steel is so thick , I really could n't do it at home , and taking it to work would take too long . So , we 'll try more without the training wheels .
 Bought this item based on all the reviews ... the metal supports were backwards and I needed to buy new ones to support it - I did and mounted them on the bike ... . I did n't complain - but I should have ... anyway good ... luck
 This product did n't come with all the necessary parts . I has to add additional products and yet still does not provide stability for my daughter 's cycle . Definately not at all what it should be . A complete waste of my money .
 The wheels bent after the first use by my wife . She weighs 109lbs , so the weight limit must be lower for this product . seems like we may be able to straighten out with a few hits of the hammer .
 When attached to a brand new 20 '' girls bicycle ridden by a nine year old weighing 100 lbs , it took less than 20 minutes for one of training wheels to be crumpled up beyond repair . The rubber surface of both wheels immediately became rough and worn and the wheels are very noisy . There are not very many products on the market that fit larger bikes , and this one looks promising but do not get your hopes up .
 My son was not very happy with product . We needed training wheels that would not bend or allow him to easily tip over . they did not do the job . They are frachile and unreliabe brand . I would recoment anybody to buy them .

It is very disappointing too because they look awesome but I do n't know whose feet are shaped like the insole ? Especially men 's feet . I wear a size 12 and the arch support is too steep and they are narrow . These seem to be shaped more perhaps for female feet ?
 I can not even use this hat because it is too small . I have a `` normal '' sized head for a female and the medium barely covered the tops of my ears . While running it was trying to jump off my head . Get it if you have a small head or get it a lot larger than you normally need it .
 WARNING READ FIRST !!! Airsplat is not the company to but from . This company is known for sending broken gun or completely the wrong gun to your address . I haved ordered from them and received a broken gun . When you try to get another one they make you pay for another and make YOU pay to return that one . AIRSPlAT is a joke DO N'T by from them !!!!!
 The first time I used this one of the handles ripped . The second time the other one did . Even as we speak I am searching for a replacement . On the plus side it is cheap . On the negative side . . it is very poorly constructed .
 We just received this product , and it is being returned as soon as possible . The so called 6 qt pot may hold 1 qt . The frying pan may be large enough to fry one burger or cook 1 egg . The cup with this is n't even large enough for a water dish for a cat . The 6 cup coffee pot is maybe 3 cups . We are really disappointed in this product and it certainly was a shock with the size of it . Do n't waste your money thinking that this will be large enough for a family , it is not , there are 4 in my family and this would barely feed 1 . Only gave it a star because you can not review with no stars
 I knew it was gon na be flimsy when I purchased it , but I really did n't realize how flimsy . I 'm returning this item . It 's like picking up a set of foil paper . I thought I could go with something cheap , but once I saw and held the set in my hands , I could n't bring myself to use it . It was just too flimsy . Did I mention how flimsy this thing is . If you truly do n't care at all what the product looks like , feels like , or how it performs , then this set is probably for you . I could n't tolerate the flimsiness . Not worth it . Spend the extra money and get a decent set !
 Think twice before ordering . Although they are quite comfortable and lightweight , they are poorly made . The third time I wore them my nail when right thru the pant leg and put a huge hole in the pants . And no I do n't have long dagger nails either . Put it this way if you can put your finger thru the pants and tear them , they should be sold as disposable wear only .
 I had to contact them 2 weeks after my order never arrived . I had n't received my pants because they were out of stock but did n't contact me , I had to reach out.Won ' t try ordering from them again .
 I wear a medium in pants . I ordered this pants in a large because I wear a lumbar back brace . I could n't even get these pants up to my knees . They were like a size small . The sizing is so off , I would not know what size to order . I have several other pairs of pants like these and I wear medium or large in them with brace . Totally disappointed .
 Ordered these yoga pants because they were supposed to be over 95 percent cotton . Unfortunately they feel as if they are more than 5 percent synthetic stretch fabric . I can wear them for a short time , but I 'm allergic to these pants and I could n't find a label anywhere that SHOWED me the actual fabric content . I considered sending them back , but they 're a perfect fit , look great and I can wear them for a short period of time . Since they were n't too expensive , I decided to keep them . I would n't buy them again .
 I got these in May and now it 's January I think I started wearing them in October and they already have holes in the legs . I got an XL but I definitely could have gotten a smaller size . These things always fall down . I do n't suggest buying them . They are comfortable just cheaply made .
 These worked well the first couple of times I wore them , but unfortunately the waist stretched out . Now I am constantly pulling them up . I will be looking for a replacement .
 I washed them on cold , and did not dry them . The pants are now a whole two sizes too small .
 I thought these were supposed to be long but they were definitely too short for me -LRB- 5 ' 9 &#34; -RRB- . I had to return them .
 I like the pants though as others have said they run a tad small . However , the sizing chart and description say they will have a 32-34 inch inseam , the pair I received has a 38 '' inseam !! If I were a fashion model who was 6 feet tall I 'd be thrilled ! Well , I 'm neither one . Sorry Christian , I 'll have to return these !
 These rip easily and they 're so thin they 're see through . You can see your underwear through them , not just the lines but actual design . I got complemented on my hello kitty underwear when I wore these to class . In certain lighting , you can even see my very small amount of cellulite through them . Spend a little more and get the `` So Low '' brand yoga pants , they 're so much better and will last longer .
 I wore them and they were super comfortable . Since i am 5 ' 3 '' , they were LONG on me . They rip very easily and are rather cheap , I do NOT recommend them .
 I am thin and although I am not super tall , I have long legs and so I have a very hard time finding pants that are long enough for me , especially these type of pants that generally do not come in `` tall '' sizes . After reading other reviews where several people said these were too long for them , I decided to try them . They were about as long as capri pants !!! A good 6 '' shorter than I needed . Other than that they fit well , and I 'm sure for people who are regular sized they are great , but not for me . Beware if you need longer lengths !
 The fabric is quite lightweight , so be aware of that . The fit is perfect for a person with long slim legs . If you have more typical proportions you 'll need to hem them and might find the fit through the thighs too snug .
 I 'm usually a XS in american apparel , so I was surprised -- when I removed them from the packaging , I could instantly tell they were going to be short . I 'm 5 ' 6 and the inseam on these must have been around 28in . I tried to not roll the waistband , but then it just looked silly wearing it lower like that , it did n't fit . Will have to return , super disappointed . $ 20 wouldve been a steal for these .
 these pants looked cute in the photo , but when they arrived and I tried them on , I realized they were made of such thin material that they were see-through . if you buy them , DO buy a size up from your normal size and DO N'T buy white .
 The shorts are a nice fit and wear well , however as a warning , the color of the shorts are actually army green , not brown .
 Despite the title of the advertisement and the seller 's adamant description these are indeed olive drab and NOT brown . My department specifies we use brown slacks/bdus/shorts and I thought I had finally found some brown shorts that looked decent -LRB- the shorts themselves are worth more than the price just realize , they ai n't brown , no not at all and do NOT look like the item advertised herein -RRB- but alas they are Olive Drab and looks like I have to use Amazon 's A-Z return as no response back from seller : -LRB-
 Do n't waste your money on this , I bought the chair and was not impressed by the quality and then I saw a similar chair at Target for $ 70 and bought it . I compared the chairs side by side and kept the one from Target .
 The shoes described in the Amazon ad are Navy Blue , however , when my shoes arrived and I opened the box I found Steel Blue -LRB- Blue-Gray -RRB- pair of shoes . Navy Blue is a medium to dark Blue and these shoes are anything but ... they almost look like they might have been a darker blue at one time but then faded .

 I purchased Adidas Campus 2 athletic shoes for my daily walks . I walk for perhaps 50 minutes each day . My walks are not strenuous activity , I 'm just going out for a walk on a paved path in a park . These shoes have caused `` turf toe '' which is a common sports injury . Turf toe is another name for
 Fell and stayed flat after 1 week - thought it would be good but how can you use it if it stays flat
 Actually its down right HARD . Sheesh , I only kept it because its cool color . I even tried letting out some air , but no dice . Buy a regular ball instead .
 I received the volleyball flat . I pumped it up and it keeps deflating . I do not like it . How do I return it . and get my money back !? I really wanted this ball . I waited for nearly 3 weeks for it and I ca n't even use it .
 I bought one of these watches in 1985 . It was a tank . It took much abuse and kept on running . Because of the heaviness of the watch the band would break often and hit the asphalt/concrete . After a few years of repeated bonking on the hard surfaces it finally quit . -LRB- I wish i had put a good fabric band on it -RRB- . Anyway , i bought one of these watches last year -LRB- 2010 -RRB- and it was a creampuff . Any jar to my arm and it would stop running . Very disappointing . This is the only watch i really desire to own , but because of the unreliability i had to leave it in the fond memories of yesteryear . -LRB- I actually bought a sport model Seiko automatic before i made this purchase in 2010 -- same problem . I sent both watches back and opted for the SKA413 . -RRB- Inferior construction/materials for the automatics nowadays ? Not sure .
 While I initially liked the idea of an automatic watch , I quickly realized that no amount of arm movement kept the watching running at the correct time . I put up with it because I really liked the style and the fact that I could dive with it without ever opening up the case to replace a battery . Unfortunately , over time , after resetting the time virtually every day , I needed to replace the o-ring in the crown . While I do n't see this problem listed in other reviews , I 'm curious if my watch has always been defective , or if others have failed to mention this issue .
 Got this watch for my cousin we do n't like is nothing like it looks online it looks very cheap . do n't buy it
 Mine worked fine when I first got it , but it stopped working a few hours later . I figured it just needed a good shake , and sure enough , it started right up . Over the next few months , it would occasionally hiccup like that , but after I gave it a shake , it would start again . When I first got it , it kept extremely accurate time -LRB- less than +5 secs per week , according to my atomic clock app -RRB- , but as time went on -LRB- ha ! -RRB- , it got progressively worse , until I was losing 8 minutes a week . And 9 mos later , it stopped for good , and no amount of shaking would start it back up . Extremely disappointed , I wish I had read the reviews and seen that this particular seller/watch has had QC issues . Based on this experience , I 'm looking for an SKX007J from a different seller.For those who get a good copy , I 'm sure it 's a great watch , just a note of caution for those looking here .
 This watch jumps 30 seconds ahead each day and it is only 3 months old . Seiko told me that 20 seconds a day is `` acceptable '' . I do n't find this acceptable . I have owned other automatic watches and have never experienced this . Do yourself a favor and do n't buy this watch unless you do n't care about knowing what time it is !
 Watch out ! I got the watch scratched on July 17th , I returned it , then was denied a refund/replacement . Amazon was useless in my claim , they backed up Mrwatch . They then didnt return the watch to my house , I dont know where it is . Today is August 20th . Watch out !
 The watch looks nice , however after few days of use , it stops working without any reason . We tried reading the manual , kept using it to see if was some mistake , but it stopped again when we were out of the country last week . I do n't want this watch anymore !
 I had a Seiko Men 's Diver 's Watch for about 10 years , and it was great . Reading reviews on several of the Seiko models , I saw several complaints about watches gaining time ; the SKX007K did n't have any of those complaints , so I went with it . It arrived looking great , and worked very well ... for about a month.Well , for the last two days it 's been gaining between 5 and 10 minutes an hour . I just emailed the seller -LRB- I 'm in Iraq and ca n't call -RRB- . We 'll see how responsive and user-friendly they are , but bear in mind your chances of getting a problem watch . Check the number of positive reviews , count how many complaints of gaining time -LRB- and I do n't mean something trivial like gaining 3 seconds a day -RRB- , and calculate the chances of having to go through what I 'm dealing with now .
 Completely disappointed.The picture clarly shows 5 belts hanging from the frame . You can only display one . The frame is cheap wood . Just completely and thoroughly disappointed .
 I received the order on time . The plastic glass in the frame has numerous scratches as if scratched by a box knife . Black frame also has some smudges and scratches . I will be contacting the vendor to see if they will replace the item for better quality .
 did not realize it only came with one belt holder . If i would have known that i would have bought a better one for the price of having to buy additional belt holders .
 I was a bit disappointed with the overall quality considering it was a 30 + dollar coffee pot . Straight out of the box , the `` top handle connector '' was not welded on one side , and we had to weld it back on , and the lid connection is a bit flimsy .
 14 Cup texport stainless percolator
 Very bad choice . Worked 3 months and and would not wind ! I have read other reviews that warned of this . I should have listened . I wonder if it is a real Seiko .
 I bought this watch and I really enjoyed having it . Looks great , is comfortable to wear and water resistant . But my joy only lasted 1.5 yrs , then the watch started running fast , around 1.5 hrs per day . Repairing it would cost me almost as much as I paid for it . A watch like this should really last a little bit longer ...
 I 've had this watch for over four years.It has constantly run fast . I need to adjustit every week . The stainless steel bracelet also came apart on one sidewhere it connects to the timepiece.It is good looking and I get some compiments on it butoverall I 'm unhappy with its performance and construction .
 I believe this to be a grey market version of the SKX009 . It appears authentic but was missing a warranty card . I did n't notice until 30 days after receiving it . It has a rattle when I shake it and I was going to return it for warranty repair but when I went to check the box it came with , there is no warranty card which Seiko requires for repair without charge . I 'm disappointed , Amazon .
 its gas it a rip off and for the money I would convert my gun to compressed air or co2 other wise its jut gas and it cost too much
 The Amazon web page shows the belt display with 9 belts . The product arrived with one belt holder . There is no mention on the web site that each belt holder must be bought seperately . This is false advertising . I would never have bought the belt-holder if I had known the truth . I called the vendor and they were not interested that their product was being falsely represented .
 I wish I would have read the reviews before I purchased this item . I also looked at the picture and thought the belt rack came with the additional attachments . I would n't have purchased this rack had I known . The rack itself is fair quality , but add on the additional costs for the belt holders and it is grossly overpriced for the quality .
 This is a very simple product . I ordered several of these for my daughter . Imagine my disappointment when the shipment arrived and half the hinges were rattling in the bottom of the package and the remaining hinges were only loosely hanging on by screws that were too short and/or in stripped out holes . I had to go to Ace Hardware to buy screws to re-attach the hinges . C'mon guys ... are n't you even the least bit embarrassed to ship poor quality products like this ?? Really ?
 I got these while I was restoring an old Schwinn since they looked almost identical to it 's old busted pedals . They worked well for about 8 months , but with all the time it spends outside , and the exposed bearings , they 've become problematic . One side has developed a very strong click as it goes around and greasing it and more can only get it to go away briefly . From the way it 's off it 's axis when I spin it , it obviously has something trapped in it that 's causing it issues now , or some similar problem , but there is no apparent way to take them apart and fix that , so now I 'm stuck buying another pair of pedals .
 The shoes described in the Amazon ad are Navy Blue , however , when my shoes arrived and I opened the box I found Steel Blue -LRB- Blue-Gray -RRB- pair of shoes . Navy Blue is a medium to dark Blue and these shoes are anything but ... they almost look like they might have been a darker blue at one time but then faded .
 I 'm really surprised at the reviews for these shoes because they are extremely uncomfortable . It is very disappointing too because they look awesome but I do n't know whose feet are shaped like the insole ? Especially men 's feet . I wear a size 12 and the arch support is too steep and they are narrow . These seem to be shaped more perhaps for female feet ?

 We 've had this vest for more than a year now . The kids do n't like it . I do n't either . It 's very bulky , and rides up on them because it does n't have the strap that others have . I 'd love to have it if my kid fell off a boat , but it 's really not designed well for kids learning to swim .
 I took this tent on the AT and replaced a heavier 4-person with it . I liked the weight and it poured the first two nights and we stayed dry so I liked the fact that it was somewhat watertight . Ca n't complain about condensation if you have a single walled tent . The third night there was about a 12 inch separation from the side and the bottom . Lasted one more night then to return it I had to clean it and package it . Putting it back up to clean caused the seam to separate all the way down one side and across the back . It 's more airy now . Unfortunately now according to Mountain Hardwear I get a credit to use on another tent manufactured by them . I would recommend you get any tent besides this one . I 'd rather have a sore back from more weight than throw away money !!
 i wanted to get this for my husband for fathers day . i ordered it on wednesday and i paid $ 18.98 for so called `` expedited '' shipping so that it would come in by saturday . needless to say , it 's not supposed to be delivered until monday because they ship ups which means they do n't ship on the weekends . what was the purpose of paying the extra for `` expedited '' if it 's still going to take 5 days to come in ? it was not made clear at checkout that this was the case . I am refusing the shipment and will not order from this company again .

 First and last order with this vendor ... the standard shipping rate was 35 % of my total !!! ... and the shipping was SLOW . If this company wants to do business online then they should find better shipping options for their customers or stop trying to boost their profits by gouging customers on shipping costs . The product was of OK quality , but with the shipping it ends up being very over-priced . You suckered me once but , never again !
 I received my pedometer watch from amazon and also emailed them that it did not work but got no reply . The time works good but the pedometer does not work worth a dam . Sometimes it will click in a few steps then stop .
 The pedometer on this watch advances with every move of the wrist ! I was sitting in the bathroom and it said I took 10 steps ! I emailed Amazon it was defective and I wanted to return it and I heard nothing from them.Needless to say , I will not be using Amazon again .
 The New Balance watch pedometer is not worth the money . You have to have it on step mode for it to capture your steps taken/calories/distance . The distance is not accurate either.I went to NB store and they even said they are not accurate.Don ' t buy
 It 's kind of adjustable and because I sew -LRB- a little -RRB- I think I can actually make this work for me . There are no directions with it and it would be nice to see how it 's expected to fit & look on a real person because we ca n't figure it out . I also wish it did n't have the clip holder or at least let me take it off when I want to and wear it without it . Like I said , I 'll make some adjustments like that on it myself . It is of good quality and a good price though .
 The article arrived at my house in a sealed plastic bag - we opened it inside the house and had to quickly throw the box outside and take the holster outside . The mold permeated the plastic bag into the box . I tried airing out the holster in my 2-car garage - then I had to take it outside under our awning because the garage stank within 12 hours ! I have emailed AirSplat twice - waiting for an answer on how to remedy this . My son is just heartbroken - and I dare not order another . AirSplat - how about answering my emails ! It was the product itself inside the sealed plastic bag - not the box .
 The holster it self is nice . it took bit to make it fit but , it smells so bad . as if it came across the ocean in a wet cargo box . I have tried putting in a bag with bakeing soda - fresh sent ect . If they ca n't see the gun under my coat they could sure smell it coming .
 Despite the universal , one-size-fits-all , application chart , this holster did not come close to fitting my gun . It seems the holster was sewn too far into the open end so only my muzzle could be inserted . I followed all of their instructions and sent the new , unused , apparently defective holster back and received only half of my money back . I will never purchase from this seller again and I advise others against it , as well .
 I might be an idiot , but maybe this thing should have come with some instructions on how to put it on ! Haha . So many velcro straps and what not . Neither me nor my father who 's been on the police force for 30 some odd years could figure out how to put this thing on properly . Again ... maybe I 'm just an idiot ...
 Shorts are very good . They fit well and padding is nice . However on second day threads started to open . Perhaps I got defective piece .
 This item never holds it 's charge and has really been a huge disappointment for our pocketbook . Our son would charge it , ride it out of the garage and down our driveway , and before he arrived at the driveway directly next door , it would lose its charge and have to be walked back ... A real bummer for the kids each and every time.Anna Maria , Orland Park , IL
 This toy of a pocket bike is good for beginners , but for kids who want to go above a whimpy 10 miles an hour this is ` nt a very good choice . I mean really , think about it , gas powered pocket bikes are faster , more durable and all around more fun , even if they are more dangerous .
 After some in depth searching , I finally came across the `` official '' website for the MiniMoto Maxii 400 bike . It was not easy to find ! Here is the link : http://www.toyquest.com/minimoto1/maxii/index.htmlThe website looks pretty informative , with a listed 1-800 phone number and even a customer support email . Do n't let that deceive you . Below is my story : I purchased the MiniMoto Maxii 400 bike about a week ago through Amazon -LRB- June 29th to be exact -RRB- and it arrived today -LRB- July 9th -RRB- . The box was shipped in it 's original retail box through UPS and as a result showed the typical wear/tear on the outside . Opening up the box , I was really amazed at how big the bike was as compared to a Razor Pocket bike.The first thing I did after separating the bike from all the styrofoam packaging was hook the bike up to an outlet so it 'll begin the recommended 12 + hour initial charge . As it was charging , I decided to call the 1-800 number to register my bike and get some information as to where I 'll be able to buy various accessories for the bike -LRB- bike cover , lock , helmet . . etc. . -RRB- Sadly , I was not able to get ahold of anyone . When I called the number , I received a never ending BUSY signal !! I thought to myself , how many 1-800 number have I called in the past that had a busy signal on the other end ? NONE !! I waited a few hours and tried againg , only to get the same BUSY signal.Since I was not getting anywhere with the 1-800 number , I decided to email the customer support email address . Within seconds , I received an automatic email thanking me for contacting them and informing me that a rep will reply to my email shortly . Within 15 minutes , I received a response from their customer support informing me that I should look at Amazon to purchase my MiniMoto accessories . I searched on Amazon but was not able to find anything and so I replied back asking for some other recommendations . I did not get a reply back.To me , more than 50 % of a customer 's satisfaction after purchasing any high value -LRB- over $ 200 -RRB- product would be the post-sale support . This bike 's manufacturer DOES NOT HAVE ANY !! If you are deciding to get this bike , I highly recommending saving your money and getting something else . It 's unbelievable how a company can survive without providing any customer service whatsoever !!!?????
 this toy goes really slow.it only goes 14mph for 10 minutes.the rest of the time , it goes about 8mph . I put a custom speedometer , charged it for 2 days , and it would only go 14mph . in ten minutes it only went 7.3 mph.A few days ago , i was riding it around my neighborhood and my throttle snapped off.to top it all off , yesterday my friends tire popped after hitting a rock.this thing is not worth the price.I recently got a gas pocket bike , which comes with a speedometer , and i went 34.7 mph in 7 seconds!i dont have to wait 8hours to charge , now i just give it some gas , jump rocks , and go fast . P.S. the gas one was only 239 bucks !
 this bike is only good for a beginer at the age of 7-9 . This is only an eletric powered pocket bike . For about 100 $ more you could get a gas mini bike that gors about 40 mph with a 49cc engine .
 This bike was purchased for my sons 8th birthday . I had been on here and other sites reading the reviews , all the bads ones too , and decided that I would risk it and get this for my sons birthday . I figured what are the odds really that I 'd get a bad bike ? I 'm telling you , all the reviews about the battery problems and it basically just not working after a few rides is COMPLETELY true . 100 % . -LSB- ... -RSB- We thought this was the best thing since sliced bread for about 2 weeks . My son rode his bike 4 ... yes only 4 times before we noticed there was a problem . Suddenly the battery would not stayed charged , after calling the manufacturer twice we got the battery to charge -LRB- or so we thought -RRB- but the bike would only drive about 3mph . After calling and complaining again , we were told we might need to get a new battery ... after 4 rides ? I dont think so . So realizing I was lucky and had a reciept ... we opted to return the piece of JUNK.I think that a bike of this price for children should be made alot better . Power Wheels are made 100 times better for peats sake ... I think it 's horrible . My son was SO SO SO disappointed , it was heartbreaking.LIVE & LEARN and listen to these reviews.Most of the postives are from people that posted when they first got the bike or from kids who still want it and dont even have it yet.Do not buy this bike .
 My 5 year old had a pocket rocket that would reach 12 to 15 mph . We thought the minimoto maxii would be the best step up , since the size is a little larger and on the box it indicated the speed of this product was 18 mph . Now online it 's only stating to go 10 mph . I 'd be highly surprised if it goes that fast . Also , as soon as it hits grass it seems to virtually go dead . I would not recommend this product unless you 're putting a complete beginner on it and you live in a parking lot !
 I have never written a review for anything but I am so overwelmed by the poor quality and bad customer service of this thing that I felt I should share my pain and maybe help someone else . I purchased this bike 2/11 for my son 's 11th birthday . Today is 3/5 and he still has not used it . I charged it for the first time for about 12 hours . The manual said it would take 12-24 hours and when the light on the charger turns green it is charged . The light was green . The bike ran for about 5 min . before completely dying . Charged it again another 10 hrs . and that time about 2 min . of running . Then charged again 24 full hours . NOTHING ! If you lift up the back of the bike and pull the throttle it runs great but as soon as you put any weight on it , even just your hand pressure , it goes no where . I tried several times to reach the customer service center -LRB- it says nearly 20 times on the box , on literture in the box and on the manual to call with any problems -RRB- and only got stuck in a holding loop that kept asking me to leave a message . I left one after holding for over an hour and they did call me back ... 3 DAYS LATER . I left out that when you call you are not dealing with Honda or Minimoto but some junk toy manufacturer called Toy Quest . I explained my problem and I was quickly advised that I would soon receive a new battery and charger free of charge . Wow , a solution , I was delighted . The package arrived almost a week later in a beat up Dawn dishwashing detergent box that was very poorly packed . The battery was clearly not new and the chargers connector was damaged do to the poor packing . They did address this issue however on the invoice that was in the box that clearly stated that Toy Quest was not responsible for breakage , damage , or loss of goods while in transit . How convenient ! Now as if all of that was not enough , I just tried to change the battery . I am following the directions in the manual to do so and I have already removed 17 bolts and screws to get to the battery with 3 more to go . However , 2 of which are completely impossible to get to and the third is stripped . I am now stuck . I can not removed the battery and I can not charge the new one without putting it on the bike . I would venture to say that it is not going to work anyway and to boot I am probably somehow voiding my warrenty by changing it myself even though Toy Quest advised me to do so . I am a pretty machanically inclined person and I am not exagerating . This is the absolute truth about my experience . I feel that my only option now is to pack it up and return it to the place of purchase . Which by the way was my local Wal-mart where it had just been reduced to $ 249 -LRB- if you still are interested in purchasing -RRB- .
 I purchased the Honda Minimoto Maxii for my son at Christmas . Due to weather conditions in Northern Ohio I did not assemble the bike until end of March . Originally the brake assembly was broken and the support group quickly sent materials . Since then I have had countless situations where the bike engages as soon as the key is turned on . I have called support and have replaced the electronics on it . Since then no support . I would warn anyone from purchasing this product !
 Last year , for new years , i got the minioto maxii . it was awesome for two weeks and then my chain started to constantly pop off and one day i flipped it and my throttle broke.the body work is impossible to take off to get to the engine.then , about two weeks later , my tire popped.it took four hours to install the new one . i do not reccomend this TOY to anyone . this is n't made by honda , manley , or even toy quest.Don ' t buy this chinese -LSB- ... -RSB- !
 Great concept and lots of fun ... while it works . Battery was n't the problem , it was the motor . The motor was broken after 2 hours of use . We called the manufacturer for help , and was shipped a `` replacement part '' . The motorcycle still does n't work -LRB- and yes , it was installed correctly -RRB- . Overall , -LSB- ... -RSB- . We are stuck with a $ 300.00 toy that got 2 hours use !
 I bought these for my husband for sleepware . He finds the material is too heavy and coarse . He , also , does n't like the waiste band as the rubber lining rubs against his stomach . I do n't plan to get him another pair .
 I was looking for a product that will be a comfortable fitting prouct , not a bunch of HARD ICE CUBES
 this thing will not fit a 2005 f-150 i got it on and i had to use a pry bar and then it ripped . this steering wheel cover is crap .
 I bought this for my son 's truck on his birthday . We tried to put this on his steering wheel , and could not ! I is not flexible !!! It is made of a extremely tough rubber inside , and will not fit on a steering wheel . I will never buy this product again from this place . It was a very humiluating experience !!!
 This converter works in the sense that it will let you use propane in your Coleman white gas stove , but it does have a critical flaw . There are only four preset knob positions
 The directional switch is a high quality original equipment part . The illustration however is very misleading . I needed the entire control panel as it is depicted in picture including the the speed rheostat and on/off switch . This product is for ONLY the pan & tilt switch . There was nothing wrong with the product I received , however the as listing needs to be significantly improved to make it very clear what you are buying .
 They shipped the Phosphorescent version of this compass even though they list the Tritum version here and will keep your shipping charges and make you pay the return freight . The vendor has been notified several weeks ago and has not corrected the error . Avoid this item and find a better vendor .
 I received my compass at the end of September 07 . The compass is phosphorescent , not tritium . I will be contacting them for return authorization number .
 I 've tried to contact the seller for a year now with no luck . Amazon was no luck either , just telling me to get in touch with the seller . I have yet to get my hitch that was ordered last fall . Really wish I would have gotten it .
 THis is not the right pump for english bicycles . The picture listed here is a misrepresentation of what is really being sold its alot smaller . If you have an english bicycle like a Raleigh Rudge of Humber then you need the 16 '' one . It is very hard to get your tire to the correct pressure with these
 The schematic of this bilge pump did not match the actual wiring of the pump switch at two locations.The directions included schematics for several bilge pump switches and none of them matched the actual switch.I was able to deconvolute the switch using a VOM meter , but the double pole switch still appeared to work in only one position.In my opinion this is a complete breakdown of quality control .
 When mey parents got this kart for my by birthday I was thrilled . I rode it everyday until it would n't go in reverse . Minimoto sent a steering wheel with switches that did n't fix the problem . After my dad took the kart apart he found that the disc brake was stopping the shaft from turning . Minimoto shipped us all new brake parts . This happened twice . Also the motor gear wore out . They had to ship us a new motor . This happened before the 6 month warranty was up . After 9 months the `` T '' handle that disconnects the electric from the engine melted . I pulled it out and got burnt . Minimoto took the kart back and gave us a full refund . I want a gas kart now . Do n't buy this piece of junk .
 mine kept on stopping and going whick led to a frustrating ride.It only last to an hour . your better off with a gas go kart
 I loved this jacket online and I got it just in time to wear to the World Series , game 4 . Problem was , it did n't fit . The length was very short , so whenever I raised my arms , my midriff was exposed . Also the sleeves were just barely to my wrists . I had ordered a Medium , which was sized 8-10 . I am only a 4-6 and yet the jacket was still too small . Sadly , I had to return it and never had a jacket to wear to the game .
 this thing is a piece of junk you would not believe how many problems it has it will burn a hole in your pocket , its a money pit.AS soon as you replace something there will be another part to break , not to mention that minimoto went out of business and sold there left over parts to monster part.Anyway i would stay away from this nightmare .
 im 15 years old one of my cousins got this it is stupid i have a $ 6,000 dollar suzuki Z400 and it is set up to be raced and it goes atleast 60mph alot better
 Bike rack is too tight . Very difficult to mount even three mountain bikes.Scrathes your bike as they are tightly packed .
 This product will not work properly with the JEEP WRANGLER SAHARA , I purchased it and had to do significant modifications to get it to function properly with our New Jeep Wrangler Sahara.The attachment point to the hitch is too short , the unit bumps up against the spare tire and will not properly pin.To make matters worse the tilt feature does not tilt far enough to avoid the tail gate when opening.Hence , if not extremely skilled in metal working you will be disappointed .
 Been using the rack for one or two bikes . As such , it works great -- easy to mount , sturdy , etc. . BUT ... when I put all four of the family bikes on there for a recent trip -- it was a disaster ! Took forever to arrange the bikes so that they would fit and they did n't fit very well -- had to raise/lower seat posts , remove a couple rear reflectors , delicately wedge foot pedals between spokes , hold back brake levers , etc. . A total pain ! The return trip was just as bad -- took just as long to load the bikes . There 's no good solution because the crossbars are just not long enough -- the spacing is too tight for really any more than two bikes . -LRB- Two bikes adjacent to each other is too close ! -RRB- The worse thing was that after the trip , a couple of the forks were badly scratched from repeatedly rubbing against foot pedals , etc. . Uggh!Also , a design flaw/oversight ... The underside of each crossbar has a small phillips screw at the end . You have to be very careful raising a bike 's top tube over the end of the rack 's crossbar because if you raise it too high and allow the bike 's down tube to come in contact , it 'll easily scratch as it passes over the screw . I learned the hard way and did n't even see the screws until the damage was done . `` Where 'd that scratch come from ? '' If Thule really needed to put screws there , they should have been sunk into the crossbar and a cap placed over them .
 I thought I 'd like this tacklebox , but I do not ! The entire unit is softside which makes it lightweight -LRB- good -RRB- , but when you remove something from the bottom section the entire thing collapses because there 's no longer anything to hold it up . I also found that the cloth gets dirty/wet . I used this tacklebox for a long weekend of camping/fishing and immediately retired it upon my return home . If I had n't used it , I 'd return it .
 I apparently did n't read the dimensions of this product well enough . It is much smaller than I imagined . There is no where to store any long clamps for hook removal . The storage trays are very limited on the size and shape of what you can fit in there . -LRB- The rows are all the same with -- no larger compartments in them -RRB- . And if you remove a tray from the bottom to get to your tackle the bag flops over because there is no support . . I really would not recommend this product especially if you change lures multiple times during your fishing trip . Maybe I can sell it on ebay and get some of my money back .
 I have a bigger version of this box which holds everything I have . It was on its last leg so I wanted a new one . Bought this one , it looked good in the picture , when it arrived , I opened the box and only had to laugh at myself for spending $ 35 on something that does n't hold half of my tackle . It was n't even close . Do n't know what to do with it and still in need of tackle box .
 Sports Instruments -LRB- SI -RRB- was a Utah based company with 3-4 employees that was sold to Bell Sports in 2004 -LRB- and Bell Sports was later sold to Easton Sports in 2006 -RRB- . SI 's activities had slowed , and it is reasonable to believe that Sports Instruments Pro , Fit and ECG Heart Rate Wristwatches were last produced in 2003 or earlier . Products were made in Asia by a reputable factory.Designer and competitive masters athlete Bill Corliss created products with an intelligently designed user interface that was easy to use . The Pro 7 and Pro 9 Hear Rate Wristwatches provided detailed and valuable data for the serious athlete . The Fit and the earlier ECG Fitness Heart Rate Wristwatches had fewer advanced features . The chest transmitter should work with most fitness equipment designed to work with the Polar standard.If you buy an SI watch , you should know that the original batteries are at the end of their shelf life . Unless the seller has recently replaced batteries , you will quickly or immediately face the burden and cost of dealing with battery issues.Replacing the watch batteries is too difficult for most consumers . Even a professional repair person must use care to maker certain that the parts are precisely returned to the original positions to maintain water resistance . Expect to pay $ 9-20 to have the watch battery replaced , and tell your repair person you want the product to keep its water resistance . The battery on the wireless chest transmitter may be less drained than the watch 's and is user replaceable , a nice feature . The chest transmitter 's CR2032 3-volt lithium battery should be available for under $ 4 . Total outlay for 2 batteries
 My first order arrived DOA -LRB- dead battery I think -RRB- . Amazon sent out a replacement , which died -LRB- again , battery , I think -RRB- during my first workout . Amazon then refused to send out a replacement for the replacement -- issuing me a refund . I 'm not happy about this , because , in the meantime , Amazon 's price has tripled.Based on my reading of the manual , and very limited use , this is a great HRT for us beancounters of our workouts ; it keeps track of a lot of information -LRB- no PC download , though -RRB- . Amazon needs to get a batch with good batteries -LRB- which are not user-replaceable , BTW -RRB- .
 I was delighted with my PRO 9 HRM for several years . The functionality is superb and the controls are very easy to navigate -LRB- it did take a few iterations before I understood the instruction booklet -RRB- . When the battery died , I took it to the local battery store franchise . The guy easily took off the back and replaced the battery , but he took about ten minutes to get it back together . Most of that time was putting the band back on . He did n't charge me anything except the cost of the battery . Did n't affect the waterproofing at all.HOWEVER , when the band finally wore out and broke , I called Sports Instruments to obtain a replacement band . After several phone calls to different companies , I ended up leaving a few messages with the guy who supposedly could help . He never returned my calls.Too bad this good product line was bought by people who do n't care about it . Now I have to go through the whole HRM decision process again . ARGHH !
 I purchased this product since it looked like it had good capabilities for a very attractive price . After reading the manual and trying to set it up for 20 minutes , I gave up in frustration . I 'm returning it and looking for a Polar , which has many user recommendations .
 I 'll make this short . This is a decent product that fails because of the battery life.Two weeks of use and the watch battery dies . The user manual directs owners to send the watch in to have a `` technician '' replace the watch battery ? WTH?Make a product that can be user serviced .
 Great Delivery . I probably did not research enough and it resulted in a bad choice . The box is entirely to small however , I 'll adapt .
 most importantly this strap will not `` float '' any camera with a substantial lens attached . In hot weather it is just too hot to even hang on your neck , and it takes up way too much room in any camera case . Apart from these criticisms it looks great !
 This bar is usless without the boots . The bar accessory is displayed WITH boots , leading you to believe you are getting both items . Very disceptive advertising . I would sent the bar back , however , to do so would cost more then the bar is worth . IT IS A BIG FAT RIP OFF . Amazon , you were cunning and most deceptive , also allowing the seller to be , with this item . I am disgusted .

 I bought this watch six months ago -- It was a great watch to use in workouts . Unfortunately , I 've had to replace both batteries and the watch band has torn twice along the slits next to the holes . The first time it broke I used Superglue , but that wo n't work a second time . Evidently the company is out of business and emails bounce back . So , what was a good watch six months ago has turned into a worthless paperweight .
 I bought the Pro 9 Metal Heart Rate monitor from Bike Nashbar on Feb 11 , 2008 . During the past year , I 've only worn the watch while cycling or running . The bands already tore in half while putting the watch on last week . I e-mailed Sports Instruments via their website and received a reply to check back with them in a week since they did n't have the bands in stock.I checked back in a week only to have my e-mail bounce back and their website is unreachable now . I tried again this past week and the e-mail bounces back.Looks like SI has gone out of business . The watch looks great , functioned fine for what I needed it to do -LRB- HRM -RRB- ; however , due to the battery issues and band issues , I would not recommend this watch !
 I bought these pedals to replace the OEM pedals on my Raleigh bike . The originals have been on the bike approximately 10 year -LRB- they still worked well but the glued on reflectors fell off -RRB- . I put these pedals on my bike -LRB- did noticed the roughness the other reviewer complained of -RRB- and road about two mile to the gas station to put air in my tires . At that time I noted the left pedal had a crack in it and thought it I had recieved a defective pedal . I got the air and decided to return home , rode a total 5 miles and when I got home to my surprise the right pedal had cracked and was coming apart from the shaft . lol Total junk , totally wasted . To Niagara Cycle Works credit I email them and they stated they were refunding the amount paid for them . The Seller is a class act , pedals junk.Mark M.ps I am 230 lb muscular man , & one star because It would n't let me give zero
 The recent change from Daylight to Standard was a pleasant surprise as the watch changed the time as opposed to the previous time change , when it took 2 days for it to take place . I was trying to change it manually but could not navigate the instructions and ALL the buttons . June was a month in which I went from Central Daylight to Eastern for 3 days and never switched as it should automatically do so . That was sole reason for buying this watch as NO MORE setting the watch . It is too heavy . It shows only date and if one wants to see the day , you need to push 2 buttons . I do not like it .
 This case arrived with the opening end completly severed from the rest of the case !!!????? What can I say ???? It was returned .
 Flambeau Outdoors Bazuka Pro Rod CaseI fly to Mexico at least once a year . I have had many trips with decent results using Flambeau rod cases . However after a recent trip my case got damaged by the airline , and I decided to spend the extra cash for the larger PRO model . The door flap broke on first trip and the rods got damaged as the door opened and rods slid out . Also broken was the steel locking fastener ? I am now thinking of going with the Plano cases ?
 I took the rod case to Cancun for the first trip . When I got my case at Cancun the top cap was hanging half off . I tried to tape it to get back to Denver but it did n't make it . The cap was totally broken off . The top needs to be reinforce
 I sent this product back . Awful . My lower back , shoulders , upper back and neck HURT for 3 weeks following the 3 or 4 times I attempted to use this product . Very high impact I would say . And the crazy thing kept creeping backward on the carpet , I would have to get off and reposition it after every 2 reps. Terrible product . I also did n't feel it was doing any good , for hips , buns or thighs . Just killed my back ! Went to see my chiropractor the following day and the popping my back did , wow . Threw everything right out .
 The biggest problem with this piece of junk is that it keeps rolling as you do the exercise so you 're clear across the room and if you are looking for any toning it does n't seem to work any of the muscles . For me I never felt the `` burn '' except when my temper flared at trying to use this piece of junk and how uncomfortable it made me and my back . You end up trying to sit down on the floor , and tilt back which sounds easy enough except your wrists start hurting because of the angle and then have to keep moving the roller back to wherever you started ... Would n't recommend this to anyone .
 Really , folks , spend the money on a gym membership , go outside and play with your dog , play soccer with your kids , or spend time in the afternoons working in the yard or the house after warming up with slow movements and a power walk . Be reasonable . Just remain aware of how your body feels , know your limits -LRB- i.e. knees , back , elbows -RRB- and do n't over do it ! It takes time to find your own approach to weight/figure management . You can do it your own way . You do n't need this thing AT ALL.This product will NOT bring you any satisfaction . you 'll only feel stupid for getting sucked into the infomercial and wasting time when you could 've been watching Saturday morning cartoons !!! In the infomercial it shows you `` all the machines '' you have to use at the gym . Well , there 's a reason people use them - becuase their tried and true . Those machines , well worth the cost of a membership , guide the user in producing precision movements . THey cost thousands of dollars and are built to be absolutely sturdy . You 're better off using machines at the gym -LRB- hey , do n't forget the YMCA -RRB- , varying your cardio between outdoor and indoor exercise , and throwing in consistant measures of Pilates and Yoga , if you want to `` change your body . `` This is just another stupid product , we 've seen them come and go for years . It wo n't be around long , folks ... Disappoint will occur , and the probabilty that injury will occur is well within the realm of possibility .
 We bought this bag for our daughter , a catcher . The bag started tearing after one game use ! We have been through 3 bags in 6 years and this one did n't last 24 hours !
 I purchased the 2 '' Flambeau and found that the interior measurement is less than advertised . I contacted Flambeau , prior to purchase , and they indicated that the interior is 1-7/8 '' . I found it to be closer to 1-3/4 '' , but certainly not the 2 '' stated on the Amazon description . The tube is flimsy and is easily compressed . The tube does telescope , but not smoothly . My fault -- you get what you pay for and I should have paid more and received the higher quality product that one needs to protect their valuable fishing rods . There is no cushioning on either end to absorb shocks or prevent breakage . A plus is that the cap screws on and is connected by a 1/8 '' leather string .
 First off , the .20 bullets sink a TON . I doubt this actually shoots 300 fps , more like in the 200 's . It has pretty bad range and a small clip size -LRB- I recommend getting a speed loader , makes loading a lot faster and easier . -RRB- The gun has pretty high velocity for the range , very light and looks AWSOME with the silencer -LRB- which by the way does n't silence anything , it 's just for looks . -RRB- Overall , I would not recommend this gun . You would be better with a spring shotgun/sniper or spending spending a little more money on a better AEG .
 I just lost this computer today for the last time . I searched for it in the weeds for about 20 mins then finally gave up . It never attached to the bike properly , and within 100 miles the sensor unit snapped apart rendering the entire device useless until I remedied the situation with some zip-ties . I would save up a few more bucks and get something nicer . I did love the style and look and even the features but it 's a very unrealiable piece of equipment . Buttons seemed cheap as well and I often had a hard time clearing the memory out for the next ride . Good luck if you get this one . Sorry Vetta .
 I 've been cycling for years - and have installed plenty of these kinds of gadgets on a multitude of bikes . This one did n't work.After carefully reading the manual and buying and changing the batteries , and reinstalling multiple times I came to the conclusion that the sensor was not working . Have emailed Vetta and the retailer . Both have replied ; Vetta sent some information and the seller has offered to send me a new sensor at their expense . I rate both for getting back to me promptly , and I hope this fixes the problem . Overall a but frustrating , but gratifying that they are actively helping fix the problem .
 This computer worked well for one set of batteries . The one exception is the auto-on function which never worked.After the first battery change -LRB- transmitter and receiver at the same time -RRB- the computer did not work as long . Upon subsequent changes the computer did not work at all . It would either not pick up the transmitter at all or read , at best , inacurately.I came across it again while shopping for a replacement -LRB- Cateye -RRB- and decided to write this review . Buy something else .
 I got this computer on a new bike at an LBS that did n't have any other options . Purchased it sight-unseen , no reviews , etc. . I would n't have purchased it otherwise , because my experience is in line with others here . I 'll be nice and start with pros . . Large screen . Smartlight that turns on the backlight at night automatically . Buttons large enough to easily use with gloves.Cons . . It does n't work . Okay , it sometimes works . When it wants to . I 've been on three rides , the first ride it seemed to work okay , then at some point I noticed the display had gone to sleep . I poked at it , gave up , rode on . Later I noticed it was registering again , although it was showing 2mph when I was going maybe 15ish . . then it stopped again . Second ride same as first , off and on . Third ride it refused to do anything , never registered any movement.I turned off automatic start on the thing , but I think that just means on/off , because there 's no `` start/stop '' type function . But I thought I 'd try it based on other reviews of it not automatically turning on , but nothing . I 've pushed the Alignment button on the bottom of the sensor and spun the wheel and I hear the distinct noise each time the sensor goes past , and based on the sensor/magnet , it 's in perfect alignment . The computer is 19in/48cm away from the sensor , not sure what else I could to to get them any closer if it 's a distance issue . I 'm going to mess with the sensor position , maybe move it out a little , perhaps better `` line of sight '' to the computer.Otherwise , I 'll be somehow returning this , or hitting it with a hammer . Not sure which will be more satisfying .
 Worked for a couple of weeks after which it stopped recording . I changed the battery and it worked for about one day after it drained the battery . I contacted the manufacturer to see if it something I was doing wrong and they concluded the sensor was defective . They were kind enough to send me a replacement sensor within days , but unfortunately that one did n't do the trick either . Next time I 'll get a different brand .
 I liked the features of this bike computer , but when I turn on my Cateye HL-EL830RC Triple Shot Pro the computer goes crazy , displaying random high speeds in 50 - 70 MPH ranges . Same thing happened while passing under some high voltage power lines .
 it was delivered fast . this is crap , have had to pull the battery after each use to input the settings . you need a magnifying glass to read the setting for km or miles . buy something else .
 wow this jock is loose , lets be honest this jock is more like a 40 to a 42 sized waist easily . the quality is not great and the leg straps seam to dig in where they attach to the belt on the jock . the pouch is plenty roomy . i would not buy this again not at 6 bucks not even for 2 dollars .
 I already did n't like this unit . The semi-english instructions sounded like they might be helpful if you already knew what they were trying to tell you . The lapping features were hard to use and did n't tell me what I wanted to know -LRB- as in , how long did that last lap take ? -RRB- . And I had to have the sending unit replaced -LRB- thank goodness for the friendship of The Bike Shop -RRB- . So I was grudgingly getting along with the thing until I rode with it in the rain . Corroded the contacts , and when I made headway getting those back , the buttons failed . Yep , this was my first bike puter . I guess I expected too much of it .
 I bought this mask because it was highly rated . However this mask was a great disappointment . I 'll start with my biggest problem with the mask , virtually all the vents on the mask was cover by plastic excess . I guess it came out of the mold and they attached it to the mask without bothering to free or cut an opening for the vents . I spent over an hour trying to cut out all that excess which I would 've figured JT should have done.Also its small and does not cover , depending on big your head is , the top part of your head . I do n't have the biggest face in the world but this mask stops right above my forehead , leaving the rest expose . Also the mask stops before my jaw line leaving part of my face and all of my neck exposed . Not cool.It 's lighter than my previous mask but thats about it , I might actually just go back to my old one.Not recommended
 To short no description of the item . If you feel like laying on yer belly or sittig in the dirt , get them mine went right in the fire place . Two sticks with a piece of bike inertube .
 Product description should include the fact that the planner only covers July 26 , 2004 thru July 31 , 2005 and not two full years as expected .
 I purchased this item on 4/27/06 . As of 6/30/06 the item still hase n't shipped . This is the worst service I have ever experienced and will hesitate to do business with Amazon.com in the future .
 This football plays Vikings chants and music when you clap it . Everything was working as intended but after about 10 times clapping it , either the speaker broke or the batteries were dead - making it pretty much worthless .
 IT is not very good value at all . IT broke in two days . I would suggest a different brand . IT S.T.I.N.K.S. !
 I bought this by mistake and thought I 'd keep it and try it out anyway . Before I could use it it lost air and is now unusable . Qite disappointed .
 This product is a joke - its not worth the money asked for - the DVD in the box did not contain enough and barely required the ball to do the exercises - I actually thought that I was purchasing a pilates squishy ball not a hard unweighted ball . I do not recommend the purchase of this product .
 When I saw that Amazon carried my favorite breeches , I jumped in and ordered 4 pairs . I love the Sigma cotton breeches with a zipper pocket . But , what I received was Tuffrider Pull On breeches with no zipper pocket , in light weight fabric -LRB- I hate pull on breeches ! -RRB- When I called Equestrian Collection to inform them that I had not received what I ordered , the person just kept going around in circles telling me this is what I ordered . I 'm sending them a copy of the Amazon page to show them what I ordered ...
 The watch arrived broken and not working , had to spend an extra $ 30 to get it repaired .
 This watch only lasted about 16 months . I thought it was the battery but it was a complete failure . Never had a watch that lasted only months ?????? Junk !
 While the discs arrived quicker than expected and packaged well , the discs themselves were a big let-down . They are not for throwing , being too wobbly to fly straight , even if given a decent spin . In fact , these discs are hardly suitable for display with how floppy and unbalanced they are .

 I thought I was getting a great yoga mat , but as soon as I started using it in yoga class , I went back to my original Gaiam yoga mat . The Oasis mat smelled horribly of rubber -LRB- not a good thing in the child 's or dog poses -RRB- , but worst of all , I kept slipping on the mat and I strained my body in trying to stay in place . Also , the mat kept sliding on the floor making my ability to stay upright even harder . The Premium sticky mat -LRB- the striped one -RRB- performed much better and costs significantly less even though I 'm still looking for a better non-slip mat . Do n't waste your money on the Oasis .
 The smell from this yoga mat is toxic ! I 'm not sure why my experience was so much worse than the other reviewers , but I can not recommend this mat . I tried airing out the mat outdoors -LRB- could n't for more than a few hours as I live in a harsh winter climate , it was snowing , and am apartment city dweller -RRB- and washed it twice , but NOTHING would get rid of the smell . The smell made my sinuses burn and swell . HORRIBLE !!!! I ended up throwing it out because it was making me ill.Perhaps if you lived somewhere where you could keep the mat outdoors for several days , this would not be an issue for you . Unfortunately , this was not an option for me .
 The racket does n't produce much spin or speed . It is good if you are just learning and need lots of control . But if you have been playing for some time , you 'll need something better to improve your game .
 This paddle is way too light , too thin and the grib is too narrow . No power . Do n't recomand for anyone . Not even for beginners . Was totally disappointed . Ca n't believe it 's from butterfly company . Going to pass it along to my kids .
 This paddle has an alright deck , but the rubber on this racket is horrible , the rubber has a 3/10 spin rating in my opinion . There are many other itemsfrom Butterfly which are much better . Dont waist your money on this one
 AVOID buying from Garrison Sports Group , buy from someone else.i bought this item and had to contact the seller 4 days later to check on status . he told me they had made some mistake and said that i `` underpaid '' and proceeded to tell me he has to cancel my order and if i want the item i have to pay another $ 240 ... what a joke . this guy tricks people into buying the item for a low price , then holds it hostage over their heads so that they pay more . Avoid this seller . he ended up canceling this order and would n't even work anything out . After I contacted him , he simply said `` if you want the item you have to pay more , if not then i will cancel this order . '' Conning people into buying from you is not the right way to do business , avoid at all costs.PS i wasnt able to leave the seller feedback due to him canceling this order , so i feel it necessary to leave it on the item itself , at least i can save some people the inconvenience .
 Ok well i ordered this for my fixed gear bike . When i had gotten this package it wasnt even 22 balls it was 16 balls then i got a replacement for it then amazon gave me the same thing a 16 ball retainer ... . i would not recommend this to any body waste of money
 I 've been a big fan of Smartwool products in the past , but this pair of socks for my girlfriend developed a hole in the side after having been worn only 3 times . Perhaps they were defective , because my other Smartwool socks have held up reasonably well , but buyer beware .
 When I saw that Amazon carried my favorite breeches , I jumped in and ordered 4 pairs . I love the Sigma cotton breeches with a zipper pocket . But , what I received was Tuffrider Pull On breeches with no zipper pocket , in light weight fabric -LRB- I hate pull on breeches ! -RRB- When I called Equestrian Collection to inform them that I had not received what I ordered , the person just kept going around in circles telling me this is what I ordered . I 'm sending them a copy of the Amazon page to show them what I ordered ...
 I do not recommend this pedometer for anyone who has trouble seeing up close.I do n't normally have to read with reading glasses , but I could not read anything other than the larger numbers and words on the display . There are some smaller ? words or letters on the far right side that are microscopic in size . I was reading under ideal conditions in my house . The overall operation of this pedometer was not user friendly . This was the first pedometer that I have purchased . I may not ever buy another unless I can try it first . Although I did not purchase this pedometer for the accompanying cd , -LRB- I did n't want to have to rip it to my computer then download it to my mp3 player -RRB- I did listen to it . It will put you to sleep . Your heart rate will increase just attempting to operate this piece of junk .
 This pedometer lasted about 4 or 5 days . After that the display went all strange and completely unreadable . It did n't get wet , I did n't drop it , it just suddenly stopped working .
 well , it was easy to set-up but the step count was NOT accurate even after adjusting the + / - several times and after making sure my stride calculations were correct.I decided to take a long walk and see if it made a difference . I clipped it to my jeans , drove to the park , walked a couple of miles , and then realized it had `` disappeared '' . The pedometer must have fallen when I got out of the car -LRB- I had made the decision to check at the end of the walk so I had no idea what had happened ! -RRB- . I found it crushed next to my car because the car next to me drove over it.I would spend extra $ $ on a different brand AND I would consider getting a safety strap .
 The product description stated the line was `` translucent '' and the color was called `` crystal '' . Little did I know that meant the line was white . Fish will spot that a mile away . Thankfully , Amazon took it back .
 The spin & speed not worth the price marking . A $ 20 paddle could have provide similar performance .
 I bought this racket at 3/11 and Delivery estimate is 3/17 - 3/22 but I did n't receive it even today is 3/30 . I complained several times but It really does n't work . I can do just waiting .
 This tire blew out on me on my second ride on it . I had only 125 PSI and it just blew out coming down a hill . Waste of money !!
 I was really excited to get this item and add to my workout repertoire UNTIL I read the owner 's manual and found out you can only use this machine for 15 minutes at a time . And then you have to let it cool down for 15 minutes . What 's the point ? My workouts are typically 45-minutes to an hour so , at best , this could only supplement what I 'm already doing . That information should be posted in the item information area . If I 'd known that ahead of time , I would n't have made the purchase . As it is , I 'm returning it and sticking with my workout DVDs .

 I have had numerous Ugly Stick spinning rods in the past but when I recieved this rod the first thing that I noticed was the eyelits/guides . Shakespeare must be trying to save money because they have gone to the old school design when everyone else has improved their design . I would not recommend this item to anyone that has owned an Ugly Stick rod in the past because they have taken a huge step backwards in the design of their rods in my opinion .
 I wrote the seller about this and no response . Anyway these springs would probably be great if they fit which they do not fit at all . You could n't get these on with a pair of pliers . So if you are getting these for your Vice Gripper get them somewhere else . COMPLETELY WORTHLESS .
 We never recieved our item , and even after emailing Amazon several times , we never recieved our money back !!! Amazing how some people ` earn ' a living ! The site wo n't let me give it zero stars ... so do n't read into the 1 star review !

 I 'm Army Infantry , in the field a lot . I knew when it arrived it was n't going to last long . The actual compass is just glued to the rubber piece that slides over your watchband . After a few days in the field , I looked down and noticed the compass piece was gone , only the rubber holder there . I 've had other brands of wrist compass ' last a lot longer than a week .

 I bought this product for the extra length and I got just that . I got the extra length and it bent on me . Now it 's JUNK !!!! I would n't recomment this product to anyone . I 'm not going to send it back because I lose on shipping through AMAZON both ways , so It 's scrap . That 's the problem I seem to encounter with Amazon . You get the money back for the article purchased but you lose out on the two way shipping , there and back . I 'm really not sure if I 'd buy any more items through Amazon due to this cost factor.WHAT DO YOU THINK , AMAZON ??????
 This item does what it is suppose to do and looks nice but after about two weeks the emblem fell off of the money clip . Should have invested ina more expensive one .

 My grip is that the pictures in the manual are horrible , they are smudged and nearly useless due to being so dark .

 Nice looking pair of glasses but unfortunately we must have gotten a defective pair . One side of the glasses -LRB- where it wraps and hooks around your ear -RRB- . This was significantly higher than the other . You can notice this by setting the shades on the table - it did not lay flat . This caused the shades to sit uneven on your face . One side touched my cheek but the other side did not . One of the joints where the frame bends was screwed on way too tight , it made it hard to fold the glasses . Had high hopes for these pair too .
 I have been using these for over 2 years now . We have 19 water spigots across our property . They range in use from my wife 's vegetable garden , occasional hookup for a power washer , and horse troughs . You could say we test these cross the whole gamut.If you let them freeze they crack.Frequent use wears out rubber seals -LRB- I get maybe a year of disconnecting and reconnecting an item once a week -RRB- . The crack easily , usually leaving a male piece in the female piece , which is impossible to get out and requires changing both pieces.I 've yet to find anything that works better , and at this price I can afford to replace them all every year .
 Partial sets of these quick-connecters came with my Gilmour Pattern Master sprinkler . Neat ! The thing is , once you put the hose-end connectors on , you realize you 'll need more connections for all the other devices that connect to the hose , hence this purchase -LRB- Gilmour 2939Q -RRB- . Everything worked well for a week or so , then the rubber o-rings on the male ends became sticky and hard to connect . Meanwhile , the locking retractors inside the female end start to cut and slice at the o-ring
 Bought these at a big box store . Initially , they worked great and bought some more . After about 12 months of infrequent use , they began to leak , not just at the gasket as others have found . These were generally kept in the garage or heated basement and not allowed to freeze . About 18 months after the initial purchase , I am junking them and going with a metal quick-connect from a different manufacturer .
 Initially I bought one set each of a few brands to compare . Gilmour seemed to be made the best , it has a built in valve -LRB- very handy -RRB- , and the male connector has a wide flange which makes it easy to tighten with fingers -LRB- others need a wrench if you do n't have tough hands -RRB- . So I bought four sets of Gilmour , I was very happy for the first two months , but now they have all failed . Ca n't push the male connector all the way into the female . Seems to be a problem inside the female . I 'm starting over , looking at other brands .
 I ordered these for a family tennis tournament and every can we opened was dead . I was very disappointed in the product .
 Wanted some tennis balls at a good price without having to go to the mall . The balls were barely acceptible when they arrived . Suspect they were very old balls because they did n't last very long .
 My game was n't that bad ! the tennis balls were flat.The balls only lasted two sets.I will look elsewhere for another brand of balls that lasta bit longer .
 It was it not the actual quantity described as 12 packages , which made it FAR more expensive than you can buy single tubes for everywhere else .
 I bought these after hitting two deer in three weeks . I have asked a couple of people if they worked and read the reviews on here . From the first day after installing them the deer did the same thing as they did without them . I am not just talking about once or twice but every time . That tells me this product does nothing.After two weeks of seeing deer not reacting I decided to relocate them just to see if that helped . It did not . I am not sure if there is a product out there that will make the deer run away from you instead of toward you but really this is not it . They did come as described and in good condition and my review in no way reflects any bad opinions on the seller .
 I had these on my 2009 Toyota Venza driving at Rockland NY around 4:30 am on my way to work and hit a deer . Two of them actually crossed the road , the first one made it to the other side but the second one hit my left fender . I was driving about 45-50 mph , way above the 35 mph claimed operational speed . My four month old Venza spent 2.5 weeks at the body shop , it looked like new after it was repaired but my emotional experience will never be the same . Save your money , now I 'm doing research on ultrasonic deer alert devices . I recently ordered the Hopkins -LRB- now Hoppy -RRB- Trailblazer 12 volt device - will test it and do another review.This is my personal experience - IT DOES N'T WORK . If you want to take your 30 % chance of avoiding a collision with a deer -LRB- based on research -RRB- then go get these . When my Venza was being repaired in the body shop , ironically the whistles were still mounted . With the technology available today , these whistles are a joke .
 I worked for the State of Virginia and had to report to duty at 6am . Since I 've had my car in 06 I bought a pair of these plastic deer avoidance devices and installed them as directed . I have hit two deer with these on the car , the first one in 2007 and the second in 2009 . The first hit did n't do any damage , but flipped a small deer in the air and it died upon landing on a guardrail . That was in the daylight on the way home at approx . 60 mph . The second was on the same Highway in Jan 09 . It did 3K damage to the car and was a direct hit in foggy conditions . I did manage to slow down to about 35 on impact . I 'm lucky the airbag did n't deploy , body shop said an inch more to the center from the passenger side would have totaled the vehicle . Do the electronic ones work ? I have no idea however if they also do not work expect another truth review . This area is infested with deer along highways .
 They MAY work for DEER but DO NOT work for MOOSE . I missed a moose by inches two nights ago while they were on my vehicle . If you want them you can have them . Email me and I will send them to you FREE !!!!!!
 I tryed to order this twice and email them with no reply order elsewhere if you want them in a timely fashion , which is what I ended up doing .
 I bought these specifically for the fact that they were the only ones I could find that were made in the USA . BUT they are not made in the USA , they are made in China . The packaging is also different then shown so I wonder what the `` sold exclusively by '' claim is for?The item is fine but NOT what is being advertised and that is why I am giving 2 stars .
 I do n't have anything to compare ours to , but I 'm not that thrilled with our trailer . It 's very small for two children , the seat is like one giant sling so it 's not comfortable , and the harness is a huge pain . I expected the harness to be a pain because of other reviews , but I expected the seat to be more comfortable and for two kids to fit pretty well . Because it 's like one giant sling , keeping two children in place comfortably is very hard . I would not buy again .
 I bought this because I was told by someone at the R. A. Allen Co. that this would work with their Bike Rack , model 440RR . It turns out that I was lied to or was given an answer by someone who did not know anything . It does NOT work with Allen 's own bike rack !!!!! The cylinder is too thick -LRB- i.e. the diameter of the cylinder is too wide -RRB- to fit through the hitch insert hole.This item will NOT work with Allen Bike Racks and company will not return your phone call or help you in any way !!!!! -LRB- I called them twice and left two messages with an Alex , who has never returned my phone call . -RRB- I will never buy another item from the R. A. Allen Co. again .
 This item is a waste of time & money . It wont fit the 1.25 inch bike rack unless you drill the hole on the bike rack to 1/2 inch . When I did that the bike rack wobbles . Even worse , because the locking hitch is not a single forged section -LRB- not the end with the key lock -RRB- mine came apart when I arrived home after a short trip . Save your money & get a long cable or chain lock to deter the casual thief .
 This bike rack lock does not work on the Allen bike racks . The description for this item did n't make that clear for me . Called customer service and they told me it is not an `` Allen '' bike rack lock even though it labeled as an Allen item and is sold by Allen . The Allen rack will wobble .
 I loved this little guy ... but after about 2 years of * really * gentle use -- day hikes , an overnight or two , skiing -- the electronics went haywire and the screen compartment started to get condensation in it ... the electronics are n't covered by the great warranty , only a very limited one . If I had seriously used this in the back country , I doubt it would have lasted a year .
 First off . The knife is great . I would n't expect anything less from swiss army . only bad part about the knife is that the altimeter has an accuracy error margin of about 75 % . And since this is both the title of the knife and the main feature of it , I give the knife a two . Only because you can get a knife just like it without the altimeter that works just as well .
 I received the watch and the hands were broken . I e-mailed the company and they are sending a new watch , however it is out of stock till the end of February . They send the UPS mishandled it . I feel that it was not mishandled . I believe it was broken before it left the company . This was very dissapointing since it was a Christmas gift .
 I have purchased Under Armor products in the past and enjoyed them . However , I was completely dissatisfied with this product . The only thing I like about it is the length of the capri pants . The waist line is too short , and the fabric is flemsy and not what I expected . I would have returned the product , but unfortunately , I threw the receipt and packaging away before I had an opportunity to try the product on . $ 31.00 plus dollars wasted !
 I have had this watch for less than 3 months and today while I was putting the watch on the band portion broke in half . Very poor quality , considering the price and I have always been very careful with it . Also , I agree with the other reviewer , it scratches way too easily . Cute watch , but I would pass due to the quality .
 Very cute watches , unfortunately they are not well made . I bought two of these watches and both of the faces fell off of them within a matter of months . I did n't wear this watch everyday or submerge it in water at any time . Very poor quality , would not recommend .
 All AK 's come with a ` dust cover ' that mounts on the top of the AK . This product is scope mount that is a replacement for that dust cover that has a weaver scope rail riveted to the top of a replacement dust cover . The original dust cover is removed and this product is put in its place . The scope is then mounted to this product . This cover/mount/scope is a very loose arrangement , as the original dust cover is somewhat loose to begin with . To add stability to the overall cover/mount/scope , two screws have been added to the rear of the dust cover so that the User can screw the product cover tight - but this technique only works once , because if you take the cover/mount/scope off , you must sight in the rifle anew as the two rear tightening screws do n't allow for precision re-tightening . Many AK 's come equipped with a left receiver side mounted scope ` rail ' that is extremely solid attached , so instead of purchasing this product , buy yourself a ` side scope attachment ' that attaches to this side rail - that is what the rail was meant for . These side scope attachments along with its attached scope can be slid on and off this rail with ease , and are either held in place with 2-3 Allen set screws or a ` Quick Mount ' lever . Both work fine . Re-sighting of the rifle should not be necessary if the scope/attachment are removed . Some are low profile attachments -LRB- are very close to the dust cover -RRB- or high profile and ride high enough above the dust cover so as to not interfer with the using the iron sights . The AK dust cover was not designed for scope attachment purposes .
 Good for killin critters at nite with an attached flashlite , horrible/unusable for scope . Side mount with quick release lever is better . Do n't waste your money on this .
 I 've used this on my Romanian and Bulgarian AK 's . I found that mount even when adjusted was n't very stable and would n't retain zero when removed .
 Granted , it is very cheap , but the quality is so low it is not even worth the $ 3 they charge . The bracket is flimsy and the bulb falls off . Junk junk junk .
 The horn was delivered bent -LRB- bought from BikeWorldUSA -RRB- on the Flare and the Chrome was flaking along the length of the horn . The hardware to connect the horn to the bike is very very low quality and does not allow you to lock in the direction of the horn securely . Just pay the extra $ 5-10 at your local bike shop for a higher quality one . I am .
 I can not review since I never received product . Supposedly not in stock but I still see it on Amazon for the last 3 months for sale . Weird ...
 when i first saw this kit . . i thought . . ?? hey its a little bit cheap . . but then when i used it . . i start thinking . . hey shure you can buy a 1000 $ gun that destroys this one . . but the price . . you cant !! . . so think about this thing cause its cool , and its like an zoo , and you can sit , take pictures , buut , , in the page
 I got your product a few months back , and it did not work the way i expected . After each time it rained , i would have to go out and buy a new bulb for the thing .
 Unless you have very small fingers , you 'll have a hard time getting the balls tight with this rack . The small size also makes it difficult to remove without disrupting the balls . I switched back to using my standard 15 ball rack .
 Takes two hands too pull the arrow out with your knee aganist it . After pulling several out your fingers starts to hurt because you have to grip so hard . I do n't and will not recommend this target . Jack
 i did quite a bit of research online -LRB- comparing descriptions , reading reviews , etc. -RRB- and thought this would be the best bike trailer for our family . we decided to not go super cheap and could n't afford a $ 500 trailer so this seemed like it would work.PROS
 It 's light and sturdy , the snaps snap tightly , easy to put together . However , it is too big for me to get through the front door of my house ! One needs a garage to store it in . Once I put it together I realized I have to take it apart to get it outside and I do n't have a garage so it 's just sitting here in my living room . Also , it will only fit to one bike as it comes with only 1 coupler . It wo n't attach to multiple bikes like other bike trailers will . Looking back I would have definitely investigated this further .
 This product might be great for a child that feels comfortable with zero support and is not upset by awkward straps . My son has tried this trailer out probably 10 times in the past year . We were hoping he would grow to like it . The canopy seats offer zero support for his back and the straps are quite awkward . I 'm not sure how any kids would like this because my husband and I both feel like we should have spent an extra $ 100 or $ 200 for a better quality trailer . If your child is easy to please and is content with most situations , by all means , go for it . If your child is a bit picky and likes to feel supported - I would not recommend this bike . We are going to try and sell it on Craig 's List for $ 50 - $ 75 to try and recover whatever money we can . Return policy is only 90 days at Target - and we are beyond that .
 I bought this trailer in Spring 2009 . The aluminum framing is great and sturdy , the fabric of the canopy , straps inside that hold the seat and the straps that hold the canopy together are awful ! Within a few weeks of owning this trailer the gray color of the fabric started turning pink due to being in the sun -LRB- which is considered normal wear and is not covered by the warranty ... I now own a blue and pink trailer -RRB- . Then after two seasons of use , both straps that hold up the bottom of the sling seat broke and one strap that holds the front of the trailer closed broke as well ! The clips used for the 5-point harness are difficult to hook and even more difficult to unhook too , but they work . The trailer is lightweight and easy to pull and my daughters love going for rides , but the quality of the fabric and straps used for the canopy leaves a lot to be desired . Since the straps to the bottom of the sling seat broke , the trailer is essentially useless for trailering the kids . Do n't waste your money on this trailer because in two years you will have to replace it .
 this bike trailer is n't totally worthless , but the seat system is for sure . i could n't hardly believe it when i saw it
 This is a cheap stroller - the manager at my local bike shop recommended seeing a baby bike trailer in person before buying one ; I disregarded his advice and ordered this to try to save a couple hundred dollars over a Chariot or comparable , and after assembling it and trying it once decided to send it back.My single biggest issue with this stroller is the restraint system for a toddler . It 's inadequate , uncomfortable , and unsafe . It consists of a single piece of webbing going across the width of the trailer as a lap belt -LRB- there 's a clasp , but no quick-release -RRB- . And , there are 3 sets of vertical restraints with 2 shoulder straps and a crotch strap - again , each has a clasp but no quick-release . If you have a single toddler in the center of the trailer , the lap belt does n't come close to restraining the child , as it 's 2-3 times with width of the her waist . Within 1-2 minutes , our little girl had wiggled out of the shoulder restraints , and the waist restraint would let her slide the width of the trailer if the trailer tipped over.The trailer comes with a notice that says , `` Do n't use above 10mph '' . I initially thought , `` this is to avoid getting sued '' , but after evaluating the restraint system , I actually believe that this trailer is not safe above 10mph . Second complaint is that you have to remove half of the cover to place the baby in the trailer , or take her out , or interact with her in any way . If you have a fussy baby like mine , this is a deal breaker.If you expect to use your baby bike trailer with any frequency , and/or your baby 's comfort and safety are concerns , I recommend spending the extra $ 200 or so and purchasing a higher quality baby trailer .
 We used this trailer for a few months and noticed that there is significant wear on the al tube that inserts to the coupler attached to the bike . You have the coupler rubbing against the Al tube which is slowly putting a cut into the Al tube . It has not failed yet , but I do n't trust having my kids in there anymore . Customer Service is not helpful at all . After 2 months of going back and fourth they are not able to provide any solution and decline that there is a problem with this design . Apparently they have not seen this before in their tests . Strange , there are two other trailers at our daycare with the same attachment mechanism and both show the same damage.Do not buy this product or any other schwinn , instep . trailer that uses this attachment mechanism . Spend the extra $ and go for a different brand . They all use a different attachment mechanism .
 I purchased this item in December and only used it three times . One of the little plastic black knobs on where the frame connects to the canopy broke of . Now the item is unusable .
 Bought this for my unscopped Ruger 10/22 . I did n't open it more then 10 times before one of the little wires in the zipper bent , and now I can not close it at all . Extremely disappointing . Overall it is cheaply made . Only buy it if you HAVE to have a case and need one cheap .
 I was disappointed to find this case has no capability of adding a small padlock.If you carry a rifle out in Caliornia , you better have the case locked . -LRB- Until the NRA sues the Peoples Republic of California for yet another infringement on The Right to Bear Arms -RRB- .
 I love boxing but this video is way to complicated . . I found myself trying to follow her , it was way to fast that I could not follow , the first time I only complete 5 minutes , the second time 15 minutes . so I am not sure if I want to try a third time . It to fast that is hard to even break a sweat , and even the people in the video are having a hard time sometimes following her.maybe she is too advance for my level .
 So I 've been eyeing this watch for a while and wife got it for me as a gift.We ended up returning it.I saw this on somebody and it looked real good . The picture looks good too . HOWEVER , once you get a close look , you 'll realize how small the diamonds are . And the whole watch itself looks a bit like a toy ... just not quality like some of the more expensive ones ... granted , the price point is what it is . But you can buy a Movado and other such watches that are 1 or 2 tiers higher than a Bulova for a hundred or 150 more.Again , the watch does look good from afar . I do have another Bulova that I like and others do as well . So not knocking the brand itself but that one also has diamonds in place of numbers but they are also very tiny with shiny square metal piece underneath to make it look bigger . I think this is what all lower tier watch makers do .
 everything on this watch is so tiny that i had to send it back . you can not read the dials to see the date with the naked eye . it is a beautiful watch if you do not need to use the functions .
 I bought a new watch from Amazon but I returned it because the watch had lots scratch on bracelet . I ordered thtee times but everything had scratches . I am so disappointment about amazon . Please check product before shipping to customers in order not to spend their time .
 I plugged it into a 120v house socket and into my GPS . Instead of powering my GPSMap 498 it did NOTHING . However when I put the GPS back in my boat I discovered that it would no longer search for satellites but I finaly managed to get it going again . I called Garmin support and they basically said `` too bad , we do n't produce that unit anymore . '' I strongly reccommend that you not purchase this unit .
 Two problems I have with this unit : . The dial is hard to read . And the controls are hard to work.So you probably wo n't be able to see it 's info very well but that 's ok because you probably wo n't have been able to set it up anyway . The salesman was so nice I felt like buying something . I 'll stick with my current Acumen unit .
 Bought this with high hopes because of its compact design and supposedly good features - BUT
 You would think in this day and age with the technology we have that a devise could not fail so miserably . It is really hard to use and just does not seem to work as far as I can tell . I have given it a few days and keep going back to the instructions to see if I can get more out of them . The control buttons are really hard to use . I just wish I had done a little reading up on pedometers before I bought this one .
 The instructions said that as soon as the battery is connected the 24hr clock will be displayed , it was n't and I should have known right then that this was n't going to end well . The instructions are n't detailed enough , eg if you press the ' + ' to input your own preferences in any of the modes absolutely nothing happens . I followed the instructions to set the step length and it just flicks over immediately to the next mode . Clock stays at 6am , can not change the hour or minutes . After nearly 2 hours of trying to programme it I 've given up .
 I purchased this product and it is impossible to program . You are not able to program the pedometer since the side buttons are so small and difficult to manuever . I basically threw away my money . Do not buy this product .
 This item was purchased for my seven year-old grandson with the purpose of encouraging him to hang up his clothes daily . Unfortunately the clothes rack fell over almost immediately after assembly and was broken rendering it unusable . I do n't know what the problem was but suspect that the top team emblem is too heavy for the slender rack to support . A cute idea that did not work!MargaretFan of the San Diego Padres
 I bought this to a 2009 Highlander and found out that I could not adjust the straps small enough for the width of my vehicle . so I decided to zip tie it in so the straps were tight accross the vehicle . BUT due to the mounting points being too close together the poles are not held up at all and i may as well have just put them in the back with the rod tips hitting the roof on the way towards the front seats . It did come with custom mounting points that can be installed in you attic garage or otherwise used in an old vehicle to add correctly spaced mounting points . I would not recomend this product to anyone unless you have an old vehicle you are willing to drill mounting points into the vehicle .
 This item was too wide for my 1996 Ford Explorer and had to be cut and modified to fit . I can tell that after a season or 2 it will need replacement , probably because i have medium to heavy tackle and use it year round . It is well suited for a larger vehicle , and i suggest you leave the heavier setups resting on the seats . I hope this review helps . Now i know why there are lots of luggage rack units around my area in use .
 I bought the Squid as a starter unicycle . My interests were purely recreational . I just wanted to see if riding a unicycle was something that I could actually do , and since I was n't going to be doing any trials , off-roading , or tricks , I thought this would be a good value purchase.Mongoose , manufactured by Schwinn , is a brand I always liked as a kid , but unfortunately my unicycle ended up breaking after three days . Just as I was able to stay upright and ride for about 20 feet or so , the axle connecting the crank arms started to slip inside the hub . -LRB- I think this defect is called `` keyhole slop . '' -RRB- This made the unicycle unridable for me because when I tried to pedal forward , the slipping crank arms would n't generate any forward momentum in the wheel . By the way , I 'm about 175 lbs -- not an unreasonable weight for a unicycle.Mongoose 's customer service did not have the replacement parts in stock . So they told me to contact the retailer . However , before the retailer could refund my money , the they had to go back and forth with Mongoose/Schwinn to get authorization for a return shipping order -- a process that took over a week . I did get a full refund , and now I 'm using those funds to buy a Torker Unistar.There were virtually no assembly instructions . But you can download some other ones on -LSB- . . -RSB- . These downloadable ones are for a different unicycle , but they are slightly more helpful than nothing.Also , there are unicycle sizing guides online . The size of the unicycle tire you should buy depends on your inseam measurement and what you want to do with it.The three hours that I was able to practice with this were fun . Too bad about the premature failure !
 I purchased three of these for my nieces and nephews . On our first round of orders , one was missing a parts box , and two had punctured inner tubes . In addition , none of the three boxes had complete instructions . After our returns , we still had to buy replacement inner tubes , as the originals were faulty . So , I had to replace BRAND NEW inner tubes for all three unicycles . I wish I had just spent the additional money up front for something of higher quality . I 'm not sure why Amazon even sells something of such poor quality . I am very dissatisfied .
 I grew up with Mongoose BMX bikes - remember the ones you could crash through the trees on and it would be just fine?Mongoose !! Where have you gone?I gave this item to my son one week ago.satisfied that it would be great , it is after all a Mongoose.NOPE!THREE DAYS LATER it is broken.The pedals fell off a few times , and it was nearly impossible to assemble correctly -LRB- it appears to go together , only to find they are not at the right angles -RRB- . Then , the axle and shafts do not connect right . spins , no wheel action . I am told it needs to be welded or replaced . Both cost as much as the unicycle !!! seat is also VERY uncomfortable for boys/young men -LRB- girls as well , but much worse for boys -RRB- . Replaced with a Torker Unistar - excellent alternatative !!! Initially , Amazon charged me 20 % of the cost in order to return the defective merchandise , after a scolding , they immediately refunded the restocking fee , with sincere apologies .
 My 14 year old was very excited to buy this unicycle with his own money . Was very easy to put together but within the first 2 days of riding it bolts were broken and the tube has a leak . We have bought a patch kit and it still will not hold the air . After two trips to town and replacement tubes not fitting properly it is sitting in pieces on his bedroom floor . Thanks Mongoose for wasting our time .
 this was good when i first started riding but not for long . everything on it is made out of pot metal so the threading on the crank to the pedal literally shredded off . the cranks on mine started falling off . its a nice design and i like the big wheel but trust me people , dont be sucha tight wad n get yourself something a little better or youll regret it .
 Unfortunately , the axle was damaged so we had to return it . Amazon was great with the return and now we are waiting for a new one to arrive . Hopefully this one will be in good shape ...
 I received one as a gift ; I am looking forward to using it , however it arrived with a defective tire tube and the directions were useless . A part is being shipped and the customer service was acceptable . It is also quite heavy .
 I got this for my daugther for Christmas , it came with no instrustions but we were able to put it together it was n't that hard.The probem came when she attempted to ride it . The left crank fell off , we put it back on and again it came off . So I took it to a bike shop only to be told that the crake was bad and would have to be repleaced . So I am ording another one . At this point I wish I had purchased the Unicyle at the bike shop for $ 90.00 .
 Mongoose 20-Inch Squid UnicycleI purchased this for my 9 years old son.This is heavy weight to handle.The tentacle frame 's corner hits my sons inner knees.Assemble instruction does not mention which way to put volts , where to install 4 rubber sheets.we have to wait using this when my son gets taller than 5 feet.I am going to order the different 16 `` size unicycle .
 WHY CA N'T AMAZON WORN YOU THAT THIS PRODUCT COMES IN THE MANUFACTURER 'S BOX , THAT 'S RIGHT JUST SITTING ON THE PORCH FOR MY SON TO FIND WHEN HE CAME HOME FROM SCHOOL . I AM SO MAD AND SAD , RUINED HIS CHRISTMAS , THANKS A TON !
 Somehow , my daughter has gotten it into her head that she was created to be a clown . So she 's taken up juggling and ordered this Mongoose Squid Unicycle . The Mongoose seemed the perfect starter unicycle , especially since it was less expensive . But so far my daughter has not been able to use the unicycle and will probably have to buy an entirely different one.There are a few positive things about it . My daughter was attracted to the Mongoose Squid largely because its squid design is unique , cool , and attractive . The unicycle seems sturdy , and the seat is comfortable , well-padded , and reinforced.Now comes the down side . First , the unicycle was missing its crank arms , which means my daughter could n't ride it . We tried contacting the manufacturer , who responded only slowly to our requests . They never did replace the correct crank arms , so we decided to take the unicycle to a local bike shop we respect . They told us that the crank arms for the Mongoose Squid were a different type from other crank arms and that they did n't have the parts . The guy told us that this was true for other parts on The Squid as well ; for example , the 20 inch wheel may be easier for a beginner but it 's not standard and is , as my daughter says , `` goofy . '' The bike guy suggested if we were still interested in a unicycle that we should just buy another one and start from scratch . Altogether , there were 10 pieces missing when the unicycle came , and the box was damaged.I 'm giving this unicycle 2 stars because it 's possible other people have had good experiences with it , but looking at other reviews , it looks like we 're not alone.I thought unicycling was supposed to be fun !
 he loves it but it came with two left cranks so the petals wont fit . try fixing that on christmas morning with nothing open !!! we finally found a petal that may work ... we 'll see
 I ca n't comment on the quality because I ca n't put it together . The single sheet instruction is laughable . My guess is the people having problems with this is due to bad assembly caused by the poor instructions . Customer service was very helpful though . give them a call .
 I really would give this 0 stars . It was difficult to program and it would work for 3 steps and then quit . I have returned the product . -LRB- There were 4 adults trying to get it to work -RRB- . It is awkward to use when it does work .
 I bought this pedometer hoping that it would motivate me to walk more . Needless to say , it 's been sitting on my desk since I bought it 3 weeks ago because it 's useless . It took me about 30 minutes to program it when I got it . Once I started using it , I found it was INCREDIBLY inaccurate . I would be sitting at my desk and look down and it would be counting steps . If I was walking it would count steps and add an additional 5 once I stopped . I found this pedometer to be useless .
 I had this item for about a month . It was not user friendly and the instructions were for several different kinds of pedometers so you had to weed through until you found the instructions that MIGHT be for yours . It started beeping the other day ... well , more like screeching and I couldnt get it to stop and since I was out walking I had to find something to break it open and take out the battery.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT .
 Watch is nice and the band is very good quality but the movement gains about 5 minutes every 3 days . Quality control was not as important when it came to function as it was for looks.Can be adjusted easy enough , should you have a competent jeweler that you can take it to . How many Jewelers you know out there with the tools to work on a mechanical movement ? And the pressure chamber to test for water leaks.The price is right for an Automatic watch . You should ask that it be checked for accuracy before delivery .
 If this watch is as bad as the other Invicta Women 's Automatic Pro Diver , then save your money . It began losing time within 60 days of purchase , and of course , I would have to pay a $ 25 handling fee to get it fixed . For this piece of junk , I did n't bother . Save your money and go for a more reliable brand with a better warrantee .
 I bought this for my son but within a year we began to have significant problems . The S-curves gradually fall off , and we are at the point that we want to buy a new replacement net , but unlike other companies -LRB- Louisvill Slugger for one -RRB- , Easton does not sell a replacement net . So many of the s-hooks are gone now , it has no tension . For the 80 $ + we had to pay for it , this is not worth the money . They should at least sell replacement hooks and a net . They give two stakes to anchor the pitch back to the ground , but it is not really enough . They need to give more . If you use it for anything besides a baseball -LRB- soccer for example , they say you casn I think -RRB- , the rebounder will fall off . This is my first time writing a negatvie review , annoyed enough to do so . Note other companies have pitchbacks that do not have s-hooks , they use more permanent catches that should be better .
 The scooter looks great on picture . Schwinn ventured into forgoten -LRB- in the USA -RRB- art of making push scooters with Roadster . The frame , board and stand are nice , but wheels handlebars and brake are poorly designed and crudely finished . Wheels have no ball bearings and are crooked . Handlebars are secured with two plastic bushings and the height is not adjustable . Brake is so badly made that it is useless for children as it is very hard to squeeze even for adult . One can get a Razor type scooter with ball bearings on both wheels and the steer for half the price of Roadster . On the other hand large inflated wheels make for much smoother -LRB- better for the knees -RRB- and safer -LRB- no falling over pebbles -RRB- ride.There are European push scooters that combine quality of Razor with the size of Roadster . They cost twice what Roadster does , but are worth it.It is also very hard to replace 10 '' tubing if needed . Local bicyle shops could not even special order them , but they can be mail ordered through Pacific Cycle .
 The wheels are too small on this product to make it fun for the kids . It does not roll well . It did come mostly assembled which was a plus . I never would have purchased it had we seen and tried it in a store .
 I bought two of these . both failed within 5 minutes of putting them on and heading out to ride . had a lot of time to think about this review on the walk back home . wish I could give zero stars and remove some from others .
 Just tried installing this on a fairly standard mountain bike rim . The valve stem is significantly shorter than the tube that came out of the wheel . It is also significantly shorter -LRB- by about a third of an inch -RRB- than an XLC branded thorn resistant tube I purchased for another bike.I purchased 4 of these tubes to fix 2 bikes . The stems were all the same length.Because of this , the stem does not stick out from the rim far enough to get an inflation valve head on it to inflate the tube.Other than that it seems sturdy enough and is on a par with other thorn resistant tubes I have purchased .
 If you live in an area where you can catch thorns - do yourself a favor and buy an expensive brand - like specialized , or just go tubeless -LRB- worth it if u are truly nuts with ur riding -RRB- .
 Spongy stringing makes control over shots difficult . I would n't buy this product again . The discontinued FlexPoint 160 is a far better product
 Do n't buy this piece of rubbish . I have played squash for over 20 years and this is the worst racquet by a distance . Balance is awful , it is a dead head racquet . My wrist ended up injured for weeks .
 This rifle case is thin and the zipper broke after 1 year of use . To all the prospective buyers , beware and do n't purchase this case . It is not worth the money . There 's an old saying , '' You got what you paid for . '' Please check the pictures that I included in the photo section of this case . I am very upset for spending my hard earned money to unreliable products .
 First delivery was 19 days late , after I ask about it , but that was OK , I just wanted the Gun Case . Then the topper was when I received the Case to find out it was a 37 inch and NOT the 42 inch case I had ordered . And the bottom line , I was charged the price of the 42 inch Case and not the lesser price of the 37 inch . No I will not buy from them again ...
 The web page for this scope shows the BDC reticle . I had to send mine back , no BDC reticle and no way to exchange it for the BDC .
 Scope did not come as advertised . Does not have a bullet drop compensator -LRB- BDC -RRB- reticle.Prostaff series comes in both rimfire and centerfire versions . I wonder if they are selling the rimfire version as the centerfire version of the prostaff series . Not good . The rimfire versions are set to be parallax free at 75 yards , centerfire at 150 yards . The centerfire version is also built more robustly to handle more recoil than the rimfire version.I am not pleased with the discrepancy.Will not buy from this seller again .
 Like the other reviewer , my watch turned out to be an expensive piece of junk that began losing time within 60 days . Upon doing some research , I suspect that is a common issue with these watches . Save your money and buy a watch that will actually tell the correct time .
 It was very hard to set the time and date.That was not too bad but the watch kept stopping after only running for a short time.In other words it was defective and I was forced to return it.It was a very pretty watch and my wife liked it but it was basicly unusable.If I thought the problem was only with this watch I would have exchanged it but I suspect the problem is with the basic design and/or manufacture .
 AFTER 60 DAYS OF BUYING THE WATCH STOPED WORKING . EVEN $ 5 WATCHES WORK LONGER , THEN THIS WATCH . I HOPE I 'LL BE ABLE TO RETURN IT .
 I love the look of the watch and received many compliments . However , it stopped working after 18 months . Guess I was luckier than some . Checked into the web site to find out about repairing the watch . May as well buy another watch by the time you get done paying for repairs .
 I purchased this swing , the first one that i received had a defective weaving , the cords came apart . I got a replacement , since then i have had the swing out and have barely used it , this summer when i tried to sit in it , the rope gave away and i fell down . Note that this swing was barely sat in .
 I was dissappointed with this product . It had freyed and untied hammock strings when I got it out of the box . As pricey as it originally was I expected at least a swing that was manufactured well . But this is terrible . It looked like it was n't even completely assembled !
 CONS1-this watch loses about 5-15 minutes daily -LRB- lost time increasing ; 2-has a screw-down case ; if you do n't screw it down it 's not waterproof , and it 's very difficult -LRB- sometimes impossible -RRB- to screw it down3-when adjusting the time , the date moves forward by a day , so you have to go thru the whole month to get back to `` today `` PROS1-it 's gorgeous for a diver 's watchI 'm sending it in for repair . If the company makes good I 'll report back -LRB- Note that the `` free '' repair will cost me $ 25 in S&H ; there goes the bargain ! I wish I had chosen the Pulsar.UPDATESince the watch is under warranty , I 've been calling Invicta -LRB- a long distance call -RRB- . My experience so far
 I can live with the annoying date-setting issue mentioned above , but what I can not live with is the fact that it looses anywhere from 15-20 minutes a day . For a `` quality '' watch , that is inexcusable . I purchased this nicer watch , rather than sticking with `` disposible '' watches like Timex , because it seemed that it would work well for someone with an active lifestyle , whose watches get soaked and beaten up on a daily basis . I think I should have stuck with the Timex . I am very disappointed with this purchase , and , if like the poster above , I have to shell out $ 25 to get the piece of junk fixed , I can guarantee that I will never purchase another in the future .
 Item received was not as described on Amazon . Amazon listing said `` Lures - 1/12 oz - 3/4 oz . '' The picture showed about 8 Lures with a cost of $ 47.00 , which had been reduced to $ 2.95 . I placed the order and a 5 days later received only 1 single Lure . This Lure I could have bought at Walmart for about $ 2.00 . I called the company and they blamed Amazon for making a mistake on the listing , but they have done nothing to correct it . I am unhappy and very disappointed with this company .
 OK ... like most golfers have figured out , trying to turn every swing into the same cookie-cutter swing -LRB- which unfortunately is the trademark of many teaching pros -RRB- is just not a great approach for everyone . Parts of this `` tool '' are helpful for the beginner , including the grip setter , and basic alignment , others less so.However ... to really get the clubsetter to `` click '' in the backswing , requires a backswing that for most people may be FAR too swift , encouraging a quick overall shot.Slowing the swing down , and accelerating through the swing is a far more accurate way to bring down your handicap , and control your shots -LRB- which ironically , is supported by Leadbetter in some of his more advanced videos -RRB- . Watching the pros , there are very few who have a quick backward snap in their backswings ... smooth ... tempo ... Fred Couples style is a far better backswing to emulate in my humble opinion !
 I ordered and received this item through The Golf Warehouse . It arrived and I immediately saw a defect , in that the magnetic balls would not release correectly , even with major force . I contacted the Golf Wrehouse and they told me to return the item to them . I requested a refund but they refused this saying the item showed signs of use and returned it to me . Since then I have tried to contact David Leadbetter 's organization but without any success . I am desperately unhappy about this purchase and , in particular , the after sales service.Derek Price Toronto , ON
 Nothing beats a good golf lesson , and this certainly doese n't qualify as a good learning tool or golf lesson . Infomercials are very seductive , and once again , I feel like a fool using this tool . The basics of the golf swing are not here , nor is this a strengthening tool . In principle it seems useful and one might think helpful , but it is not . Very disappointed overall . However , it makes for a good conversation piece . I am sure that David Leadbetter is a great instructor , however , this is of little help ! Do n't waste the $ , see your local pro , or ask David for a personal lesson !
 The workmanship & detailing are impeccable , but the material is so thin that I can easily read my review while holding this shirt in front of my face ! Given it 's intended use for `` Sports & Outdoor '' activities , I expected the shirt would be made from a durable fabric rather than flimsy gauze ... The camo pattern looks great , so if that 's your most-important consideration for ordering this item , then remember to use the `` delicate '' cycle on your washing machine and steer clear of briars & brambles when you 're wearing it !
 Illusion in the advert.The product is not the photos , the sights come without the bases .
 Liked the reviews , but it arrived with the front wheel fork welded visibly crooked . Help line was unavailable to take care of it when we needed them most . Disappointed in the quality control .
 We bought our daughters these for their 4th Birthday . One is this exact style and the other one is similar but the back wheel came with hubcaps . If this one had also come with hubcaps , I would give it a 5 star rating . But instead , when my daughter rides it , her ankle bone is always hitting the exposed bolt for the back wheel . It 's too uncomfortable to ride . We are looking to replace hers with the style her sister got -LRB- also Disney Princess by Huffy -RRB- . We bought both of ours at Target for $ 25 ea .
 I bought this as a practice crossbow and the string broke when putting it together . I called the company any they sent me a new string , it broke again , It 's a waste , do n't but it .
 Broke in five shots . It is junk . Lets try repeating that ... junk junk junk junk junk junk junk . Seriously , do not waste your money . Also the arrows ca n't penetrate jack .
 I bought this at a flea market and I did n't expect something amazing but i wanted something that i could shoot at a card board box as soon as I opened it the cross bow was fine but i spent 4 hours at my grandmas trying to put the string on . the string was too short and i tried my hardest to get it on and my dad helped me and was put on half way but it was tight and stayed on . i had a hard time pulling it back but i got it so i went to shoot it out side and it shot hard . it spun in mid air but it still went far . i went to pull it back again and it snapped so i am going to find a better string hopefully dont wast your money buy a gun that has a company and do n't waste your money buy a cobra crossbow pistol those are even better . if the string improved i would really like this .
 U get what you pay for ... that is all i can say really.It shoots straight for the first 5 feet but after that watch out
 The first thing I noticed after opening the box was this press is not the same as pictured on Amazon . It looks almost identical except for the turret actuator . The turret actuator pictured on Amazon is made of metal . The actuator on the press I received is made of plastic . I reload thousands of rounds and this press will not last . I 'm not surprised it only comes with a 24 month warranty.This 4 hole turret press was a real disappointment . It 's not as sturdy and accurate as a single stage press which of course will last forever.Hope this helps .
 I bought this product because my two-year-old loves to use the bouncy balls at daycare . I guess they 've gone out of style because it was very hard to find many options . The price on these seemed suspiciously low , but I decided to try it anyway . When it arrived -LRB- very quickly , by the way - excellent seller -RRB- I opened it inside my house . I immediately moved it outside because the smell was horrible ! When I picked up the ball , my fingers came away covered in awful smelling gunk . I noticed that the entire ball was covered in it . I inflated it and realized it was big enough for me , NOT a two-year-old -LRB- even though it was described as the `` small '' size - I ca n't imagine what the `` large '' looks like -RRB- . I washed it with soap and sprayed it with a high-powered hose and it still smelled and felt disgusting ! I guess this is what we get when we allow companies to outsource to the lowest bidder , in countries with no product quality standards , and questionable materials .
 Photo and description were inadequate . Hose connector was wrong size and therefore unusable on my pump .
 Zeal Blasts were a good choice for MTB protective eyewear . I give the lowest rating to punish Zeal for pulling these frames AND the replacement lenses from their product line - unforgiveable & unsustainable in this day & age . I e-mailed and called to find if I could get replacements anywhere but they could n't be bothered to reply - poor attitude - avoid .
 It was impossible trying to verify the information for this product and it 's compatibility with the Magellan products since I was receiving conflicting information from Magellan . I eventually ordered the item and when it arrived , it was not what was advertised . I received an SD Card and the item was advertised as a Micro SD Card . I soon discovered that the SD Card was blank and had no data on it . The only good thing I can say about this purchase is that Amazon quickly refunded my money .
 cheap product and uncertain attachment . It also rattles on the spoke and only has a secure attachment surface in one spot . Wo n't use for long .
 I bought 7 of these for charity . They seemed like they were decent quality , but 3 of the 7 were missing parts -LRB- pedals , bolt for the seat -RRB- . The missing parts were n't major , but you 'd need to send the entire bikes back to get them which is a pain , so I 'd stay away .
 This is not a good product . The Construction is not very good , and the instructions would have been better written in Chinese , they make no sense at all . I tried their website , and that was n't any help . My suggestion
 Product comes with minimal instructions , which forced me to go to youtube for help . The plastic piece holding the reed split in half during the 2nd week of use . I 'll be contacting Primos since they claim a lifetime guarentee . I would n't buy this product again and I 'm not paying for shipping if Primos wants to ship me the piece at my cost . I 'm looking into the Illusion Extinguisher . I found a 30 minute video on youtube which was great !!! Product reviews here are good too : -RRB-
 I purchased this jersey and it began to fall apart after only 2-3 washes . The white numerals were what came off .
 I was very excited to buy this product . When it came I ran water through it and it worked great . The seal on the liquid storage is not built into the lid . I do not know why . Maybe for cleaning reasons ? The seal never felt right . I filled the device with whiskey and coke for the golf course and drove to the course . When I went to retrieve the device from my trunk I realized it had leaked everywhere . Nothing like a suv wreaking of Jim Beam . Basically I had great expectations but was let down by the seal .
 The mask constantly leaks water and does not seal properly around the face . I would not recommend buying this mask .

 This coloring book is such a waste . It has very few pages , the illustrations are terrible , and it has very little to do with martial arts . Absolutely do not waste any money on buying and having this shipped to you . I was so disappointed .
 The mask constantly leaks water and does not seal properly around the face . I would not recommend buying this mask .
 This saddle is comfortable , no question about that . But after less than a year of riding maybe 10 miles a week , the fabric is worn through . I re-covered it with duct tape ... but at $ 30-40 a saddle should last much longer before reaching the duct-tape stage .
 While these socks were cosy they were completely unusable for skiing as I could not pull them up under my boots without cutting off my circulation ! I am a size 14 - with average legs - I think - and these were impossible - had to wear them folded down .
 Had this a couple of years now , sure wish I had bought this from a place I could have returned it to . If you need reading glasses like I do , you will need them to read the display as the the digits of data other than the heart rate are very tiny . And then the heart rate reading displays `` 0 '' half the time . Just changed both batteries yesterday and right in the middle of a vigerous workout it stopped displaying heart rate . Put on my wife 's $ 19 Polar from Big 5 and got a steady reading for the rest of the ride.A plus is that it does provides average HR , althought for what good with only part of the workout active -LRB- do n't think the 0 readings are included -RRB- . On the down side
 The heartrate monitor function on this watch did n't work right out of the box . I tried everything , even replacing the battery in the transmitter and could n't get the watch to recognize my heart rate or anyone elses . Amazon was great about taking the watch back but what a pain . This is the second x3hr I have ordered that has been defective . The first one was not from Amazon however and the screen froze then the battery died the day after I received it . These watches seem like a bargain for all of the functions they have , but they also seem to be unreliable .
 It arrived in good condition . However , difficult to use and can not seem to get the Heart Rate Monitor working properly in spite of doing all of the diagnostic tests .
 This watch has been a total waste of money . The temperature and altitude features are completely inaccurate and the heart rate monitor only reads part of the time . I would strongly recommend purchasing a different watch .
 Very disappointed . Watch was worn to office job and not stressed with immersion or hard use . Required a new battery after only 6 months . Then went through 3 more batteries in only 2 months . The last battery lasted only a week .
 i bought the first one 3 years ago , and they replaced it after one year , suddenly stop working , the second one lasted almost 9 months , then failed too , and they replaced , the third one lasted 9 months and is going bad and i ran out of warranty , never dropped them or submerged in water , i treated my watch very gently , but is the quality of the product , keep away from this brand , when it worked it was accurate and i like it but they are disposable watches no longer than a year . they should be like a 20 dollar watch for the time they last .
 This is my third Altimeter watch , my original Suunto ran like a champ for years until finally giving up 3 years ago . I then went to a Highgear , more accurate than mu original Suunto . When the face of my Highgear came apart for no reason , I returned it to REI and bought the X3HR.Negative - display items too small and often hard to read ; it is strictly a secondary altimeter due to the small atitude display , by backlight quit working after 3 months.Positive - Smaller and less geeky than other altimeter watches
 The pedometer arrived in a zip bag . It looks like a used or returned item by previous customer -LRB- s -RRB- . Returning it .
 Had to return it ! It wo n't operate unless registered at a site that closed 2 years ago . No mention of this anywhere until you try and log on .
 This is the second time that I bought a Sportbrain pedometer . . and both times they went out of business -LRB- or at least discontinued their website that made it work -RRB- . I had hoped that when they resurrected they would stay viable , but that did not happen . It was a nice product while they existed , but since they are not longer viable -LRB- again -RRB- you should pull this product from your site . Why offer a product that is useless ?
 I am not happy with my SportBrain pedometer at all . When I went to the website to load the program , the website was no longer working . Now , I 'm stuck with a useless pedometer !!!
 Requires to be linked to a website that does not exist anymore . The thing is totally junk and is an utter waste of money . Dont make the mistake I did . AVOID !!!!
 This product requires website activation - the website is no longer viable . Useless - have tried to get around it by going to sites that upload data from the device but without the primary site activation , it wo n't communicate . What company would ever design a product that would n't work without online registration ? What if I did n't want to use their site to monitor ? Very disappointed .
 I have used a variety of pedometers . This one fails with me for a very strange reason . The damn thing keeps falling off the belt . Doese n't matter what you use to secure it or the type of clothing , belt you are wearing , if you bend over it falls to the floor . Something that you ca n't count on staying on your body can not count your level of activity .
 Sportbrain is now out of business ! This pedometer does not work if it is not registered at their website , which does not exist anymore ! Do n't waste your money .
 Sport Brain web site stopped working and pedometer stopped counting steps after few days . Pedometer can be replaced but web site still does not work and one can not download daily accomplishment . I am returning pedometer and not recommending product.Actually I would like to give NO STAR if it was possible .
 I have been using the sportbrain pedometer for several years ... and I LOVED it so much . Towards the end of July 2011 , the website became un-available . Without the website , the pedometer is actually even less useful than any old digital pedometer because after about a week , if you do n't connect to the website and uploade the data/clear the memory , it stops counting steps ... and the only way to re-set it is to take the battery out and put it back in . I miss my sportbrain pedometer ... and I will keep checking back to see if the site ever comes back up ... but I ended up investing in a FitBit , and I am VERY happy with the unit , it is accurate , it has a free website that gives you tons of data , and it also has a food log with widgets for setting goals . I have also used the BodyBugg for about 6 months , but the arm band caused atrophy in my tricept , and it took about a year to heal . That , coupled with the expense of the subscription to the bodybugg website , caused me to opt for the FitBit ... -LRB- FitBit 's website is VERY comparable to bodybugg 's , in that it not only provides you w / stats and data ... but it has a weight management tool for tracking calories , consumption vs output ... very helpful for staying on track ... Actually ... if you are addicted to data ... FitBit offers alot more than either sportbrain or bodybugg ... it 's REALLY COOL -RRB- So ... if you are thinking of buying the sportbrain pedometer , please check -LSB- ... -RSB- to verify that the website is , in fact , down ... before spending the money on it ... If the website were working I would recommend it to EVERYONE ... because it was AWESOME ... but with out the website ... it 's useless ... and there are other options out there . . that may be a little more expensive that the sportbrain , but they do give you ALOT of functionality above what sportbrain offered ... These tools and toys are so cool and motivating ... I 'm just so glad I found another option ...
 I purchased a very similar iStep X2 around a year and a half ago . It worked great , as described by other reviewers , with a fairly accurate step count , good upload capability , and many more features than I ever needed.However , the initial unit died within the first 6 months , and the warranty replacement died at about one and a half years . At this point SportBrain is saying since it only has a 1 year limited warranty they wo n't repair it , replace it , nor sell me a refurbished unit at a discount.If you are happy with having to replace it every year or two its a good product , but I expect a bit more longevity out of my purchases . The warranty is not listed for this product but I would guess that it is also only 1 year .
 I loved this pedometer and have worn it for years ! Apparently the company has gone out of business and now my pedometer is worthless . It only holds so many steps before you have to upload it to their website and it clears it . No website = inability to clear the memory . Well , not necessarily , I suppose I could remove the battery , but this is not why I spent this much money on a pedometer ! So disappointed !
 I 've been using sportbrain pedometers since 2003 , of various types . They have been enormously helpful in tracking my exercise goals for walking . Availability of their website is crucial . Until recently , I 'd have given them at least 4 stars , despite the slow response to problems -LRB- which have to be reported on their website -RRB- . WARNING : in the last few months , the website has been down a lot , sometimes for storing data , sometimes for looking at the data . I 've not been able to store data or look at it for several days . If something is n't fixed soon , my pedometer will stop displaying steps - they need to be cleared regularly . And I 'll have to use something else .
 Making a pedometer that can talk to your computer and all the other fancy tricks that SportBrain put into this Pedometer are pointless if the damn thing wo n't stay on your belt . Walking is fine , but if you bend over , twist , turn , go to bathroom the pedometer falls off your belt and goes flying across the room . The frustration index is quite high . How can the thing count your steps if it wo n't stay on you ?
 Too heavy for my 28 month old , very strong grand daughter . Would have been better off with a lighter weight plastic bike . Definately not worth the price . One fall , not very serious , but the weight of the bike on her leg scared her .
 We bought my daughter and son regular 12 '' bikes and left off the pedals and training wheels . They scooted around for a few weeks and when we put the pedals on , my daughter took off like a pro . -LRB- My son has autism and it 's taking him a little longer , but his balance is getting REALLY good -RRB- So ... can someone explain to me why anyone would want to spend 80-100 dollars on one of these `` balance '' or `` skuut '' bikes when you can spend $ 50 at Walmart for a regular 12 '' bike that they can eventually RIDE for real ? If I had bought one of these balance or Skuut bikes , I 'd have to go buy a regular bike 3 weeks later anyway . You can do this for lots cheaper . Sorry . I do n't get it .
 I bought this item thinking that it will sharpen my hook , but it end up just eating my tip without sharpening .
 I bought this thing a couple of weeks ago . This device does not sharpen the hooks .
 Ok , so they are cheap . Ok , they are also painful . I am just rolling my pantlegs up for now . It 's not worth wearing these . I 'll wear them in the winter though . I have n't tried any other metal cycling bands so maybe most are painful . I do n't know . I would probably buy the soft kind -LRB- velcro or whatever -RRB- if I had it to do over again even though they are not as convenient for slipping on and off as these . Another benefit of these is that I wo n't be heartbroken if I lose them .
 Amazon item description states this item is a DIGITAL SCALE !! IT IS NOT !!! It is only a device to hold fish and to measure length NOT WEIGHT , though the item description states `` Digital scale weighs lbs and oz , or kilograms . '' Very unhappy :-LRB- RETURNING ITEM FOR REFUND !!!
 Talk about an upset , when I attempted to install this on the bottom bracket of a mountain bike for my front derailleur shift cable , it did not fit in the hole at the base of my bottom bracket shell , i shaved a few bits off the plug to make it fit using a razor knife , when I finally got it to work ; the cable , when used to shift , caused the guides stopper , the two cross bars in the picture , to fail which means the cable tore right through the stopper and made this thing essentially useless.But thats what you get when you spend a dollar for something I suppose .
 The performance and usability of this watch simply do not justify its price tag .1 . The HRM function is n't reliable . My $ 30 unbranded HRM maintains a better wireless connection to the chest strap . Occasionally the X6HR measures false heart rate spikes up to 190 . Occasional drop outs or false spikes are not a problem for a simple HRM , but a real pain when you 're using the X6HR to record over time , as it screws up heart rate statistics .2 . The buttons are too ` mushy ' . It 's hard to tell when a button has been properly pressed .3 . The software the comes with the watch is clunky and ugly.Overall , if you are looking at the X6HR , look at the Polar AXN500 .
 I have now had two of these watches fall apart on me in under 6 yrs . The latest lasting only 16 months . It was bought as a replacement from Suunto . All they can offer it another replacement at a cost of 266euro and no description of why it is not repairable . Think carefully before you spend you hard earned money on a suunto product . Teir customer service system is very hard to deal with if it is not a standard problem . They do not care about their customers .
 Piss me off . damn thing did n't ship w / a USB connector like it says it does & cant use the damn thing , after paying over $ 500 for it . Since I am in Iraq , I can not send it back . GREAT . RIPOFFS !!!!
 Description appears to be Suunto X6HRM -LRB- M is for Metal -RRB- , but the item shipped is in fact Suunto X6HR . I sent it back asking for the good item -LRB- which cost me 80 , more than 100 $ -RRB- and I had a refund.Thanks a lot it cost me a lot for ... nothing.I will surely order again .
 I received my Elliptical Trainer 24 Sept 2007 . The box was not damaged in any way at all . When I opened the box I found there were NO INSTRUCTIONS NOR WARRENTY FOR THE ITEM . Also when trying to remove the base from the bottom of the box I found that the round section was misaligned . Considering we paid mega $ $ $ for this item , there should be instructions and a warrenty encluded.Disappointed in the item . Now what?Carol
 I 'm a cyclist , and after researching watches for a couple of weeks , the X6 seemed like the perfect product to track accumulated elevation gain and degree of slope . Unfortunately , the watch has some serious flaws that hinder its usefulness.First , elevation gain
 Both of the .17 HMR and the .22 , that I bought , broke off while pulling them through the bore . NOT GOOD HOPPES !
 The cord broke the first time i attempted to run it thru my savage 17 mach 2 . Do n`t waste your money on this .
 it doesent fit , or at least not thick enough to really clean the AK47 bore , even when fully soaking it in cleaner and fully dry it goes through but not tight enough feel to really clean or pull all the crap from the barrell , at least doesent feel that way , comes out very very easily .
 Please do not purchase this for a 22 caliber rifle . The brass weight is not heavy enough to get the string started through the barrel . I saw all the other reviews and this product looked good . Not for 22 caliber and I bet the same problem with .177 caliber . I purchased the 22 caliber size . I thought it would be good for quick clean after shooting . For a 22 caliber rifle it was an exercise in frustration to get it to feed through -LRB- ever try pushing string ?? -RRB- . My son and I both tried numerous times and got it through once . He was holding the gun and I was trying to feed it through , then I tried it alone too . We had the barrel pointed downward and tried numerous times to get it through . What a waste . Get a rod and some patches or make your own patches from cut up flannel . Sorry I wasted the money . Not worth the hassle !!!!
 The Hoppe 's .17 Hornady Magnum Rimfire -LRB- HMR -RRB- BoreSnake is too large for a .17 HMR rifle . WAY TOO THICK ... Instead use a Tipton 's 36 '' carbon rod with patches . I previously purchased two Hoppe 's BoreSnakes for my .22 Match LR and .223 bolt . These works great -- Tight enough to clean barrel while wrapping snake around hand and pulling hard . On the range a boresnake quickly return weapon to sub MOA shooting . This .17 boresnake will be used with Butch 's oil and a couple .17 patches for field cleaning otherwise it is a waste of money .
 First I had to shake the barrel up and down for the weight attached to the line would come out the other end of the barrel.Then I had to rap the line around my feet , and pull on the barrel to get this thing out . Maybe I should have used a little oil to make it easier.I will not use it again.Pat . B
 After reading all the great reviews of the Bore Snake , I was very excited about it . The problem is the pull string is way too fat to drop through the bore.I tied some fishing line to the weight and was able to pull it through . After it was through , it worked great . But that 's a bigger hassle than using regular old rods and brushes.It would probably be great on a larger bore , but on my .223 s , it 's just not workable .
 I have used Boresnakes for years for my handguns and rifles , of all calibers . Except , until now , .22 LR.I managed to get it about 1/4 of the way into the bore , but it would n't budge any further . The nylon leader began to break , so I ` backed it out ' and took it back to the vendor -LRB- not Amazon.com -RRB- . You might have a different experience in .22 LR , but this was just a tight squeeze , and I 'll stick with the cleaning rod , pull through , jag and patches.In other calibers these work fine , but they should be thoroughly washed with every use , or else you 're just dragging old junk through the barrel again .
 I purchased the .22 / .223 size and it will not fit in a .22 nor .223 barrel . Stick with a cleaning rod kit
 PRODUCT DOES NOT FIT WILL NOT PULL THROUGH . RECIEVED AS A GIFT . . THANK GOD ... IF I HAD WASTED MY OWN MONEY ON THIS CRAP I WOULD HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY MORE PISSED OFF THAN I ALREADY WAS . GO GET A REAL CLEANING KIT
 I want get the easy way to clean my rifle . my it is too small for 7.62 / 303 and 308
 I should have bought a rod and brush . The snake can not be used on my pump air rifle because you can not remove or insert the long weight through the breach opening . On my break barrel air rifle , it is so tight that I am afraid the string attaching the weight to the snake is going to break off . I used it -LRB- .177 -RRB- on my 22 rim fire long rifle and pistol . It was snug and cleaned those well .
 Bought the .17 HMR bore snake and it would not even fit into the barrel . Total waste of $ 16.00 and shipping . I have bore snakes in .223 and .308 that I really like alot and are great products , but the one I got for my .17 will not even fit into the barrel.Brandon
 I have one of these for my .357 magnum revolver and that 's fine . It does a reasonable job and is way faster that brushes and patches.I bought another for a .22 rifle and it was a disaster . As other reviewers have mentioned , it 's difficult to get the weight to pass through the barrel - it 's not heavy enough and too close to the diameter of the barrel . So close , in fact , that I managed to get it lodged in the barrel - would n't fall through & could n't pull it out . I called a gunsmith and he laughed . Apparently I 'm not the only one to have this experience.If it happens to you , you might try the fix he suggested - put a small rubber stopper in the muzzle and fill the bore with copper solvent overnight . That softened up the brass enough that I could drive it out with a squib rod.Needless to say I would never use this again for a .22
 I ordered this so I could move . I received a notice 4 months after I moved that the product was shipping . I never saw this arrive .
 This case is flimsy plastic with thin aluminum edges . Mine came dented , and two of the little rivets had snapped off prior to my using it . Save your money and look somewhere else .
 It 's just OK . I do not like the triple front door arrangement at all . Trying to close it back up and get the side flaps to line up is an issue . The clasps are cheap . If you want to use the scope holder , you better have a straight scope as one with an angled eye piece will not tuck in on closing , as there is a divider in the middle of the case . The gun holder is just foam that does not hold the guns very securely at all . Save your money and buy a used Gun-ho or Pachmayr or a new Strong Case . I 'd like to sent it back , but since it had free shipping , the terms and conditions say I 'd have to pay that as well as the cost to send it back .
 I 've been wearing Timex watches for running for at least the past 15 years . I 've been using a Timex Heart Rate Monitor watch , a data recorder and this GPS Speed and Distance sensor for the past four years . Unfortunately , I 've been very frustrated with Timex because the watches have repeatedly stopped working for no good reason and now the GPS Speed and Distance sensor has stopped working . I just received another Heart Rate Monitor replacement because it 'd stopped working so I 'm not going to go through the trouble of replacing this latest breakdown . When it 's worked , it 's been ok , not great , just ok . The thing that 's upset me is that I have n't been able to share my data with anyone on the web like everyone is able to do with other similar units . Also , the software for recording the data has n't been updated in years , it 's almost as if Timex just decided to stop trying to compete with Garmin and Polar.I just wish I had n't made the mistake of sticking with Timex all these years , it 's been frustrating ...
 It takes a long time to locate a signal . Once it finds a signal it works fine ; however , it does lose it 's signal every once in a while which is a bit frustrating . Not real excited about the product at the time .
 This hat is on the thin side for a major name but most importantly it is very small in size even though it is marked LG/EX LG IMHO ...
 it has been over a month and i still have not received my tent . with no reply on how long it 's gon na be till i receive it .
 This ball is inferior to other products of the same size . The material is weaker and therefore if you are a bit heavier than average the ball does not maintain it 's shape . That is to say taht you can not do situps as it becomes too `` flat '' . I tried inflating it more until I could not inflate it any moer and it still flattens out when you sit on it . I previously purchased a 95cm ball by Physioball -LRB- like the one I had been using in Physical Therapy -RRB- and it did not flatten when sat upon . I had no problem with the ball -LRB- until the cat puntured it -RRB- . I do NOT recomend this ball if you are overweight . Look for one which is a bit pricier as they seem to be made of a better -LRB- thicker perhaps -RRB- material . If I had the paper work I would return this ball !!
 the darts that arrived are not as pictured . The shafts and flights are black not silver as pictured . The case is it was sent in was cheap , the parts were jumbled about and do not fit well . The case is notihing like pictured , twice the size , not padded , no o rings inside and darts must be disassembled to fit . Very dissapointing . Will return .
 Why are people reviewing cones and flags when the product is a basketball rim attachment , I was thinking about ordering it but now I do n't know what I 'll get .
 First one fell apart early in fishing season . The gripper came loose from the handle/scale part . Fortunately , all the pieces fell in the boat . I returned it to Berkley and got a replacement . After a couple of months use , the second one started to give wrong weights . I would n't recommend this unit .
 ACTUALLY I 'M NOT ABLE TO GIVE AN HONEST REVIEW ON THE ENTIRE PRODUCT BECAUSE IT FILLED UP WITH RAIN WATER THE FIRST TIME I WENT OUT IN THE BOAT.I NEVER ACTUALLY GOT TO USE THE GRIPPER . WHAT I CAN SAY IS THE BATTERIES GOT FILLED WITH WATER AND THE DIGITAL SCALE FAILED TO WORK ON THE FIRST TIME OUT.AVOID THIS PRODUCT . I RETURNED MINE .
 This was to be the bed for my 3 1/2 year old grandson . When it was time for him to go to sleep it was almost entirely deflated . It had been blown up a few hours before . We inflated it again and by morning he was on the floor . I would NOT recommend this mattress . It is going back to Amazon .
 bought htis for limited use , camping , I am kind and careful of my gear.I used this for three nights , good news it blows up in seven minutes with the hand pump.Bad news it had several slow leaks that got worse every night , by the the thrid night I had to pump it up twice while trying to sleeep.amazon will pay shipping back , so it goes back and I will try another model .
 air bed has several pin hiles and will not stay inflated . the cost to return is almost as much as the purchase price . the air bed is useless to me , and I 'll never make another similar purchase .
 Bought it 2 months ago for in-door usage , thought it 'd last until the end of the semester.After less than a couple of weeks of normal everyday usage , punctures started to appear , and the patches that came along with the package did n't help much.Even though the design and the built-in manual pump is a big plus , the quality is very disappointing .
 I bought 2 one only lasted a week before it leaked then the seam split around the pump . The company sent a new one but they do n't seem to hold up .
 The pump was n't what I was expecting . Time consuming to inflate and difficult to deflate .
 In an emergency evacuation , there are a lot of things that you can scrap along without , but water is not one of them . The Center for Disease Control recommends 1 gal/day/person of drinking water . FEMA and the American Red Cross both recommend a minimum of 2 qts/day/person . I checked Mayday 's website - the packets included here are 4.225 ounces each , or a little over 8 oz/day/person . If you were n't in an emergency situation when you started using this kit , you certainly would be after having 1 small glass of water a day for 3 days.The 2400 calorie bar is 6 3 oz bars of wheat flour , soy flour , and fat with added vitamins and minerals - you eat 2 per day or 800 cal/day . With any luck your 2 water packets would at least be enough to wash the bar down . Maybe .
 This kit contains a lot of cheaply made items that wo n't be worth anything should a survival situation arise . Yes the cheap flashlight , `` first aid kit '' -LRB- which is a few finger bandaids -RRB- and tent/ponchos , utility knife , should be of use for a very short time . I do like the water and high calorie food bars , but the rest of the items I should 've bought elsewhere that will last me longer than the chinese crap sent with this kit .
 Terrible battery life , light does n't illuminate well , settings are not intuitive . Although this watch may seem like a good deal , there are better quality watches out there for the same price .
 The sign was smaller than I thought it would be and its very flimsy plastic . Would not purchase again thats for sure ...
 I just received this gift I bought for my nephew , two days before Christmas . The ` Cowboys ' sign is all scratched and looks secondhand . It would be ok if I ordered a used product . The edges look like crap , as if someone cut the sign in their garage . Considering there is an official nfl logo on the back , I would expect something to look fresh out of the package . I hope my nephew does n't think I bought this at a garage sale . Last time I buy from this seller ...
 The sign came just as described , but was scratched up terribly when I recieved it . Since it 's was for a gift it is useless .
 Took these hearing protectors to the range the day after I received them . They looked nice and had a slim profile . Too bad they did little to lessen the hurt to my ears from the rifle percussion . Tried adjusting them every which way , but no avail . Went back to my old ear protectors so I could finish my shooting . Save your money and apply it to a better set of hearing muffs .
 They precut the housing in to uselessly short lengths that wo n't fit most bikes . Do n't get halfway through your cable change and realize they 've screwed you like me .
 I have not found any materiel that is really waterproof except rubber . That includes gore-Tex . My feet were moist after using for only 1 hr in semi wet conditions .
 These are not bad wading socks other than the fact they will start smelling really bad after about the third or fourth use . I wash them regularly after each use also to no avail . They retain a horrible mildew stink no matter how long you soak them . I would not reccoumend just because of this problem . I am a clean person and wash all my clothes regularly and can not believe how horrible these socks stink .
 I used these socks once for a ten mile run in snow . By the middle of the run my feet were sloshing from the acculumated sweat . When I took them off , I could literally squeeze water out of the socks . Not only that , after one use they smelled that something had died in them.Don ' t depend on these for long sporting activities .
 They are not waterproof at all -LRB- well they do n't leave the water get out in fact -RRB- . . i bought them for canyoning . . water came in and them i have to walk with an extra pound of water in my shoes . . do n't buy this .
 This is a really flawed concept . The problem is that even if they do happen to work they do not release sweat . So your feet maybe water free but what good is that if your foot is soaked in sweat . If this were n't enough water does come through the fabric .
 these people are horrible i orderd wool socks and they sent me nylon and i paid more money for wool nylon would have been cheaperit says odor proof on the box almost every day i got a complain that they smelli wash them and the same day they smell they have a horrible odor that comes
 Bought 3 pairs of these in 3 sizes for me , wife , & mother . Took them on a 4-day rafting trip w / light/moderate rapids . Even on the lightest day , our feet were still soaking wet & cold by the end . Tried 'em with cuff below and above wetsuit -- did n't work in any configuration . Great idea -- just does n't work .
 I have 2 pair of gloves , 4 pair of socks . Out of the 12 items only 1 is water proof . If you only dip it in water for a second it will be water proof , anything over 1 second it is going to leak . I wear the socks under my water shoes while I get into my kayak , I am in water just below my ankle for about 3 seconds , that all it takes to make them leak . They seem to be ok for a few wearings but after that-wet feet . Same for the gloves .
 Far too many poles and bits and pieces to set it up!Took the beach on first day , took it out of the box and realized it was going to take forever for 2 of us to set up . Had to pack it back up and return it .
 this leaks ... accuracy is horrible even with .2 malfunctionslist of common malfunctions -LRB- I HAD TO RETURN THIS GUN 3 TIMES -RRB- first stage of trigger does not work . you must pull back hammermagazine ... must take out each time and put back in to fire a roundAll around crappy DO NOT BUY THIS !
 I bought both the Ark III and the Super Ark. . The Super Ark is a slight improvement over the Ark III but I would never recommend people buy either one . There are far better entry-level kits , for just a few dollars more , available from other sources.The Ark III contains 24 oz . of water , a food bar , and a small , inexpensive emergency blanket in a Kleenex-sized cardboard box . I 'll use the products in the two kits to supplement the emergency kits I subsequently purchased.I 'm surprised - and disappointed - Amazon carries these products .
 Opened it to check out items and manufactured date was 1992 . Waste of money . Threw everything out but blanket . Should have contacted seller but had already thrown away receipt .
 The stain color of the cabinet does not match the picture on the Internet . It is much darker than it appears . Almost more like a chocolate brown . I mean other than that it appears to be OK . I was hoping to have it match the color of the other furniture downstairs .
 I bought this for my son 's room and thought it was a very cute idea . For the price I paid for it I think it should have been a little sturdier . It is cheaply made and all you are paying for is the Texans logo . How ever with some wood glue and brads my husband was able to reinforce it a little better .
 Our Paha Que Promontory tent arrived this week and we set it up as recommended . What a disappointment . We found the set up instructions less than helpful . They tell you how to deal with the 2 poles but nothing more . It took us at least a half hour to figure out how it all went together . Needless frustration when a few more instructions would have answered the questions . We were 2 stakes short and one of the snaps on the rain fly broke when we were taking it down . The divider fastens in the four corners and the top and is little more than a screen . There is only one small pocket on the tent wall which may hold a pair of glasses and you have to choose whether you use the loft or the room divider as both can not be up at the same time . The floor looks to be everything they claim but the rest of it does n't warrant the price . Buy a cheap tent and you at least know what you 're getting .
 Wore it very lightly for about 18 months . I have about 10 watches from cheap solar casios to a Ball `` Engineer . '' Story : So I think it needs a new battery . I have it replaced . Still seems funny , but I do n't get around to looking at it . SO I finally send it in 2 months after the warranty runs out . Tissot -LRB- Swatch -RRB- wants 200.00 to fix . WOuld not say whats wrong , just 200.00 . SO I guess every 2-3 years they keep wanting to charge you 200 for your watch . Their web page even says this . 3-5 years full service , 200.00 . Sheesh ca n't by anything nice now . Do n't by Tissot .
 I have not had this screen this screen tent working for an entire season since I purchased it . A pole broke during the first season and a simple warranty replacement has now dragged on for three years . After shipping my poles cross country several times I was mailed back ; 1 -RRB- One pole that was the wrong size . 2 -RRB- 2 pole that had the same visible construction flaws 3 -RRB- Two poles over a foot short.In three years PaHa Que was unable to send me one `` NEW '' pole.The following is my suggestion if you want a high quality tent from a company thatEureka ! Northern Breeze - Screen House
 This bag was for my fiance . But he has been unable to fit his ball in it ! No where does it say that it only holds a undersized ball only . Now the bag is waiting to be returned . Terrble advertisement , terrible purchase
 The caps I received did not have a hex head hole in the middle of the cap . Mine have a long slot for removal with a large flat screw driver or a coin . Not as nice in my opinion as the hex head , but probably less prone to stripping . I 'd return them except that they were so cheap .
 I will say this , the company shipped this item extremely quickly which was a plus . My only issue is I received the item in two pieces . It was snapped in half when I pulled it out of the envelope so I had to throw it away . I think I 'll order a metal one next time .
 I can not review this product because I never received it . I have sent emails to the company but as of now they are not sending me another License Plate .
 First off I want to say that I loved parts of this tent . LOVED it . I was so excited for it . I have been camping all of my life and my husband used to work for Eastern Mountain Sports so we did a TON of research before buying this screenroom . We were so excited when it came we went right out to set it up . We had watched the video on their website so we felt informed on the set-up . Well , before we even got it all the way up one of the roof poles snapped . Now we have probably set up at least 20 different tents between the two of us , so I would say that we are fairly knowledgeable in tent set up and how poles need to be all the way together . I was so bummbed but when I contacted Jason at Paha Que he said they do n't usually have problems with poles but if I sent the pole back they would fix it fast and send it back in plenty of time before my first camping trip 4 weeks later . 3 weeks later I contacted Jason again just to make sure it would be back in time for our trip . I am not sure where it was in the process but he said he would put a rush on it so it would come in time . It came the morning of our trip and I wanted to set it up to make sure we knew how to do it before we got to our campsite ... we are nerds like that ! We set it up just fine ... I loved the light colors and the vertical walls.I was really paranoid about the poles at this point though . So I took a really good look at them . They are good aluminum but it seems really thin for the size of the tent -LRB- My husband says they look like the poles on the old style lawn chairs -RRB- . Also the part where one pole slips into another is not at all reinforced . When it 's set up there is only one clip on the lower end of the corners so the poles bow out quite a bit on the top half.So mostly satisfied with the tent and also with the set up of it ... although a little difficult , we start to take it down . I had one corner , my husband the other and we lifted together to get them out of the grommets . There was a loud snap and I said I bet another pole broke ! One of the cross beams was broken . I was heartbroken ! I loved this tent.I called Jason at Paha Que and was basically told it was our fault and that their poles and tents are the best on the market and they never have any problems with them breaking . Which is a lie because I have found reviews where people have had problems with broken poles . I felt he was very argumenative . Finally he said they would take the tent back and do a whole new pole set because maybe there was something wrong with the poles.Well we went on our camping trip , without a screenroom and when we got back I took the tent to UPS to send it back . Well UPS said it would be $ 110 because it was oversized . I was confused because it only cost $ 30 to send it out and they said that corperate accounts get a better deal because of volume . He said to contact the company and see if they will schedule a pick up.After this I let some time go by because it was the hight of summer at this point and we were very busy . We camp about every other weekend . So it was August by the time I got back to the Tent and called Jason . At this point he had forgotten about me and the story of the tent poles . So I went over it all again and he was again very argumenative and insisted that we broke the poles because we did n't set the tent up right . Now he does n't even want to replace the poles . I finally was able to talk to the owner and said `` I do n't want to walk away from this mad . I loved the tent but it broke , I would still consider Paha que in the future for our next family tent '' . He was VERY nice and said he would take the tent back and also refund shipping because of the hassle . So we arranged for a pick up of the tent.That was in August . I kept an eye on my account for the refund . When it still had n't come by the end of October I was starting to get worried . I contacted them in early November to see what was happening with it . Jason said he was sorry for the delay and he would refund my money minus a 15 % restocking fee and no shipping . I contacted him again and went over the WHOLE story again . I did n't return it because I did n't like it ... I returned it because it was BROKEN ! He insisted again that it was totally our fault and we should be lucky they took it back at all . So I reminded him what Jeff the owner had promised me and asked if he could consult with Jeff because I really do n't want to walk away from this unhappy . I had already paid $ 20 to ship the poles back the first time . Jason said he was talking to Jeff and they would refund the total amount minus shipping and we should be greatful for that . I felt like I had to argue at every step and defend ourselves against someone who thought we were idiots for breaking a pole when I know we set it up exactly how the video said.So Bottom Line I am out $ 50 on a tent I do n't even own , not to mention all the hassle and not having a screenroom for half the summer . -LRB- I finally ended up buying a Eureka with MORE features , sturdier poles and better flaps to keep the rain out . It is darker fabric though which is a bummer . -RRB- Be VERY cautious when working with this company . All it would have taken to make me happy was $ 30 and they could n't do it . I will never buy from this company again . I would rather go to EMS or Cabela 's where if you have a problem , they will take it back with making you feel like an idiot . Also I got the refund two days after the last call . Not sure what happened during the previous two months or if I had n't stayed on top of it if I would have gotten a refund at all .
 bought it for a weekend event . Poles broke and we were without a shelter . . going back in the box and being returned . Very disappointed
 I paid almost $ 8 for one shirt ? I thought I would get more then one and I guess that was my fault on not knowing how many items you get when you buy from Stitch with us . I tried to return it and you only get about 4 in return . Im not happy with this company or the shirt at all . I will not make this mistake again . I would have kept the shirt if I would have known I wasnt getting a full refund ! I would have given less then 1 star but it 's not possible !
 I needed a cool , 100 % - cotton T-shirt to wear while working out . That 's how Amazon described this product
 This is the only Haynes T-shirt that does not bunch at the back of the neck . It is light and drapes well . But it is too light for printing .
 after about 6 wears of these t-shirts -LRB- worn under dress shirt0 , both collars started to fray w / cotton ballsnot a good deal , unless that 's the look you want
 As thin as paper , flimsy , ill-fitting , and NOT 100 % cotton as listing states . The size was way off , too . If you want a tee that 's so thin it 's practically see-through , this is the one for you . Better get several , though . I do n't expect it to survive a wash .
 Heavyweight ? It it the thinest t-shirt I own . Makes me wonder what a normal Hanes t-shirt is like .
 when I received these shirts they ask that instead of giving them a poor review to contact them . So I did and it was ignored.They never bothered getting back to me . Also these shirts fade pretty quick for a 50/50 blend
 The shirt looks comfy , but it is not &#34; teal &#34; as it says int he description . I am pretty disappointed , actually .
 The print on the inside of the neck gets itchy after a few washes as the ink cracks . Will not buy them again -LRB- normal tags are far better -RRB- .
 I 've ordered 6 size L T-shirts for my husband . All of them are kind of small compared to other `` L '' t-shirts I 've got , but half of them are way too small . It might say `` size L '' on the tshirt but it looks like an `` S '' . The fabric is weird , very thin and colours are not the ones shown on the website . Do n't buy it !
 As a rule of thumb to all buyers who have n't ran into any trouble with LEAD Apparel do n't buy an item from this company . I never received my order and then when I complained they gave me the runaround excuse that I received my item . Luckily I was refunded my money through Amazon and I wo n't spend another cent with LEAD again .
 I ordered the white color . This is only 50 % cotton , so I had to throw it away -LRB- I hated the touch -RRB- . Now I do see that in the description there is a note about it -LRB- 50 % -RRB- , but since the title states clearly 100 % cotton then this is very misleading and I feel I was cheated .
 I believe they should adjust the sizing for these shirts . I ordered my true size but would probably need to order one or two sizes bigger . It was so tight I 'm afraid to wash it .
 These shirts suck . The material is too thick and very coarse . It does not stretch at all . I got some Hanes `` ComfortSoft '' from Target and that material is great , much more comfortable than these .
 I bought one each of the deep red and deep royal colors.I hand washed them , fortunately separately , before wearing and both colors ran , and are still running despite numerous rinses .
 I received these T-shirts roughly two years ago , and have since replaced them . First thing that I noticed is that they are very irregularly sized amongst themselves . The cotton is rigid , and not as soft as what you can get for the same price elsewhere . The fit around the shoulders is small and awkward . Though these shirts are tagless , hanes produces other kinds of shirts in a tagged variety . That they do n't combine these things seems a bit contrived to me . Overall , I still have two of them as work shirts , and they probably would have lasted longer if I could have dealt with the awkward fit .
 These shirts are not really what you think if you are looking for something to lounge around in or work out in they are more form fitting . Disappointed due when someone buys in 4XL or larger they are looking for comfort and room to move in not to be so skin tight barely get them on or fight to pull them off . Very tight in the arms and pits not a good fit hard to move your arms . Nothing personal against the company sold them it is just Hanes brand themselves . I find they tend not to be consistent on their product manufacturing .
 I bought two shades of gray , one was 60 % cotton 40 % polyester , the other 70 % cotton 30 % polyester . I am completely dissatisfied with this product . It is clearly advertised as 100 % cotton , if you look closely at the pictures , they cleverly cover up the part of the print that should say 100 % cotton . A nice scam , I must say . Figures they are based out of N.Y.
 The black plastic case holds the shot cups , but does not stay on the flask & the flask itself leaks all the way around the bottom . Need to take it to a jeweler and see if they can solder it .
 I 've owned several sets of these scope covers and they are very cheaply made and will not last . The tiny little `` snaps '' wear out after a few dozen closings or openings . Replace these things with good quality stretchable scope covers that cover the entire scope . You will be better off in the long run .
 I bought this for my boyfriend as a gift -LRB- he LOVES beanie hats -RRB- , I was so excited to receive it because of the `` good reviews '' posted here . I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED . I do n't know what kind of hat everyone else received , but this is not a beanie and the quality is so cheap . Honestly , I would have been better off buying a hat from the dollar store.If you are looking for a long hat -LRB- beanie style -RRB- , that can be worn in windy weather , AVOID . This hat is good if you want a hat to wear when its nice for `` style '' . Not worth the wait and the trouble , go to a dollar store .
 I thought this beanie would be slouchy due to its longness.I was wrong . its extremely stiff , even after washes.and it sticks straight up , like a gangmemeber would wear a beanie.i did n't really like the fabric , it was itchy .
 My brother and I have each purchased this product for our dogs . The range starts out excellent -LRB- several hundred yards -RRB- but after 6 months or so both of our remotes saw a huge decrease in both battery life and range . I am going to purchase a replacement battery for the remote , but this is the second sportdog product I 've owned and they have both had serious issues with battery life and remote range .
 I just got this and the Add-A-Collar since I have two dogs , and if I 'm reading the manual right , all three buttons on the transmitter do the same thing , shock the dog . I want to be able to train them with the tone and use the shock as a last resort , so if I want to do that , I have to buy another transmitter ? How stupid is that ?!?
 I initially thought this trainer was a good buy . However after about 6 months I noticed -LRB- nearly too late -RRB- thatthe trainer was failing at distances over 30 ft. It was originally good for around a half mile . It was completely chargedbut just not working.At the price this is just not acceptable.I have contacted the company but have not received a response as yet.A big disappointment .
 I purchased this item for my 5 month lab , and it worked great for 2 days . I read the manual and followed the directions and it was exactly what we wanted to further train our puppy . Yesterday while in the kitchen my dog yelped , and then several seconds later another yelp . then it was constant panic and yelping . I went into shock trying to get the collar off my dog because i realized that the collar was shocking my dog for no reason . It was on tight and in order to get the collar off i had to grab some scissors to get it off . He is now spooked and wo n't even go back into the kitchen . So what I was trying to establish , has now went into the wrong direction and I 'm extremely upset for this . I kept the remote on top of a counter with nothing around it to set if out . I thought this was a great collar but it only takes one mistake to ruin everything . Please use with caution , because it could have happened in the water or somewhere you could n't get to him fast enough .
 After using the SD-800 collar four times in the last year , the transmitter failed . SportDog will NOT honor the warranty because I bought from an unauthorized dealer thru E-Bay . Would not recommend this product at all based on their failure to honor their 2 year warranty no matter where it was purchased .
 The SportDog 800 is the first training collar that I have ever used so I have nothing to compare it against . The problem with it is n't in its performance in the field , the problem is that the transmitter has a continuous drain on the battery even when not in use . You can fully charge the transmitter , take it off the charger , and in under 6 or 7 hours the battery will be dead even if it was n't used ! Additionally , the user manual says that after the initial charge , it is detrimental to the batteries life to leave it on the charger for more than 12 hours . So essentially you have to plan every use well ahead of time so that you can charge it for it 's 8 hour charging time and then use it within a 3 or 4 hour window before the battery dies.If you were to pack this along on a trip 200 miles away , your transmitter might be dead before you even reached your destination.I could n't believe that the product was meant to perform this way and contacted SportDog for a replacement battery . After 3 weeks of agonizingly slow customer service they informed me that I had purchased from an unauthorized SportDog retailer and there was nothing they could do to help.I then purchased a 30 $ replacement battery and installed it . It still performs the same . I guess I will just leave it on the charger until I feel like using it despite what the owners manual says , and if I feel like taking it on a trip away from an electrical outlet I will just be out of luck.Bottom line is do n't waste your money . After further research I have found other customers experience the exact same problems that I do . The SD-800 works wonderfully when the batteries are charged but keeping them charged is a constant hassle that could have been easily resolved with a simple on/off switch . And should you ever need assistance from SportDog customer service , Good luck to you , you will definitely need it .
 I just hate it . It looks really bad and has a very rough finish . Not at all looks like what you see in the photos ! DO N'T BUY !
 first thing first the cap was hard to screw on it took at least 4 attempts to get a tight fit then i put water in and it still leaked i ended up taking two two litter waters for my backpacking trip dont buy this product
 I love the insanity workouts . The only problem is that at least three of the discs came damaged and skip constantly .
 This workout program is not good . Basically , one does the same workout again and again and again , with just slight variations of the moves that do not make any substantial difference . The ` theory ' of this program , which it proudly tells you , is that it makes Interval training harder , by taking out the interval rest period , so that it is no longer an interval -LRB- ? -RRB- . The plyometrics do not follow any of the protocols of plyo training that you can find on any university physical education Web site.The form of the background exercises is also poor . There is one , a young blonde woman , who always does her squats etc. with her spine hunched over in a `` C '' - shape that makes my back hurt just watching her . She is never corrected in her form.The company , Beachbody , that puts this out also has a multi-level marketing program , so that there is no shortage of people who will sell this to you on the Web and offer to become your ` coach ' , the only qualification to be a coach seems to be a willingness to sign up other ` coaches ' from what I can see.The same company also puts out the much advertised P90X which actually is a very good general conditioning program . It actually alternates days of weight training days vs. cardio/yoga days so that one does n't overwork one area too much . There is weight work , yoga , stretching , kickboxing moves , plyometrics , something for everyone . For a lot of people this is all they will need to meet the advice of ` take exercise ' . If one wanted more of a cardio-based routine , I would probably go with ` RushFit ' which is co-hosted with George St. Pierre.As for Insanity , you 'd have to be nuts to make this the centre of your program .
 I tried to do this dvd set for about 3 wks. , while it is a good work out some moves r 2 fast & it is definetly not for any one with bad knees like myself ! There 's a lot of jumping moves that my knees could ` nt take . Otherwise it 's a great cardio workout , wish i could do it .
 I read all of the reviews and factored in both positive and negatives ... then decided to try it for free - I borrowed the DVDs from a Coworker and eased my way into it . Definitely not for beginners -LRB- as the infomercial insinuates -RRB- and it did get a bit boring . Very hard on knees . I think I 'll go back to my X-factor ST DVDs . I must also add that I 'm appalled at the amount of people who criticized those reviewers who did n't like the program . What happened to freedom of speech ? These reviews are based on people 's personal opinions , not facts . You should respect their reviews and they should respect yours . Everyone has a different experience , so let it be .
 I bought this package about a month ago and did the workouts then noticed spelling errors on the workout calender . I thought was odd so I looked up fake insanity on YouTube and the insanity I received was just like the one in the video .
 This is a great workout set and provides a good cardio workout with lots of variety . There are several DVD 's in the package however that were damaged and at least three of them do not work at all . There are others that skip around as well . Also , the set included 2 of the same DVD and was missing another one . I would never buy from this company again and regret my purchase for this reason . I would say about half of this set is not usable . I love the Insanity workouts , they are great . Next time I will buy from a more credible source so that I do not waste my money on poor quality DVD 's .
 The workouts are intense and helpful but virtually every DVD is scratched . Nothing is more frustrating than working out and then waiting for the DVD to start working again . Very dissatisfied with this seller .
 I Never received it . I was sent the wrong work out videos so I 'm not sure about this item . I hear its great but I went thru such a hassle I no longer want to order it again .
 The Video is the REAL Deal if you want a great workout . I believe the one I bought on Amazon was a black market copy ... so I returned .
 The workout package belies the $ 150 that was paid but the DVD 's can give several players some real trouble . As is happens , the 1 day old top-of-the-line LG DVD/BluRay player would not play the disks without inserting an old movie DVD first otherwise a `` Disk Error '' message would be visible . I tried on another -LRB- JVC -RRB- player and had a similar problem with pretty much every other disk in the package . I contacted Beach Body on their online chat customer service system and was promised a replacement with an email to confirm the replacement . I never received the email and am now embroiled in back-and-forth game of who to talk to about having this issue resolved . I even pointed their customer service -LRB- routed overseas -RRB- to their own forum where others discuss this problem . I do n't have very high hopes that this will be resolved and the whole kit will be sent back .
 ILOVE insanity but I 'm going into my second month if the program and the cd 's in the package do not match the DVD cover so I am missing a few workouts which is VERY disappointing .
 The product was suppose to be like new and several of the disc will not play well ; movement hangs and moves at 1/2 speed . Not super satisfied . Also note that work out is great for the young but not for anyone that has hip or knee pain ; too much jumping . Easy to modify at lower level but would not pay price if one has joint pain .
 I 'm highly disappointed because two of the extra DVDs do n't work . I was under the impression that like new meant all the DVDs would work .
 i tried this for the first week aware of the knee issue other people were having being very cautious landing softly ... i felt some discomfort but i was still able to do the work outs ... i modified a few exercises but in the middle of the second week my right knee started to hurt and had a popping sound so i stopped even thou i can still do the work out and have no problems going up the stairs i dont think its worth risking it ... maybe i 'll give it a week and start doing this every other day ... its weird i feel slimmer in my waist but havent lost any weight i was getting happy cuz i like being at 175 being 5 ' 8 ... i still dont think this work out is worth the price thou and they should know the knee shouldnt go thru those workouts everyday ... even recovery week i saw didnt seem to be much of a break ... i did plyometrics from p90x and even added a 20 pound jacket and weighted 190 and didnt have this issue ...
 I love Insanity ! However the bonus dvds that came with my purchase : Max Interval Sports Training , Insane Abs and Upper Body Weight Training do n't work at all . So be careful if you buy from this person .
 So you can push yourself as hard or little as you want with this video . I did n't care for it because I pushed myself and could definately tell that even though I would consider myself in pretty good shape -LRB- workout at least 3 times a week -RRB- , my joints did n't like all the jumping and I could end up hurting myself . I ended up giving this to my brother-in-law who uses it in the winter to stay in shape while running marathons the rest of the year . He does n't overdo it . I feel that men may like this video more than women .
 I ordered Insanity to do with one of my friends . And it is HARD . But I love it , and even more - I love how I feel . It 's a fantastic workout.That said , I have one major complaint . The insane abs dvd - the one I most wanted/needed does n't work . It skips all around , it has since the first time I put it in . It 's not a scratch , the DVD is just composed wrong . You ca n't use it . This took me down from 5 stars to 2 . As much as I paid for this product , I expected it all to work and did n't try insane abs until the first 30 days were up and it was unreturnable.The workout is great - but check all your dvds or you might be getting ripped off .
 I have been doing P90X for about 2 years now and felt that I was in decent shape at 47 y.o. I started with the Fit Test -LRB- day 1 -RRB- of the Insanity . They show you a few moves you will be doing throughout the program.So Day 2 starts with the Plyo Cardio Circuit . I found that many of the moves were extremely dangerous . I actually slightly pulled a hamstring because there was no stretching at the beginning.I think Insanity is more like the Crossfit where the exercises are violent to the point of injury.The advantage of P90X is that you ALWAYS stretch before exercising.I think Insanity is more for age 30 and under .
 The order came in decent time but 4 out of the 10 disks are completely damaged and not even usable . A few of the other disks also have damaged spots that skip when your trying to use them . I was beyond upset with the quality because of how much it was listed for .
 2 videos came damaged and would not play . The rest of them are fine and I actually like the workout .
 About Insanity GroupInsanity Group is committed to providing each customer with the highest standard of customer service.Insanity Group does not respond to customers . These DVD set despite the description they gave do not work . Unless they resolve the issue I would not buy from Insanity Group.Supposedly the program is great .
 Some of the DVDs in this set do not even work . What a ripoff ! Very disappointed ! These DVDs were obviously copies of the real thing .
 I 've received this video set several weeks ago and watched it every day -LRB- except sunday -RRB- and I 'm still more fat than ralphie may . I usually play it while I 'm eating supper at the kitchen table and boy does it make me sweat watching these guys jump around . No wonder it 's called insanity ! But now if I were actually a part of the video I may get in shape but just watching it at home has done nothing except scare me and make my bones bigger .
 I would give it no stars if it were possible ... the item came damaged and when I tried contacting them to Exchange or return i never got a response . I still have n't got a response I do n't recommend buying from this company .
 Thank you all for your feedback about dvds not working . I found these comments on all Beachbody Products . So , I have decided against the purchase & will look for other products . Again thanks save me $ 150 !!!
 I have n't been able to use the workout . While it plays on my computer here at work , it wo n't play on my DVD player at home . I emailed Lorraine Sperrazza twice , heard back from her once but have n't heard back from her with an answer to my second email . My first email stated that I could not play the Fitness DVD , that was before I found out that the entire set does n't play on my DVD player at home . It 's insane for them to think that I can do the work out at work!I also do not want a refund , I really want this program . Any suggestions ? Can you guys help me instead ? I do n't know where to return this so that I can get a replacement . They obviously have my money ... HELP !!! Johanna
 First off , i must state the value of my criticism . I do n't know how to say this , but i am kind of a big deal . I have traveled the world and gave advice and criticism on many products and services . And this product , at first glances and if be used by a mildly obese child , is absolutely fine and performs its functions properly . Absolutely fine by means of the child , indicating that `` its '' parents were giving the appearance to improve their child . This product is not only a waste of time and money , but is also a poor excuse to feel `` guilt-free '' . Making workouts commercialized will only bring the value of work outs and exercising as a whole , down . Using and showing off a this product and others like it to make ones friends and family feel impressed is a poor excuse and a act of cowardice . Furthermore , using this product as a tool for `` the beach body '' you always wanted is embarrassing to say the least . One does not simply watch TV and follow the actor as if a puppet and magically obtain a `` perfect '' body . Real results only come from real work outs . And there is nothing real about watching other people jump around from the `` convince '' of you own home . Working out is n't supposed to be convenient or easy , it 's hard work and real men love hard work . And some of you might read this and say , `` But Tyrone . . Everyone has it , and I even have friends or family that bought it . And the results are real and proven . '' And I would say of course there were results , mimicking moment that was only slightly greater than what you were used too , none , then of course some progress would appear . Losing 20 pounds from a previous weighing of 400 pounds is n't impressive .
 However my I never received it . I ordered it over two weeks ago and no emails indicating the status of my package or anything . I 've never had a problem dealing with Amazon before , even when I was deployed my stuff would get there within a week of placing an order !!!! I guess this is what happens when Amazon starts to outsource their operation to small amateurish firms ... I want my money back !!!!! Before people start whining about me not reviewing the product , let me initiate the conversation , get a life , I want what I paid for , I did n't receive anything so here is my review on the product !!!! NOTHING !!!!!
 I did not like the fact it is advertised for beginners and when I got the product it repeatedly said not for beginners .
 The workouts are hard . Very hard . But they are also seriously boring !! You repeat the same 5 exercises over and over and over -LRB- and I will spare you how many times you repeat the same thing -RRB- , but at slightly different speeds . It did n't keep my interest at all . I got bored long before I got tired . After 20 days , I shipped mine back . It was not worth the money or the time to put the disc into the DVD player . Waste of $ 25 + for shipping and handling .
 I was really excited to try this series . I played rugby for 7 years and was used to intense , challenging 2 + hour workouts . I 've never made it through more than 10 minutes of a DVD because the moves are so repetitious and boring . The countdown on screen makes it even worse ... you see how much time you have left and just think &#34; God , not 35 more minutes of this !!! &#34; This is good for someone who wants simple , predictable moves . It definitely challenges your body and tires you out but I just could n't stand how boring it is . I need a little more excitement in my workouts .
 I purchased the dvd and it shipped two days later but took almost 3 weeks to arrive , when it was supposed to be coming from 2 states over . I tried repeatedly to contact the seller with no response . Once the dvds arrived , most would not play in my player and it is obvious they are not original copies . I ordered from this seller because of the high ratings , but it is a joke . My shipment included a coupon for $ 25 visa if I rated them 5 stars . Do n't trust this seller !
 I received the DVDs but unfortunately , I could not get any of them to worke . I tried them on 2 different computers and 2 different DVD players . I think the seller will do the right thing and let us return them though .
 I actually loved Insanity . It pushed me , the music and workout was great . It was a great challenge and put me into perfect shape . However , a couple of weeks after completing insanity I started getting back pain which progressed over time . Ultimately it turned into a fully herniated disc . Now I am potentially facing a lifetime of pain and challenges.I read many reviews before doing insanity about it being a high impact workout with repetitive jumping and motions that can cause deterioration in spinal discs . Oh how I regret not paying attention to that ahead of time . I 'm 34 and was in good shape before I started insanity and have always been athletic . I 've never had back pain before but now I 'm stuck.Also , I did n't actually experience any specific back pain or injury while doing the workout and I was careful to build up and use my core during any bending or back focused exercises . I believe it was just the intense , repetitive movement that deteriorated the casing on my disc and now I ca n't do any exercise.Be careful with this .
 I 'm a 5 ' 11 '' , 139 # female who works out at the gym 5 days a week running , eliptical and weights . I wanted this program as a breakfrom the gym and a way to build up my push up capability , etc. . The program is intense and had me sweating , no doubt . However , Istarted to bulk up in a major way in my upper back , arms , thighs , etc. . Rather than strengthening and keeping me sleek and tight . . I started to get bigger ... not my goal ! Works well if you want a muscle-bound look but I 'll stick with the gym !
 I bought this for my son . When he got around to the 4th DVD it was scratched and would not play properly . I had order a whole new system and return the other one for credit . I was disappointed to have to pay a &#34; restocking fee &#34; . Why should I be penalized for their faulty product ?
 The service and the quality of the DVDs was great except that the insane abs and max interval sports training DVDs were defective . When I contacted the seller , I got two replacement DVDs but they were defective too . I emailed them about the issue but never heard anything back .
 I am a personal trainer and very fit . This routine is very difficult but I was able to get through it with no breaks but decided to stop doing it because I was waking up with knee joint pain . This workout routine is very bad on your joints . If you are young and can get through this routine , I assure you it will affect your joints ... if not immediately , in the future . The body is not meant to do so much pounding , especially the knees . It has been a week since I stopped and I am still having issues with my knees . I love the Beachbody DVD 's , especially Chalene 's and Tony 's DVD 's , but am disappointed Beachbody for this routine .
 All my CD 's are defective . They all skip . I 've tried several different computers just to make sure it was n't my equipment . Do not buy from Amazon . Spend the extra money and purchase directly from beachbody.com
 The INSANITY workout itself is great . I was disappointed with the overall quality of the set and cd 's . The sleeve the cd 's came in was already falling apart when I opened it from the mailbox . Most of all , mulitple CD 's did not work , including Insane Abs , and they look like they are burned copies , not the real deal . It 's like someone printed all the stuff at Kinko 's and burned the cd 's in there basement ...
 Hey all , Lately I 've been going to McDonalds and other GREAT fast food chains and have noticed that they are starting to serve more healthy food and listing calories next to menu item . It is very irritating because I go to a great restaurant like McDonalds to enjoy delicious food , and not worry about prices or calories ... I love my body and I am happy with having a gut and love handles . Anywho , at a recent doctor 's visit my Doc said that i had atherosclerotic coronary artery disease and my arteries were 99 % clogged . He tried to threaten me saying that if I kept up my lifestyle I would have about 6 months of life left in me and suggested I do a workout program such as Insanity to get `` in shape '' . So I put this insanity DVD on and gave up after 30 seconds . Working out and healthy eating is a complete waste of time and effort ! As a matter of fact , why would anyone want to look like a convict on death row !? If I am going to life my life I am going to eat happy at great places like McDonalds , Burger King , and Jack in the Box . Also , my time is valuable to me and I would rather be watching good DVDs like Jersey Shore , Battlefield Earth , Freddy Got Fingered , and Catwoman .
 Seller shipped item immediately , and was received promptly , however looking at the product something appeared to be off . I did n't think much of it , but as I used the DVDs they would skip and freeze . I returned the DVD package back to the company and ordered directly from the manufacturer -LRB- beachbody -RRB- . It was n't until I received the new order that I realized that the item I had previously purchased was not a `` like new used product '' but a bootleg . For as great of a program that Insanity is get the original and let the company make the money they deserve.Insanity itself has been great , really intense and results are immediate . Hard on the knees but just know how to pace yourself . As Shaun-T says `` Keep it Safe ! ''
 I am not really overweight , but not in great shape either . The problem I have with these videos is 1 -RRB- The warmup is 20 minutes long and will wear you out before you can do the actual workout .2 -RRB- There is no upper body included in the warmups so when you are spent , you 've only done legs and cardio .3 -RRB- Even if I could do the full 40 minutes , I do not look forward to taking that much time from my day to get a workout.There are better programs that can whip you into shape in less time . If you are finishing these workouts , you are already in good shape . As others have mentioned , people in the class on the video are dropping out during the warmup phase.On a positive note , the production value is outstanding . Shaun T is motivational , and not annoying to listen to . The music is not your typical electronic repetitive rhythm , but it 's more of an orchestral Rocky-type soundtrack , which is great.However , if you are looking to do a workout that only takes about 20 minutes and will really work your muscles and cardio , I recommend : Jillian Michaels - 30 Day ShredThe production value is much lower , and I have to turn the volume down so I do n't have to listen to her , but I just play my own music on the stereo .
 They say Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results . Personally , I think they may have hit the mark with that quote . I recently bought this DVD set to challenge myself . I 'm fit , a swimmer , worked to get a black belt in Taekwondo , am an avid tennis player and cyclist . After having completed the P90X program , I was looking to increase stamina as well as further define my muscles . So far , what I am noticing is a lack of variety in the moves that will most likely lead to the `` plateauing '' that a program like P90X manages to avoid . I 'm not into getting rich quick or losing weight quick . I wanted a challenging , sustainable workout , with intense cardio , more complex resistance training and good stretching . Instead , I got :1 -RRB- Repetition ad nauseam/Lack of any substantial instruction
 The package received looked like a bootleg version of the real program . And was missing one dvd which was replaced by a duplicate of another . Just terrible . Obviously paid $ 120 to support some illegal operation . Pay the extra 30 bucks and get the real one .
 I bought this for myself and several of my friends . The program was difficult from the word GO . and though it looked exciting at first ... i soon realized how much strain it was putting on my knees , ankles and even my thighs . I exercise regularly and do not have any muscle ache issues but this one left me NOT SORE but actually injured and I just had to stop . anyways my friends stopped this too after a few days because of one reason or another . IN short , buy some other program probably p90X but not this one . you can get seriously injured .
 Most of the things about this product were great . I received it in very quick timing , it was packaged really well , and they even included some laffy taffy with it . However , one of the dvds was defective . It skipped throughout the whole thing and was unusable . I emailed the seller about it and they said they would send me a replacement dvd . I waited a week and had n't heard anything , so I sent them an email asking if I would be notified when they sent the replacement dvd . They responded with just a period . That 's it . So I thought maybe the response was a mistake , so I resent the email . I got the same period . So I 'm not sure if I 'm going to get my replacement dvd or not , which is a bummer because when you pay almost $ 100 for something you would hope that the whole thing would work , not just part of it . Great business and package except for this .
 there should be an extreme notice for this workout
 I 've done the 4 listed in the title . Want to know the truth ? I use Rush Fit the most , even though I rate it 3.75 . 1st check out what the American Council of Exercise has to say about the big 3 :[ ... -RSB- Too much ? Ok . Here 's my opinion . If you are out of shape , Insanity is not for you . You are expected to preform at a high level almost from the get go . Yes , there is a `` warm up '' , if by warm up you mean doing the same similar exercises that you are going to do in the meat of the daily routine . There is SO LITTLE VARIETY !! Even though of the DVD 's have different focuses , you 'd be hard pressed to site significant differences in the routines and exercises in 85 % of them . Not only that , speed and intensity is emphasized over proper form . Watch the others in the video . Their form is atrocious ! Again , if you 're over weight and try to keep up , you 're asking for trouble . Want to look like Shaun-T ? Ai n't going to happen with this program . There is absolutely NO UPPER BODY workout , except for push up types of exercise.If you are in good-great shape , you will find these sessions boring . Yes , you will get a good cardio workout . Like I said above , though , the DVD 's are repetitious , even though the titles try to lead you to believe otherwise . You 'll also notice the `` warm up '' and stretching are not really sound . Also , just like above , NO UPPER BODY except for push up type exercises . It 's all High-Impact , high cadence aerobics.P90X - In short , you can look like Tony Horton -LRB- the host -RRB- if you follow the program . Sessions are highly varied . My problem with it is that it requires a fair amount of equipment . If you 're just starting out , you wo n't have 1/3 of what you need . Also , sessions can start to approach 2 hours . OUCH ! As a family man , I do n't have that type of time . But , it is the most well rounded program.P90X-2 - If you have n't done P90X , start there . If you 've completed P90X , be prepared to buy another $ 200 - $ 300 worth of gym equipment and increase the difficulty of the same exercises . Where there were pushups , now use only one arm ! Pull-ups ? Yep , try one arm . Air squats , try one leg !! Nothing ground breaking . More of the same with increased difficulty and the need for more equipment.RushFit - Owings -LRB- host -RRB- is an MMA trainer . Very dead pan . George St. Pierre is a great MMA , but makes a cringe worthy co-host . Luckily he does n't say much . But , after a while , you start to laugh at the inane things he does say . Good session variety , but the warm ups and cool downs are always the same . -LRB- Probably because they sell all of the DVD 's separately , too . -RRB- You only need a set of dumbbells or two . 10lbs and 15lbs are what I use . I 'm in pretty good shape and I work up a great sweat with only those . GStP only uses 25lbs in the video and he struggles at times . WHY DO I USE THIS THE MOST ? I work out with weight/bowflex and these videos to get a better mix of aerobic and anaerobic exercises . This is 50 mins max for a great workout . I can bowflex in the morning before work and use this in the evening and still have time for the wife and daughter . It 's not perfect , but it 's what 's best for me.Do you want a complete package that can cover the beginner to the intermediate and have ample time ? P90X is the way to go . Do you want to throw in something unique to your tried - and-true routine without working out too much ? RushFit . Do you want a twisted ankle or throw out a disk in your back ? Or maybe want something that gives you unattainable goals while teaching you bad habits and then making you depressed because you 'll never be like those on the video ? Insanity is where it 's at.Variety , though , is best . Rotate your routines . Throw in something new and drop something old . Bring it back in a few months and you 'll be surprised that you 're probably better at it now . I 'm putting up my copy of Insanity on craig 's list .
 I started this work out thinking I could loose 15 maybe 20 pounds in the 63 days.I did Hip Hop Abs a few years ago and lost 40 pounds.I am on my 7th week of Insainity and to date have lost 3 pounds.I really busted my hump with this program and up till now thought it would pay off.Im 5 foot 3 and a half inches , start weight was 158 , throughout the first month of the program I stayed at 160 so there was a 2 pound weight gain.I made sure to eat right and cut out everything that taste good , today is my third day of week 7 and my current weight is 155 , but that too fluctuates some days are 157 . I really poured my heart and soul into this program and cant really believe that as much as I worked I still look the same.I Was so worried that I wouldnt loose what I need to that I added turbofire after the third week of begining insainity.So here I am doing 1 and a half to 2 hours of hard intense workout everyday , I will have to stop the program in 9 days for a vacation to flordia , so im sure there is not much time to loose much more.I took before and after pictures every 2 weeks and see no diffrence.Im not saying dont buy this program , I just want other Ladies to know that you may not get what you hope for with this one .
 The 1st 2 DVD 's do not work . I do not have the invoice or I would have tried to send it back . I ca n't use the start up videos so I have not been able to even use the product . It has been a waste f $ 90 .
 What this program does not let buyers know off the bat is that it is really about jumping . Mostly jumping . If you have issues with your knees , or ever had issues with your knees , this is not for you .
 Writing a review about Insanity has been weighing on my mind for a while now . The reason I have n't written one sooner , was due to my indecisiveness pertaining to this product . Having picked it up a few times , I have now decided to put it down forever . Let me elaborate.I am 33 , and my background is in lighter , but relatively intensive sports
 I 've been following Insanity to the dot . I followed the diet plan and did the workouts every day . I just finished the first week of the second month . I 'm pretty active ; ran marathons and was in good shape to start off . For the amount of time it takes to do the work outs I have not seen any results what so ever . I still weigh the same . I still look the same and I still do not see any abs . I 'm still going to finish the program , just to be sure that I 'm giving it the full 60 days ; however , so far I have not seen any results .
 RIP OFF !!!!! HALF ALL THE DVDS WERE THE SAME !!!! I WOULD NEVER USE THIS VENDER AGAIN !!!! ONE WOULD THINK THIS COMPANY WOULD AT LEAST PUT THE CORRECT DVDs IN EACH BOX !!!
 I 've been working out off & on over the last 10 years.This years plan started with Power90 , then INANITY -LRB- a new one for me -RRB- then P90X . Finished Power90 , I was pumped up & looking forward to INSANITY.I do n't half-ass my programs & want the best results , so of course I 'm eating the right foods in the right amounts , 5 to 6 meals a day plus taking supplements.For me the results were n't worth all the `` Insanely '' hard works . I 'll be starting P90X again . I get much better results from that.I think INSANITY may be for people younger & fatter then me .
 This is a good program but not for me . It also was missing an important part - the suggested workout schedule .
 I am in my late 40 's and have always been in shape until recently . I really was hoping for something to kickstart me back into shape , but THIS IS SOOOOOOOO NOT MY ANSWER . All the people in the video are young and ripped.I did the first few exercises and did the butt kick and felt a sharp stab in my left knee.I stopped and bringing it back to our library.Suggestion ... Get it from your library first and try it out before you buy ? Maybe you will love it , but I would much rather work at my own pace . They tell you not to sacrifice form , but you try to keep up and then the form is blown.Sorry , but it would be insanity if I kept doing this . This was NOT for me . Going back to Margaret Richard and Body Electric
 I started playing the dvd 's one day at a time per the program and i 'm now on dvd 4 and day 4 , Three of the 4 dvd 's are scratched and skipping one of which only plays until 14 mins in and then wo n't play past that point ... I feel like I was ripped off by this seller and will not use them again , really $ 100 and you send me scratched up hardly playing dvd 's shame on you !
 So , like many of you here , I watched the infomercial and was inspired . I really thought that Insanity was the fitness program I was looking for . No equipment needed , and look at the results ! So , I laid down the cash and bought the program.I am a fairly active guy who plays hockey and goes biking at least twice a week . I work at a desk job and really enjoy getting out and moving on the weekends . I was hoping that Insanity would really give me an edge and help to build my endurance . The fit test quickly shows you that you 're far more out of shape than you think . Disc by disc and day by day , I found it a huge challenge to even get through the `` warm ups '' . So yes , the program IS challenging . I 'm not disputing that . Clearly even the pros in the video had a hard time keeping up.My dispute is that people are paying in the neighborhood of $ 200 for some guy to tell them to do variations of basic cardio moves at a vigorous pace . That 's the only `` secret '' to Insanity . Do jumping jacks , jogging in place and push ups as hard and fast as you can for 30 minutes straight . The program gets old quick . I could do this all for free . And it 's not very practical to use in your living room if you have any loose items on shelves . I got tired of knocking things over and vibrating everything . Also , get ready for rug burn.At the end of the day , I have more fun and stay motivated to work out harder playing hockey or biking for a few hours on the weekends than I did with insanity . Sure , if you 're someone who hates actual activities , needs someone telling them to stay motivated , or are some body building wannabe freak , I 'm sure this program is fine . But if you like to compete and have fun , this is n't the program for you . I could not keep it up and sold it off . Too boring and too much money . The infomercial really makes it out to be some hardcore experience . It 's just a workout.To paraphrase `` Eastbound and Down '' charachter Kenny Powers , '' I like to play a real sport , not be the best at exercising ! '' . Think twice about this investment . You may as well just make an audio recording of you screaming `` PUSH ! GO ! , '' and `` BUTTKICKS ! JUMPING JACKS ! HEISMAN ! '' than buy this . If you 're into that , great . But if you like competing and being outside , pass this and go join a club sport or go biking or jogging for free . You 'll have way more fun .
 I use to be in GREAT shape but got in a car accident and was in a wheelchair for 6 months and had to learn how to walk for an additional 6 months . After all of that my body was very out of shape but figured how bad could it be its only been a year my body will bounce back after some cardio . so i bought this not realizing you have to be in shape to do this its not for beginners or for people who have been out of the game for a while it sure is not for seriously over weight people . my 1st week of doing this is going to be my last week of doing this until i find a more suitable work out program and work my self up to this . I got ta say even in my best shape i know i would find this program hard but at least then it would n't kill me . i took frequent breaks and did n't push my self to hard but still found my self so sore i had a hard time walking at times . I gave this 2 stars because no where does it say this program is for an advanced all ready in shape person all it says is `` The Insanity Workout is a difficult workout '' this program is for some one who already goes to the gym and some what in shape but just needs that little extra to lean up . now i have to find and buy another program that can work me up to this program seems misleading and waisted my time and money 2 things I 'm limited on.I 'm 32 years old , 5 ' 4 female , 143 lbs , and about 20 to 25 lbs heavier then i use to be . I use to work out 4 to 5 times a week about a year ago just so people know my level i would say I 'm the average person ... i hope my review was helpful
 i have hip replacement and ankle broken so i think this is not for me i , m afraid i might get hurt so i think its hard for me
 I am upset that I paid $ 100 for a fake ! I would be happy to get my money back and send the program back !!! SOme of this disks were mislabeled when they were pirated but at least they work .
 i bought from this seller thinking i would get my money 's worth because of all the good reviews i read . Well I was wrong . first of all , none of the DVDs played in my computer which was a total let down because I 've never had this problem before with my computer . second of all , one of the DVDs does n't even have the right content . It has the right name of the work out written on the outside of the DVD but when you play it it has a different workout , so i have the same work out twice . i contacted the seller a couple of times and he told me that he would send me the DVD with the right content in it . it 's been three moths since then and i still have n't received my DVD . I would like to know where the loyalty to their buyers is ? i payed so much money for basically a bunch of trash . i do not recommend this seller , and i would definitely not buy from them again . Beware what you order from this seller .
 Two of the discs in this package do not work and it was advertised as `` new '' and the user said they had never used it . I wish people would not sell items that do not work .
 Workout is great when the dvd will play . Tried several of the dvd 's in three different players and they will not play smoothly in any of them . Emailed the seller about exchange for new dvd 's and get no return email back
 I was disappointed in the Plyomentric DVD that didnt work -LRB- bought used from BOOKS FOR EVERYBODY -RRB- , disk was unreadable in multiple DVD players . The back of the DVD doesnt look scratched so I suspect it was burnt . So far the other DVD 's worked but I havent made it through all of them yet . Everything was included in the set but still a let down .
 I bought the set and only 2 disc out of the 11 would even play . So I was unable to do the work out at all .
 So far 3 of the discs in my set do n't work . Some skip the entire workout and just go to the cool down , others skip parts of the workout or start in the middle .
 Received the product in 10 days . Product looks good but defective . More than half of the DVDs do not work in the DVD player or computer . Seller stated that he would replace but after more than 2 weeks had not replaced the defective product . Will return half of emails about defective product . Would not recommend . Looking at a product I paid for that does not work . Purchase at your own risk .
 I just received my Insanity package -LRB- ordered through Amazon -RRB- , opened it up and there are no CD 's !!!!!!!!!!!! What a waste of time . Obviously no quality control program for who packages this together . Duh .
 I had purchased this product a while ago and did not have a chance to use all of the discs . Today , my sister borrowed a disc to use . She placed it in the dvd player and it did not work , so thinking it might have been the dvd player she placed the disc into her computer . Her computer now does not work because it is completely frozen from the disc and it will not eject from her computer .
 Recieved product in a timely manner , but some of the videos are messed up . some skip around like they were burned and some are scratchy . very disappointed !!!! Trying to save money did n't payoff for me ...
 I 'm sure it is a great program . I live in a rural area with no gyms nearby . My home is the only option ; however , I live in a small farm house with only 8 foot ceilings . Unfortunately , this is totally useless for me because of the jumping involved . I 'll be returning it and getting some band aids for my knuckles .
 Only a few of the dvd are working . A lot of them skip during the workout and the rest of them are so scratched that it refuses to play . The product came in time and was wrapped up and everything but I do n't know why the alot of the dvds are scratched up .
 I ordered the Insanity workout DVDs about 6 months ago . I have tried half of them , and they do not work properly . They skip repeatedly , and you can not properly finish your workout . I contacted the seller this evening . If they respond back to me I will re-rate this purchase . This is the only Amazon.com seller that I have not been 100 % satisfied with , and I order from them a frequently .
 the dvd 's that do work are fun , but 1/2 the dvd 's did not work in any of my dvd players and that is very frustrating when something you buy new and pay a lot of money for does n't even work .
 I 'm giving this review half the stars because half the videos were scratched , skipped & not useable . Should be listed as `` used like used '' not `` used like new '' .
 The item which was requested and received was missing the very first DVD as well as another . There was 1 duplicate DVD also . Was very dissatisfied over this , as well as not being able to get a replacement item , which wasnt available to ship and had to re-order if i wanted .
 I got this workout as a cardio circuit after doing P90X and before doing P90X2 - however , there is pretty much no upper body to this workout - after I noticed my arm muscles getting flabby I decided to move on to something else ... Like several other reviewers have said it is the same thing over and over again and is really boring ... I 'd save your money if I were you ...
 I bought this DVD set after completing P90X . I wanted to amp up my cardio fitness and saw this as the way to go . The workouts themselves are excellent . They jack up your heart rate and keep it high -LRB- without killing you -RRB- by varying the exercises . If you fololow their advice -LRB- i.e. use good form and keep your abs tight -RRB- then the workouts are n't particularly traumatic to knees and shoulders either . As stand alone workouts , they are among the best I 've ever seen . The problem is the program . You hit it hard five days a week . Two or three workouts in sequence will hit the same body parts . I am very fit but I am also 39 . My body could n't take the pounding . By day 40 I was feeling pretty beat up . I woke up on day 50 with severe muscle spasms in my lower back and was forced to take 10 days off . I am now using these DVD 's in a hybrid program with P90X and am much happier . If you 're 25 then this program is for you . If you 're over 35 then think seriously about modifying the training frequency or mixing it with another program .
 Overall , this is a very good and challenging workout . I completed 7 weeks of the 9 week program and feel that I am in better shape cardiovascularly and my core is stronger . I did n't loose any weight and my body looks no different than when I started . However , I ca n't recommend this workout to anyone due to its unbalanced approach and high impact movements that can cause injury . I think you can achieve the same results with a lower impact workout . In addition , there is very little stretching -LRB- and what there is can be awkward -RRB- and Shawn T is not graceful in this respect . Also , there is n't any balance between working chest and back or quads and hamstrings . As a result , my experience suggests that this imbalance can lead to poor posture and potential injury . The lack of stretching is more alarming . I had such cramping in my legs , I could n't lay flat without pain and had to sleep in the fetal position . It 's frustrating because from a fitness perspective , the workouts were enjoyable and effective but just not worth the risk for injury.I 've been working out for over 20 years -LRB- I 'm 35 , 5 ' 9 '' , 155 lbs , male -RRB- lifting weights , running , swimming , cycling , hiking , skiing , and practicing yoga . I 've never had any serious injury due to any of my exercises . However , I had to stop walking up and down stairs around week 5 of this program even with icing my knees after every workout . I finally decided to stop the workout completely when I could not do the moves during the workout without joint pain -LRB- not the `` good '' burning pain from working out -RRB- . Pros : ChallengingMotivatingFun WorkoutsCons : Risk of injuryImbalanced routineAwkward stretching and `` off '' workoutsUnrealistic time commitment -LRB- 6 days per week and some workouts are 90 minutes -RRB-
 The workout is terrific ! The problem is that the DVD 's themselves will only play on one DVD player I own , and even then , the freeze frequently . This is incredibly frustrating !
 This product is excellent . I 've owned it and been in the best shape of my life . I gave it to a friend when I moved to a new apartment without room to do the workout . I know what this product is and what I got from DVD and game exchange is a ripoff . Do NOT purchase this from them . Maybe you can get a good version from someone , but I 'm just going to go straight through Beachbody . They will give me a legitimate version of this product .
 I ordered the Insanity DVD set from Fightclub on Amazon . When the DVD 's arrived from China , they were horrible quality . They skipped forward sometimes up to 2 minutes at a time and one would n't play in the DVD machine at all . The seller refused to admit there was an issue until I got Amazon and my credit card company involved . I finally got a refund after I mailed the set back -LRB- I had to pay for the shipping -RRB- . I then ordered Insanity directly from Beachbody and they play fine . The workouts are great .
 I purchased this DVD set used from Amazon . The set arrived promptly , but the packaging and documents looked like low-quality photo-copies on thin paper . The DVD sound did not work in many places and the video quality was poor . The vendor accepted the return of the set and I bought a brand new set from the original publisher , rather then through Amazon . I wish Amazon could protect us better from pirated books , software and videos .
 Franklin Supermart -LRB- seller profile -RRB- Shirley Co , in Alhambra , CANADA , make me so unhappy.I ordered Shaun T , Insanity the Ulitmate Cardio Workout & Fitness DVD Program and some of the DVD 's I could n't play on my DVD player here in the United States because the disc said `` Area Limitation '' . So now I have to resend those DVD 's at my cost back to them -LRB- Shirly Co in Alhambra CA -RRB- to do whatever they need to do.When I emailed the seller -LRB- Franklin Supermart -RRB- and asked what the term `` Area Limitation '' meant , there was no explanation , instead I was told in the email to send the DVD 's back to them . on my dime .
 The workouts on several disks from my first order jumped around in time -LRB- 40 minutes remaining then BAM 22 minutes remaining then BAM 35 minutes remaining -RRB- I was hoping the defective DVDs the first time I ordered this were just a fluke . Apparently they were n't since the second set of disks had the same kind of issue . Just go and order it straight from the team beachbody website .
 I consider myself an intermediate/advanced exerciser . I really wanted to like this work out . It is too repetitive . I do n't know why but my body started to leech nutrients from my skin , so my knuckles became dark . I took a multivitamin and copper -LRB- to help with iron absorption -RRB- . Callenetics is boring as heck , but at least I only have to do that every other day and can eat what I want . With Insanity , I started to gain inches and pounds on a modified diet -LRB- 2000 calories per day -RRB- . At 30 Something , I think I am too old to be jumping around , lol . Also felt I had much better and longer lasting cardio gains with THE FIRM and Cathe Workouts .
 This workout can and will get you in shape if you follow it . With that being said the results achieved will most probably be very short-lived . It reminded me much of basic training - yes you got in shape , but for how long ? There are many fat ex-soldiers , marines , etc , who were once in phenomenal shape . In order for a program to get more than measly star from me it must be sustainable in the long-term . I would be hard-pressed to find the individual who maintains fitness on this program for long . It is too challenging , and not for the average to above average fitness enthusiast as far as sustainability . It can definitely get you in shape in the short-term . However , you will have to look elsewhere for more enduring exercise protocols if you wish to maintain your level of fitness . I am a member of the Armed Forces , and as I said it is much like Basic - gets you there , but the rest is up to a more enduring philosophy . If you want to get in shape , and then fall out of it fast - follow this methodology . If you want long-term fitness which will endure year after year then best look elsewhere . Potentially , you could get in shape with this program , and then follow another program for the long-haul - but that frankly is doubtful . Reminds me of the tortoise and the hare analogy . Not saying turtles are fit , but you get the point . BTW I did it for six weeks just for the heck of it - and can assure you it is not a long-term fix . Good luck in your fitness endeavors .
 I purchased this for my hubby for fathers day as he really wanted to try it . Afterall w / it 's bragging about getting a `` beach body '' in 60 days how could you not want it ?! I did it w / him so that he would stay motivated . Well , we did it for 60 days and a beach body was not what we got.First let me say I just recently lost 20 pounds prior to this purchase . So when I bought it I was at moderate weight , 5 ' 2 '' 119 lbs . I was truly hoping to to drop a little bit more weight and tone my body.My husband and I stuck to the routines and eating plan . We were literally dripping w / sweat and out of breath after each exercise . Within the 60 day time period , my poor hubby actually gained a pound and then lost it , putting him at the exact same weight he was when he started it ... At the beginning I kept telling him it was because muscle was heavier than fat . . but he did not gain any definition either so that soon became something that we could no longer believe.I did lose 5 pounds but I was able to lose 20 w/out the help of `` Insanity '' so I do n't see that as an accomplishment . I also did not gain any definition in my body.I wish I had returned the DVDs w/in the first 30 days ; the product has a 30 day money back guarantee . However , I thought , well it probably takes the full 60 days to see results so we stuck it out.My recommendation is do not buy this . If you do and you do n't see any changes w/in the 30 day guarantee period then send it back for a refund.On the positive side , the workuts can be fun when you get used to them and Shaun T is very motivating and nice too look at . ; - -RRB-
 First off , let me just say , YES , I have completed the 60 days . I am writing this post based on 60 full days of Insanity.A short back-story because I think it 'll help . I have been doing distance running for a number of years now , and completed the Boston Marathon back in April . Along with a rigorous running regimen , I also go to the gym three times a week to strength train . Additionally , I will usually use my elliptical machine at least twice a week . On any given day , I work out for between 1.5 to 2 hours . That said , you would n't look at me and see that I 'm ripped , however , I am lean and I am very physically fit.I started Insanity in my running off-season , because it 's hot here and I was getting burned out on running . I wanted to replace running as an experiment and see if I could condition myself in other ways . I wanted a workout which would be hard and challenge me , as well as lose a few pounds and get more `` cut '' . Enter Insanity.When I started the first month 's workouts , I really felt like they were n't long enough -LRB- about 35 minutes -RRB- , so I decided to run 4 miles prior to doing the videos every day . The first month was somewhat challenging ; however , I was very disappointed in the lack of calories I was burning . Although Insanity follows the HIIT protocol , I could not get my heart rate above 160 bpm no matter how hard I tried . Perhaps this has something to do with my current conditioning . After month 1 , no weight loss , no definition . Nada.After month one , I was a bit frustrated because I was seeing 0 results . I read that month two was much harder and that is where people supposedly get the most results . Awesome ! Bring it on , I thought . Month two is hard -LRB- VERY -RRB- ; however , here are my issues with it : - Intervals are short -LRB- 3 minutes -RRB- , I barely got to 160 bpm , and then I was back into recovery mode . Though the workouts were longer , I was still not yielding the calorie loss that I hoped . On average , during a 55 minute workout I would maybe burn up to 350 calories . - WAY TOO MUCH jumping , I noticed my knees were getting jacked up -LRB- and this is coming from a runner who averaged 50 miles per week of running and never had knee problems -RRB- . - WAY TOO MANY push-ups . I could care less about my chest muscles , I have breasts covering them up , after all . - Work outs were random and did n't offer balanced conditioning . - Cast members really started to annoy me , especially Tania -LRB- do n't ask why , I could write a whole blog post on these people alone -RRB- . After month two completed 0 RESULTS ! In fact , I gained 2-3 pounds -LRB- please note that my diet did not change at all during this process , the only thing that changed was the fact that I was not running nearly as much -RRB- . WTF ?!?! I did a before and after photo , and I swear I must have bulked up or something , because I actually look worse . I 've concluded that I have crappy genetics -LRB- actually , I concluded this when I was about four years old , but this only further validates it -RRB- . I will never get `` cut '' . I have been ten pounds lighter than I am now , and still was never cut . I think this is also proven by some of the Cast Members on Insanity . Take Akeel -LRB- misspell ? -RRB- for instance . This dude is ripped like Shaun , however , he can barely make it through many of the intervals . I noticed that I almost always out performed him . Also , look at the various people in the video ; they all vary greatly in how much they are `` ripped '' . If you work out a ton , and are not ripped , like me , then you got dealt the crappy genetics card -LRB- thanks mom -RRB- . My overall analysis is if you 're fit , you may see marginal results , depends on your genetics . If you 're lean , be prepared to get a bit `` bulky '' . If you 're a runner , you 're better off sticking with running and do some strength training on your off days , plus , you wo n't risk killing your knees in the process . That said , I will continue to do Insanity a couple times a week , because I feel it does have some redeeming qualities ; however , just did n't yield the results I expected .
 $ 144.00 ?? Are you serious ?? This set is n't worth a quarter of that . Maybe if the DVDs were made out of gold or platinum , but they 're just plain old DVDs . Think about this
 The ONLY good thing about this product was the nutrition guide which is definitely not worth the 157 $ I paid for this . I am pretty fit and healthy already but I really wanted abs like the ones they advertise you get by doing this program . First they ask for waay too much money then the workout is not insane its ridiculous You are much better off paying 20 $ a month for a gym membership and getting fit with regular excersize and the right nutrition best of luck with your goals : -RRB-
 The product I received was missing on of the DVDs despite the fact that the product rating was `` like new '' .
 I purchased Insanity , ready to start a new workout challenge . Almost a week into the workouts , I found that one of the DVDs skipped , which made it impossible to do the workout . I ended up returning the product and purchasing one with all working DVDs .
 I ordered the set . I put the 2nd work out in and up comes the TV show Damages . The label is correct , but the content is something else . I try calling , but nobody picks up . I did the chat and they just promise someone will call . I will be returning these DVD in 48 hours if nobody calls be back . Talk about disappointed , I was all ready to start my 60 days to be stuck with this crap . It is too bad since they seem like a good workout .
 My husband and I did this program together after hearing rave reviews about it . Within the first week we were both sick of the constant reminders to drink our results and recovery formula and buy shakeology . We wanted a work out , not a daily hour of advertisement . We went through the entire first month with minimal results . My very fit husband lost weight , which he was not happy about because he was hoping to bulk up . I am 20 pounds over weight so I figured I would see some weight loss and lose some inches . A month in I was down one singular pound and no inches . I did notice increased cardiovascular endurance , but that was it.We dutifully went through the recovery week and slogged through 2.5 weeks of the second month before we quit . During the finally 3.5 weeks he lost more weight and an inch off of his waist and lost NOTHING . The workouts were way too long for us to waste our evenings on no results . Some nights we were spending an hour and a half on the workouts ... too long for something that is not fun and not producing results.Another thing I hated about these videos was Shaun T. His yelling and poor grammar -LRB- Legs is working ? Please respect yourself and speak properly . -RRB- were extremely demotivating .
 This dvd selection and workout is not for everyone . It is very hard and very fast paced . Even some of the people demonstating the video could not complete the workout . They focus on repetition as fast as possible . This does n't make sense to me because I have always been taught to focus on form so that you do n't get hurt . There is no way to keep your form in these workouts . Very expensive !
 I received the DVDs and none of them worked . I tried them on 3 different computers and 3 different DVD players . I attempted to contact the seller and never heard back . DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM GINA FOR LESS ! You will be throwing your money away like I did .
 Ok here it goes . If you have bad knees , shoulders , or any other body part then this is not for you . If you are already in shape then this will not get you in more shape . Insanity is just a cardio work out and it is difficult at time but there is nothing in the videos that you ca n't do on your own . For 30 to 60 minutes you will do mainly a leg , calf , thigh , and butt work out with some push ups and abs in there too . Many times through the videos some of the exercises repeat from previous workouts that you have already completed.My final statement is
 Ok I love the DVD itself , however , most of the dvd 's are scratched & wont even play :-LRB- Had I know this , i would have bought them directly from the Insanity website vs buying used off Amazon seller . I saved $ 40 but cant even use several of the disks , its very frutrating !! The workout itself is GREAT . I was working out prior 5 day week runner/walker for 40 min a day and this workout is definitely kicking my butt into bettter shape ! I love it !! If you 're going to purchase it , just dont purchase it from this seller ... Thats why i gave it 1 star .
 The Item got to my home fast , within a few days . The only issue I had was that some of the extra DVD 's were scratched up and would not play . The Item was cheap pricewise so I did not bother with returning it . The important DVD 's worked just fine . So over all I am pleased with my service .
 Pros :1 . Shaun T is motivational , and does n't come across as arrogant as Tony Horton . P90X and P90X2 are much better programs , but I think I 'd probably break the screen if I had to listen to Tony for 90 days . I tolerate him only in very limited quantities , maybe once a week or so . ShaunT is OK , although yelling Yo ! and talking about himself in third person -LRB- Even ShaunT needs a break -RRB- is mildly annoying sometimes .2 . It does improve cardiovascular fitness .3 . I suppose if you have weight to lose , it would contribute to wait loss . Ca n't tell from personal experience since I am on maintenance diet and do not wish to lose weight .4 . Eye candy . There are several guys with nice bodies . Women however in most cases do not have much of a muscle definition and have really puny arms . That should have given me a clue that this one is not really for me.Cons :1 . Insignificant upper body work . I 've added upper body training twice a week and additional yoga once a week , but that is just enough not to experience deterioration , I am not making any more progress with my pullups and advanced pushups -LRB- backclap for example , or hands on medicine ball , feet of stability ball pushups -RRB- .2 . Workout is rather imbalanced , can result in too strong quads and consequently tight calfs , hamstrings , and IT band . I am adding additional exercises to correct this , additional stretches and also some foam roller work .3 . Risk of injury - so far have n't injured myself , but I 've been doing plyometrics moves in other workouts for years . However , a friend who just started injured himself on Day 1 , fit test . Knee injury , it will take weeks to recover .4 . Stretching is inadequate . Shaun T is obviously not flexible enough , and stretches are too easy and incomplete . I normally add my own stretching .5 . If you are already fit starting this , you ca n't expect big progress , except maybe in exercises you don ; t do that often . My first fit test was
 Got this set brand new , and some of the DVDs do not work - pain in the ass to get them replaced . Searched online and apparently many people have this problem with Insanity . If you give it as a gift , you have to make sure people know all your info so they can get the replacement DVDs if they 'll even give them . I guess you have to just buy them yourself if you want them - and definitely do n't buy through a 3rd party !
 After my 3rd day of doing the Insanity workout , my opinion is ready to be shared . First of all , may I just say `` good for me '' because I can actually keep up pretty well with the crazies in the video well into the 3rd set . However , Ive decided that there is no reason why anyone -LRB- save an avid bball player , marathon enthusiast , or triathlete -RRB- needs to push the human body that much . Its the kind of workout my 5 ' 8 '' 115 lb former self would have LOVED for the mere fact that it is the perfect punishment for someone so chubby -LRB- I was warped in the brain -RRB- . PS ... Im currently weighing in at 135ish lbs , and thats just fine with me . While there are some really great super moves to be remembered and incorporated into a daily routine , there is just . no . reason to hurt the body the way Shaun T apparently thinks you should . Even the people who are in the video -LRB- and clearly in waaaaaaay better shape than I need to be -RRB- are literally screaming in pain to push themselves to the end . Why ?!?! It 's also kind of boring , to be honest . Its the same 5 or 6 moves over and over and over and over , and very little resistance training . Maybe when the zombie apocolypse happens I 'll wish Id gone through Insanity as it was meant to be , but until then I 'll stick with doing my favorite Insanity moves on a much more normal human level , P90-x , Jillian Michaels , yoga , jogging , and my friendly little eliptical .
 So far I have loved Insanity ... but would be nice if I could use all of the discs . 3 of the 13 do n't work , very disappointing especially after paying so much for it . My advice-buy from BeachBody.com !!! not some random seller .
 I am enjoying the Insanity program . It took about 3 weeks to get here though . Also , as I progressed into my workout , a couple of the ` new ' dvds would n't work on my computer . I had just taken them out of the packaging . Sometimes I would have to re-insert the dvd 10 times before it would work . Other dvds work fine . Anyway , I contacted the seller about a possible return and was informed they are no longer with amazon . This makes me feel like I was cheated .
 Workout is good but after using it a fewvtimes you know exactly what is coming , same warmups etc. it gets hard to motivate yourself to do it over and over
 Do not buy Insanity if you have any joint issues - shoulders , knees , etc. . The moves are high impact/high stress . I contacted the company by phone and email , several times , prior to my purchase decision , to find out if persons with joint issues should or should not buy . However , no reply was ever received . Unfortunately , I decided to try the DVD 's but am not able to use them ; a waste of $ 150 . Rather than direct a potential customer to another product and , thus , retain the customer , BeachBody has chosen to lose a potential lifetime customer .
 I was really excited to get this exercise video . I have been an avid fitness person for the last 25 years and have tried all kinds of workouts , so I was excited to try this one as it looked challenging . Now I wish I had never tried this exercise video . First week was good , very challenging , but I was getting a good sweat . Second week of videos , I injured my back ! Yes , that 's right , I sustained a bulging disc and facet joint injury from one of the jumping movements in the videos . These videos have lots of high impact , high jumping , fast twisting movements ... not very natural or safe movements looking back on it . While doing what they call `` Suicide Jump '' I fell to the ground and could not get up for a long time . I was in so much pain . Several days later , I ended up going to an ortho doctor , had an MRI , and was told I have a bulging disc pressing on my nerve with facet joint injury as well ! As I said before , I have worked out continuously for 25 years and am in good shape and have NEVER had problems with my back ! From what the ortho doctor told me , even though I am in shape , it was the way I came down in a twisting motion that caused the injury . I am now scheduled to have an oupt procedure next week where the doctor will be injecting a combination of cortisone and novacaine to hooefully reduce the inflammation around the nerve and reduce the pain . Although I am nervous about the procedure , I am ready for some pain releif . I have not been able to even get up without help all week.So be careful with these videos . Not to say this or any other injury will happen to everyone , but know that it could . I have another friend who was doing the Insanity workout as well and she had to stop doing the videos because her knees were killing her . These videos are very hard on your joints and many of the movements are very unnatural and risky for your body . Be careful !!!!!
 The good : It 's all body weight exercises , which means you can do it in your own living room with no equipment . This is wonderfully convenient.My cautions : First
 Bag seemed nice at first , but zipper teeth on shoe compartment broke within first 2 months . Handle seems rickety when fully extended and the locks dont keep the handle from retracting when pulling and pushing bag around . Would not buy again .
 It was not forxbox 360 It would not play . Grandson upset because he could n't . Play game.I will Deirdre this game .
 I Ordered NCAA 07 XBox 360 , Not Plain Old Xbox !? This Game is Incompatible With XBox 360 !!? I Want My Money Back !!!
 When i bought this game i was used to playing live 09 and 10 on the 360 . I like how realistic these games are . this game is nothing like that . It 's more like a `` street '' game so arcade style . Not really worth my time .
 This is a cheap pedometer . I ca n't speak for how well it works because it broke less than 10 minutes after I opened it . Setting it up was relatively easy . There are no labels on the casing . So once it was clipped shut , I had no way as easily identifying which side to open from . Sure enough , I opened up the wrong side and exposed circuitry . I snapped it back shut , but now it does n't work.It was my mistake to open the wrong side . But that would not have happened if the casing was clearly marked . How hard can it be to clearly identify the side to open ? How about using some labels?Let this be a warning when opening up this pedometer to check the readout . If you try the wrong side , it opens too easily and never works again . Poor design .
 I 've purchased this pedometer twice now , and both have died on me after around a period of 1-2months each . Maybe I 'm just unlucky and got a pair of duds , but really now ... that 's not acceptable by any standards . Aside from the horrid battery life on these things , the functionality is decent , simple , easy to use and setup . It 's fairly accurate as soon as you find just the right sensitivity settings for the environment you plan to use it.Final verdict , I have n't actually tried to replace the batteries yet , so I ca n't be sure if it 's a device failure or if it 's a battery failure . But I know for sure that I 'll be searching for a different brand . For you consumers out there , if you 're willing to risk having to replace the battery or possibly the whole unit , then this is a pretty solid cheap pedometer . Otherwise , I 'd recommend doing some research and going for something more reliable and overall better quality . I 'd love to give it at least 3 stars in rating for price and functionality , but having the device fail twice now , I ca n't give it any more than 2 stars .
 It did n't last long before it stopped working . We purchased 2 & both broke in a very short time . Extrememly dissapointed that this company made a pedometer that could n't stand up to normal wear . I wanted it to track my daily walking , & gym activity . Nothing unusual .
 This product was great when I first bought it ! It 's fairly accurate and super simple to work and adjust . The only problem I have with this product is that is stopped working after about 45 days of use . Even after 2 different battery changes , I could not get the product to turn on or keep count of my steps . It 's a great value for the price but if you plan on working out/monitoring your steps for an extended period of time , spring for the higher quality pedometer .
 I bought 2 of this for my grandparents as an upgrade to the ones they had from China . I chose this because it had a good price and a decent rating . But after receiving the product , the sensors turned out to be even less accurate than the old ones . I might have just have received defective units so I just simply returned the items with no hassle . Besides the sensors , the device looked nice and the usage was pretty intuitive . My grandparents would have totally liked the device is the main sensor actually worked .
 That is simply unacceptable ! Granted it 's not the most expensive unit out there but it should last more than a month.I did like it 's size and it was fairly unobtrustive and not hard to program or read -LRB- that gives it the extra star -RRB- As for measuring steps it is not as accurate as I wanted anyway . When compared to the treadmill and elliptical machines , both of which give readouts of what you 've done in your workout , this unit did not count all my steps . I wore it on the belt area/top of waist . It may be that mine was a dud and the battery was going from the beginning which is why the step count was off - but it really does n't matter . I 'm going to purchase a much better quality unit in the hopes it will last longer ! I can not possibly recommend this unit - although it does sound like others have had better experiences .
 Kept falling off my belt . Too complicated for what I wanted , which was a simple step counter . And the technology to actually count miles is dependent upon your own accurate measurement of the length of your own stride , which probably will change along with speed , hills , stairs etc. 65 years ago I got that by sending in a Cheerios box top to that company . Or was it Kix ?
 Could n't understand it . Took too long to figure it out and then it did n't count my steps that well . Would n't recommend .
 I do not recommend this pedometer . It is EXTREMELY difficult to set and read and is not very accurate . I was attracted to it because it in in a closed case -LRB- which a previous model was not and it proved to be a problem -RRB- , however , I still was n't able to obtain the information that I wanted from a pedometer .
 This pedometer is extremely inaccurate . It says you 've walked about 1/2 mile less than you actually have . I would not recommend it . What good is it if it can not keep accurate counts !
 This sign is not real plastic . Cardboard covered with plastic film . Not water proof . During recent rain fell apart . I do not recommend it .
 I ordered this koozie for a Christmas gift . When it arrived , it was a completely different koozie than is pictured above . It is a red collapsable koozie . Clearly , that is not what is pictured above . I sent multiple emails to the contact I was provided and have yet to receive any response . I am strongly disappointed in the customer service of this shop . I would not recommend ordering anything from this store .
 I went to the manufacturer 's site for these shorts and thought they sounded like they would be great . Upon receiving them and wearing them , the fabric is thin , the padding is thin , and they 're the only bike shorts I own that I ca n't wear to spin class due to the thin padding . I mountain and rode bike and was extremely disappointed in the quality of these shorts . Needless to say , I wo n't be purchasing another pair of shorts from this company .
 The product barley does any cleaning on the vinyl , but smells nice . Does NO restoration whatsoever . If you 're getting this to make you boat cushions look relatively new again , then do n't waste your time or money .
 I ordered this mug plus a Phillies mug . When I received them I found out that the company does not carry this mug . They never have . Amazon magically has a picture of this better mug . In its place the company sent out a very plain mug with nothing floating in the liquid . Beware of any mugs that look like this on Amazon!UPDATE
 But this is pitiful!I understand the difference between cheap and well made items , and I specifically got this because it was cheap and looked pretty neat . But two days after I got it the orange ring fell off . For no specific reason . It happened over the weekend , so I had n't even been at work to damage it or anything.Looks neat , but not worth the money , small amount as it is.Two thumbs down .
 I purchased a new boat , and this charger was put on at the factory . It did n't last 8 months , and it was n't used that much . Take my advice , do n't buy this model or brand !
 This is false advertising . Description says that it comes with additional Unottle and cover . It does not . Do not buy this as it is overpriced when you do n't get everything you paid for .
 Nice bag , but I bought the silver/black version and the waist straps ARE NOT removable . This is quite an annoyance since the waist strap is basically useless-it does not affect your load bearing and is barely functional . An earlier review said that the waist straps are ` velcroed ' in place . I must have the early version because my waist straps are sewn in place harder than a Yosemite tick . I would not recommend this pack .
 You real ca n't `` hinge naturally '' with this device . The hinge or the power angle should happen from the momentum of the backswing and pulling of the arms by your lower body movement on the downswing -LRB- compressed -RRB- . Check out some videos of Sergio Garcia on YouTube to get the best understanding.All it maybe really good for is check your positions at very slow pace or pausing.If you need it for that do what I did and find a knock off version on eBay for about $ 3 . This one by Swingyde is way over price . Otherwise I say do without it !
 Use instructions no clear . No explanation for what to expect when used correctly or incorrectly . Might try it later but I doubt it .
 It does what you 'd expect it to do , but I do n't find myself using it much . First , the plastic is really flimsy . Second , the main fault it is trying to fix can be done with a tee stuck between the pad of your palm and the grip of your club . Expected more ...
 I thought it was a piece of crap & i threw it in the garbarge , they ought to be put in jail for screwing people with that junk .
 IT IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED AND AS A GOLFER ITS NOT AIDING IN ANYTHING AS FAR AS MY GAME . THE ONLY THING IT AIDED IS TO LESSEN MY BANK ACCOUNT .
 This device was a cheap piece of plastic junk . I only ordered one and yet I was billed for two and did receive both but am totally dissatisfied with this product .
 Spend $ 30 for the hanger drill ? That is what you are buying here . Go get a 25 cent hanger , look up the hanger drill online and do the same thing . The hanger drill has been around a long time . This is a great money maker for Jim Flick , but he did n't create the idea . He did know a great drill and marketed , so hat 's off to him . But I will save my money and spend it on playing golf
 I 'll admit that I purchased the Swingyde based on the reviews i read . Bad mistake . I play golf at least once a week . In my opinion this is priced 25 bucks too much . It mainly helps you hinge your wrist on the back swing and nothing else . There is SOOOO much more to a golf swing than hinging your wrist ! My opinion - pass on this product and get some lessons - preferably an instructor that records your swing and analyzes it with you one on one afterwards .
 I bought this based on the reviews . But actually it did n't work for me at all . It is not worth it . The hinge between the club and your wrist is just one small thing in the whole golf swing . If you are a beginner , you should focus on grip , stance , tempo . During back swing , keep your head still , keep your right knee flex and keep your weight at the inner side of your right foot . This thing wo n't help you .
 Found it to be very akward and insructions were unreliable . Took me a while to ascertain that the opening was put on the grip and not on the shaft .
 I bought this based on the Amazon rating . I was hoping it would fix my swing . However , it does n't provide me with any feedback . Maybe my wrist hing is already where it needs to be . I also believe this to be overpriced for what you get . Changing clubs is tedious , luckily I have a spare 5 iron which I was able to set it up and leave it on .
 Received on time - but this is a total waste of money - do n't even bother - I would recommend taking a few lessons before buying this .
 I have read other reviews where people have said this straighted out their swing however , I did not like it . I am sure it works for some people but it just feels too odd for my taste . I am thinking about selling mine , brand new , only used once . It just was n't for me . I would rather keep buying range time .
 For the price the Swingyde is not worth the money . It is difficult to set up correctly , and it really does not give that much feed back . I forsee it breaking in the near future as it is literally a plastic piece of crap . Just goes to show golfers will buy almost anything in their quest for par . Save your money on this one .
 Maybe this can help some people , but to me it 's nothing more than a cheap piece of plastic that is way over priced . I tried it several times but for the life of me , I could n't understand why some of the golf pros would recommend this thing . Money , I suspect . Save your money and buy something that really works ...
 This was not the product I thought I was ordering . I was looking for an iron that breaks at a hinge when one 's swing is not correct . I would very much like to return this item . What do I need to do in order to return the Swingyde Club Swing Training Aid ?
 this product was shipped over a month ago and I have yet to receive it .
 ordered this and was not the right size as stated and the material is garbage wouldnt recommend to anyone . . returned it for refund and still have not recieved credit back to account for over a month . i would never but this again ... buyer beware
 I ordered the camo mini in a large size for women and it is more like junior sizing . Will keep it becos I do n't to hassle with a return for one item .
 Very disappointed it was made with thin material I have a clear plastic curtain behind it and u can see right through the NHL curtain I could have bought a better one at dollar general
 I had no problems with heel strikes with this bag . However , it is really flimsy and poorly constructed . On the very first day using it , I had problems with the corners of the bag hitting the spokes , making a horrible noise and shattering a reflector . The bungee cord came undone in about two weeks , which I managed to repair . A week later , the hook holding the bag in place tore off while I was riding , sending my bag into the middle of the road and under the semi behind me . Also when using the bag as a shoulder/messenger bag , which I had to do after recovering it once the truck rolled by , the hooks that latch onto the rack dig into your back in a less than pleasant way . NO GOOD ! ALL BAD !!!
 I might be using it incorrectly but there are two things I do n't like :1 . It is too wide and so my foot hits it on the upstroke .2 . The top flares open when carrying anything . I wish it had a strap to hold it together while riding . If I 'm missing something , please respond to this post and I 'll update my recommendation .
 If you hunting for a good , serviceable pannier , keep on looking . This bag sucks ! Here are the problems . The bag gaps open allowing things to fall out . Most bags of this type have some method for tightening the sides of the bag to keep things inside . This one does n't . There is a clasp attached at the bottom of the bag that will keep it shut completely . That 's fine if you have nothing inside . But , the clasp is absolutely useless once you have anything in the bag . The last straw broke for me today when the hook that attaches the bag to the bike rack fell off.Really , do that have low IQ monkeys designing for this company ? No , monkeys would probably realize that if they had to carry bananas in this bag that they would lose them . I would give it zero stars , if the rating existed .
 These t shirts are a real let down . For so long I have been a Hanes fan , until now . The shirts do not feel comfortable after washing , the fit is binding . The sleeves and bottom curl up , and to make matters worse , they sewed a white tag on the bottom , so when it curls up , the tag is exposed . I have ordered several Russell Atheletic t shirts that have a higher custormer rating . They should arrive soon .
 They switched out the order . This is clearly a short sleeved tshirt but they sent me two sleeveless shirts . What 's up with that ?
 I ordered a 3X t-shirt that turned out to be the size of a large ! The price was great . It was n't worth mailing back so will give it to a smaller person for a present .
 I bought two of them , in Large size , but when I opened the package i see two super xtra wide tshirts that says `` LARGE '' . I hate it . The colors is worst , different than the images that you see in Amazon .
 I ordered 7 of these shirts for my husband , and only 3 of them were 100 % cotton .
 My husband likes a tighter neck and this was quite loose . Also the ones I got were very lightweight by comparison to onehe already had which was quite heavy and the neck was snugger .
 I thought I was ordering a poly/cotton blend and it 's not . It is a 100 % cotton , thinly made , very short t-shirt .
 Sure its your average shirt , maybe I got unlucky . I washed mine once and the thread started to unravel on the bottom seam .
 I have worn Russell Tee shirts for years and found them to be well made from a fairly heavy material and they always lasted years . The `` Russell '' Tee shirts I recently purchased via Amazon , were cheaply made of a thin material that looks horrible after 1 or 2 washings . The shirts have the Russell name on them but they are like a cheap imitation .
 Having purchased both , it is well worth the extra five dollars or so for the cotton performance tee . The performance tee is soft and comfortable . The basic tee is unpleasant .
 The material is really bad and it does n't fit good . The sleeve are too big and it is short and is really no good . Do n't buy it ! WASTED MONEY
 First of all , UPS delivered a previous Amazon order to someone else other than my brother and it never showed up . I had ordered a sleep set for my brother and his wife . They stayed home waiting for the package that never came . I had especially wanted my sister in law to have the products that I ordered . That was a bummer . So I called Amazon and said that they were out of what I had ordered for her but they would send me another set for my brother . Well , UPS delivered it to the wrong address again to a neighbor . The neighbor opened it and then decided to take it to my brother several days after it was shipped . Well , the shirt I ordered was supposed to be Xlarge . The box his neighbor brought over several days after it was shipped contained a 2X shirt -LRB- I orderXL -RRB- . What happened Amazon ? Think you need to change from UPS to a company that can find the correct addresses . Very upset about all of this .
 I ordered these because they are cotton/poly blend . The three shirts I received are 100 % cotton . I am not a happy camper .
 Not as heavy as I 'd like , and not very good to wear under a dress shirt -LRB- logo is too prominent , and the sleeves are longer than a short-sleeve dress shirt -RRB- . To wear as your only shirt , it 's definitely not as heavy-duty . I got a great sale price on them , so it 's a fair deal ...
 Hi there , I still hav n't recieved this order . Please could you follow as to where it is . Thanks very much .
 You get what you pay for with these shirts . If only Russell had invested more money in quality instead of their fancy sleeve logo and lousy stamped neck tags . These shirts are 2 '' shorter than other T-shirts I own and thinner in quality . They wrinkle worse after drying than my other shirts . Overall , not terrible but was expecting better based upon the reviews here .
 Disappointing . The seller needs to do a better job of letting the customers know that the T-shirts sold on the same page are not all the same material . I wanted 100 % cotton . Two shirts were , the two others were cotton/poly blends . I also wanted size medium . The tent-like proportions of their mediums are ridiculous . It 's at least a size large , edging towards XL . They 're cheap so I 'm keeping them but I wo n't be buying this brand again .
 I wash all of our clothes in cold water to avoid shrinkage , but after a few washes this shirt lost a couple of inches and looks ridiculous .
 Russell made nice 100 % cotton t-shirts at one time.Not so anymore.This 100 % cotton tee that it claims to be is the thinnest tee I ever purchased.Fits lousy too.I attribute this to products being made in other countries instead of the USA.As long as corporate America keeps exporting jobs to people who do n't care about quality and cutting back on solid material to make the product this is what you get.I will never purchase the brand Russell again , period !
 I ordered this shirt in size 2XL , which is my normal t-shirt size . The shirt was 2XL , but was HUGE . Soft material , but so big it is awkward to wear . Very long for its size as well .
 these tee shirts just do n't seem the same quality as the Russell tees you buy at Sears , etc. . I bought them here because I am 6 ' 3 and it is hard to find the tall ones in the stores . These are too long - down below your butt . And the necks feel too tight . I would n't buy again .
 I 've worn Russell shirts for years and my last two are showing their age and need to be replaced . Unfortunately these shirts were not up to the quality of my past shirts . These shirts were made with a much thinner cheaper feeling cotton fabric and it did n't like it would stand up to the rugged beating my current shirts have taken over the years . Very disappointing , and I returned them . If only I could find the same type of Russel shirts as I 've purchased in the past .
 These are not the thick Russell T-shirts that I originally had and expected to get . Instead these are much lighter and a longer size . Very disappointed . I would return them but not sure how to order the thicker T-shirts that I was really looking for . If anyone knows please let me know !
 The shirt is ok for the price . I would not purchase it as a great quality shirt ! So that is what you are looking for do n't hesitate in purchasing it !
 If you 're looking for the good , thick Russell Athletic T-shirts , do not waste your time with these . These are not them . I have a drawer full of R.A. T shirts , they 're getting old . I wanted to replace some of them . I researched as best I could before buying these through Amazon.com . They came today . They 're no better than the run-of-the-mill , thin , budget T-shirts that you can buy at Walmart . I 'm sending the three I bought back .
 The most important thing about a cotton tee is that it NOT shrink in the vertical.Russel tee 's did n't used to and that 's why I buy them.This latest batch pretty much joins the pantheon of cheap crappy tee shirts that after the first wash are unwearable because they shrink until they do n't tuck into my pants and get so wide in the body they feel like wearing very short tent.Guess I 'm looking for a new brand .
 I have been buying Russell tees for years and they had the best High Quality thick cotton tee shirt for any price around . This is a company that has lost its way . I was very disappointed in this tee shirt and would not buy another one . Very thin !! Do not waste your money.Does anybody make a thick 100 % cotton tee shirt anymore ?
 Cloth was kind of rough to the feel so I washed it and it shrunk to a shorter size , so badly I will be sending it back
 This rescue knife is great ; providing all of the functions described . However , the sheath is so weak that it unbuckled frequently when moving around . After all of two weeks of using this knife , it has fell off my belt while on duty . The Sheath may have came with the knife for free , but it has now cost me seventy dollars . Very poorly made and disappointing from such a trusted company as Gerber.Let me add this is the first piece of equipment to have ever fell of my belt in many years of working ems .
 I bought one of these as a Christmas present for my husband to use in the car . It proved to be ineffective and failed to relieve his discomfort driving long distances . Now , alittle over a year later , it has a hole worn in the center . I will not be buying this product again .
 Not very well made nor designed . One side has a very flimsy cover which you can see the grey foam rubber waffle pattern through . This is the side you sit on , because the other side is a weave of grippy rubbery stuff that holds the cushion in place . Sitting on the waffle grille side is not very smooth -- I can find no evidence of any `` gel '' utilized in this product at all -- it is merely an open gridwork of pretty soft rubber with a flimsy cover . It is easy enough to compress the grillework between your fingers , so sitting on it flattens it out pretty quickly . Look at the picture with the cover peeled back -- that 's all there is to it . It 's really not a premium product and is certainly not worth the $ 60 Amazon advertises it for by another supplier . With shipping , this item came to over $ 40 , and it 's just not worth it in my opinion .
 The handle is listed as being aircraft aluminum , but it feels like hard plastic to me . I 'm a big fan of Kershaw knives , and I bought this for my brother-in-law for Christmas . I 'm pretty sure he would n't be thrilled with the handle , so I 'll return it and pick him up a different one !
 Shirt was not the same length as the other 14-16 size shirts of this type that my granddaughter has . Somewhat shorter and does n't stay tucked in as she would like .
 The Revell Big Boy is really a disappointment . If you are a railway hobbyist , try to buy a Bachmann or the like instead with far superior detailing and accuracy . The Revell is just a cheap representation suitable for kids . Its railing is moded with the boiler but with the space between the railing and the boiler blocked . The end result is like a pair of narrow wings on the boiler . Also , the brakes are missing . It makes the model very uncomfortable to look at . In fact the same problem with the Hudson , another one of the same series by Revell . After 20 years with the completed model , I still cant figure out how the make good the deficit . it seems one day I would have to throw it into the trashbin !!!
 I was browsing the internet for sites that contained electric model steam locomotives . The site that contains the `` Big Boy '' is one that is otherwise exclusively train set locomotives and other products . Nowhere does the description on the `` Big Boy '' say that it is a plastic non-working model kit . If I had wanted a model kit I would have gone to a site for model kits . Revell should not have this product listed on this site .
 Marinco 12VBRAD ConnectPro 12-Volt Charging and Trolling 6-Guage Wire Receptacle Adapter for Trolling MotorsAfter struggling with this item for an hour , it ended up in the trash . A complete waste of time and money . The receptacle size was inadequate for my 6 gauge wire , meaning that I had to trim off strands of wire to get a good bite and the wire coating does not fit into the boots so I end up with exposed wire outside the connector . Then trying to eliminate the exposed wire , I stripped the threads.Save your money and get a couple butt joint connectors instead . I 'd rate the is a 0 if that were an option .
 This is the first Gaiam yoga video that has disappointed me . The workout is a short 20 minutes . The actual workout is OK and it flows well and quickly , but the narration is poor . The audio is a few seconds delayed so that the instructor is ahead of what is being described . If the verbal instructions were unclear , I would look up at the TV and she would be on the next pose already . This is something that should have been corrected before releasing the tape . This just is n't up to the standards of the other Gaiam yoga tapes .
 Not a horrible deal for the discounted price but in a sign that manufacturers may be rushing these to production before states start to close the loopholes allowing them , there are some fit and finish issues -LRB- not a knife expert so do n't know the technical terms -RRB- : The mechanism , which is located at the join of handle and blade , has stops in it that grind a bit on opening and closing which makes me think that it might be a durability issue . It does n't seem to slow the opening speed noticeably but it 's odd.Related to the above mentioned mechanism location , the blade has some noticeable lateral play when open . Not something you would see with a conventional folder of this price.The safety lock is alternately sticky and loose leading to some interferance with opening and closing . Additionally , to unlock the blade for closing you push the lock forward -LRB- toward the blade -RRB- raising the potential for an accidental closure if really bearing down on a project.When locked closed the blade still has enough play to extend out about 3/16 of an inch beyond the handle making it a potential pocket cutter.On the plus sides it is attractive and the blade is quite sharp.So sort of okay for the price but not as tight as it should be and obviously a `` bandwagon '' release that is meant to capitalize on the trend . I 'm looking for a 2.5 '' assisted that I can give as a gift and this is n't it . I have a 3.5 '' SOG that is double the price but is also rock solid -LRB- SOG mechanism is a bit slower but strikes me as being less prone to wear as it is piston-based -RRB- and does n't have any of the cons listed above . Have a Camillus coming so I 'll be interested to compare .
 Most snowboard boots i 've used use a liner or are seamless on the inside . These are not . The are where they sewed the lip on protrudes on the inside of the boot . They dig into your toes and the top of your foot . Making for a very painful run down the mountain .
 I bought this inner tube based on the positive reviews for using it in water . It is only big enough for a child -LRB- about 90 pounds -RRB- ... worse though , is the pin where you pump in the air . It is enormous , about 4-5 inches big , and is likely to dig into the back of even of a small child . If you think you 're buying an inner tube like you 'd find at a water park , THIS IS NOT IT .
 If you are expecting a large Truck inner-tube you will be disappointed.Do not go by pictures in the product listing.This is much too small for even a small adult to use .
 The write up mentioned good for snow sledding . It is absolutely not . The tube was thin and small . My young children could not even hold themselves up because the tube was too small and close to the ground .
 Despite the small size when not inflated the tube can get fairly large . I inflated mine to about 3.5 ' in diameter . PSI does not really play a role here , since there is no tire around it . I tried finding what the recommended PSI rating is but was n't able to ... I do n't think it applies.The tube popped on me half way through our adventure at Harpers Ferry on the Potomac . Not sure if the tube is really to blame , the water was fairly low and I did hit a few large rocks . These tubes also deform fairly easily , and are not very comfortable to ride . This was my first tubing trip on an auto inner tube and we all got fairly bad arm rashes from paddling.If I had a chance , I would definitely `` splurge '' and spend the extra $ 8 for one designed for water tubing exclusively , and maybe also purchase a cheap canoe paddle . Because of the deformity , rash and having to walk 4 miles back to the car , I rate this 2 stars for water tubing purposes .
 If your planning to use this as a floating devise say to shoot the rapids in the river then you better get something bigger . It is way to small for an adult .
 I ordered two tires through amazon . One of them split open on a seem within two weeks . This was a complete waste of money .
 I had a lot of fun with this for about 2 hours . We used it while sledding and built a big ramp out of snow at the bottom of a hill . The innertube worked better than the other sleds we had available to us . It seemed pretty tough , but it was easily slashed open by a small twig . Do n't use this for sledding if there 's a chance that you 'll be running into anything hard .
 These tubes are way too small for anyone except someone 5 years or under . Not suitable for river tubing , look more like bike tubes ! Picture is deceptive .
 These socks are n't as good as my other ua products . I wear a size 10 in men 's shoes and have narrow feet . In all my other ua socks , I wear a lg . The toe box area in these socks is too loose and the material is n't as comfortable as ua normally is . My calves are med sized , and the top of the sock is too tight and does n't expand that much . Overall , subpar -LRB- by ua standards -RRB- product . Would buy again at a clearance price . The seller on the other hand was good . Fast shipment and great updates . Thanks again amazon for a very good buying experience .
 I ORDERED NAVY SOCKS AND GOT WHITE SOCKS ... MY HUSBAND NEEDED THESE SOCKS FOR HIS FOOTBALL GAME AND THIS IS WHAT HE RECIEVED . THANKS
 these were -LRB- just -RRB- ok , although socks are socks ... these socks are very slick on the outside . If you are at a higher level of competition and make hard cuts , these will give you blisters even if your soccer boots are well broken in . I gave them 5 good washes after the initial use , and then used them again , and still I got blisters ... . I do n't get blisters with other brands -LRB- in the same shoes -RRB- , sorry under armour I wo n't buy your soccer products again !!!!
 I ordered Under Armour Allsport Socks size Large and Navy blue . I received white XL socks . I 've worn the white socks once and -LRB- of course -RRB- they are stained from the infield dirt .
 For my team we all ordered these socks . I found the only good thing about them is that they have an Under Armour logo . wearing them is a totally different story . They are uncomfortable and thin . They cause feet to sweat even before any physical activity . In a 30F game my feet still sweat . After you sweat in them they will just get slippery and cause one to slide in the cleat , loosing speed and agility .
 these socks are hot , not exactly comfortable for work in combination with tennis shoes.Your feet will likely sweat . Im going to go back to clima-cool .
 Hi , I bought this watch on ebay brand new about three weeks ago -LRB- did not even realized it was women 's watch -RRB- . For the record I live in Chicago , US - so I 'm sure I have plenty of satellites over my hadOk here it goes . The manual says it takes about 5 minutes to connect watch to satellite first time or if you move from your location by hundreds of miles - well ; it took me over sixty minute to connect first time . The manual say every next time you turn it on it takes about 45seconds - it takes me every time about 15 minutes when I try to connect each day.Then when I jog this over glorified stop watch disconnects from satellite on average every 60 seconds . And if you happen to be in stopwatch/distance mode it will not beep to let you know that you are disconnected . So you have to look at this dam watch every 15seconds to see if the mileage updates.Speaking of `` dates '' the time does not displays correctly ether . It has dual time zones , but one shows correct date but hour is way off and the other shows time with one hour difference but date way off.They advertise it to be water resistant up to 100 meters - but the manual say
 Ugh . I have been using this watch for over a month and have yet to have it work correctly . I have already had to glue the transmitter piece back together . If I do manage to find a connection I had better be careful not to run within 10 miles of the nearest ground projection or the satellite connection will be broken . Any stray wispy cloud or piece of floating cottonwood can cause the satellite connection to be lost . I love how the literature says it is great for hiking . Maybe above the treeline and cloud cover . So , if you are planning a trip to the top of Mount Everest , this may be the watch for you . Otherwise , save your money and your sanity .
 Does not work well with my GSG 522 's plastic magazines . Unlike the real bullet the tail end of these have edges which catches at the top bullet -LRB- exit -RRB- portion of the magazine which causes pitting in the -LRB- plastic -RRB- magazine , thus causing these or the real bullets to jam .
 I 've read investigative reports that many companies hawking wares on the web these days hire professional writers -LRB- `` Shills '' -RRB- to post favorable reviews on Web sites like Amazon . I believe this may be the case with `` White Lightning Trigger Bicycle Cleaner '' . Here 's my story : The cleaning mechanism of this chain cleaner fits onto the rim of an aerosol can in an improbable manner . Using it requires the skill of a contortionist . You must hold the can in your left hand , press the dispenser button at the top with one finger , hold the spring-loaded trigger that closes the mechanism with another finger and keep the contraption in line with the lower chain -- all while turning the crank with your right hand!In truth , you will only get to this point if you are able to successfully assemble the product in the first place ! The device first needs to be set-up . A `` straw '' connects the dispenser nozzle on the can to the cleaning device attached to its rim . This tube looks like the straw from a can of WD-40 . The stiff plastic tube does n't have the flexibility to make the sharp `` S '' bend needed to complete the connection . Attempting to complete this attachment invariably results in the dispenser button popping off the top of the can!Oh , did I mention that the plastic straw does n't fit into the spray-can nozzle ? You 'll have to use a small tool to widen the hole on the nozzle before you can get started.After nearly 30 mins of tinkering and increasing frustration , I finally realized I 'd been had.Although Amazon 's return policy does n't cover flammable aerosols -LRB- like this one -RRB- , when I recounted my story the customer service agent , Lisa was kind to issue a refund on amazon 's dime.My advice to anyone considering ordering this product online is `` do n't '' . Ask a local bicycle shop to demonstrate it to you before buying . If you ca n't find any local bicycle shops that carry this stuff or willing to demonstrate it - take it as fair warningMy hat goes to Amazon for their handling of this issue .
 I agree with the other reviewer
 Requires three hands to operate because the force of the lubricant pushes the tube out of the spray head , so it takes one hand to crank the pedals , one to press the spray tip , and a third to hold the feed tub in place .
 This product is a total waste of money . The ring is so uncomfortable and does nothing but cause bruises . If you decide to order , do not order from the company directly as they will give you a `` free '' upgrade to the automatic monthly shipment of their vitamin supplement . When you call to try to cancel the `` free '' $ 26 per month service , you are left on hold forever and when it finally gets through you are hung up on . This company needs to be put out of business !
 I am a personal trainer and I bought this for my home collection . The video is only 15 minutes long and has ZERO pilates . It has a chest press , tricep press , couple of ab moves , and leg raises . THATS IT !!!! The whole thing is a joke . I think lighting my money on fire would have been a better use for it .
 I saw this ad on TV today and about to purchase from here at Amazon instead of zone Pilates ' web site . I kept reading reviews and one reviewer -LRB- Evelyn from FL -RRB- mentioned that the ring would not stay on the body . Actually , I was thinking the same . I was about to purchase and saw s/h fees -LRB- about $ 15 -RRB- . Also her `` Keep on looking '' and I did . I found out `` Everlast for Her Pilates Fitness Ring with DVD '' here at amazon for only $ 14.99 -LRB- ASIN
 I just got mine 3 days ago . I can see that it might help toning the areas . And the video is not annoying . What is a problem is the WONDERFUL bruising on my legs where the device sits for the workout . I did n't purchase this item for weight loss , I thought it would help for toning . But the bruises , while they may go away with continued use , are not worthe the $ $ . I am sending mine back today . Sorry !
 be forwarned , that this is more for isolated toning legs , arms , shoulders.hips , rather than pilates workout . does not strengthen the core muscles like pilates does and may weaken them . The trainer on the dvd has flabby abs , and thick torso , rather than long lean muscles and core muscle strength that is usually found when doing pilates workouts . i found the equipment bulky and awkward to use , hard to hold my body in good alignment and almost impossible to do the exercises from my power center , very disappointed in dvd training that accompanies the set . and serious questions about whether this routine weakens the abs , after my experience with it and seeing the condition of the abds of the trainer . It is not up to the caliber of what I have come to expect from pilates . also feel there is risk of injury related to difficulty of holding body in correct alignment , as equipment kept slipping down or up . Need to go back to the drawing board on this one , there are better , less expensive , better made options out there , with better training . Keep on looking .
 This is one of the worst investments I have ever made . I have been using it for a few months now and all I have to show for my time and effort are bruises !!!
 I purchased this from the TV AD , When I got it I was very excited , put the DVD in right away and was totally disappointed . Not only did the lady on the DVD have a frumpy body but the exercises where a joke . I thought `` no big deal , not to surprised as it was cheep '' that was until my credit card kept getting billed for some subscription that I never signed up for . I know what your thinking `` read the fine print '' only problem is there is no fine print . No where do they tell you that you will be paying enormous shipping and handling charge along with a $ 29.00 per month subscription . I would not recommend this to someone I hated , let alone someone I liked .
 I 'm a bit disappointed with this purchase . I bought 3 size 5 balls on 9/20/08 specifically to use during my daughter 's home soccer games . One ball for the field and one ball placed at each goal . During the game , the players noticed the ball kind of wobbled when it was kicked . Our coach asked where I bought them , later told me these balls were the cheapest in the market , and soon would breakdown . I stored the soccer balls in my garage and used it about 2 weeks later . All the balls were flat and needed to be pumped . I was kind of surprise of the quality and even more so , embarrassed to use these balls for our games . I 'll eat this loss but , why should you ? Keep shopping .
 olso this Item is not arrive the many been paid for all the item but some of it is not shown please leet know whats happen and whay all this dailay .
 Yeegods ! the lines on this board are so narrow , they are hard to find close up ! This board is definitely for a player who wants to go pro or is a pro ! Otherwise , it is much too difficult for the average weekend player . Returned it for the Bandit Plus .
 The hinges were missing the screws . The cost to send it back was more than the item . I got screwed but not the screws .
 Why replace poorly made hinges with new poorly made hinges that will break just like the original ones did ? I thought about replacing them with Coleman stainless steel hinges , but with shipping they came to almost $ 20 . So I went to Lowe 's and bought a set of Gatehouse 3-inch brass hinges for $ 2.98 . It takes 6 screws , so I used the original four plus two 3/4 inch self-drilling pan Phillips screws . It works great ! To hold the lid upright , I loosely installed an additional screw on the side of the lid and another on the side of the cooler , connected them with a piece of speaker wire , then cinched up the screws . A great , permanent fix for three bucks .
 good knife but hundred bucks for `` made in taiwan '' ? no thanks . ordered it for my friend and decide to order one for me if I like it but will search for something made in USA .
 The knife was fine when received . But SOG makes some of the worst sheaths in the industry . Case in point the kydex sheath that came with the knife . It was so tight I could n't get the knife into it . Do n't they ever test these things at the factory ? I had to take an automotive screwdriver and cram it down into the sheath and work it back and forth to get it to loosen up so the sheath would accept the knife . I still do n't have it right yet . By the time I also worked the knife back and forth to get it to fit it lost its edge and I 'm going to have to get it sharpened . SOG needs to work on their sheaths and put a little more effort and workmanship into them . It 's a continual problem I 've encountered with their fixed blade knives .
 Dear Potential Customers , I am a college tennis player , and I dont want to sound bais for the players who are not a hard hitter , but I am . If you are a player who is a hard hitter , dont and I telling you again , dont buy this racquet . It is very light . In one of my tennis matches the strings did not broke , but it was the handle that broke in half . Also the racquet could not handle the impact of the ball , which made my shots miss some of mph , which experienced players knows could make a world of a difference in a match . When you play against other power players with this racquets the impact of the ball pushes you back , and prevents you from being in control in the rally , and your on the defense all the time , which is very annoying . My average serve is at 105mph . With this racquet it was at 85mph , and the impact was not good on my wrist . Again I know that many raquets handle are made of wood , but the wood on this handle is extremly light and cant take much force . I am telling you the truth.My sister has the same racquet and she still has it till this day because she is not a power player . This is not an agressive racquet . Also it has a very oversized frame . It lasted 2days for me.The best racquet I have ever played with is the Head TiS2 . Nothing beats that racquet . Unfortunately Amazon dont have it . I think it is the only racket that is in between for a power player but also provides the best control . Also the TiS2 is very affordable at 70dollars or less . I was looking for an upgrade and I thought the TiS5 was the best solution . Not True .
 The string is broken after one month play -LRB- I play 4 hours every week -RRB- I need to string the racquet myself now , which cost me another 20 bucks
 I did n't like this racquet at all . Too much power . Any small amount of force you use , goes out of bounds . I was trying to modify my swing style and holding the racket not to the edge , but somewhere in the middle to hit with less force , but still could n't get it to work for me .
 seller promised restrung racquet . However , it came with the original string . Went to Dick 's sport and compared with the orignal string . There is no difference . The string snapped after 3 weeks . Unfortunately , it is high school tennis season so can not return it . Have it restrung at a local store . Kept the original string and planning to go through Amazon to issue a complaint .
 The product look fantastic , but after trying it out I was more sore then ever . My quest for a comfy female seat continues : -LRB-
 This pedometer did not work right out of the package . My husband calabrated it i put it on my pants and just doing that added 12 steps . I walked around the house counted 35 steps and the pedometer showed 75 . There was something inside the device that was lose you could hear it rattle around . I had one from another company for 4 years and never had this problem . Would not get this brand again .
 This is something my husband has asked for because of his outside job always made his coffee get cold to quick . It looked really nice and definitely kept his coffee hot , but then coffee would taste like the inner plastic liner after the first 5-10 minutes of being plugged in . Then after 2 weeks of use the charger port became loose and it would no longer work . It was n't worth my time and money to ship back for a replacement ... I just wo n't buy from that company again . .
 These shoes are suppose to be designed for kung fu/martial arts . However , they are not designed to withstand the abuse of a regular class , much less completion or sparring . The material is thin and tears easily . The outer edge that should cushion under you ankle is rigid and prevents comfortable mobility , forcing you to move as if you are walking on glass . Also , the exhorbitant restocking fee leaves you with the option of returning the shoes for a dollop of a refund , or keeping the shoes as unique bookends . I now use them to throw at stray cats in my yard . They are very effective used in that manner .
 These shoes are good looking ; but , are of a lower quality that the Aididas and Otomix martial arts sneakers . Very little arch support and the seams are not welded at high quality .
 Up to today 's date 04/11/2006 , I still have not received this item even though my credit card was charged and the item was ordered three months ago
 The tent sets up extremely easy -LRB- except for below -RRB- and has plenty of room . The material seems to be decent quality but here are the issues ... We were setting up the tent and one of the poles refused to fit through the channel . After further inspection , where there was additional stitching for one of the hooks , they had sewn in to the channel , not providing enough room for the pole to slip through properly . A hair dryer and a little patience and I was able to get the pole through . For such an expensive purchase , a little quality assurance would go a long way.Now the tent is set up , I notice there is a `` push '' in the top netting , its not really a rip but the netting is defective in one spot . I guess nail polish would stop it from ripping but why should I be worrying about this on a brand new tent?Just a note ... if there is low lighting behind the tent , you will see shadows . So if you are sitting on the pot or taking a shower and rub a dubbing , you can see shadows from the outside.And finally ... While taking down the tent and GENTLY and I do mean GENTLY removing the poles , one of them gets hung up on the threads -LRB- the same threads that were sewn in for hooks -RRB- and the bungee snaps with no effort at all . What the heck?That was the last straw , back it goes.Amazon did great as usual . Fast shipping and willing to exchange or refund my purchase.Edit
 If I were to buy a shower/outhouse again I would not pay the extra money for this one . They claim one person can set it up in 5 minutes but in our experience we ca n't set it up with 2 people in 5 minutes . The sleeves that the poles go through are so tight it is a struggle to get the poles through . There was really nothing about this unit that really impressed me and there are other versions that are only a fraction of the price .
 On the positive , a very well made shower tent . The negative is the very difficult assembly . I can assemble my six person tent in half the time . The rod couplers are too big for the tent sleeves making it almost impossible to slide the rods up to the top of the tent . This is even worse when you attempt to remove these rods as you can not pull them out from the base without binding up each coupler and separating the rod.Had I not used it I would return it .
 They announce five brushes in the photo , and speak in the plural of the characteristics of these brushes , but it is really a marketing trick . It 's just a brush and it is junk ...
 I bought this hand exerciser & within the second day the valve blew out with a hiss . I continued to use it , but by the 5th day I wore a hole in the ball itself . I was going to take it back , but could n't find the receipt , of course , so was stuck with a flat leaky ball . I threw it away in the garbage where it belonged in the first place . Very disappointed .
 There are some mixed feelings on this product . I love this product if it holds air . I have ordered 4 of these so far and 2 of them did n't hold air that includes the last order . I 'm debating to return and order another one or just forget about whole thing .
 The designation of this axe/hatchet as a Campers Axe is totally misleading for those of us that spend any time in the bush . This is a very very heavy hatchet . It is a great tool , but not if you have to carry it on your back for 16-20 miles . While I like it and use it on my farm , it is anything but a camper 's tool . I have n't weighed it and Eastwing does not give a weight on their website , but I would never take this tool into the bush for camping -- it is just too heavy . For less weight , I would go to a 26 inch axe like the excellent Council Tool 26 inch Hudson Bay Axe which also is coincidentally considerably cheaper . The Hudson Bay Axe has a 1.75 lbs head which probably puts it around 44 ounces total weight . Or , if you want to stay with a steel handle , get its bigger brother -- same head but with a 26 inch handle -- which will allow more wood processing with less work at a very slight increase in overall weight -LRB- approx 60.8 ounces . While its big Brother weighs more in total weight and this axe/hatchet it actually feels lighter -- most likely because of the balance with the longer handle.Because of its heavy weight , this `` campers axe '' is suitable for car camping , but nothing more . In reading some of the sterling reviews and the high ratings I really have no idea what they are talking about . Let 's see all these reviewers that gave it a five star review take this on five days of 20 mile per day hikes and then see how much they like it -- I guarrantee you they wo n't be giving it such high reviews at the end of their little jaunt -- LOL !!!
 I bought this axe because I wanted an indistuctible camp axe . And with legendary estwing performance I was sure this axe would fall into line with the other products that I have purchased . However out of the box this axe was as dull as a child 's toy . As I was gently using it to split some wood the axe accidentally hit the ground . The dull blade chipped . The steel is so hard that it is brittle . I have worked for hours trying to fix the edge . Very hard to hand sharpen . The axe is way to heavy for bushcraft . This one item will not change the legendary performance that I have experienced with estwing .
 If you take this on a 3 day hiking trip , you might be a goober , but you 'll definitely be sick of carrying it . Just saying ... I think its to small to call it an axe , but bigger than any hatchet I 've ever seen . Should have gone to Lowe 's and bought the one in the hammer isle . Well , after sending this thing back , that 's what I did , but I wish I would have done it first .
 Bought this for my brother in law who is a coach . This product looks much better online ... very cheap in person .
 Bought these based on the other 2 reviews . Guess I got the bottom of the barrel , almost all are used logo balls , at least 20 % are quite definitely ` used ' , a few are what I expected -LRB- basically new -RRB- . I 'll not try to send them back , I 'll just use them for practice or something . Disappointed.Added next day - OK , after putting these on the back shelf I decided to examine each one . Here 's the breakdown - 17 are almost new -LRB- logos -RRB- , 6 are OK , and 13 are too worn for me to put in play . Half are red Big Berthas , half blue . So , 23 balls for $ 30 , still cheaper than new I suppose , just . Still , not as advertised .
 The mechanics of the ball retriever are sound , and it works really well capturing and retrieving golf balls from water hazards . My problem with the product is that the retrieving ring sheared off of the wand before I had had it a month .
 A few weeks ago I ordered a swiss army knife and it was not the one I wanted . I called the company that I had ordered it from and they said to send it back and they would try to get me the model I wanted . I asked for an RA number and they said I did not need one . This was a mistake because it has been weeks and I have not heard anything . My credit card was charged for thirty some dollars and I do not have anything to show for it .
 Despite their claim , these do n't float , and that 's the only reason I bought these . Lost one the first time I went out and I 'm still peeved .
 it did not sound any thing like an owl , more like a horn for ` Happy New Year party &#34; it scared my cat away .
 While these socks were cosy they were completely unusable for skiing as I could not pull them up under my boots without cutting off my circulation ! I am a size 14 - with average legs - I think - and these were impossible - had to wear them folded down .
 The designs on this one are way too intricate and the tools are not sharp enough to get the job done . We kept losing parts of the pumpkin and only got one to turn out .
 Width is great . No problems for fellow pumpkin heads there . Two major problems . As another reviewer said , it needs more `` vertical depth '' . It sits a full 2 inches above my ears . It 's like wearing a party hat . The other problem , it has no padding . There are a couple of things that look like pads , but they are too thin . At that , they are not held on very well at all . Because of this lack of padding , the helmet is very uncomfortable . Because of that , I do n't have mine on tight but rather loose . Not good for safety . It 's OK for the time being while I search out another helmet , but that 's it .
 My head is not way big , just about a 7 1/2 hat size . The extra large size of the Triton is fine in the summer . Problem is I also ride in the winter which means a hat underneath is necessary . The idiots who designed this helmet made the straps way too short . Can not use this helmet in the winter unless I want to freeze .
 Hogue seems 100 % obsessed about adding finger groves to every gun in the world . Nifty idea , but how exactly does one go about putting groves in the right place for every hand?I 'm a man with XL paws . Petite women have tiny hands . Yet Hogue lives in some fantasy land where they believe it 's magically possible to position finger groves such that they fit all hands.Welcome to the real world where that 's not going to happen.I do n't need groves to tell me where to put my fingers . I can hold a gun perfectly well without groves and would much prefer a grip without groves .
 We bought these for our boat to secure the shore power cords on the dock . They are really difficult to use b/c it requires too much elbow grease to push the cord into the holder . I do not recommend product for others -- there are other solutions in the market .
 THE PICTURE OF THIS SKATE IS NOT WHAT YOU GET I ORDERED FOR MY SON AND THE LOGO ON THE HEEL IS NOT ON IT AND THE WHEELS HAVE LIKE SPOLK HOLES ALL AROUND THEM AND WHEN YOU RECEIVE THE SKATES THEY DO NOT HAVE THIS AND THE WHEELS ON THESE SKATES WERE USED VERY DISAPPOINTED
 I 'm a big guy , 6 ft and 260 lbs . When you order a set of size 12 skates , it 's game on ... your skates should be able to handle a larger guy.Overall , these skates are a fairly disappointing venture . Though to be fair , I do n't have much money in this pair . I was fortunate to only have spent under Twenty-Eight dollars -LRB- $ 28 -RRB- on this , by some strangeness in the size 12 selection.Let 's start with the bearings . It 's been said before ... chuck them . To that I 'd say , heck yeah . These were a mixed bag of ABEC-1 and ABEC-3 bearings , none of which would go around 1 revolution on a free spin . Add to that , each of the outward facing bearings on each wheel looked like it had been hammered into place . Hard ! The bearing race of each outside bearing had been caved in and some bad enough to intrude into the bearing race , rendering a poor bearing totally unusable . I replaced all with Bones China Red at about Thirty-Five dollars -LRB- $ 35 -RRB- . Next , the wheels . They are poorly made , some being mis-cast where the bearings go so that there is extra material that I had to carefully trim away . Some have significant side-to-side sway when spun and looked at from the front/back , all had visible up and down motion due to being out of round when viewed from the side while spinning . They will need to be replaced as well at an average cost of Fourty dollars -LRB- $ 40 -RRB- for a set , plus shipping , but I have n't had the chance yet . It 's bad enough that the skates get a shimmy to them at speed , the feel like your car just got a flat tire.Aluminum trucks look pretty solid , actually . The Vinyl boots were alright , though the tongue is only a single ply sheet of cut Vinyl . I 'm not expecting that to last.On the maiden voyage , with the new bearings , they were actually pretty fast . However , they did have a very strong tendency to want to pull the feet away from the centerline , and I found it almost impossible to just skate on one foot without the skate taking me on a pronounced curve towards that foot . Though it could in part be the fault of the wheels , it 's hard to tell if it 's just how the truck plate is mounted.In summary , I tried to get off cheap so while it was worth a shot , I 'm not sure I want to invest in wheels and experiment with these further . It is a darned shame that real skates like Riedell are monster expensive . *** update 8/2012 *** I did go for new wheels all around , at a cost closer to $ 80 total . So
 I ordered this as a birthday gift for my husband because he specifically asked for the Chicago Roller Skates 805 series . The package arrived quickly a little too quick . They sent me the 400 series which I could of purchased cheaper elsewhere . I was highly disappointed especially since the picture shows a Chicago 805 skate . Use discretion when ordering unless you do not care what your getting .
 As the title suggests , these skates are very uncomfortable around the ankle . Even with the addition of multiple pairs of socks it there just is not a good fit . In addition , the skate is a lot heavier than your standard pair . Let 's just say I 'm searching for another pair if you 're thinking about purchasing these bad boys .
 I was so excited after reading all these reviews . A $ 22 great board . Well , the good thing about the board is just that , the board . It 's made of good material and heals nicely . The metal is way to thick which encourages bounce backs , the color of the numbers are nearly unrecognizable . That 's no big deal , I painted mine white . There was about 1/16 th inch gap between metal and board which ridiculous . It ca n't simply be re-anchored ... because ... It was all warped and so something was inevitable to be `` off '' . I gently removed it and took a picture . If I had to do again , I would probably buy the same board . Obviously , I 'm one of the unfortunate . Oh , mounting instructions would have helped . 3 nails a few screws and some bracket I had to figure out .
 Until I purchased my last rod , a St.Croix , I fished exclusively with Shimano and , with the notable exception of the Syncopate , I can not complain about Shimano . The Syncopate , though , is a different matter . I tried three separate times to line this reel up and each time the line came loose and , as a result , line was pulled out with no drag at all and the reel could not pull the line back in . I attempted to contact Shimano about the problem and received no reply . After abandoning the Syncopate , I bought a Shimano R2000 reel for $ 10 . It is remarkably smooth and I am getting better cast distances from the $ 10 R200 than from the $ 40 Syncopate .
 I had no problem getting the saw into postion , but once there it had a tendancy to flip over if I was n't careful , and then eventually get stuck in its own cut . The learning curve is quite long with this tool , and at its best it works poorly . I found myself using the saw to cut into my branches a couple of inches -LRB- until the saw got stuck beyond removal -RRB- then I used a long rope and my car to pull at the branches to force them to the ground . If you are dealing with large branches , and are desperate , it is worth a shot .
 I bought this product thinking that it would be great to use to cut down some broken tree limbs that are somewhat high up . On paper , the saw looks awesome ; in real life , it sucks . It takes a while to heave the bean bag over the proper branch and get the blade in the right spot , and if the chain happens to be upside-down , you 'd have just as much luck yanking the rope down and re-throwing the bean bag as you would managing to flip the blade over . Once you have the blade in place and it 's right-side down , it 's pretty difficult to actually get the cutting rythym started . One note - if you do somehow manage to get a rythym going the blade cuts surprisingly well . However , if you get part way through the branch and pull one side of the rope down too far , which is pretty easy to do , the blade will no longer be in the `` groove '' you just cut but the rope will . The trouble here is that the end of the rope is crimped where it attaches to the blade and it 's too big to fit back into the groove . Therefore simply pulling down on one side of the rope in an attempt to get the blade back where it should be does n't work . Pulling the whole thing down and trying to throw the bean bag back over the branch in the exact same place and having the blade end up in the groove is also virtually impossible . I actually got a ladder out and climbed to the very top of it just to hand place the blade where I wanted it so that I could climb back down to `` safety '' and continue my cut . I found that having an extendable golf ball retriever was useful in moving the rope around and getting it untangled from other smaller branches.Bottom line for me - 3 hours later I had climbed my ladder about 7 times and had managed to cut one branch that looked sloppy because it splintered and broke once I was about 80 % of the way through the top ... The overall quality of the saw is pretty good , so if you 're bored and have a tall ladder and a golf ball retriever , tell your neighbors to grab a few beers and watch as you entertain them with your fight against unwanted branches .
 Does n't work like intended , but after hours it grabbed the limb so I could use my chainsaw to cut it and pull it down . I had to go the hardware store and replace the flimsy clip because the sand bag kept coming off with each throw . I can use it , but not as it was intended . Thank goodness it was on sale .
 I did not have a good result with this saw.I tried to cut a 3 '' limb about 20 feet above the ground.The chain was so flimsy that , even though the one end is weighted so the teeth face down at that one end , the chain itself twists along its length so that just the side of the chain rubs on the branch without actually cutting any wood.After bring the saw down on the ground , I held the 48 '' long chain stretched out between my hands and found that it easily twisted 180 degrees along its length with a very light twist of my hands . This product needs a more substantial chain so that it does not twist , and it would also help to just put cutting teeth on both sides of the chain , in addition to orienting the cutting teeth in both forward and backwards directions , and also a sideways direction if that is possible .
 I had a high limb with a very difficult throw but managed to get the rope over the limb . In the proceess of cutting first ther crimp fitting on the end of the rope where I attached extra rope and where the tossing bag goes failed ... had to retie and retoss it over a difficult limb . afet getting it on the limb the second time and got to cutting , about 1/3 of the way though a 8 inch limb the ropes crimp fitting at the end of the blade failed !! I pulled it down and also noticed the crimp fitting on the other end of the chain was about to fail too . Packaged it up and returned it for a refund.My advice if you are going to use this on anything but a small branch with any easy throw to reach it is to redo the ropes at all the ends where the cheap , weak , factory crimp fittings are but better advice would be not to buy it .
 Well I had high hopes for this product . It seemed like a great idea and a money saver . I needed to cut a branch off a tree causing problems with my hughes and dtv dishes . Well I bought the 48 inch and the suggested slingshot . I then bought fishing line to use as a lead because you can not shoot the weight and line included , they to heavy . I tied the line to a bolt and shot it over the branch and then tied the rope on and pulled it over . Everything is now in place and the handles are attached to the ropes . I start to try to saw and the chain does not move after the first two pulls . Tried everything for an hour to try to get it dislodged to return it to amazon . I even considered hooking the rope to my atv to pull it but did not because I would break . Well it all came to an end when one of the rope ripped off the chain . This was somewhat of a relief because at least there would not be yellow ropes hanging in the front yard . I then ripped the other rope off and left the chain in the tree . I wish that I could get a refund this is a terrible to use and poorly constructed product . The instructions stink , way to vague . I am not one to write reviews and complain about products but this was to much . Buyer beware it is JUNK !
 On the first throw , the bag got stuck on the branch . A `` tug '' on the rope pulled the bag off the clip and made the clip unusable . With that problem resolved , I made it half way through my first 4 '' -6 '' branch before one of the ropes came loose from the saw blade . There are gromets on either end of the blade that the ropes loop through and attach back to the other side with rope clamps . I had to pull the blade out of the half sawed branch and reattach the rope with a slip knot . I then had to get the saw back to the same place it had been to finish the cut . What a pain . Being a slow learner I tried another larger limb only to have the clamps on the other side of the rope come loose because of breaking clamps . Again , a real pain to get the saw repositioned on the limb.The saw will work but it will work you to death if you do it by yourself and do n't make a few modifications . I would suggest the following before you get started :1 . Get someone to help you - much easier with two people than one .2 . Replace the been bag clip with something more substantial .3 . Cut the rope loose from the saw and reattach by tying it or with stronger rope clamps . Better yet , buy a stronger rope and use that instead.If you do the above , you will save yourself some unecessary frustration . It is a shame that for $ 40 - $ 50 bucks this company chooses to use such poor quality materials to make their product .
 On the 1st try the key snap for the throw weight deformed out of shapeOn the 2nd try the end of the rope pulled out of the metal sleeveOn subsequent tries the chain without fail got stuck in the branch to be removed , necessitating a climb up a ladder.Don ' t even think about buying this product ; mine 's going back for a refund .
 While cutting down the first and only branch the bands that old the rope closed on each end of the chain saw and the one that holds the loop for the bag all broke along with one of the handles at the end of the chain saw . Poorly made if it can not even cut one branch before falling apart .
 The general product idea is a good one on paper , but the implementation has a few flaws : * The small clip for the weight bag is fairly fragile , so if you 're swinging the rope vigorously for a high branch , it 's possible for the bag to come detached . * If your intended branch is n't fairly bare already , it 's possible for twigs and smaller off-shoot branches to prevent the weighted tab from righting the chain properly . * The last inch or so of a cut is where you 're most likely to encounter problems . If you can get a friend to help cut , the further apart you keep the two ends of the rope , the better . Less chance of binding that way , just make sure you 're both out from under . * If the saw does get pinched or otherwise bind , do not pull on either rope to free it , this will likely detach the rope from the saw due to the fragile fittings holding the rope . Use an upward flicking motion and a lot of patience . * Make sure not to cut any branches that have off-shoots above the saw itself . The chain is very slender and very easily bent by any lateral weight.If the item were built with sturdier components , it would be much more practical .
 Like I said before this is the worst product I 've purchased on Amazon.com , it broke the first time I used it on a 3 '' branch . I would not recommend it to anyone , very cheaply made , rope is weak and throwing bag broke on third throw . Also for price very expensive product for quality .
 SAVE YOUR MONEY !!! This 48 '' high limb chain saw worked well on three 3 '' cuts . It worked so-so on one 8 '' cut -LRB- kept getting stuck -RRB- . After that , it just would n't work . It keeps getting stuck . You have to have a tall ladder nearby to get up there and get it unstuck and it seems to be duller than a butter knife . Save yourself some money , lots of time , and an enormous amount of frustration , and get either a chain saw or a motorized pole saw . This thing is NOT worth it !
 Worked well on the first limb . Tried for 45 minutes to get the chain flipped to the saw side but to no avail .
 Inferior piece of crap!Waste of money and time.It broke first timeout.How ??!! The clamp that ties or connects the rope to the `` saw tooth '' let go on my first try.The rope is made of weak material and the clamps that connect the blade are made of cheap materials.I 'm a glass is half full kind of guy . Always looking for the positive in life.This `` rope and chain saw '' is $ 50.00 now you see it now you do n't !
 I 'm willing to accept that maybe my expectations were unreasonable , but here are the issues . The weight was n't heavy enough to pull the rope down the other side of the limb . I removed it and added a heavier -LRB- 3 lb -RRB- weight , which made it really difficult to throw , but I got it in the right spot . But the saw would n't make a dent in the branch , which admittedly was quite thick . I tried again on some smaller branches , same problem . In theory it should work , and I 'm sure others were successful , but for my end ... it could n't do the job .
 Bean bag clip very poor quality.Rope wears immediately.Had to send it back.Sorry , maybe the previous reviewers received a better product .
 The chain is sharp and actually cuts but you would need infinite patience to actually get it over a high limb and work the handles back and forth to be effective . If it lands cutting size down , that 's a bonus if not a necessity . Otherwise , you have to extricate it from the tree and start all over again hoping it does n't get snagged on a branch . In the case wher you do n't have a ladder or a ladder high enough , it might be useful . But those are the actual situations that make it extremely difficult to use !!
 I bought this to cut some high limbs and perhaps the top off a difficult to access tree . I managed to cut almost all the way through a one 3 &#34; limb before the rope broke off one end of the chain . Pulling on the other end only caused it to dig into the wood and get permanently stuck .
 There is a fundamental flaw in this product
 I cut down a small branch and the saw blade was bent the blade thin and cheaply made . Chinese crap
 In my opinion this is poorly designed . The throw bag came off the flimsy clip after two throws . Further , it does not appear to be heavy enough since it does not come down if I am miraculously lucky enough to get the bag and line over the limb of interest . I had to play and play and play with the line trying to add inches of drop after each jigger of the line before the throw bag and rope finally came down to a height where it could be pulled down . Then I had to try to get the line pulled back far enough on the limb to where I really want to cut the limb . I found the provided yellow rope does not slide easily -LRB- I had to cut one limb only where I managed to get the line tossed onto the limb , not further back closer to the trunk -RRB- . The fun continued when I tried to get the cutting part facing down on the limb . A number of times the cutter then caught , causing jigger after jigger as well as the muttering of certain words trying to loosen it.The most frustrating part has been trying to toss the bag and line over the limb of interest . I have found this to be quite difficult.This may eventually provide the limbing that I need , but I caution others to expect frustration and sore arms from throwing and throwing the throw bag hoping it goes over the desired limb while not getting stuck .
 nice idea , but not easy to use . binds and then climb the tree anyway . not worth the $ $ .
 The concept of the cutting chain with a rope pull on either side is a very good idea , but it is difficult to postition the cutting edge of the chain to the branch to be cut . In addition , the clamps holding the rope to the cutting chain let loose during operation . After replacing the clamps the unit worked better .
 Have n't given up on it yet but have not had much success with cutting any limbs yet . If the limb is high it 's very difficult to get the chain over it without any stray branches getting in the way and in the correct position . Slingshot was no help and my throwing arm is n't what it used to be .
 I used the saw out of the package on several 3 '' or so limbs too high to reach with a pole saw . As noted in other reviews , the throwing bag worked fine , but it was hard to orient the blade into the cutting position , despite changing angles , length of rope , etc. . Almost impossible to move it further down the branch once it 's in place , but this might be easier with dead branches -- mine had collateral branches on them.Once I got it sawing , it sawed fairly quickly and the hand straps were easy to use and helpful . But once the branches began to lean some , it was pot luck whether the chain would stay in the cutting position or get jammed in the cut . I think the problem would be solved if you stand right under the cut , but that 's not safe with larger branches . The chain became bent after about an hour of use.Seems to me a work around would be replacing the chain saw with a wire saw that would work in any direction and have a thinner profile . I 'm also getting some rope clamps to re-secure the rope .
 I bought this tool to trim some dead 3-inch diameter ash branches about 20 ft. up . It 's not like I never trimmed a tree before -- I spend a summer working as a tree trimmer while in college . However , this tool doomed the operation from the start.First the bean bag used to throw the rope over the limb got stuck . When I pulled it back , it ripped open , losing the sand and ruining the bag . The two of us used a padlock for a substitute weight and got the rope and chain over the first limb . During the early stages of sawing one of the red handles broke . Then the chain refused to saw further , wedging itself in the saw cut.I now have two pretty yellow ropes hanging from my tree , with a stuck chain , and no prospects in ever getting it down without calling the pros and their boom truck.Although the chain itself seemed to be of reasonable quality , the rest of this product was made with poor quality materials .
 The chain saw is great . The weighted bag is a great idea . The small clip holding the bag is cheap . Clip came undone while throwing over tree limb . Also , rope broke while cutting limb . After market rope and d-ring will make it a better product .
 Product is nicely made and some aspects are well thought out . The throw bag works well -LRB- though the clip has to be reshaped every time as it bends -RRB- . The hand straps work very well for working the rope . However , the whole idea falls down due to the chain . Despite design attempts to keep the cutting edge of the chain pointed to the tree -LRB- there is a metal piece that you are supposed hold between the ropes to prevent this -RRB- the chain always rolls and the teeth only fan air . Since the metal piece is at best 6 inches long any limb exceeding 4 inches and you ca n't effectively engage the guide . I will go back to using a pole saw and ladder - that works every time .
 this did not work I would not recommendbetter directions need to be provideda waste of moneyvery difficult to fliip the blade when trying to remove the limb
 This device is a standard chainsaw chain -LRB- cuts one side only ! -RRB- attached to a standard poly rope . The small metal bar meant to flip it over so `` cut '' side is down is a joke . If you want the frustration of using a one sided chain , save yourself a good part of the 50 bucks and buy your own chain and rope and have at it . For the money I would have thought that this thing would cut on BOTH sides -- it 's very hard to get the single cutting side facing down so that it will in fact cut . Also , as stated in other reviews , the clip that holds the sandbag is very flimsy.ADDED
 I got this to cut some limbs PG&E ; wants me to cut that I ca n't reach with a pole saw or a ladder . I took it out to cut a couple of limbs that I did n't need to cut to get a feel for it . The clip that holds the weight on bent out the first throw . Secondly , the weight is n't heavy enough . It does n't have enough momentum to get the chain to any substantial height , and it 's not heavy enough to bring the chain up as it falls to the other side . After a lot of hassle , I did get my first limb cut and moved onto the next . I threw the weight up , and it got stuck in some brush . When I tried to get it out , the clip came off and the weight was stuck in the brush . Very stuck.So I went and got a 2 1/2 lb lifting weight and tied it to my rope . It worked much better . So I cut down the limb that was holding the weight that came with this lousy product and moved onto the limb I was trying to cut when my weight got stuck . I threw it over with my 2 1/2 lifting weight , and got it just where I wanted it first try , and it came down instead of stalling with the weight that comes with it , which is n't heavy enough , and is n't made to actually stay on . I cut about halfway through the limb when the rope on one side of the chain slipped out of the cheap clip holding it on . So I pulled it out with the other side of the rope which , thankfully , did n't come out or I 'd still have the chain stuck up there.This product is cheap . I suspect they made the weight for their smaller chain , and did n't even think to realize that it was n't enough for this larger size chain . The rope broke before I hardly used the thing , and I did not even put any muscle into it and manhandle it . This product is very nearly junk . I expected much more for the amount I paid for it . I might as well have made my own with higher quality materials for less money . It did n't even come in the packaging you see in the picture .
 The product information states that the chain is 48 '' . In fact the chain is only 24 '' . On the first use the weight bag used to loft the rope over the limb pulled free from the metal clasp . The clasp deformed and is now unusable . Trying to saw a 2 '' maple limb was disappointing . Right now the saw is wedged in a partial saw kerf , the limb is hanging but wo n't come down and I 'm angry that I wasted the money . I 'm not a klutz , having worked with saws , axes and trimming tools for 30 years . If I can ever get this `` tool '' down from the limb where it currently resides I will be returning this for a refund .
 Not a `` pro '' tool . For light-duty , occasional use only . You WILL need other tools as well.I got in over my head -LRB- so to speak -RRB- . Tried it on a locust tree 's dead branch -LRB- hard wood -RRB- . As others have reported , the chain stuck on first try . Ended up also buying a Remington pole chainsaw pruner . The pole chainsaw has its own set of issues -LRB- cheaply made , chain falls off , etc -RRB- but it 's much faster and more effective than this item -LRB- when it works -RRB- . What DOES N'T work
 The saw got caught when cutting and the knot that connects the rope to the chain came loose . = $ 50 saw stuck 25ft up in tree .
 The high rope saw can be difficult to use . It does n't always stay cutting edge down so you have to throw the saw back up to change which side is down -LRB- Only one side of the blade cuts -RRB- . It binds frequently and sometimes gets stuck . Make sure you read the directons and udercut the branch or the bark will tear . It is difficult to use by yourself if the branch is more than 3 inches in diamater . It bent and had to be thrown our after using it on about 15 branches .
 Some parts were missing and the bean bag was torn and leaking sand upon and the ropes were very much unravel-led upon receipt of the product . Basically trash .
 Unable to use . Chain would not stay cutting edge down . It kept twisting over and would not cut thru the limb .
 After the early October snow storm this year I bought the High Limb Rope and Chain Saw to try to get down some of the hanging branches that were left around my property . I picked an easy branch to start on but found that the Rope Saw was hard to use . If the branch is high up it takes many tries to get the chain over the branch and in the right orientation . When I finally started sawing the chain was working well and cutting through the branch but then got stuck . We even had two people doing the sawing -LRB- which helps the angle -RRB- but the chain still got stuck . We had to get a ladder to get the chain down . If you have a tall ladder it is easier just to use that and it really can reach just as high as the rope saw . So when the rope saw works it 's nice to have but I 've found it frequently hard to use .
 This product does not work . It is a total Waste of money . The rope that came with it is cheap and breaks . The hook that attaches the sand bag is cheap and bent out of shape . Save your money , buy a trim pole instead .
 I might have to re-review this tool if I ever cut anything with it , but so far I have been unsuccessful.Amazon suggests other people have bought a slingshot with this tool , which I assumed was used to shoot the weighted bag over the limb . Save your money ... the slingshot is not nearly powerful enough to send this bag more than a few feet , especially when weighed down by the rope and saw . Throwing the bag by hand is more effective.When throwing the bag , be sure not to catch the metal hook on your finger , or it will cut you.After several attempts at throwing the bag over a 40 ft high limb , I instead got the weighted bag and rope wrapped around a limb of a different tree , and could n't get it loose . I ended up just cutting both trees down with a chainsaw to be done with it.It seems like a good idea in theory , but it did n't work out for me .
 High Limb CS-48 Rope-and-Chain Saw . In theory , this was an answer to a problem that we had in our back yard after a winter snow storm . Due to the weight of the snow , an upper limb snapped and fell , breaking a lower limb of the tree in the fall . The lower limb , while broken , remained attached . This limb was attached approximately 30 feet from the ground , too high for a chainsaw and the ladder that we had on the premises . The High Limb CS-48 Rope-and-Chain Saw available on Amazon appeared to be the answer . Pricing was reasonable , and it arrived in a few days after purchase . The packaging and the instructions were a little vague on the details as to how to use this product absolutely . There were a few caveats to be careful about listed , but mostly it was sell copy . It relies mostly on the purchaser to figure out how to use this . I will point out , however , that the patented device that automatically turns the chain saw to the cutting blade was virtuely useless.The results speak for themselves . We followed the instructions , as listed , and were able to thread the throwing rope over the limb . The patented devise did not work as advertised , and thus we struggled for a while to get the cutting side of the blade sawing on the wood . Finally , we got the blade turned and started sawing . Within a short time , the blade got stuck and it required approximately an hour to get it freed . Where upon , we had to begin the entire process over again . Inspite of all of our best efforts , and religiously following the instructions and a great knowledge of how to use tools , the saw got stuck again , this time for good . We were able to get the limb down by resorting to twisting the limb around until it finally snapped and fell to the ground , which was a particularly dangerous thing to do , but worked out . The High Limb CS-48 Rope-and-Chain Saw is now a permanent part of the tree , as it would be virtually impossible to free it and not worth the danger of climbing up on an extremely tall ladder to retrieve it.The moral is that we spent approximately $ 40 for a devise that proved to be useless , not as advertised and now a permanent part of our back yard tree , and due to it 's present location was not available to be returned to the vendor as defective .
 A Super idea - here 's a way to cut a limb that is too high to climb to and/or too thick to use your pruning saw on.That 's about as far as it goes - the way it 's * supposed * to work.Unfortunately , there are several problems actually making the concept work : Getting the saw up there - yep , there is the `` throwing bag '' - which if you have a good , accurate arm and handle the loose rope well - will get the saw over the branch . However , if your aim is n't so good , or if there are several branches in the way , or too many twigs , etc - it can take several -LRB- many -RRB- tries to get this to work.Another user mention that the device for `` flipping '' the blade right-side-up is iffy at best . This is especially true -LRB- again -RRB- if there are twigs near where you want to cut that prevent the blade weight from flipping the blade.Anybody who 's cut branches off of trees knows that occasionally a saw blade gets `` pinched '' and stuck . That 's a big pain on the ground - but when it happens with this tool , the stuck saw blade is up to 25 ' overhead . Whatcha gon na do now ? If you 're lucky enough to have the branch sawed through enough that it 's started to come down , you can grab it and pull and bounce on it and it will probably break free bringing the saw back to earth . Another user mentioned that his chain broke when this happened . If the branch wo n't break off - then you either have to climb anyway -LRB- if you even can -RRB- or - you get to leave your expensive saw UP in the tree and you 're worse off than you started.Finally , anybody who knows about pruning limbs off of trees that you want to keep knows that it takes THREE cuts to do this properly - and that one of them needs to be made from bottom of the branch to keep the bark from tearing . That 's just impossible with this tool . So resign yourself to a very messy , unprofessional job.So - buy this tool if you 're OUT of other options - and resign yourself to the fact that you may STILL have to climb to finish the job and get your saw back down . I have used this tool to make 5 or 6 cuts - but every one of them had problems , and only one of them looks like a decent pruning job . The rest look like an amateur did it . I still had to climb for most of those cuts .
 Had I known this was a little more than a section of chain-saw blade attached to a rope , I probably would have made my own . It was all but impossible to have the chain `` roll over '' so that the blade was next to the limb and not the back of it ...

 I ordered this product on amazon , I owned this product for about a month , when I received it there was a small hair inside the watch , hardly noticeable , after about 3-4 weeks I noticed that the light on the bezel and the second hand had fallen off . I called the service center and they felt they could not cover the watch under warranty because it was purchased on amazon , after much hassle and contacting the seller as well as a manager there they agreed to repair the watch . I received the watch back a couple weeks later , and bezel was not repaired the second hand was back on the watch but bent , after two weeks I got back from a yoga class and found that the second hand had fallen off again . I contacted the service center and said I would like a replacement as I had surely gotten a defective product and they had failed to repair it . they said customer service would make that decision , got Michell at customer service , she said the service center would make that decision and contact Evan the the service center , Evan explained that the second hand falling off for a second time in 2 month of ownership would not typically warrant a replacement , I probably got a second hand from their bad batch and they would be sure they gave me one from the good batch next time , and apologized for not replacing the bezel . He said I would have to send it back again , and this situation would probably not warrant a replacement . I purchased this watch for about ten times as much as a comparably featured inexpensive watch because it was supposed to be durable . Its lightweight and the lights are a nice feature , but I have purchased watches for less than the shipping cost to the service center that lasted longer and came with less hassle -LRB- usually meaning that I lost them before they broke -RRB- . In their defense they agreed to pay for the shipping this time . I will not ever be purchasing another Luminox product .
 So I bought this product directly from Orby . I took it out the day after I received it and brought it to a park at night with my friend . It broke after ten minutse of use -LRB- not an exaggeration -RRB- . It is very expensive considering the quality of the product . I knew the product would n't last a lifetime once I removed it from the package , but I did n't expect it to break so quickly . It resembled a child 's party favor toy -LRB- in packaging and material -RRB- . Things to know : - Built of foam . The tail section is built out out of a cheap foam , similar to what you 'd find at a craft store . - When you throw it like a football , it goes about half the distance you would expect . - To get distance , you have to throw it like a split-finger fastball -LRB- not a major problem , but annoying -RRB- . - The ball has 4 super bright LEDs , it does NOT have an even glow of light . This is important in a way I did n't anticipate . The brightness of the LEDs do not change as the ball is coming toward you . This makes it hard to catch , as it is difficult to judge the distance as it is coming towards you . Be prepared to drop a lot of catches and get hit a few times . It is also easy to underestimate the speed of the ball as it comes toward you . If the ball had an even glow of light , it would be easier to judge the depth and speed of it.-Order in which things broke
 While the DVD 's do demonstrate great form , I was extremely disappointed the workouts did not flow . I was hoping for something that blending together better .
 Item looks great , easy set-up but its very cheaply made . The platform broke after 2 weeks and it needed to be replaced . I wish I had my money back because its a cheaply made product that will break over and over again . Buyer beware !
 Hopefully by now Amazon has pulled the photo that was with this product ... it was painted black and a different design . We kept the item and tried it out in the gym ; most of the guys do not like it so we are going to modify it for use . Just a warning that you will not get what you see here .
 This page advertises Park PolyLube PPL-1 . If you add it to your basket it will show up as Park Anti-Seize Compound ASC-1 . This is an incorrectly listed product .
 The 4 oz . tube of Park Tool PolyLube 100 -LRB- PPL-1 -RRB- should cost something like $ 4-5 . The 16 oz . tub should cost something like $ 9-10 . As of January 30 , 2011 , this page gives $ 9.58 as the cost of a 4 oz . tube of PolyLube -LRB- wrong -RRB- , and the picture at left is the picture of a tube of Anti-Seize Compound -LRB- ASC-1 -RRB- , a totally different kind of goop.This is great grease , by the way , and I 'd love to buy some . But this listing leaves me utterly in the dark as to which quantity of which product is for sale here .
 I have ordered countless things online and have never been compelled to write a review before . I was completely ecstatic to `` Bears '' down my sons room . Let 's keep in mind that he is 19 months old , so he takes up very little space in his twin size bed nor does he actually ever use this comforter for his blanket . We have had the set for a whopping 6 weeks and already the Bear silkscreen is cracked and peeling off . Since we do n't use it for his blanket we have n't even put it through the washer , I ca n't imagine it being able to endure that since it has n't endured six weeks of being basically a decorative throw . Disappointed does n't even begin to describe how I feel .
 This product is actually quite small . Even though is says mini , I still expected it to be a little bit bigger . Also , it will not stand up with a drink bottle in it . The seams on the bottom make it too unstable to stand alone .
 A few years ago I picked up a couple Insulated bottle carriers in a grocery store for about $ 5 each . I fell in love with them quickly -- they keep your bottled water cool in the summer and prevent freezing in the winter . The two I got in the grocery store also have two methods for carrying -- a string you can wrap around your wrist , and a clip . I wish I had gotten more of these or knew who manufactured them . I wanted a couple more , and tried this product.This bottle carrier -- the one I 'm reviewing on this page -- simply is n't as good . It does keep beverages cool and keep them from freezing , but there is only a clip -LRB- no carrying string -RRB- , and it is very difficult to insert a bottle of water then be able to `` stand up '' the bottle on a table . If you try to stand it up , it falls over easily . I do n't have this problem with the carriers I got in the grocery store because they have a little `` ridge '' sewn around the bottom of the carrier which stabalizes the bottle when you stand it up.In fact , this product actually makes it much more difficult to stand the bottle up because there is a seam that runs exactly down the center of the bottom , creating an uneven platform . I even purchased a couple heavy 2 '' or so washers and inserted them into the bottom , but this did n't help them stand up much.So , compared to the two excellent bottle carriers I found in the grocery store a few years ago , this product just does n't compare
 Received the model and noted that some crucial parts had not been molded properly and the pieces would not fit properly . Loved the moving parts like the dive flaps just wish the wings were molded and every thing fit together .

 I ordered these glasses and other glasses I received . I do not understand how it is possible to order a product and receive another ...
 One of the lenses fell out of the frame as soon as I carefully took it out of the package . On top of that , after a half of a day 's gentle use , one side snaped at the henge and became very flemsy while normally opening the glasses for about the third time . The next day that side actually fell off while trying to open them up again . The only thing nice about these is that the lens was completely mirrored and you ca n't really see through them from the front like others . Other than this , these glasses are a horrible buy , and you get what you pay for . I just bought a pair that is way more sturdy and durable enough so you can open them up without them falling into pieces . I got them at a stand in my local mall for a price of 2 for $ 25 , I suggest you do the same and I absolutely do not recommend these .
 For $ 5.99 , I was n't expecting a lot . As a matter of fact , I was expecting very little . Kudos to the manufacturer/seller then , for disappointing me DESPITE my pragmatic attitude.These are so flimsy , that I was afraid of breaking them simply by holding them in my hands . What 's more , the promised `` case '' -LRB- which would have been nothing but a pouch made of cheap fabric -RRB- was missing from the package . Very disappointing , because after taking one look at this lemon , I knew that the pouch would be the only thing of value in this order . I contacted Amazon , arranged a return , and I 'm happy for it.I 'll be fulfilling all my optometry needs at the gas station , thank you very much .
 These glasses came on time , but , when I opened them , I soon realized why they were priced so low ; They 're complete garbage . The arch in the middle was n't centered , and the mirror was part chipped upon arrival . Also , the frames are so flimsy anything would risk breaking them . Even though they are cheap , I would not suggest buying them .
 Save your money ! Sunglass lens are substantially smaller than true Aviator . You can get these or better at your local drugstore .
 I 've only had these sunglasses for a week , and already the nose rest has fallen off of the glasses and the frame is beginning to bend more than an acceptable amount .
 Looks very cheep and the one that I got has lot of scratches . Thought of returning , but felt wasting time on returning this $ 1.20 item .
 i got these in the mail and i opened the box . I almost broke the arms on them because there so thin ! but they are dark
 well at first they looked nice but further inspection proved that the glasses are poorly constructed . A few months passed and the lenses fell off . DONT BOTHER .
 Please do not buy these . The frame was bent when I opened the package and they never sat quite right on my face . Terrible quality and a waste of 5 bucks . I accidentally sat on them a couple days later and let 's say I was glad to throw them away ha !
 Made for small/narrow heads . I need wider ones , these were not worth my money but if you have a small head they may work for you .
 This really does n't work at all . Felt no burn or anything . Waste of money for sure .
 Gus Hansen 's Advanced Strategies DVD was a general disappointment . Much of the DVD was Gus speaking in front of the camera in generalities with few concrete examples . He 'd say something like `` well if I have a mediocre hand maybe I bet big or maybe I just fold , depending how I feel about the opponents hands . '' Well , thanks . It does n't really help me.I was hoping to see some solid examples . For example , you are the dealer , hold a King & Ten and 3 people called the big blind . The flop is a ten , nine , four . Everyone checks to you . What do you do ? You figure your pair of tens is best right now , but it may not hold up . People are likely on the straight draw and want to see a free card . If you bet big now , you make people determine whether they want to chance chasing the straight . `` While obviously a poker player may not act the same way every time in an attempt to be unpredictable and change things up , what should a advanced amateur do here MOST of the time ? What should a player be thinking about when he sees his hole cards , sees other peoples bets , and sees a flop?There are a few tips , like adding up the `` points '' of your starting hands . If you are early to bet , betting a little can show you where you stand . Checking does n't help reveal anything about what your opponents may be holding . He also went over pots odds and outs , but these are beginner tactics not `` advanced . `` Overall , I think I learn more watching an hour of world poker tour or celebrity poker can be more helpful , when the commentators talk about what the players are doing or should have done .
 This espresso maker was a total bomb.It was small and tippy and blew a big mess everywhere.I have seen one of these work properly , but it must have been the larger size or a different brand.I would not recommend this .
 but there is nothing lower than one star.I bought this as a Christmas present for my husband and he wore it that night as we watched the Miami/Jets game on TV . It was only worn that one time and washed the next day . It 's important to note that it was washed according to instructions on the tag - in cold water and tumble-dried for a short while in low heat . When it came out , we noticed that all of the white on the shirt -LRB- the numbers and name on the back -RRB- had begun to peel off . The shirt looked like garbage . Two days after Christmas , when I contacted the company that it was purchased from , they told me that if the shirt has been washed there is nothing they can do anymore.In short , if you buy this , you will pay a lot of money for an item that is only good for one-time use . It 's a piece of junk that should not be purchased .
 I wish there had been some reviews before I purchased these . I bought 2 -LRB- red & blue -RRB- dribbles for my 15 year old son who loves to play bag ball . The lights were really cool looking , but were broken within minutes of my son using the ball . Unless you plan NOT to use these for what they are intended , they might make a neat little night light on your dresser .
 I ordered this mat three weeks ago and was very eager to try it out when it arrived . However upon opening the packaging , a horrible penetrant rubbery smell filled my nostrils . It was so bad , that I did n't dare to bring the mat to my yoga practice , as I was afraid that the smell would prevent me from being able to concentrate , and even more , that it would bother others . I washed the mat by hand and the smell is a bit less potent , but I still keep this mat for my at home practice of yoga only . If you do n't mind the smell , the mat is very thick and long , and the design is cute , but for me it was a waste of money .
 its electric ? how about gas powered dirt bikes ? huh ? i highly recomend gas powered items . Like the pocket rocket ! get a couple gas powered pocket rockets ! you guys are pathetick !
 Christmas morning , charged all night , my son got on it and it does not work . What a dissapointment . Now we have to find a RAZOR dealer to get it fixed , give me a break . I will be going out in the morning to but my sone a new Polaris 4 wheeler , which is what I should have done in the first place . RAZOR PRODUCTS SUCK .
 Totally cool product , kids had fun , I had fun!Problem was reliability when the bike was 2 weeks old!Charging plug on bike prevented proper charging resulting in dead bike!No fun!Razor sends out new part , owner supplies labor , NO fun!On / Off switch breaks , can not turn off bike!No fun , battery dies!Razor sends new switch , owner supplies labor , NO fun !
 My son got this in October . It worked great for a while . Than the unit stopped fully recharging and goes slow . I called the company who gave me the name of a center to service it . This was afer 1 day of owning it . I called the center who does not return calls . I had to call razor who said they can send me a battery but i would have to pay for the install . I did it and the next battery did the same thing . They sent me two more batteries and I tried one which just died after 3 min . I have anothr battery and a piece of garbage in my garage . I do not have hours and hours to spend on this . The stores do not return them so i m out of luck and so will you if you buy this .
 I bought this razor dirt rocket electric bike ... it came without the axle and spacer an washers , nuts to hold it all together ... I need help finding out how to get this part I paid for.order received 1/18/2007 . If I get this part I would rate it 5 stars.Sharon Tilton in Calif
 What a disaster ! Came without the front axle and several other parts . Box was a mess , parts were broken . Another reviewer said the same thing , but I thought amazon would have fixed the problem by now . BUYER BEWARE !!! Disappointed son on his birthday . Amazon did give a prompt refund and sent UPS to pick up .
 I have owned both the Razor MX500 and MX350 . I first got the MX350 when I was about 10 -LRB- says age 13 + -RRB- . At age 10 most kids would be almost too big to ride this . Its going to be too small for many 11-12 year-olds . About a year to a year and a half ago I bought the MX500 . It says ages 14 + and at 14 it was just my size , and I knew I 'd only have about a year on it . Within a few months the whole back end and tire had to be replaced . A few weeks after that , both the charger died -LRB- the MX350 charger died a few months before that -RRB- . And after the winter , even though we stored them inside , they both needed new batteries . In the Owner 's manual it says `` Even with proper care , a rechargeable battery does not last forever . Average battery life is 1 to 2 years depending on vehicle use and conditions . Replace only with a Razor replacement battery . '' If you 're willing to spend $ 139.99 every year to keep this going , keep reading . On the website it boasts about how awesome it is off-road . In the owner 's manual it states `` Use only on solid , flat -LSB- , -RSB- clean -LSB- , -RSB- and dry surfaces such as pavement or level ground . '' And I can vouch for the fact that this will not be able to take someone up a dirt hill . It gets 2 stars because for the small amount of time it works , it actually is pretty fun . But both of these together we have put at lest $ 700 + into these in about 5 years and now they ca n't sell for more than $ 100 -LRB- I am trying to sell them as I have outgrown them -RRB- . These will cost you a lot of money for something that is not very reliable or durable , but pretty fun . If money is no issue what-so-ever -LRB- doubtful -RRB- , then these are great for little kids to learn before a real dirt bike , or just for the heck of it.This is from someone who has had experienced these for 5 + years .
 Bike broke with less then 1 hour of use . Called razor and was told it needed a new rear wheel . I was told it was in stock and would ship right away . Called 3 weeks later and was told part was back ordered and that it could take 3 to 6 months for replacement part . Razor is no help and they think it 's okay to have a child wait 6 months to use his xmas gift .
 It 's not sluggish . It works great or not at all.The not so helpful manual says that maybe the connectors need reconnecting . After removing the plastic case I find that there are a half dozen connectors with various lables on them . The connectors are mated tightly and all have a black plastic tie-wrap around the mated connectors to keep them together.Seems that at around 40 deg F the unit will not work . Twist the throttle and you can hear a small click from the Controller under the seat area , most likely a relay . The motor does not turn . Probably a bad connection inside the electronics somewhere.If a bring the bike into my heated house for a while it resumes normal operation . You hear a couple cliks and the motor turns.If I park it in the unheated garage it stops working.I will most likely return it to PepBoys Automotive within the week . It was their last one -LRB- floor model -RRB- so who knows if it was `` tested out '' by the employees ... . I like putting new things together myself so I know it 's built correctly .
 From day one our Razor MX Dirt Rocket would n't last for more than 2 minutes . About a month after purchase , I contacted Razor directly , since there are warnings all over not to return to the retailer . The Razor rep said they would send a battery/electric motor replacement unit and that no replacement of the Dirt Rocket itself was allowed . To make a long story short , I never received the battery/electric motor unit and when I contacted Razor , the response I got was that they did n't have record of my original contact and that it was now past the 90 day warranty . Needless to say , our family will never purchase a Razor product again .
 We purchased this for our 10 year old son . It was great for 1 week - then the back tire stripped out and now it wo n't run . When we went online to see what to do - there were other reviews-not on Amazon - about this problem . Now we have to spend the next 3 weeks taking it to a repair shop and getting a new back wheel put on . Make sure your children ONLY ride this in the street and not `` hard '' it will strip the gears and wreck the back tire !
 Bought for my son for Xmas , rode about 8X , rear wheel stopped working . Can not buy replacement part due to `` Out of Stock '' . Same problem as with many others who reviewed . Do not buy , it 's tempting , but risk is not worth it . Big waste of $ and dissapointed kid .
 I read just about all of the 90 + review . Same issues , busted up boxes with missing parts and a rear wheel that goes bad . How can this continue ? Why does Amazon even sell these , and how is Razor dealing with this ? Do n't they get the message by now something is wrong ?
 As the title says - it was a great little dirt bike , at first . After two days , however the common problem came up . Many other reviewers said the same thing
 Do n't buy any Razor products except for their original scooter . Their customer service is non existent . If they believed in their products you would be able to buy and return them at a retail store like any other product . You would not have to sign off that you will not return it to the store . After the success of their original scooter they took their brand name and tried to squeeze every bit of profit out of it that they could . Razor does not mean quality to the many people screwed by their products .
 We purchased this bike for our 7-year old son for Christmas . After reading the reviews , we were nervous about purchasing it but we were not comfortable purchasing the more powerful MX650 and the MX350 was too small . In an effort to avoid disappointment on Christmas morning , we ordered it early -LRB- the box was badly worn upon arrival but all parts were there -RRB- and tested it several times before the big morning . Despite that , the bike STILL broke on Christmas morning after ONLY ten minutes of use . Our son did love it for the ten minutes that he was able to ride on it ; however , the common design problem occurred . The clutch is mounted on the rear wheel and it is very poorly designed and appears to fail easily . In order to fix the problem , Razor has to send a new rear wheel and we have to cross our fingers that it actually works this time AND continues to work.Despite being concerned about the MX650 being too much bike for a 7-year old , I wish that we had purchased that bike instead . It does not appear to have the same design flaw that the MX500 is plagued with and at least it would be working right now .
 I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son and after putting it together it did n't work . I bought it early as a Christmas present so the warranty ran out by the time winter was over and he was ready to use it . After putting it together there was a disconnected wire in the throttle which I had to find a razor dealer to repair . Brand new , never used and already an extra $ 40.00 charge . After that it ran for a while and now it will not hold a charge . I read other reviews and decided I will not go through the exercise of buying a new battery which is about $ 90.00 without tax . I highly recommend not buying this dirt bike !!!
 It sounds like I am not the onl ; y one has had issues with this and Razor certainly doesnt stand behind it . Worked great for awhile then it seemed like it wouldnt charge . Checked battery with a meter and the battery was good and when checking throttle it was sending right amount of volts to motor . Motor done in less than 6 months . Had another Razor scooter a few years before and within a year the motor on that went as well . If you want it to work for just a short time it is a great product . But dont expect anything over 6-9 nmonths out of it . I have purchased my last Razor product . I understand things happen but when they have happened on both Razor products I have purchased and Razor was willing to do nothing about it well that to me says it all . Garbage Product !
 We bought this for our 10 year old son for Christmas and it has already broken after riding it a dozen or so times . My son only weighs 75 pounds and he rode it on the street and on grass . Now the back gear is stripped and the rear wheel will not move . I wish I had read the reviews by others about the rear wheel problem . This is a very common problem and yet Razor will not replace it once you are out of the 90 day warranty period . The rear wheel costs $ 50 to replace , so if you buy this product plan on replacing the rear wheel assembly .
 This bike worked great for a the first four months and then quit . The warranty is only for 90 days . I called Razor tech support that told me that the problem was the electrical kit and I would need a new one for $ 50 . Two weeks later the kit came in and I replaced it . Still did n't work . I called tech support again and they said it was the charger for $ 40 that needed to be replaced but it was back orderd for 4-6 weeks . Still not working but have many useless parts !
 I bought my son one if these b/c he wanted a dirtbike so i bought him one i put so much money into it i payed for a use real dirtbike .
 HA ha ha ha ha ha ha ha , dont get me started gas powered dirt bikes = mutch better . eletric powered = sucks my opnion is dont by anything eltric or moroize cuaes evry thing honda or razor suck , i like real honda dirt bikes but not this eletronic dirt bike , ha they should even call it a dirt bike more like a bike with a motor slapped on !!!!!! its not durable or fun!if your one of those over protective moms that wants there momas boy safe then this porduct is for them or if u want to be a cool mom then by a gas powered dirt bike there thank u when they turn pro pulling back flips of a jump making milloins every day !! or u could just follow them hand an foot kissing there boo boos an scrapes !! ps : my grammar might suck
 Do not buy this ! I am 14 years old and I saved my money for 3 months to buy this . I finnaly ordered it and was extremely excited ! I assembled it , charged it , and the next day , I rode in my neighborhood . A cop drove buy and got out of the car and told me that it was illegal to ride those . It got impounded and I had to pay a $ 120 plus $ 150 dollars to get it back . Now , I have spent a grand total of $ 570 and I have a useless dirtbike in my garage . Dont buy !!!! There Illegal in almost every state !!!
 I got this bike for my son over a year ago . At first , it was a great bike and a lot of fun . Then the bike stopped running . First we had to buy a new rear wheel that cost $ 50 . It was easy to put on . Then we had to replace a control module . It was not so easy . I thought that maybe everything would be fine , but today it has stopped running again . And once again the problem is the rear wheel . I have already put almost as much money into the bike that I originally spent on it . So , it is not worth buying another rear wheel . Not to mention , what is the point in buying another part that will eventually break again . I think that the Razor company needs to acknowledge that the rear wheel assembly is defective and fix it . I will not waste my money on a Razor MX500 again until they do . BUYER BEWARE !
 Hi ... maybe we were UNLUCKY !! But the first Razor Motorcycle we got from Amazon had broken gears . We would give it some ` gas ' and the rear sprocket would just spin , as if the gears were not engaging with the sprocket/chain . So we returned that first bike , and Amazon sent us a new one at no charge -LRB- which was great -RRB- . Unfotunately the SECOND bike was n't much better . The battery on the second bike did n't hold a charge . We followed the directions for how to charge it initially , which we did , but now the yellow like on the throttle always shows `` lit '' meaning that it needs a charge , eventhough we had it on the chareger for several hours . DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ... IT 'S NOT WORTH IT .
 I purchased the Razor MX500 for my grandson 's birthday . The bike arrived on September 21 , 2011 . The bike was 90 % assembled out of the box and it only took about 30 minutes to complete the handlebar and wheel assemble . I then charged the bike 's batteries and presented it to my grandson on September 23 , 2011 . Jackson loved the bike but after only two weeks of use it quit running . We went through all the troubleshooting techniques listed in the manual and online but it still would n't run . We called Razor directly and they said a part was bad and they are going to send us a new part . The bike only comes with a 90 day warranty -LRB- very short for an item that cost $ 340 -RRB- so it 's important to get it fixed right away . Very disappointed the electric dirt bike did n't hold up longer but I guess we 'll find out how good Razor 's service and warranty department are . Jury 's still out on this product but I 'm starting to feel like I 've wasted my money on this product .
 We purchased this product for Christmas for my son . He loved it ... at first . He rode it as much as possible , but this past winter produced a good amound of snow in our area so he did not get much opportunity to ride . After riding the bike four or five times the centrifugal clutch that drives the rear wheel stripped and the bike would not move . We called Razor and in order to fix the problem you must replace the entire rear wheel assembly , they sent out a replacement wheel assembly at no charge . The wheel assembly was easy enough to replace.This Spring we had a significant amount of rain so he was unable to ride more than a few times . Again after replacing the wheel assembly he was able to ride the bike four or five times and the centrifugal clutch failed again . We again called Razor and they sent out a replacement wheel assembly.Now that summer is here and the weather has reached the point that he can ride , we have gone through two more wheel assemblies due to a failure in the centrifugal clutch . The latest cluch lasted two rides -LRB- maybe 30 minutes -RRB- . Overall my son has gotten maybe 10 hours of ride time.I have spoken to Razor to determine what is causing the clutch to fail and the person answering the phone is simply reading from a script so you can not get any valid information . They tried to tell me that the chain is too tight ... the problem with that theory is that the bike comes with a chain tensioner . In order for the chain to be too tight the tensioner would have to be applying more pressure than it is physically capable of applying . When I pointed this out to the customer service rep she got rather irritated that I was not believing the line provided by the script she was reading.At this point I am going to call again and get another wheel assebly ... but given that they last a short period if time I will not be purchasing one when Razor stops replacing them and I will not buy or recomment another Razor product . We would have been far better off buying him a small gas powered dirt bike than the Razor product that is clearly not engineered very well . I would recommend you save your money and a great deal of frustration for both you and your child and avoid this product .
 This is ridiculous and we are completely frustrated . We bought this bike for my son 's birthday . He paid half of it with his birthday money . 5 days after we bought it , the rear wheel stopped working . Same problem as many others -LRB- read below -RRB- where the wheel just stops turning . We waited for the part from Razor for 6 weeks and finally asked the store where we bought it to take it back . They graciously did , and we had another one assembled for us . 3 weeks later , the EXACT SAME PROBLEM !!!!!! Razor !! You need to recall this defective product and give the people their money back !
 I PURCHASED THIS BIKE FOR MY SON FOR CHRISTMAS , WHEN I WENT TO PUT BIKE TOGETHER IT WAS MISSING PARTS , CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY WERE NO HELP . I HAVE SEEN OTHER REVIEWS THAT SAID RAZOR HAS POOR PRODUCTS AND POORER CUSTOMER SERVICE AND I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED . DONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE . DONT BUY RAZOR PRODUCTS .
 I too bought this bike for my son on his birthday . It came the first time with the bike half way out of the box , cardboard missing from the box and numerous parts missing including the front axle and tire !!! Amazon said they would send me a new one no problem . Two days later I received the same item in the same box as before . Amazon said they would send it one more time ! Well , after three weeks have gone by and I finally recieved the bike -LRB- AGAIN DAMAGED TO THE POINT THAT THINGS HAD FALLEN OUT OF THE BOX ON THE UPS TRUCK -RRB- I got a refund but my son still did not have a bike a month after his birthday !!! What a disaster !!!!!!!!!
 DIRT ROCKET # 1 WAS BROKEN WITHIN A COUPLE HOURS AFTER BRINGING IT HOME . TOOK IT BACK TO THE STORE AND WAS TOLD THE BEARINGS WERE STRIPPED AND COULD NOT BE REPAIRED . THEY ASSEMBLED ANOTHER ONE FOR US AND AGAIN WITHIN A COUPLE OF DAYS DIRT ROCKET # 2 BEARINGS WERE STRIPPED . THE STORE CLERK SAID THAT THESE BIKES ARE NOT TO BE RODE ROUGHLY . THEY ARE MORE LIKE AN ELECTRIC SCOOTER . I DONT CONSIDER RIDING UP AND DOWN THE STREET/DRIVEWAYS ROUGHT RIDDING . FORTUNATELY , WE WERE ABLE TO RETURN AND GET OUR MONEY BACK . MY SON WAS EXTREMELY UPSET ABOUT RETURNING THE DIRT ROCKET , SETTLED FOR PLAYSTATION3 INSTEAD . HE 'S HAPPY ; I 'M HAPPY . I DO N'T ADVISE THE PURCHASE OF THESE `` VEHICLES '' -- THEY ARE LEMONS !
 I purchased this bike for my son this past Christmas . It was his only gift . I immediately had a problem with the breaks -LRB- which I was able to fix -RRB- . Then , the power would not shut off -LRB- even when the the on/off switch was turned off -RRB- so it never held a charge . It took me 40 phone calls to Razor for before I could even speak to a person . -LRB- Their recording just kept telling you to call back later because they were so busy from Christmas sales . -RRB- I finally arranged to have a new on/off switch shipped to me . I rec 'd it with no instructions to install ... which turned into about a two hour process for two people to accomplish . Now the bike will turn on and off but it wo n't go when you hit the throttle . I understand when things break but my biggest gripe is with the company . They do not stand behind their products and all they want is to send you more parts to fix it . All I want is what I paid for . I ca n't tell you how dissappointed my son is and my husband and I. Do n't waste your money !
 Much has been written about the Razor electric motocross bikes . So , I would just like to add that the Bike stopped working one day after the warranty expired .
 We purchased a MX500 Razor Dirt Electric Motro bile from Toysr ' Us in July , 2007 for our grandson to use when he visited . The bike ran very well the 4-5 times he came over to ride . This past weekend , Feb 15-17 , we got the bike out after charging overnight and it did not run . Called Razor and they said it was likely the electric control module ? Warranty is only for 90 days ! Way too short ! Module wil cost $ 24.99 plus shipping . Very dissappointed !
 i got this item on november 7 . and the box came scratched and the dirt bike had a flat tire right out of the box ! also right know it makes a whining sound whenever you ride it , and it only runs for 25 min . not the told 45 . anyway my friend got this and his also was broken but he sent it back and know he has a good one . I suggest this item to plenty of people but if you are worried about the chance of a scratched and tore box or a broken bike do n't get it .
 OK , I read all of the reviews too . I decided to take a chance against my better judgement ... I figured I 'm very mechanical ... if it breaks I 'll fix it right ? We 'll yeah it broke , right after my 7 year old rode it for 5 minutes on his birthday . My wife and I contacted Razor immediately , spoke to two representatives then finally the supervisor . After 2 hours of taking this thing apart with the phone in one ear and a very upset 7 year old in another-the supervisor came to the conclusion that the batteries were defective as well as the brake levers and we would have to wait weeks for both . I immediately took the piece of junk apart , put it back in the box and returned it for a full refund . The next day , I went to a local motorcycle shop and bought a used 50cc gas powered dirtbike for half of the price that runs like a champ.In all seriousness , there is nothing worse than the look on your child 's face as they are so excited to see a dream present ... a shiny new MX500 , then ride it for 5 minutes and have their dream shattered and heart broken . No one can explain the feeling I felt and I am no `` softie '' ; I can assure you . Do n't but this thing folks ... do n't do it.Anyway , the MX500 will need a new battery pack -LRB- $ 135.00 -RRB- every year plus God only knows what else . Go buy a gas powered Chinese dirtbike for $ 300 bucks that needs maybe a gallon of gas a week and can run all day vs. 20 minutes then needs to be charged for 14 hours .
 The bike is good while it was working . It only worked for several times and my son loved it . But then it stop working the bike still looks brand new . I was trying to see if my mechanic fix it and he told me that the part needed to be changed . I was late calling Amazon by 2 days to just return the item . They did not care about the product being defective only after several times of use and they did not want return my unit even though this was my FIRST time asking for a return after purchasing thousand and thousands dollars of merchandise . I though Amazon is much better than that
 Purchased this product for my sons 11th birthday and two weeks after the chain tensionser broker . Received replacement part and screw is stripped so we can not even fix it . This is suppose to be a dirt bike and the videos show kids doing all kinds or things with it . I suggest if you purchase to just have them ride up and down the street and make sure there are no bumps .
 Bike broke within 10 minutes of riding it . It is going back to the store . Please read all the bad reviews on this . They are all true !
 First time I received the Razor the box was badly torn and the front axle parts were missing . They probably fell through the numerous holes in the box . Returned to Amazon and asked for replacement . The second Razor arrived in an even worse box and also had parts missing . It looked like the second box had probably been returned by someone else and Amazon is just reshipping these things to the next person who orders . Beware ordering this from Amazon because it seems as though your are just going to get something someone else returned that had missing parts . Amazon has got to be losing a fortune on the back and forth shipping costs on these things .
 I bought one of these for my 6 year old . He used it for a year and loved it . It worked well . However , over the winter I stored it indoors in my basement to avoid freezing temps here in New England . When I brought it out in the spring , the battery would not hold a charge at all - completely dead . The only authorized repair center was too far away for me . I bought an exact replacement battery online for $ 75 and installed it . It worked , but the motorcycle only goes half as fast as it did before . I read some similar reviews elsewhere with someone going to the company for 4-5 more new batteries within days of purchasing a new bike before finding one that worked properly . My son wo n't even ride it anymore because its so slow.I 'm not sure I would spent the money on this again knowing I will only get a years worth of use from it without investing more money in it just to keep it running.It is a toy after all . Very disappointed in the quality of this and all toys today . We took extra good care of this maintenance wise . Does anyone make anything that lasts or stand behind their products anymore ?
 Bought this for my 10 yr . old . He loved it UNTIL only 8 weeks later it completely broke down . Took it to a bike/scooter shop and even they could n't fix it . Listen to all the reviews - I took a chance thinking `` Mine will last longer . '' . No luck . What a waste of money . Do not buy one unless you get a full warranty for at least a year . Will never buy Razor again .
 Was very disappointed that a part on the tire/chain broke immediately & we needed to wait for a replacement part . This is an ongoing defect with these bikes that needs to be corrected BEFORE they sell them .
 It was a Christmas Present for my son and we charged it 18 hours like it said . He was so excited and we took him outside to use it and it did not work at all ! So now my husband is taking it to a dealer -LRB- 2 hours from our home -RRB- to get it fixed and they are getting alot of these sent there to fix!Dont waste your money on a horrible gift !
 I only had it 30 days and im not sure what happen but now i cant charge it it wont go
 We have had nothing but trouble with this bike . we have returned it two times to the retailer and within two weeks it is n't working again . There is noone within 100 miles to take the bike to which is a real inconvenience . Would not buy this product again , ever !
 The product was shipped without a front axle so could not be used until Razor sent a new one . Throttle and controller broke down after 2 weeks . Rear wheel has a clutch that broke down now it in the shop waiting for a new wheel from Razor . A friend also just bought one and the rear wheel clutch also broke after 3 weeks . The bikes are fun for the kids when they are working but do n't seem to hold up and getting warrenty parts seems to take too long .
 We bought 2 of the MX500 bikes for Christmas for my 2 sons . Used less than 10 times and the Flywheel on the rear wheel broke -LRB- my sons weigh less than 70lbs and they only rode on pavement -RRB- . Not covered under warrenty because after 90 days -LRB- bought in November 2006 but kids did not really start to use until spring -RRB- . From reading other reviews this appears to be a common defect but Razor will not replace the rear wheel for free . Even if I wanted to purchase rear wheel replacement from Razor - it is out of stock which further makes me believe this is a defect.Fun when product works , but I would not recommend buying because of defect .
 It is a great like bike for kids to have fun riding.Unfortunately there is a defect with the rear wheel assembly . Recently our 2nd wheel broke where it will only freewheels -LRB- spins -RRB- and wo n't engage to drive the wheel . Unlike a bicycle , they do n't sell the center hub -LRB- broken part -RRB- , but only the whole assembly . Very wasteful of both money and material resources to only sell this entire piece .
 Be careful about buying this bike !! If you have to return it , you will be out a lot money . The bike is too large for our child , it is VERY heavy for him . Unfortunately , UNbeatablesale will not help out with cost of the return . It 's going to cost us @ $ 200 dollars !! I 'm so used to just trusting Amazon.com to work with top notch sellers that I never even considered the case of a return . BIG mistake . No where in their return policy does it say it say that the sole responsibility for returns is on the customer . Sorry that Amazon works with this company as they do not have a clear return payment policy . They simply say that they will not send out prepaid return labels . This brief statement leaves a lot of room for interpretation .
 WE purchased this bike as a gift for my 10 year old son as his main Christmas present . He got on to ride his new bike on Christmas morning and the Razor did not work properly . We evaluated all of the troubleshooting scenarious on the website . From everything we can tell the rear wheel is not engaging . The motor drives the chain does not engage the wheel to produce momentum . We are very dissatisfied at this moment .
 It fell apart within days ... it makes a grinding noise , wobbles and not at all steady . I called up the Customer Service , but the solutions they provided were temporary -LRB- worked for 2 min , then the noise started again !! -RRB- . There is some serious design flaw in this product . I have used ellipticals many other places , but this one is the worst among the lot . Not worth buying !!!
 3 Days ... 3 DAYS !!! before it started to fall apart . It creaks and grinds and is NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR MONEY!I 'd give it zero stars if I could .
 I bought this item a few weeks ago . The item was listed as new !! When I opened the box that it came in I found 1/2 the unit had scratches , red paint on it , and grease all over it . I wanted to send it back but it would be impossible to put it back in the same box it came in . I decide to try to assemble it . I was not even 1/2 way through putting it together and came across another problem ... the bolts that they sent with it were the wrong size . I would highly suggest to anyone looking for an elliptical trainer to shop elswhere !!!
 Bought it cheap for $ 100 . Cheap is what it is . It doesnt have a long enough stride or hard enough setting for any kind of workout . Easy to put together but fell apart even easier . Tried to resell it for $ 10 but no one wants it . Ended up at the scrapyard . If your looking for good eliptical , spend the money .
 This product is junk ! They replaced the nice heavy duty cast iron grates that this grill used to come with with this cheap tin crap that warped the 3rd time we used it . Do n't buy it !
 Terrible product . This grill lasted three uses before becoming useless . The build quality is flimsy , the piezo starter stopped functioning after the second session , the propane adapter stripped out quickly , and clean up is difficult . Fat and marinade trap easily at the bottom so flare ups are a problem . There 's no lid to deal w / flare up 's which also wastes more propane and makes cooking pretty inefficient . I would n't recommend grilling anything but hotdogs on this .
 i thought it was new I open the box it was used nasty on the in side for the price that I paid for it could had bought a brand new one
 This looked like a fine idea . The execution , however , is horrible . I tried 3 different golf bags and not one would stay attached when I attempted to pull the cart . I guess the $ 29.99 price should have clued me to the lack of quality . Objects should work as described.rjero
 Great Idea !!!!! That 's where it ends . I 've used it a couple of times on the course . The golf bag rotates around and does n't stay on the base very well . -LRB- I even tried to use a rubber strap to hold the bag down on the base . Did n't help ! -RRB- Very unstable . Does n't stay upright , so to keep it from falling over , you have to lay your bag down . Defeats the purpose!Go with a standard pull cart . This one just does n't work .
 This is a very neat product and I seriously wish it worked for me , but I find myself constantly messing with it because it 's just too damned small for me . Worn around the neck it strangles , and any way I put it on top of my head it immediately starts creeping off . I see they make a `` slim '' fit now for the `` pinhead '' types , how about one for us with the `` jumbo gourd '' . Seriously , I 'll pay extra !
 First , they sent me the wrong color . I wanted something light colored . This thing is nearly black and in Corpus Christi , thats no goodI also wanted something to keep the sun off the back of my neck , but he bottom part rides up the neck , and the top part rides down . It quickly begins to take on the personality of a choker necklace.If you are very skinny and lanky , this might be a good product for you.google `` DJ Qualls '' completely made for him ! -LRB- and no one else -RRB-
 I first purchased a wool buff by Buff and loved everything about it ! So , I decided to try another one that was a little more decorative & not wool and I ordered this item above -LRB- in the Buthan pattern -RRB- . I had been waiting & waiting for it to come and it finally did in the mail today , but it is awful !!! I was extremely disappointed in the craftsmanship of this item . The fabric is terribly cheap and the ends of the buff are not even finished or stitched . It literally looks like someone took a pair of old kitchen scissors and roughly cut off each end . Also , it is at least 6inches shorter than my wool buff I received recently as well as the buffs that my friends have . It is terrible . I would gladly pay the difference of about $ 6 for another original wool buff rather than keep this one . The price was n't an issue just wanted to try something different and will a little more of a nice pattern , since i use my other one for hiking , camping , and etc. . . Due to the type of material this is made out of I am not even sure that it would make a good utility rag at this point . I do not recommend this product.However , if you are considering getting or trying a buff out , the other , original , wool buffs by Buff - highly recommend . Could not be happier !
 I ordered a seagrass UV Blackfly Buff for use while wade fishing the sunny bonefish flats . It is recommended by several fly fishing gurus so I thought I 'd try one . I 'm 6 ' 2 '' and have an 18 '' neck and this thing is just too tight to be comfortable enough to wear . It is also too tight for me to wear as a headband and especially as a balaclava when it begins to feel like a treatment for a broken jaw ! I can stretch it out but it immediately returns to it 's original size and puts the squeeze on ... of course that 's a good thing if you are one of those that it fits well . I have stretched the heck out of this thing every way I could think of trying to make it fit me and it always goes back to the same size and it 's no worse for the wear of all the stretching . I thought I might have mistakenly gotten a junior size Buff but I checked the Buff USA website and mine is the adult 9 1/2 inch size . That 's as big as they come.Even though it does n't fit me I think this is a great , well made product . It is extremely durable considering all the stretching I 've done to it ... it 's like a Timex in that regard . Just wish they 'd consider doing an XL line . If you are a small man or a woman who loves the outdoors , I think you 'll like your Buff .
 I purchased this mask to replace the one I used last year in St. Thomas . I figured the silicone would make it more comfortable and keep the water out better . I did n't know what to expect from the Purge Valve as I had never owned a mask with one . I tried it on and the suction is great but the hard plastic disk at the bottom of the nose piece hurts my nose . I ca n't imagine having the mask on for any length of time because of this , so I returned it .
 light went kaput after two uses . horrible customer service for repairs . spend your money with someone else . i have four friends who have had problems with their systems within a couple of years .
 I have done a lot of archery throughout my life and I have to say that these are probably some of the worst arrows I have ever seen and used . The fletchings are super cheap and rip easily off , one was broken when it was delivered . The points are also cheaply designed and ready to break off . These were 15.00 dollars plus shipping so they are definitely not worth 6-7 .00 dollars an arrow . I would have given them a zero star rating but it would not let me .
 I purchased the VELO-5 at my local bike shop about a week ago . I had had a computer in the past on a different bike ; I do n't remember the model , but I bought it at Walmart for $ 10 or so . I was hoping that a major bicycle accessories company would have a slightly more reliable product.When I opened the package , I was mildly disappointed ; the computer , sensor , and wire were mounted via plastic cinch strips , instead of proper mounting brackets , like the cheap computer I 'd last used . Nevertheless , I installed it as indicated in the directions ; I had no trouble with the sensor and computer unit , but when I attempted to install the spoke-mounted magnet I immediately stripped the threads on the cheap plastic `` bolt '' that holds it in place . I was n't using a pair of pliers , just my fingers . In the end I was able to get it reasonably secure , until I started riding and it immediately slide on the spoke to the rim and the sensor could n't pick it up . After a few miles , the magnet loosened itself up and flew off the wheel into the woods.Luckily , I discovered I still had the all-metal magnet/bolt from the old computer I had , and put that on . Worked like a charm.I would n't suggest buying the Velo-5 unless you already have a spoke-mounted magnet lying around that you can use . The computer itself works great ; it 's accurate , even at low speeds -LRB- a major problem for the cheapo Kmart computer I had -RRB- , and the single-button operation could n't be simpler to use . If they 'd start using a metal backer on the magnet , I 'd give it 5 stars .
 I was looking forward to using this machine . Placed an order on August 2 , 2006 for next day delivery . It never arrived . Called Amazon on August 3 , 2006 and was promised for delivery on the next day . It never arrived . Called DHL on August 4th and was told by them that Amazon never sent the package out . Called Amazon and was told that it was sent out and to expect the package the latest on Monday , August 7th . Was told if it was n't there on Monday to call back and they would re-ship . Package never came on Monday . Called back Tuesday , August 8th and cancelled the order . The only good point about this is that the customer service people were friendly although not helpful since i never got my order . Will try to place the order with another company.The 1 star is for Amazon Service . I can not rate teh machine .
 I was excited when I ordered this product . I got super savings shipping and it arrived quickly . However , when I unpacked the product , it was missing pieces and missing most of the hardware , so I could not even begin to put it together . I promptly packed it up and sent it back . Thank you very much !
 There are two set of exercise
 This watch is a lie !!! There is no steel watch from Timex Data link . I 'm buyng this watch not first time and I know . In fact I called Timex and confirmed there is no model that has steel , except steel that is on band . So do your self a favor do n't buy this watch from Watchesnthings . Buy real stuff http://www.amazon.com/Timex-Mens-Ironman-Watch-T5C291/dp/B000B545B4/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s;=watches&qid;=1237479469&sr;=8-1Yes , it is acrilic , but it is real and true , not lie !!!
 First , I have been running in Thorlos for 4 years and can say that I believe their claim that their socks reduce blisters and provide shock absorption - in fact I would say they do this very effectively ! However , the mini-lite product is not as effective as the regular thickness version , in both blister prevention or shock absorption . In fact , they pretty much feel like any other sock . In my view , they are not worth the extra price over any other fitted running sock , many of which you can buy for about half the price as the Thorlos .
 I got a paid with a bike I bought used . One day , the bike fell over on its side -- a not uncommon event -- and one of these broke , right through one of the forks that holds it on the handlebar . So on that basis , I ca n't recommend them .
 If the metal was any thiner you could see through it . The lid has come off after a couple of uses , was repaired easly but attached very poor . This is not the enamel I was acquainted with .
 Amazing how simple a whistle is constructionwise . This whistle did not work . Think hard before buying this junk . Too much trouble to send it back . beware .
 I do n't know what kind of feeble fingers these other reviewers have but using this particular hand exerciser -LRB- black -RRB- is not a challenge whatsoever . This item offers an incredibly weak level of resistance . I 'm a woman and judging by the name and the color I thought I might hurt myself using this but it 's almost like moving my un-trained fingers through thin air . I 'm returning mine .
 Get the heaviest one . I 'm a scrawny kid and this was way too easy . I 'm not struggling at all . meh
 Well made - but extremely light . May be good for physical therapy or a child , not for an adult . I bought all three and even the haviest is pretty light .
 I bought all three and they should be labled Light , Lighter and Lightest.Good for physical therapy , women or children.well made .
 The product is listed as designed for men with `` very strong hands . '' I am in good shape , but I would n't consider myself very strong . I am 19 years old and only about 170 pounds . When the gripmaster arrived I began using it and I felt that it was almost effortless . I do n't think that I have very strong hands , but I wanted a challenge so I bought the `` heavy tension '' model . They should n't have pictures of bodybuilders using the product if it is n't even a legitimate workout for someone like me . Now I do n't even know how much I should move up by due to their inaccurate description .
 The grip master is comfortable on the palm of the hand , but not on the fingers or finger tips . The press downs are hard plastic and after a while your fingers are going to start to hurt if you dont have fat cushiony fingers , my fingers are hurting days after my first set . And no its not because I do n't have the strength to do it , I have no problems pressing them down its just that they are not comfortable , they should 've made the finger press downs the same as the palm grip , RUBBER !!! not hard plastic .
 My criticism of this product is in the title . While it might help strengthen the fingers , I find it does little for the thumbs . I think a tennis ball would be a better all-around hand strengthener .
 I have a Gripmaster that I bought probably 6 years ago , and it 's solid and the movement is very smooth . I bought one of these new versions of the Gripmaster and it absolutely blows.First , the name/graphics label is not what is pictured . It says `` prohands.net '' . Nice , sounds like a top-tier company -LSB- / sarcasm -RSB- . Second , the action is not smooth at all . The springs between the palm and middle section stick constantly.I do n't get how there are a bunch of different products called the `` Gripmaster '' and they are all slightly different versions of the same thing . I need to find the company that is making the version of the Gripmaster that is like my older one , because this new one sucks and is going back to Amazon .
 Its pretty light , even for a single finger for an adult man . I bought all three and this heavy tension is even light . I like the ones from Ironminds better .
 This would be good for a child or a person with petite hands , but for my full-size man hand I could only get three fingers on it . If it were larger it would be just fine
 I received the product -LRB- after a week and a half , mind you -RRB- , opened the package , and was mentally getting ready to encounter the 9 pounds of resistance . When I squeezed it , it felt like 1 pound , instead of 9 . Either my hands are very strong -LRB- I am a 5 ' 3 , 130lb 17 y. o. with no solid gym experience other than pull-ups and push-ups -RRB- , which is unlikely , or this product is a rip-off . Want to return it but foolishly threw the package and packing slip away before trying the product.DON ' T BUY IT !
 We ordered three such hand exerciser , one of them blue , but we got a black one instead . We should be sent the right item .
 I am trying to purchase the light tension -LRB- 5 lbs per finger -RRB- version of this product which comes in blue . However , the link keeps bringing up the black -LRB- heavy -RRB- version . Could your webmaster please fix this ? Thank you .
 I -LSB- used to -RSB- love this product . But Gripmaster has reduced the palm pad to something too uncomfortable to be useful . I have a 5lb blue version , which I use often . I decided to get a 7lb medium version . What arrived was the new version , which I did n't expect - images were n't yet updated . As of this writing , Gripmaster 's own site still does n't picture the currently sold version . I 've posted my own pictures here , which compare the original with the new version . The old version was nicely padded and ergonomically large . The new version has much less padding and it feels sharp and blocky . It wears on you after too few reps. With the original , I could go as long as my finger and forearm muscles would allow ; with the new one , discomfort kicks in first . As other reviewers have noted , these are n't best for developing brute strength -LRB- weights are -RRB- but rather for therapy and dexterity , which require moderately high reps. If it ca n't do the reps without discomfort , it 's just not worth using at all.And in case you own the original and you 're thinking you 'll just put the big pad on the new skeleton , forget it . They 're not interchangeable , which is also disappointing . On the original you could put the pad on either side , allowing you to use all your fingers on the unified bar or independently on the buttons . Ca n't do that with the new one . -LRB- See the pictures . -RRB- Too often a company makes a good product and once it gains a market foothold , they cut costs and expect it will only increase profit margin . This is a perfect example . Well , I hope this review will encourage purchasing choices that make Gripmaster regret their choice to go cheap on their customers . Maybe they 'll be compelled to resume making the great product it used to be , which led to all these positive reviews , almost all of which are NOT about the product you 'll actually receive.While I expect resurrection of the original Gripmaster to be a long shot , the fact remains
 I got this unit to strengthen and increase individual dexterity in my fingers , specifically the fingers on my left hand for playing bass guitar . Since the unit is made to work in unison -LRB- all fingers at once -RRB- it does not work very well for working each finger one at a time , such as a bass player might want to do for single note runs , etc. . It is likely fine for guitar players who wish to press all fingers down at the same time , such as with playing chords.While the tension seems reasonable what I also find difficult to use about it is that the unit is not large enough for my larger than average hands . If I press my fingers tight together I can use it , however , pressing only one of the end keys -LRB- such as with just your little finger -RRB- is awkward this way , and the unit itself twists to the side quite a bit.If the unit were wider I would possibly be able to use it as I originally intended , but given the small overall size of the unit and the unison function of it I will likely just give it to a guitar player friend with small hands and keep looking for another solution .
 This is a new version of a great product and falls very short of its predecessor . Very uncomfortable in the palm . Bring the old one back !
 The price went down more than two dollars as soon as next day of delivery . The product is well made , but I expected the tension to be stronger on this . Not worth the money for me at least .
 save your hard earned money and buy an exercise ball made for your hands , this item is over priced , and does n't really work well . waste of money .
 The black -LRB- Grey -RRB- padded hand portion is anemic on this model If you buy the Gripmaster from Guitar Center theirs is much more padded and easier to grip comfortably .
 I expected it to be much more difficult to use . It was easier than a hand grip I purchased at a local sporting goods store , and that store sold one for half the price of this so called grip master .
 I bought this hoping that it would increase my hand strength for palming a basketball and guitar . This thing hurts ; not my fingers nor wrist , but my palm . It is a pretty bad pain and I got the thing in the mail less then 5 min ago . I have been squeezing it for about 3 min , and do n't feel anything . It is also SO small that my fingers keep slipping off , which hurts also . This is a fail of an item . The only way I can use it is by putting my whole hand over the thing and squeezing it . Good idea , but I 'm gon na return it and get the classing squeeze thing .
 I 'm a 23 yr old male and I broke my hand in high school . It never healed correctly , and I find exercising my weak hand relieves my occasional dull pain . I ordered the red Gripmaster to replace the `` old school '' grip strengthener I 've used forever , which I felt was inferior since it does n't have a spring for each finger.I 'm disappointed with the Gripmaster for 3 reasons.First , I read medium tension was ideal for `` the average man 's hand . '' That 's me . Well , I must actually be Chuck Norris . This red gripmaster is not challenging for either hand , especially my injury-free strong hand . It 's comical that this is one step away from the maximum resistance.Second , this thing is tiny , smaller than a deck of cards . The springs are 1/2 inches long . I have stubby fingers so I was worried I would have trouble wrapping my ring and pinky fingers around it . Amazingly , my hand swallows this thing to where it 's awkward to use . Not only is the resistance too light for me , the range of motion is far too short , resulting in an underwhelming workout for the fingers and forearm.Third , the finger pads are too small and close together . Once again , I do n't have big hands . Yet if I only exercise one finger , it catches on the adjacent finger hands while I squeeze . If I had fatter fingers , I 'm positive I 'd pinch myself . They either need to separate the finger pads so we can truly work each finger , or , make the whole contraption bigger.The only reason I do n't give this one star is because I like the individual springs . That will help me strengthen my pinky , but the further I get into this review , the more I dislike this thing . I 'll use it b/c I paid for it , but `` average men , '' either get the heavy-duty one or better yet , buy a different product .
 The band on this watch will break . This is because the metal-to-plastic resin which connects the plastic band to te metal face wears off eventually-no matter how lightly the watch is used . Even under the lightest usage , at least on band will just fall off within 12-13 months . Because of this , I now bought the Nike Triax Fury model . Its band seems to be a unitary one from one end to the other -LRB- no glue ! -RRB- . If you want a Nike watch like this , get one of the Fury models .
 Returned this last fall after I received THREE whistles , not the three `` dozen '' I ordered . I see this was corrected for another customer , so hopefully it 's been rectified in the meantime , but I might double check if possible , or choose a different item for a time-sensitive order .
 I have the fabulous smaller version of this GSI wok and was excited to get its larger brother . Note that is not a wok for backpacking . This wok will serve for creating meals while car camping or at home in the kitchen , but it is too heavy to be associated with the word ` outdoor ' unless you 're traveling by pack horse.The big disappointment is that this wok does not have a domed lid , unlike its smaller incarnation . This means that you 'll be unable to use a steamer basket in this wok or be able to cook larger items.Why did GSI do this?Therefore , minus one star.The product image is somewhat disingenuous due to angle of the wok in the product image -LRB- taken directly from GSI 's product page -RRB- . You 'd never know about the problem lid unless you have seen the product in person.Minus another star.Also , the lid is not the same material or quality as the wok itself , and appears to be an after-thought add-on to what is simply an aluminum wok with a folding handle.Minus another star.Altogether , at 1 lb . 15 oz. , this is simply a lightweight kitchen wok with a non-stick surface .
 You know , preferably the type that does n't burn . Took this product up to the Boundary Waters ; it fits nicely into a Army pack/duluth pack and functions to give the pack a flat back.But after a day of use , the griddle began to warp badly and was covered with a black soot that made everything else dirty . The non-stick was n't really non-stick , as the first thing I cooked on it ruined the surface . To be fair , the product description says campfire coals , but to keep it hot enough , we had to go a fire going . The pan was placed on two rocks about six inches from the ground.I threw it away as soon as I got home . I 'll be looking for an alternative next year , and would n't recommend this unless you 're in a very controlled cooking environment .
 I want to be very clear that the issue I had was with the 3rd party seller and the item they sent me NOT Amazon 's shipping . I 'm tired of Amazon negating less-than-positive reviews claiming it was their shipping fulfillment that was the issue.It was n't . The packaging was fine ; it was the item that was misrepresented . Sold as new , CLEARLY USED.The original packaging was torn up , the glasses were in a ziplock bag inside the case , and the lenses had fingerprints all over them . I had ordered these to take on a summer trip and was very disappointed that I had to send them back . I have since ordered another pair from another website altogether . I would have preferred to order them through Amazon with Prime shipping , but I could n't take that chance a second time with such an expensive item.The glasses themselves are great ; I live in Seattle , and the HCL brown lenses are perfect for the bright , but overcast , weather in the summer months .
 This tent is not worth the money . Seems as though the manufacturer could have used a more sturdy pole and the tent would be fine . After 1 1/2 weeks of the ten being up an entire piece of one pole snapped right off , a good size piece . Then the rest of the tent caved in . Each pole needs to be screwed together and the was not part of the directions , we did it anyway , and the tent still caved . This tent could have been great with a thicker pole structure , they just cheeped out ... The weight of the actual tent does not match up with the flimsy pole structure ... this tent is crap !
 The title says it all . O good windstorm and it was all but shot . Had it tied down good and tight just could not hold up under good winds like maybe 15 20 mph
 Plastic connectors broke from the tiniest breeze . After setting it up , the wind -LRB- barely 10 mph breeze -RRB- picked it up like a parachute and snapped several of the plastic connectors . I was n't expecting much , based on other reviews , but the frame was even more flimsy than I thought possible . Others complained about the thin poles , but it was the plastic connectors that broke and no way to fix it in time for my party later that day . I am so disappointed . Based on the other reviews , it 's like the tent I received was different than the one they reviewed . The poles were fine , possibly improved after previous complaints , but the connectors were the weak point . I have a $ 200 pile of fabric and poles . Total waste of money .
 I was under the impression that I was purchasing multiple balls . Only now have they changed the product description to state that it 's only one ball . For the quality of the ball , the product is overpriced . Go to your local store and find a nerf ball instead .
 I definitely would not recommend buying this ball -LRB- yes there is only one ball that you do n't get to choose the color of -RRB- . It is a cheap foam ball that costs much more than it is worth as it is just squishy foam with a thin rubberized layer over the top . So it is not durable , not water proof , and over priced . I would highly recommend purchasing something else .
 FYI Before anyone else purchases . This ball does not bounce . It is made of foam and not good for a 17 month old . We needed a ball that bounced this size for the park . Seller needs to add this info to describtion .
 As soon as I received the product I tried adjusting to fit my size . When adjusting the strap , the plastic fastener immediately broke . The products is not dependable for daily use . The basic construction of the product is just flimsy and poorly made and would probably have to be replaced within a short time of use . I would not recommend this product .
 Instructions unclear and once figured out , gun does NOT sta in holster without being snapped shut making it slow to withdraw.VERY bad choice on my part and did not live up to the mfg 's discription .
 Poorly constructed of cheap materials . Held together with rubber bands . Simply , a very poorly put together product.Would never recommend .
 Not at all what I needed . The String was much shorter than the advertised lenght so therefore useless to me .
 I ordered the 56 inch string , but the one that came was only around 46 inches , luckily I was making a pvc bow so I cut off a few inches to make it fit
 I ordered the 60 '' string and was sent the correct string the first time . My problem is that this is not a recurve bowstring as the description leads you to believe . It is literally just a braided string . The loops are n't spliced or tied , but held together with cheap copper cable clamps . There is no serving of any kind . Even worse , the bowstring is n't even the right length . Normally a 60 '' AMR bowstring will be about 56 '' long , but this one is only 53 '' . After doing some research online , it seems that this is supposed to be the `` no-load string length '' . Is the string really supposed to stretch 3 '' when you put it on your bow ? If so , I would be pretty worried about the its longevity.I suspect that this Amazon listing was just badly thrown together and is therefore misleading . Bear Archery does make children 's toy bows . The packaging for this string indicates that it 's a replacement string for `` A34060 '' , which must be one of their toy bow models . My string 's packaging indicates that other replacement strings offered on this page are for models A34042 , A34048 , A34050 , A34054 , A34056 , and A345 . If you want to replace your kid 's toy bowstring with a $ 9 manufacturer part instead of tying a couple of bowlines in a cheap string , go ahead . If you 're looking for a real bowstring , look someplace else.The only upshot of this experience is Amazon 's fantastic refund policy . It only took about 2 minutes to go through the refund process and they 're not even making me send the string back . Looks like I 've got a new 53 '' cat toy !
 i ordered a 50 '' bow string from bear thru amazon 4 different times and got a 37 '' string each time do n't thier employees read the forms , amazon tried to fix it and i got another 37 '' bow stringi have never had a problem with amazon , in 10yrs til nowi am a prime member and shipping is free , but to get what i want for a $ 7.95 item i have to pay $ 6.95 for shipping some thing that fits in a reg . envelope ... something is wrong !!!
 I orders the 18 '' docking wheel and I was surprised to find after I had installed it to the dock that the hardware was missing . I called the vendor and I am still awaiting for any type of call back . Do n't think I will be buying from this vendor again.Capt . Ken Pappas
 Folks , I purchased this item , and it is NOT the Taylor Made Dock Pro . The item Overton carries and shipped is a DockMate . Overton is bringing this to the attention of Amazon .
 I recently got a Eureka Apex 2 tent . We do wilderness canoe camping and have been using an older Eureka dome tent that is slightly larger and uses 6 poles . The smaller footprint of the Apex 2 and the simpler setup were the main attractions . I should have returned the tent immediately after putting it up and seeing the way the fly was designed . But , because of all the favorable reviews , we decided to use it anyway . After a week of camping and a couple of rains I have to say that the design is appaling.It is a fine tent if you want the windows open while you are awake , but do n't leave them open if there is any chance of rain . The rain fly does not protect the window-doors at all except for a tiny overlap at the top . Unlike most tents the windows open from the bottom so they must be kept fully closed to protect from rain . The zippers for the doors and windows come together at the bottom away from the `` vestibules '' . They must be carefully closed into a small waterproof pocket , a process that is almost impossible in the dark . Even then , some water will leak at this closure point . If you need to get in or out of the tent while it is raining water will get in . You need to pull or push the door flap to the outside of the tent to minimize the water entry.If you need to take the tent down in the rain you will be distressed . The entire roof of the tent under the fly is netting . It makes for good ventilation , but it also makes a good water entry point when the fly is removed , which you must do to take the tent down . As for the vestibules , not a bad idea , but they are hard to reach from inside the tent . If it is raining when you try this you are going to get some water in the tent .
 Miserable excuse for a tent period . Picked one up in hopes of getting a little bulk and weight out of my decade old camping setup with a Kelty 2 man tent . This was used on one trip and immediately sold on craigslist for $ 25 since it could not be returned easily . The tent itself is of average size for a 2 man . As with most 2 man tents it is really a 1 person with a bit of gear tent . Two people would be very snug.Biggest problem with this tent ... rainfly , rainfly , rainfly . Most of the problems with this tent come from the poor excuse for a rainfly that only covers a portion of the tent . Even minor rain showers resulted in a damp tent interior . When I attempted to exit or enter the tent in a rain shower the rainfly provided no protection for the doors and water just streamed inside.Also there is little or no full coverage Vestibule room . There is no excuse for not having at least some good coverage for your boots with a modern tent . Who wants to sleep with stinky muddy boots in their tent.It was also not as simple and intuitive as a number of other tents I have setup . Overall I was very disappointed in this product and would not recommend it to anyone . Spend a few more dollars on a good Kelty , Sierra Designs , Big Agnes , or similar quality built tent .
 I spent one of the most miserable nights of my life in this tent . My daughter and I were camping on Current River and got caught in a strong rainstorm . The pitiful little excuse for a rainfly that this tent comes with is almost criminally negligent on Eureka 's part . Any tent that does n't offer a full-coverage rainfly is begging to leak.Woke up with darn near an inch of water in the tent with us . Wet bags , wet clothes , wet us.I hope to never have the misfortune of spending another night in a Eureka tent . At least not this one.I got home and ordered a Columbia Hawk Ridge tent instead . It 's made all the difference . Much superior in every single way.I ca n't recommend this tent , unless you 're planning on camping indoors .
 I love tents , but this is cheap and poorly made . Maybe for someone used to less quality and features .
 I had a Lexan version of this for two years . Then I decided to purchase this one . BIG mistake !!! The Lexan 33oz . java press plunger piece kept breaking . So did the one for the GSI Glacier Stainless Steel Java Press . The only good thing is that I could easily call GSI for replacement parts at no charge even with the shipping.I honestly thought that the stainless steel version would have a fully stainless steel plunger . I 'd say for GSI to take this design back to the drawing board.I would not recommend this to anyone until the plunger design is changed .
 The product worked very well for a couple of weeks , but I have had to send it back . The plastic filter on the end of the plunger is very flimsy . It works its way loose easily when rinsing , and a piece of the plastic cracked off underneath where the rod screws in . It is a real shame GSI has n't seen fit to put a stronger filter in this otherwise very nice press .
 We returned to Amazon and got a full refund . Thank you Amazon . First it came plopped in a box , rolling around with absolutely no padding . Then the top was hard to get on -LRB- not sure if it was damaged in transit ? -RRB- . But overall for the price , this product is very flimsy construction and it would n't have lasted for more than a few uses .
 I bought this product from Shooter 's Ridge . Stay away from this product because it does not come pre-filled as advertised . I have not been able to use this product yet because I have n't had the time to fill it . First , I have to figure out what to fill it with . Once this is determined -LRB- I live in Minnesota with a blanket of snow -RRB- , then I have to spend considerable time filling it . Do n't buy this product .
 After only about 15 uses , the main stretch-band handle ripped off of the band . Do not buy -LRB- from Amazon or anywhere -RRB- .
 This is OK as a general bike workout . But , if you are more a spinning enthusiast I 'm not sure how relevant it is .
 I was REALLY looking forward to receiving this item for the camping trips we have planned this summer . When it finally arrived I was happy to see that it was a decent size . The construction * seemed * to be really nice too . We set it up in the living room to check it out and noticed that the leg joints for the main section -LRB- not the wire stove counter section -RRB- were in two pieces , put together via plastic joints . After moving the table in the room , two of the legs broke . The plastic plugs came out of the metal tube and bent the metal so that putting the leg back in was a bad fit . Now , I have wood floors and I was really surprised that the small amount of pressure applied would break the table legs so easily . If I 'd had carpets , I could see the legs getting stuck in the piling and forcing the break . But it 's absolutely ridiculous that the legs should break so easily . So for future purchasers of this item , please remember that you will need two people to move it by lifting it on all sides before putting it back down again .
 The legs that attach to the sink section have are plastic screw type and made the sink very wobbly . The extended shelf section was not sturdy enough then to hold a stove or grill and actually pulled on the plastic sink and made an impression . The water system worked however can not be used with solid water jugs as seen in other photos . The connections for the water system were push on not screw on and were hard to connect . This was not a typical GSI product . Not a good design . I called GSI as well and gave them this review . I purchased this from another store and they are refunding me .
 I have ordered countless things online and have never been compelled to write a review before . I was completely ecstatic to `` Bears '' down my sons room . Let 's keep in mind that he is 19 months old , so he takes up very little space in his twin size bed nor does he actually ever use this comforter for his blanket . We have had the set for a whopping 6 weeks and already the Bear silkscreen is cracked and peeling off . Since we do n't use it for his blanket we have n't even put it through the washer , I ca n't imagine it being able to endure that since it has n't endured six weeks of being basically a decorative throw . Disappointed does n't even begin to describe how I feel .

 sweat a lot not durable , if you use this product be careful , probably best for jogging no weight lifting if I was just a runner I would probably be able to rate this product different , maybe could hold up better than doing fast movements with heavy weights .
 IF you understand the english language please read
 Bell Fitness Solar Belt -LRB- One Size Fits Most -RRB- This has been a most disappointing belt . Number one , it falls apart with hardly any wearing . Number two , the prices charged are outrageous for the amount of wear it is capable of.I would like to get a real belt that wears well and effectively for a long time of exercise .
 Less durable than the Danskin product I bought for comparison purposes . There were small tears at both edges after 4-5 months of use .
 Purpose of the belt was to keep the lower back warm while exercising . It works , does not slip . I would have paid more for a more sturdy neopreme fabric , thus adding some support . As i said you get what you pay for .
 This coffee maker broke on the third use . The top that pushes down is very flimsy and a spoke broke making it unusable . Lucky for us we had another top from a different company that we had saved from an old pot that had broken .
 The press mechanism broke in the 2nd week of a 3-week sailing vacation . It ca n't be fixed , so it 's of no use any more . Before that , it made great coffee and appeared to be perfect for use on the sailboat .
 I was really upset that after using this for camping 1 time the inside of the press broke into pieces , I ca n't even fix it . For one thing these presses inside should not be made of plastic there is to much pressure .
 Do n't be deceived by the high price of this volleyball . It is NOT a real AVP ball . The real one 's have a gold label and are made out of leather . This is a synthetic ball that will last a lot longer than a leather one for two reasons : A
 The stencils in this kit are way to small and will only work on average sized pumpkins , also the stencils are only good for one use .
 highly dissapointed ! The knives broke before we could carve the pumpkin . We were going to use these for a party for a football theme . Big waste of money !
 Been unable to figure out how it works because it arrived with no instructions or package . Just the stop watch in an envelop . Really ca n't rate the product .
 I have the Wii Fit and have been using it for a couple months . I thought I 'd try this product just to get some variety . Sorry I did.The interface to the game is not nearly as good good as the Wii fit . The exercise routines are OK , but the leg band keeps falling off and the rubber band they send you to work with is a joke.While some of the graphics are nice , the overall quality of it is just not up to what I expected .
 The resistance band and leg strap both contain latex . Would have been nice if that was noted on the outside packaging .
 I read all the reviews and felt pretty comfortable buying the game . We played it for exactly 30 minutes and could not figure out what everyone else found to be fun about the game . It was soooooo much worse than the WII game . My daughter and I mastered the cardio dance -LRB- which really wasnt dancing - more like some kind of cheerleading movements -RRB- within minutes . We did a couple other exercises - none that were anything to write home about . The scenery was kind of cheesy , the music -LRB- or lack thereof -RRB- was horrible , and we hardly broke a sweat doing the exercises that we like . In a word - BORING . I will take WII Fit over this product anyday .
 A little disappointed , does not always pick up body movements and transfer to the screen . May have been a better `` fit '' out there . You might try it out before you buy it and are stuck with it .
 I am very disappointed in the leg strap . I bought this game to help lose weight and if you are heavy the leg strap is difficult to get on and keep on . In fact it may not fit depending on how big you are . The company should really develop and include in the game an extension for the leg strap .
 The Balance Board does not work with this game . It says it does but it will not sync in game . Below is the official EA explanation but `` A small minority '' must mean everyone that bought the game . Even work around explained does not help . >> >> A small minority of players have experienced issues syncing their Balance Boards with the game . While this is not a widespread issue , Nintendo and Electronic Arts are well aware of the bug and the EA SPORTS Active development team is hard at work on a fix . Expect a patch -LRB- for this and other minor issues -RRB- to be released very shortly.As a temporary fix , try syncing the board from within the Home Screen . When the game asks you to sync the board , press the Home button on the Wii mote and then hit the sync buttons on the Balance Board -LRB- near the battery compartment -RRB- and the Wii itself -LRB- under the plastic flap on the front of the console -RRB- . This procedure should keep the Board functioning until it enters sleep mode -LRB- after an extended period of non-use -RRB- , upon which you 'll have to repeat the above steps .
 I think the overall concept of EA Active is great . The problem is that the actual product does not follow through . - The game does not register my movements . Many times it does not register that I 've done the exercise . It just stays stuck in one place . Even if I 'm holding still , it will tell me that I 'm not . - Too much downtime between exercises . I wear a heart rate monitor and my heart rate drops too much between exercises for it to be effective . - Not intensive , or enough , cardio . - Resistance band is cheap and does not provide enough resistance to really work muscles.Overall , I find this be a big waste of money . I really expected more from EA and Nintendo with this product .
 I was extremely disappointed in this product . I was so looking forward to getting into some fun exercise , but this was more annoying than anywhere near exercise . As others stated , the leg band kept falling down -LRB- and it 's not because my thighs are skinny ! -RRB- , if I was n't holding the controls perfectly , the exercise would stop and I would have to stand there for a long time until I figured it out . This happened over and over . The competitions are not challenging at all . Maybe , just maybe , this would work for someone who has NEVER worked out before . They might find it fun . But if you are looking for a workout that is challenging and enjoying , this is not for you . I wish I would have listened to the critical comments instead of the great ones . I learned a lesson ! I would have saved myself time and money .
 I think this game is great in theory , but it was n't well implemented , particularly with regard to the controls . The leg strap falls off too easily . It 's difficult to get the game to recognize your movements unless you hold the controller just so or have it just perfectly positioned in the pocket of the leg strap . The resistance band is chintzy and weak . I found myself struggling more with controls , the strap , and the band then with the actual workout .
 I got tired of this very quickly . At first I thought it was great . Better than Wii Fit.Now I have Wii Fit Plus and I love it.The leg band was uncomfortable and I kept having to readjust.It was hard to actually get in the spirit . Too much wii control activity and not enough straight routine .
 I was hoping that this program would allow me to share the workout experience with my wife . However , I am very disappointed.First ... the leg strap does n't work . I did find I could apply a tourniquet and get the strap sufficiently tight to stay on my leg , but then this might not promote lifelong use of the leg ... My pants pocket will be the alternative.Second ... the `` Mii '' is n't me at all . Believe it or not , Wii Fit Plus uses a much more life-like Mii than EA Sports Active . If they allow the user to create a Mii , it should at least somewhat resemble me -LRB- beard , glasses , conservative haircut , etc. -RRB- . Third ... The game does n't seem to accurately track my movements . To jog , I ended up taking the nunchuck out of my pocket and held it in my hand , shaking it in time with my leg movements . For other activities , I could n't figure out the magic way to hold it just right.Fourth ... Good thing I am right handed , since the exercises , such as pitching , seem to be designed for those of use who prefer the right approach ... Fifth ... Why such short options for custom exercises ? I can do extensions for just one time . Otherwise , if I want more than 3 or 6 minutes , I have to string a bunch of similar exercises together then start them over.Bottom line
 Have used this system 3 times and it constantly fails to continue the exercises . I think there are multiple software deficiencies
 This software could be really good , but after 3 days of dealing with all the non-sense involved , I 'm either going to trade it in or throw it away . The game has no idea what my movements are . It says to run on the track , so when I start running in place , the message on the screen constantly switches back and forth from `` perfect '' to `` too slow '' even though I 'm running at the same pace for the entire exercise . The resistance band that comes with the game is not even challenging for my 7 year old daughter . I 'm not sure if it 's 2 lbs or 5 lbs , but it 's useless . When performing curls , the game repeatedly told me to hold still and hold my arms like the person on the screen . I ended up doing about 30 curls and it only registered one of them . I have no reason to believe this is a Wii hardware problem as the family plays lots of other games on a regular basis .
 I 've been using this game for over two months now ... as a workout , it is very effective
 It looked like it would be great , but after many tries and having it always hang up ... we gave up and returned it .
 This game has a bug that sometimes it can not recognize the movement and just hang there .
 I thought this game was good on the first day I had it - it was a nice mix of fun and more of a workout than wii fit . I immediately started the 30 day challenge and thought the exercises were good , except for the bent over rows . I am really short so I had to have my legs very wide in order for the resistance band to give any kind of resistance . The second day I did the workout my game stopped registering my movements during the bicep curls and lunges . I opened a new nunchuck and changed the batteries on my wii remote but still could not get the exercises to register . I tried skipping exercises , and that worked for a bit , but who needs a game that you ca n't do all the moves in ? Then the game kept telling me to stand still even though I already was . I adjusted the leg strap and even tried taking it off and setting it , the remote , and nunchuck down , but the game still insisted that I was not standing still . My boyfriend tried to use the game to see if it was just me , and it would not register his moves either . It was incredibly frustrating , and I returned the game . I had really high hopes for this product but so far it is the only game for wii that I have had any kind of trouble with . When I was having trouble with the controls it was WORSE than the Jillian Michaels game .
 This was the worst video game and waste of money yet . HATED it . half the time the nunchunk in the strap does n't register . The other half the time the punches in the boxing do n't register . I WANT MY MONEY BACK . HORRIBLE
 The reason I gave the Wii Active such a poor review is the numchuck holder is designed very poorly . The numchuck holder does not stay on the thigh very well - Nintendo could of come up with a different way to hold the numchuck on the leg . If I knew how poorly designed the holder was I would not have purchased this workout from Nintendo . I wish I could get a refund .
 First , let 's look at the value provided in EA Sports Active . For your 60 bucks you get a joke of a resistance band , the leg strap , and the game disc . If you like to wear nylon gym shorts you will be disappointed in the leg strap . It wo n't stay in place because Sports Active is very much high impact . Lots of jumping , and more jumping , and running in place , with high knees or it wo n't register properly . Then deep knee bends , not squats , as they 're mislabed . In four episodes of using the prepared workouts you 'll earn a trophy ... . for over 100 deep knee bends.Second , as several reviewers have already pointed out , the `` game '' locks up frequently . No rhyme or reason to either the lockups or what you 'll have to do to recover . Other reviewers have also noted the lack of any pushups or situps , but there are lots and lots of lunges and deep knee bends , mislabeled as squats.Third , holding the numchuk and wiimote while corded together and doing some of these exercises will have the cord flying all around your face.Fourth , for all of you complaining about the time it takes to do a workout with Wii Fit , the pre-assembled so-called 30 minute workout with EA Sports Active takes 45 minutes by my clock ! -LRB- The twenty minute ones take about 35 minutes by the clock , even skipping all videos . -RRB- I can do the entire Strength , Yoga , Rhythm Boxing - Expert from Wii Fit in one and one-half hours and get credit for one hour and twenty-one minutes of exercise.Fifth , prepare to do the same things over and over in each workout . Deep knee bends , running in place , bent over rows are all repeated at least twice in each of the pre-assembled workouts.Sixth , you 'll spend an inordinate amout of time putting the numchuk in the leg strap , taking it out for the next exercixe , putting it back in for the one after that , holding it with the resistance band next , etc. . I find that much more aggravating than clicking through the Wii Fit menus.In conclusion , I do n't know how this got such good ratings . It is n't a fun workout , flows less well than Wii Fit , and since you 're constantly fixing either the leg strap or resistance band , this game is downright aggravating .
 Thankfully a friend loaned this to me , so I was n't out the money . I tried it maybe 5 times over 2 weeks , doing the 30 Day Challenge after the 1st time . While at first it seemed I was getting a good workout , after the first time , the only thing I was feeling after the fact was massive knee pain . I amped up to the `` hard '' setting on the Challenge , and I have to say , it was not challenging at all . There is a lot of stop & wait , a lot of `` hold still '' and a lot of annoying chatter from the trainer . If I ever hear `` You , my friend , are poetry in motion '' again , I may have to strangle someone.I would say if you have any experience working out at all , this wo n't do it for you . If not , perhaps this is the way to get into working out .
 Plastic band is very cheaply made . Leg cuff to hold numchuk falls down easily.Going from band to sticking numchuk into cuff is crazy . Oh wait . Let me put my band down while I put the numchuk into the cuff . Perform exercise . Then it switches back to a band exercise . Oh wait again while I take out the numchuk and get the band and put it on the floor and step on it to perform next exercise.Constantly have to stop , wait and stand still for the instructor because the program does not sense motion properly when a rep has been performed correctly .
 I wanted to warn people off because this has gotten so many good reviews , but its not for everyone . Certainly not for me.I give it 2 stars because it did give me a workout . Unfortunately , playing the game felt more like a chore than a game.I stuck it out through the games entire `` 30 day challenge '' to give it a fair shot . Having done so , I do n't think I will play it again.There are no high scores to strive to surpass . The music is terrible . The avatars do n't move in sync with your movements.The game feels more like an exercise video that complains at you if you happen to be holding the wiimote incorrectly.Most of this is doing exercises like lunges and bicep curls . If you like this sort of thing , thats fine , but I find it boring.The `` sports '' games are few and far between which is merciful as they are more worse than the exercises.They are basically timing games . Swing your arms at the right moment to hit the machine launched tennisball . Wheee.The game plays better without the wii fit board . It seems tacked on as an afterthought , and it does n't seem to work very well with the game.I really enjoy exercising with the Wii fit.My latest favorite exercise game is Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party 3 . That game is a blast , and gives you just as much exercise.Skip this , and buy DDR or Wii fit .
 I had high hopes for this game as I wanted something a little more challenging than the Wii Fit and My Fitness Coach had to offer . The first couple of days I tried out the game I liked it , but now that I have completed the 30 Day Challenge , I can not recommend this game.I find that having to use the nunchuck made things more clumsy and awkward . It was especially clumsy when performing the moves in volleyball , tennis and baseball . Let me clarify , it was the wire from the nunchuk that made it clumsy . If Nintendo could figure out a way to make the nunchuk wireless , then this game would improve immensely.I have trouble with the kick-ups . Sometimes it tells me I am doing it perfectly , sometimes it tells me I am too slow , even though I have not changed my speed or position . It 's very frustrating.Squats are an excellent exercise to do , but I find that in order to do them `` properly '' in this game , my form is all off.Using the balance board did not provide any additional benefit to the exercises , it only made them more clunky and cumbersome . Also , I know it is recommended that you not wear sneakers to use the balance board , but I am not about to keep taking my shoes on and off during the workout.I can see how this game is beneficial to people who are looking to start a workout program . But I found that I tired of it quickly and I almost dreaded just getting through the 30 Day Challenge . I would not recommend it for people who have had any experience with working with free weights in a gym .
 Overall , EA Sports Active feels a lot like a pre-release of a game that will become an excellent game just as soon as the people who purchase the game find all the bugs for them . In other words , the first wave of buyers are their Beta testers.Numerous people have posted their frustrations over the problem with the intermittent failures of the game to properly track the movements of their arms and legs . I have had the same issue , the game stalls and goes into an annoying waiting mode prompting you to complete the exercise , not because you have n't but because it is not reading your movements properly . Normally you can get out of this mode by widely swinging whatever body part it has failed to read . It 's annoying to have to do this , and so far this is the only Wii sports game I 've played that has this glitch.The resistance band have almost no resistance , and the idea of holding the Wii controls in each hand along with the resistance band is just plain bad design . However , I suspect that they ended up like this as the lesser of two evils . You ca n't do the exercises without holding the two Wii remotes in your hands , however if you used the right resistance while holding the remotes you have a safety issue . I noticed that Everlast released a set of two pound weights that hold the Wii remotes inside of their handles which allow for the correct resistance without the safety risks . If Everlast ends up releasing an entire range of hand weights for the Wii console , then the EA Sports Active resistance band could be replaced with those weights . Problem solved , but then again , if EA Sports Active had thought this all through when they designed this software , it would have been a non-issue , solved before the release of the software.This is why I feel this product is more of a Beta then a full release . The designers and managers behind this game had to have known at some point that the resistant bands were not a good design , and they should have come up with a solution before releasing this to the world.If everything worked right , and the resistance band was not an issue I would give EA Sports Active five stars . As it stands , I only give it a three . I have also decided that I will rent any Wii sports games before I buy . Wii sports games seem to always get high reviews , in spite of some real problems with the quality of the software.On a side note there 's a workout you do with the band for your shoulders where the trainer actually says `` At no time should you allow the shoulder to come out of the socket . '' I ca n't tell if it 's suppose to be a joke or not , but either way , it 's pretty funny .
 I 've tried most of the workout games available for the Wii and EA Sports Active brings a few new welcome things to the table but in the end falls short . While their program occasionally makes exercise enjoyable , more often than not it has you running for an unknown goal in which you barely break a sweat.When you start EA Spots Active you create your Fitness Profile . You absolutely have to have the nunchuck plugged in for this for some reason , which is a bit annoying but understanding that a workout is only minutes away a minor inconvenience . As in Wii Fit the first thing you are shown is the current system settings for date and time are displayed and you are asked to confirm if they are correct . Next you are ask if you want to load the last profile used if you have a profile created . If you do n't have a profile you are prompted to create a personal Fitness Profile to track your goals and stats as you progress through the game.Default profile settings are below and are all adjustable using horizontal sliders or arrows on a single page . No voice over is heard during the profile creation process to walk you through the why and what-for but its fairly simple to get through . Oddly though you do n't use the Wii Balance Board to weigh yourself for the first time . A strange omission considering that Wii Fit has made this the standard.Fitness Creation Options : Female/Male-Age
 I am very enthusiastic about this category of product . I have used the Wii Fit at least weekly for over a year . The Wii Fit is great fun and is a superb stress management system , but is a poor cardio workout . So when I read reviews of EA Active as a more cardio Wii Fit , I bought it.I have used Active almost daily for over a month and it is a very disappointing product . Active has many , many problems but the biggest is that Active does not deal with data coming from the nunchuk and wiimote effectively . For example , if you run at a constant pace , every few seconds you will get alternating instructions such as `` too slow '' and `` perfect '' as the Active is not interpreting the data properly . This also creates a frequent lag between your actions and the result on the screen . This becomes very annoying in the timing games -LRB- tennis , baseball , etc. -RRB- . Instead of `` just working , '' like Wii Sports Tennis , you change the timing your swing to adjust for the lag . Active has you exaggerate your actions during the exercises -LRB- e.g. `` point the numchuk at the ground at the conclusion of the exercise '' -RRB- to compensate . As a result you need to concentrate on complying with these exaggerated actions to complete the exercise . And no matter how hard to concentrate you will never always get it right , resulting in Active nagging you and wasting your time . So while you should be getting in a positive frame of mind with an exercise product , with Active you end up getting frustrated with the poor product quality . Not fun.There are many , many other shortcomings , but I will mention a few . The workouts are geared towards women . Like most men , I need cardio and abdominal/core work . You will not get much of either with Active . Workouts emphasize toning arms and legs , typically not an issue for men . What passes for cardio is high impact jumping . You will jump over 100 times a workout . So unless you are under 25 and/or a runner be prepared for sore knees . If you dig deep you can find one low impact -LRB- and even lower cardio -RRB- workout and the ability to customize workouts . However , it takes several minutes to set up a customized workout and it does not save them . So no cardio either.There are plenty of other shortcomings - a really lame Me creator , Sega Genesis era graphics , balance board integration an afterthought - but you get the idea . On the positive side , Active has helped my wife get some exercise while the kids are home for the summer . In addition , the 30 day challenge provides some structure for those who are not self motivated . Our three kids , who love anything Wii , tried Active a couple times and dumped it.We own Fifa 09 for the Wii . EA knows how to make games for the Wii . I am not sure what happened with the is product , but save your money , it is a disaster .
 I 'm reading all of these reviews , and I ca n't believe how positive they all are ! I guess if you 've never worked out before or want some light exercise then this will be fine , but otherwise do n't expect too much . Here are my issues : - Working out with yourself as an avatar instead of following the movements of an on-screen coach was too weird for me -- there 's a lag in the action between you and what your cartoon self does , so it does n't really move with you . You 're even supposed to try to make it look like you , which I found slightly creepy . - There are several times during the workout when you 're told to keep still when you 're not moving at all , and it wo n't proceed until you hold still for about thirty seconds . Kind of kills the whole `` cardio '' flow . - There 's no stretching or real warmup/cooldown . There 's a jerky kind of walk/jog on a track at the beginning which I guess could be interpreted as such , but did n't work for me . - There are very few low-impact exercises available . I have a bad Achilles tendon and ca n't jog . I opted out of as many exercises as I could , but when told to break into a jog from a walk , I just ended up shaking the nunchuk in my hand to make it think I was running . The exercises that remained were n't very cardio-challenging -LRB- even set to their hardest -RRB- , and there was WAY too much fussing with the band and holstering/unholstering the nunchuck between exercises . - The resistance band is way too weak . I ended up using my own , which was much stronger . - Cardio boxing ? Please . Even set at the highest level , you punch at the targets so slowly you could get coffee in between ! - It offers a `` customized workout '' option to design yourself , but this , too , was disappointing because it pauses between each exercise -- there 's really no way to maintain an elevated heart rate and have a truly successful cardio workout with this.Bottom line , I was looking for something WAY more challenging , and actually feel like this was a waste of money . I was looking for something to supplement My Fitness Coach -LRB- which also has some issues , but overall takes a much better approach and makes you work a lot harder over time -RRB- , and this just did n't fit the bill , sorry.But just so I 'm not 100 % negative , the in-line skating was fun and more difficult than expected . Hard on the Achilles , but definitely challenging .
 Some aspects of this game are fun and challenging but the game is just too frustrating to use for a regular workout . I have had the same problems a lot of others complain about -- the resistance band snaps and does n't offer much resistance anyhow , and my movements do not always register . It 's annoying to have to stop to adjust the remote in all different directions to find the perfect angle to make it register -- even when following the directions exactly . I would not recommend the game .
 I was so excited to get this game . I could not wait to try it . I had read all of the reviews here and on the EA Active game website forum - they complained about the strap and the game freezing . I figured I would try it anyway because of all of the positive reviews . Well guess what - could not keep the leg strap on and the game froze up 5 times in the first 3 minutes . I have brand new WII console that has not given me a lick of problem with any other game . I am returning this piece of crap this morning . Save yourself the time and money and do not purchase this .
 Fun game , but system does not pick up each body movement - which makes it very frustrating to continue .
 Unless you mainly want to do squats & run . If that 's all you want then you should like this . I was really looking forward to this workout but I found it kind of dull . It had great potential and I bought it excited for the kickboxing & inline skating . The main problem with this workout is that the makers thought it would be less dull if you only did about 1-2 minutes of each exercise before moving on to the next one . So instead of say ; playing tennis , you hit 10 balls in a row then it stops and moves on to the next thing . Which is probably squats . This takes all of the `` have fun while you exercise '' that the Wii is known for out of this program . Even the `` dancing '' segments are dull . Perhaps if the transitions were fast from activity to activity the concept would have worked but unfortunately , they are painfully slow . And the trainer is so slow I found myself wondering if they made this for people who did not speak English as their first language . The slow pace and slow transitions made me not really even break a sweat . I 'm not entirely sorry I bought it because the kickboxing & inline skating segments will give me a little variety from time to time -LRB- but remember each only runs for a few minutes instead of being a fun game-like activity -RRB- . The ability to choose the order of workouts and put them into a program is novel and would have been great if the activities were more fun . Overall this really could have been a great addition to the Wii but I think it falls WAY short . And I think it should have cost no more than $ 20 bucks . If you want a better workout get `` Gold 's Gym Cardio Workout '' -LRB- boxing -RRB- instead and hope , like I do , that the makers of the Wii think up some really fun games that workout the lower body well since we need them !
 My wife and I bought this game after tearing through Wii fit and Gold 's Gym Cardio . At first it seemed pretty promising . But within a week both bands broke , so we went out and bought bungee style bands ... which is fine except holding both the band handles and the wiimote is a bit difficult . Especially with how sensitive this game is to the direction and orientation of your wiimote.But the biggest pain -LRB- literally -RRB- is the fact that every single time we did alternating lunges , reverse lunges , or jump lunges , the game would hold us longer on our left leg than our right . I 'm talking like 3 seconds longer each time . We ended up just holding our right lunges an extra 3 seconds so we did n't end up all lopsided with one gigantic leg and one normal sized leg.My wife also had so much trouble getting the game to recognize her movements that she finally gave up on the game completely .
 The leg strap falls off easily . The game does n't do a good job registering your movements and you ca n't keep going once it decides your not moving your arm in the exact correct position , even if you are actually moving the correct way . You can customize your workouts but you ca n't just go in and try different activities , you have to actually set up a workout in order to even just try one exercise , which is time consuming when you just want to try the different activities . There are no core muscle exercises .
 Awful design - save your money ! The leg strap is either too tight or falling off . Even when properly on the Wii will not read the remotes . For some reason , the game stops dead if it ca n't tell what you are doing . I spend more time adjusting remotes & waving them at the machine to get the exercise started back up than I do actually exercising . Needless to say , I am not achieving my target heart rate , although my blood pressure is way up.My wii does other games fine ; software glitch or something ? Very poor design to have the exercise come to a dead stop if it can not read what you are doing.Also , the intensity of the exercise is lacking . I am an overweight couch potato trying to get a bit more fit , and I have a hard time breaking a sweat on a lot of them .
 I bought this for my Wii and I thought it was a pretty cool idea using the nunchuk in a leg strap the way they do in this . I was wrong.The problem with the leg strap is that whoever engineered the design had no business doing so . I 'm not terribly out of shape and my legs are the normal `` circumfrence '' . However , when I put this leg strap onto ANY sort of clothing/fabric , it always slipped down during the exercises . I tried running shorts , jogging pants , jeans , casual shorts , anything and everything that would just stop the damned thing from slipping . NOTHING worked . It always slips and you can feel it slipping and it makes you really distracted from the exercise which is TERRIBLE for a good , focused workout . I highly reccomend waiting until they possibly improve the leg strap.Also , the mechanics of the game are TERRIBLY flawed . On several of the exercises , I was doing EXACTLY what was asked of me by the game , but the trainer kept insisting that I was n't doing it right and implored me to try again REPEATEDLY ad nauseum . You will become so frustrated that , if you 're anything like me , you 'll end up screaming to the TV `` BUT THAT 'S EXACTLY WHAT I 'M DOING , YOU PIECE OF ... '' Well you get it.The most difficult workouts to deal with are any of the ones involving lunges . It NEVER picks up on your movements , and then blames YOU for it . I recall one time a member of my family spent 5 + minutes simply trying to get it to recognize that she was doing the correct movements . It takes an act of god for this game to recognize and understand your movements . I would n't give this game the money or the time of day required to use it.Buy any Wii workout game but this one and you 'll be much better off .
 I am a mom of 2 and have been trying to get some workout in at home . I thought this would be very challenging . The upper body workout is not challenging at all and there is no ab workout . With in a week of using this the resistant band broke . I thought I would just return it since I barely even used it . I was told that I could only exchange for another one . I was not happy about that . I would not get this item again if I had the choice .
 I think the workout exercises are great and kept me very interested with the different scenarios . It is very hard at first because there is a lot of squatting involved , but after a couple weeks I really noticed an improvement in my thigh muscles . My advice to anyone starting any kind of exercise program is to skip two days after your first day . Because it really hurts the day after ... hurts a lot more the second day after ... on the third day , it hurts about as much as the first day after , but you warm out of it and then can work out without having near as much after-workout pain.What I do n't like about this DVD : You should be able to skip an exercise when you are in the middle of the workout . Only way to skip one is if you uncheck it from the list before starting . If you go back and uncheck it , the whole workout starts over.There is a lot of time wasted in intros to every exercise . You are forced to go through the `` show me how '' EVERY TIME ... must ALWAYS click the plus to `` show me how '' and then click it again to skip to the exercise . There should be something to click to completely bypass the `` show me how '' . If you are not holding position exactly and perfectly , it tells you to `` stand still '' and wait for up to a couple of minutes BETWEEN EACH REP before the exercise resumes . That is also one heck of a time waster . If I only have 20-30 minutes to work out , all these pauses only allow me to do a few exercises with most of my time spent standing still waiting for the program to resume . There is no way to make it resume until it does it on its own . It can take 10 or more minutes to go through one 16 rep exercise because of this . It is very frustrating because to my knowledge I AM doing it correctly . Since it is apparently sensing that one 's position is wrong , why ca n't it tell you WHAT you 're doing wrong so you can correct it?The exercise band that comes with the DVD is very wimpy . Fine for someone who never uses their arms at all I suppose , but it did nothing for me .
 I hated putting on the leg strap . which always fell down or completely off . Also , when you 're doing the exercises a lot of of times the game does n't pick up your movement so you are stuck and not able to move ahead . Total pain . I ended up buying an exercise DVD instead .
 I will refer to the review by Jacques Strap -LRB- cute name , BTW -RRB- for the key points of my difficulty with this game . But as an aside , for those who may have the concerns I do about high-impact exercises and their knees in particular , I would like to specifically say you should avoid this program . I have been using the Wii Fit Plus for 6 months with no problem . There are plenty of excercises to choose from , and you can build a customized workout -- just not with cardio built in . I like the Wii Fit Plus . I do have bad knees , but I have not had trouble with them doing those exercises . However , going through the `` hard '' level of the 30 minute workout on the EA Sports Active , more than 30 % of it was jumping -- jump lunges , jump squats , rollerblading with jumping . And really nothing for your abs at all.The strap is really annoying . It is very hard to hold them and the nunchuk and the remote at the same time and still get that magic angle with the remote so that your move registers as complete . I ca n't tell you how long I was in a squat just because 1 -RRB- the remote kept banging on the tension strap and 2 -RRB- I did n't have the remotes pointed in the exact correct angle at the end of the exercise.Sorry , but I would much rather do my Jillian Michaels video and use weights for my tricep kickbacks than mess with this strap thing and the nunchuk and remote .
 I wanted to diversify from Wii fit and play a fitness game with my daughter . First thing I noticed is that even in two player mode you are required to strap the nun-chuck to your thigh . We have two nun chucks but the game only comes with one thigh strap - not something one would get extras of . So after getting irritated me and daughter started skipping all nun-chuck thigh exercises which ruined the workout.But even trying it alone I found the nun-chuck as used in this game annoying , I would be hit by the wire , have movement restricted by the wire or the whole strap and numchuck fall off my leg.In short I am still looking for a game to supplement Wii Fit Plus .
 I have been using My Fitness Coach -LRB- MFC -RRB- and bought EA Sports because of all the great reviews . I tried it for a few sessions , and now it gathers dust because :1 . The leg holster is cumbersome and uncomfortable . It is a real pain taking the motion detector out of the pocket and to put it in correctly . The game wo n't work unless the thing is put in just right .2 . I did n't do a couple of the exercises correctly and the game would keep on telling me I was doing it wrong . I would keep on trying to do it right with no positive results . Finally , the game would freeze up and I would have to restart it . When I exercise , I do n't want to worry about correct settings and rebooting the Wii.Now I am back on MFC and love it . It is not exciting . It is not a game . But is not just a DVD either . The change with each session and you can concentrate on cardio , lower body , core , upper body and flexibility for each time . However , they all start with cardio to get you warmed up and sweating .
 EA Sport Active is a great concept . An interactive coach that monitor your form , speed , etc while performing the reps with you is amazing . Unfortunately , this software come with a big issue ; it has glitches . Certain exercises can not be recognized , no matter how you attempt to mimic the fitness model . What happens ? The game stops -LRB- trying to correct you -RRB- and you become increasingly frustrated . This can go on for 4 , 5 , 8 mins . Worse than the frustration is you lose the ` pump ' and your heart rate drops -LRB- I wear a monitor -RRB- . Finally you cancel out that session and on to the next ... and it will happen again on another exercise . I contacted the tech 's at the software company and they said ` Yeah , we know . We get a lot of complaints on it ' only to end the conversation with ` maybe it 's your form ? ' It 's not . They made a ton of money on a faulty software . You 've been warned . Make a better choice .
 The 30 day challenge has a lot of running and jumping which is very hard on the knees . I already had one replacement -LRB- and need the other knee replaced -RRB- so I have to take many of these exercises out of my workout . The ones left are okay but I do n't feel that I get that good of a workout . And you definitely need to have the remote and nunchuck in the correct position or they wo n't register your movements.If you choose to use the balance board , you either have to take off and put on your sneakers several times or -LRB- as I now do -RRB- just keep them on while using the board . I know this is n't recommended but it is less of a hassle.I finished the 17th day of the challenge today . I still do WiiFit Plus everyday in addition to this one . I enjoy WiiFit Plus much better than this one but I will continue to use both . -LRB- P.S. I DO NOT WEAR shoes when using Fit Plus . -RRB-
 I did n't get too far because the leg strap is too short to fit high enough on my leg for the nunchuck to register well . For the first running exercise I could just put it in my pocket , but the squats were just impossible . I may give it one more try to see if there is any way I can rig this thing to work with my body , but otherwise I may just return it . When making a fitness product , it helps to consider that people who are n't fit and are looking to change that may want to use it .
 The concept and idea of the game is great . The problem is that the techonology can not make it real . The exercises that work well , running , jumping are fine . The resistance band exercises are horrible . Why - The system is not sensitive enough to `` read '' what your doing and the controls have to held in the `` exact '' right position for the game to read your movement , this equals major frustration when your holding the resistance bands above your head for 5 minutes because the game cant read what your doing . Then as other reviewers have reported the resistance bands break . I worked through the easy level and it was bad and during the intermediate level it was intolorable as a 20 minute workout was taking an hour to complete due to the inept reading by the Wii system . This problem takes the fun out of playing this game . I took mine to a video store and traded it off . I can not recommend this game for working out . Maybe if they remake it using the motion plus system it might work correctly , who knows , but as it is now , its a total waste of your money .
 This game does not have provisions for left handed people and takes away from the game . EA is not commenting on it . This is a big oversight them .
 I have been a triathlete in the past and am trying to claw my way back to that level of fitness -LRB- prior to kids -RRB- . Based on the premise that Active presented , I was hopeful that I could use this as a timely and motivating daily base workout and add in biking , swimming and running separately . After using it for 4 days I think honestly the positive reviews are are from people mostly like my friend who is very out of shape and needs something engaging that is better than nothing . Basically the positives for me are
 I found that the exercise routines were going to slow for my needs . I found myself waiting for the computerized instructor too much and too often . I dont think that this type of fitness program is for me . I ca n't get motivated to do this type of exercise at home and alone . I 'd rather play racquet ball or tennis or some type of out door sport . Just not for me ...
 The leg strap and and also the cheap flimsy resistance band are awful . You have to assemble the resistance band . The loops on the resistance band are too small to fit my hands in . When using the leg strap in falls down my leg . There is hardly any resistance at all in the resistance band . If EA improved on these two things it would be a decent product . Maybe put a real resistance band in the box ? . I 'll stick with a real gym for now ...
 As a person who has EXTREME issues getting up early -LRB- as in before work in the morning -RRB- to work out , I find this game extremely ineffective and more than a little bit frustrating . If I ca n't get a decent workout in the mornings , I do n't have time any other time to do them and I feel that I will not be successful with EA Sports . It is very frustrating trying to get the controllers in place to where they are detected . There is so much lull time that I ca n't possibly be getting any sort of effective workout . I spend way too much time standing around ! I only have about 30 to 45 minutes in the mornings to work out and I am getting in 20 minutes of non-challenging exercise at best in a 40 minute session . I do enjoy the targets in baseball and tennis however , but think I will do them just for 10 or 15 minutes of fun and movement when I have time . My Fitness Coach may have some flaws , but they are nothing compared to EA Sports Fitness . At least I can get 30 minutes of EXERCISE in with MFC . I think I will go back to that instead . This game is a waste of time and money .
 Wow ... I bought this for my wife and we both set it up and tried to work out with this . First of all , I think that the reviews giving it 5 stars had to be planted from either EA or Bob Greene . There is no way that anyone looking for a workout could consider this anything other than a joke . Ok , if you 're never worked out in your life , you might consider this as a starting point , but even then you 'd be better off just going outside or to the mall and walking a mile or so.Do yourself a favor and save your money . Go buy some dumbbells or some serious resistance bands and create your own workout ... just not with the software/game . I even bought the Step attachment for the Wii Balance Board to add some intensity -LRB- hopefully -RRB- to the workouts . Not that the description implies that you should buy this accessory ... it does n't . But that did n't even help . The fastest dance routine still felt a bit like walking up a flight of steps in slow motion . This was the fastest ... really ? Buy Dance Dance Revolution instead.And honestly ... lifting your left leg or right leg to balance while supposedly Rollerblading is supposed to be ACTIVE ? Come on ... I was disappointed by the original Wii Fit , but had high hopes for this after seeing all the positive reviews and having it made/endorsed by EA Sports . I felt like it was maybe a half star better than the original Fit software and I would give that zero stars if possible.Buyer Beware !!!
 I have yet to really use this product fully as the set up takes a bit of time . In addition , you pick your own type of music and I do n't particularly care for any of the choices . I 'm a more Oldies/Country type and they are not a choice.I think the exercises should allow for people with prior sports injuries . I had knee surgery and ca n't do a lot of the lower body exercises such as lunges , squats , etc. and they should offer alternate exercises they can be done with the lower body .
 I had very high expectations for this game . First of all , the concept is excellent with the variety of routines and even the sports games such as the basketball , volleyball , and baseball . We are in a recession and a good many of us are spending $ 60 on this product on top of monthly gym fees -LRB- yes we are trying to eliminate gym fees with using products like these -RRB- . Highs : Regular workoutsSports WorkoutsDesigning your own work outUse of wii boardWorkout partnerRewards systemLows : That cheap resistance band and leg strap ! The EA separate one -LRB- not the wii one but EA specifically -RRB- functions much better than what they chose to package with this $ 60 game!Not able to use two wii boards if partnering on the workoutsWii board is supposed to be used shoeless but routines combine wii board and transition right into a shoe required exercise.Leg strap lousy fitSometimes the computer does not sense your movements even if you are doing all movements as told.Using the remote in one hand and the nun chuck in the other - you get whacked in the face while working out with the wires -LRB- smell a lawsuit coming on this one.I have to admit I do like the concept and enjoy the routines . But also have to admit I got so frustrated with the bands coming undone -LRB- you have to tie bands in knots on the straps . I tried to wrap them around my hand instead but that was worse as you also have to hold the remote and nun chuck so it is very easy to lose the grip and band goes flying.This band issue is frustrating to the point that I am very tempted to return this product . Come on - this guy 's made millions off the Oprah name , he could n't cut into his profit margin a bit and have a better band design?Unfortunately - I will not recommend this to my friends . The lows far outweigh this initial release of this product . Looks like another Oprah KFC disaster in the making.We should all be receiving an apology from fitness expert Bob Greene via You Tube .
 It 's to bad but on to many of the activities there is n't enough detecion and your person in the game just stands there and does n't do anything and then you ca n't play on it sucks !
 This was the first day I used it.Pros : It has an organized program , easy to followThe graphics are OKCons : The leg strap is falling down on my leg all the time . It takes my attention to the strap instead of focusing on the exercise . By the way . I am wearing pants !!!! The resistance band is a joke . It hurts the skin of my hands . Using weights and holding the remote control and the nunchuk in one hands is not feasible.I did not find the use for the fitboard . No special feedback when using it . A wasted opportunity!A very important component of a fitness program is one 's weight . One can not use the board to evaluate daily changes . This was a silly oversight!There is delay between one movements and the moment they get into the program . It is very distracting ...

 Can I stress again how peeved I am at the EA Sports Active ? I am definitely returning it on Saturday . After suffering through the bugs in the software and getting a little aggravated that there was no cool down or stretching after the work out , I did some research online and dozens , almost a hundred people , are as peeved as I am about how incomplete and faulty this game is . More people than I can count on two hands had the flex band break and the same and additional people had trouble with the strap not staying on the leg . This is not a problem I encountered but my son did have problem with the leg strap.More people than my family has hands encountered the same problem with the software not recognizing movements . It was particularly stressful when I had to do some weird yoga move to have it recognize my left side lunges . The pause in between reps was waaaayyyy to long and I found her positive comments about how well I was doing when I clearly was n't was really annoying ! Major bugs in this software!Another thing that my research found was that there are NO ab specific work and no stretching . Are you kidding me ? You fry our entire body and there are no cool downs and no stretches?I researched other Wii fitness games and know to never buy the Jillian Michaels software as no one seemed to be happy with it . So , thank you Game Stop guy for talking me out of it and shame on the same guy for talking me into putting the EA Sports Active on hold ... well , maybe not shame as it was n't out yet and he could not have known all the bugs were going to occur.I think I will get the Wii Fitness Coach as it has Flexibility as one of the options and seems to be a good compliment to the Wii Fit . Personally I do n't see myself using the Wii Fit for most of it as I do not need to Hula Hoop . But , I have n't explored all of it yet other than to add to my Activity Log for my runs and walks .
 I was a little disappointed in this . I read lots of positive reviews and how it was better than the Wii Fit . I disagree . There is a lot of running which I ca n't do and it 's mostly exercises without being games so it 's not that fun . I used the Wii Fit every day for 5 months and was ready for a change but I 've had this for 3 weeks and only used it once . Wish I had my $ -LSB- ... -RSB- back !
 I purchased the EAS Active after reading several of the reviews . I was VERY dissapointed with this product . I spent most of my workout time trying to get the game to pick up on my movements . Unfortunately , because the game is opened , it is not returnable . Money down the drain . Think twice before buying this - it is a piece of junk !
 Tried it a couple of times , leg thing is a general pain in the ... Stuck it in a drawer , wo n't find it for a couple of years . Fine with me .
 I just bought this , did the `` hard '' workout , and felt like I wasted almost 60 bucks . While I did break a little sweat ... this game was not challenging enough for me . I could see how this game would be good for someone who is just starting out with exercise , but as I already get regular vigorous exercise , it just did n't cut it . I also found the resistance band to be flimsy and a bit of a joke , not providing enough resistance to get real toning . Also , if I am going to run ... I am going to run outside in the sunshine and fresh air , not run in place in my apartment . While I did like the boxing challenges , the rest I could have done without . I liked Wii fit 's yoga and strength training much better as it focuses on balance and correct posture . Save yourself some money and get Jillian Michaels or Tie Bo workout videos . They are cheaper and provide a much better workout .
 Let me start by telling you what was WRONG with this game ... 1 . The program does n't always recognize when I 've made the movement it 's telling me to make . With several of the exercises , I was doing exactly what the figure on the screen was , but it was n't acknowledging that I was doing so . This made it almost impossible to complete some of the activities because it simply did n't recognize that I had done it .2 . It has the opposite problem of the original Wii Fit . With the original Wii Fit , you had to select each and every exercise separately and could n't just choose a list of activities for it to run you through . Here , you have the opposite issue . You ca n't just select an activity and do it , you have to create a workout list and preset the activities you want to try or use their ready-to-go routines .3 . It has ways for you to practice sports moves for different sports , but no actual game for you to play to apply those actions . You ca n't play a round of Basketball or Volleyball , but you can practice passing , throwing , spiking and the rest.As to what 's GOOD about this game , I liked the variety of activities and if you are up for the pre-set workout routines , you 'll definitely get a good workout in . Some of the sports practice was fun , and I liked that it came with the resistance band and leg strap for the nunchuck.At the end of the day , I just do n't recommend it for someone looking for something easy to use for a fun way to get some exercise in .
 I purchased this title -LRB- EA Sports Active -RRB- along with EA Sports Active More Workouts also , both at the same time . I also use a Wii Balance Board.This review addresses both the `` EA Sports Active '' and the `` EA Sports Active More Workouts '' games.I had waited to purchase this -LRB- EA Sports Active -RRB- workout package due to many initially poor reviews due to the leg strap not fitting people or falling down one 's leg while working out which had me concerned . Back when it debuted , this seemed to be a problem . I later saw reviews that replacement straps had been created and so I figured this problem had been fixed . Since I was looking for a workout option on days the winter weather is horrible , I thought I would finally get this to workout at home on days I missed going to the gym . I do have a balance board and did use it with this game.The leg strap is still a problem with this workout game title . The current leg strap is very large and will adjust to both very large and very small leg sizes . It comes with extra velcro to help make it even smaller though I ca n't imagine that ever being needed . It also has a slight non-skid rubber inside to supposedly keep it from slipping . This however does not work . I tried various fabric workout clothes underneath , tightening the strap more and more , etc. all to no avail . After a few minutes , it 's slips down and you have to keep stopping to reposition it only so it can fall down again and again . Possiblly if you have really slim straight legs that are uniform in width , it might stay up like it does on the demonstration model in the video instructions/commercials . From the glowing reviews of this product , I 'm sure many people must not have a problem with the leg strap and I finally gave in to buy it . However , I do not think this will stay up once anyone is very active . I personally have more muscular legs so the leg strap is not uniformly snug when worn causing slippage constantly . Even tightening it does not help , it still slips , and having anything tight on one 's leg is a bad idea . Not sure why I ca n't get it to stay in place better . Since you can not choose to perform the workouts without the leg monitoring of the nunchuck in the leg strap , this makes the game pretty much unusable . Furthmore , having a nunchuck with it 's short wire is not a big hindrance , but , it can be annoying at times only adding to the fustration since the leg strap wo n't stay in place either.The resistance band included is cheap and very low resistance . It 's not as thick as the free ones Shape magazine gives out . I would n't complain about this , but , not everyone at home has stronger resistance bands to substitute and wrapping the extra in the middle to tighten it still did n't help , it 's a very weak resistance band . And since this game is a higher priced item , a buyer should not have to substitute their own work out bands in order to use the game . Workout bands are cheap to produce . It should have come with a either a better resistance band or maybe even a couple different tensions for different strength levels . The band and it 's tie on handles are really poorly made and just not that good to use.On to the EA Sports Active game . The initial fitness workout I received in the 30 day challenge required quite a few exercises and is actually rather long for a novice . It starts with running in place -LRB- no marching , stretching or basic warm up -RRB- , which depending on the items in your home might not be the best idea . Next it goes to squats for instance . Not being sufficiently warmed up from trying to run and stopping constantly to fuss with the nunchuck means the squats required might have been placed too soon in the workout for any novice since squats performed incorrectly can be dangerous or likewise for those with those with any kind of knee weakness/problems , etc. . The game required that you squat , hold it in the downward position , and then stand . The game did not respond in sync with my movement and constantly thought that I was not squatting low enough despite the fact that I was . As a personal trainer household , I did have someone watching my form to ensure I was squatting properly and it 's an exercise I routinely perform anyway so I am very familiar with proper form . I think this was due to the constant slippage of the nunchuck leg holder or it not staying high enough on my leg . I attempted to hold the leg strap in place , but , the game still did not respond correctly or fast enough to mirror my movement accurately . You were instructed to squat , hold it , then stand , and at times it showed me still squatting even after I stood up , or vice versa . Squatting improperly can cause injury and so I worry that people not aware of correct form might overextend , etc. as the game incorrectly urges them to keep squatting deeper despite already being low and in position . The game also does not give enough hints on proper form either . While it shows a graphic of a person squatting that you watch face to face head on for timing , it does not show a profile or give an tips such as never allowing your knee to extend forward over your toes , etc. as it keeps nagging you to squat lower and lower . It then went on to an upper body exercise that was totally unchallenging with the weak resistance band despite shortening it as instructed . Next was an inline skating exercise that would require you to crouch down -LRB- on the balance board -RRB- to gain speed , lean forward , and then perform and hold a lateral leg lift to avoid several obstacles . This is a very challenging move since you are not lifting and lowering your leg but holding it up for several seconds to avoid several obstacles . For a novice or anyone without great balance , this could be really tricky especially on day 1 of the workout challenge on the EASY setting . It was a challenge even for me . Then it went back to medium running in place -LRB- goodness more running in place -RRB- and then squats again ?? As a muscle building exercise , squats should not have come again in this work out and definitely not in a harder setting . Something to focus on other leg muscles for symmetry would have been better . I had the game set on easy since I was new to this program and am surprised they repeated this exercise so soon . I really am concerned that someone could over work or ever strain certain muscle groups , etc. following this game 's exercises in the order given , etc. I gave up in fustration over the leg strap since you ca n't really use the game without it in proper place and checked out the create your own work out to see if there were non-nunchuck exercises I could use to still salvage any usability out of the game I had paid so much money for . There are not any ways to use it without the nunchuck . Also , only a small fraction of exercises use the balance board , only 1 per category . Since a full list of game exercises was not listed in the product description , I was not aware so few use the balance board which was disappointing as that 's a great tool.I went to the create your own workout to see the `` sports '' related exercies you can pick and you ca n't see them or get a demo without selecting several of them into a created workout and just doing them or skipping them -LRB- which is odd if you do n't know what they are and really kills the flow of a workout -RRB- . I feel the game should have had a menu to view and pick exercises/activities you want to do like Wii Fit or Wii Fit Plus in addition to the ability to create a workout from a string of several exercises once you had experimented with them separately . The extra sport related games on this game are things like boxing , tennis , volleyball , basketball and inline skating and nothing else . There is no Yoga group , so if you were hoping that would be in this title , it is n't . There are only several categories , so do not expect dozens of sports to choose from . The `` EA Sports
 The first EA Sports workout program for Wii that I got was the EA Sports Active - More Workouts AND I LOVE IT ! Thinking the first workout EA put together would be just as good , I ordered EA Sports Active . I was so disappointed . This workout is not safe as there is NO warm up or cool down stretch . The workouts , especially without the warm up are dangerous and not very much fun . Do n't get this EA Sports DVD , but DO get the `` More Workouts '' version . In the `` More Workouts '' version , all of the bad points of their first DVD are addressed . I give the `` More Workouts '' version 5 stars !
 I received a lot of positive feedback from friends but it would not register my leg exercises unless I bent my knees , beyond 90 degrees . It could just be me , but Wii active did not work for my knees .
 Let 's start with some full disclosure here . I 'm fat . I am trying desperately to undo that situation , and with all the recommendations from colleagues , folks in my WW group , and my primary care physician , I went ahead and ordered this , along with the `` More Workouts '' . The software is fine , although the trainers are a bit annoying , but what trainer is n't ? The issue I have is with the hardware ... At 6 ' 0 '' , and 300lbs , my thigh is just a wee bit big for the dumb leg strap thing-a-ma-jig for the nunchuck . Now I know for a good number of already fit folks you are going to say big whoop dee right ? Remember , it 's the fatties that are the majority these days ! -LRB- Thank Bill Gates and the Internet age for that ! -RRB- . it just struck me as silly that this thing is sized for already fit people when I would suspect that the average customer is like me ... At the very least they ought to include something to more easily extend the strap ... The resistance bands leave a LOT to be desired . They resemble baloons , and you have to tie them off to the handles yourself . And the knots very easily slip while you are working out ... All in all , I am wishing I had figured out a different rig for the nunchuck , and just used some power bands from the sporting goods store with the software ... These hardware pieces seem like a real waste of money .
 The product is fair . Not all motions are reflected and you end taking a long time to get the information to record . For example , in the lunges an individual could be doing the exercise , but the software/hardware will not recgonize the motion . Things depend on how the nunchuk is in the pocket and/or how the motion is executed.Also , most of the exercises do not use the wii balance board -- at least the ones I have seen . I would not recommend the product . The activities that come with the wii fit balance board are much better .2 Stars at best
 I have played EA Sports Active for a couple of weeks now and parts of the game are done well.Pros : - Sports tab workouts are fun and challenging.-The games workouts can be modified to suit your needs . You can go through the workouts and click on the green checkmark , so they are deleted from the workout.-The female workout trainer has a pleasant voice , and there are many motivating statements imbedded in the exercises.-The Fit Balance Board can be used for special exercises.-Three workout intensities
 I would not recommend this game due to the fact that it often underperforms . It does not read your movements as well as WII does which causes you to have to repeat the excercise numerous times . It gets very furstrating at times . I loved the idea but it was below my expectations for reading movements . Also , the graphics are not the best . My sister , my daughter and I were all equally disappointed !
 This is a great idea and it does work up a great sweat but I 'm extremely frustrated with it . I KNOW how to do squats , lunges and jumps with great form but this game frequently does n't recognize that I 'm even moving . I 've readjusted the leg strap and nunchuck 100 different ways and it does n't make a difference . Looks like a lot of people have had this problem . I can not believe the software engineers did n't do something about this or create a work around of some kind -LRB- like allowing you to push `` A '' when your at the bottom of your lunge and then B at the top or something to override the sensors since they do n't work.I 've even tried just giving it a little shake or moving the nunchuck up and down myself but it does n't matter . This game would be a lot of fun if I did n't have to `` skip '' pieces of the workout because it does n't see that I 've done them . Honestly I wish I had not spent the money on it .
 The WII Active gives you a nice alternative to walking , running and jumping , but the resistance bands are a problem . The bands that come with the package are n't adequate for a taller or more fit person . The suggestion is to buy bands that fit your height and resistance need . The problem is that the WII controllers do n't pick up the signal as well , so the trainer gets `` stuck , '' and you are unable to go forward without bumping out of the exercise . After bumping out of all of the resistance band training exercises , there is no reason to have WII Active unless you need a running companion or the same sports you get on other WII games.Don ' t buy this product until the resistance band problem is resolved -LRB- or at least noticed by EA Sports -RRB-
 I 'm glad they 're making video gaming more active for people . Unfortunately , this game needs work . I should have rented it before spending the money on it . I 've tried to do the workouts and the running part was okay , but when it came to the other workouts where the reps are counted , no matter what I did it did n't register . I fought with it and tried adjusting my position for 10-15 minutes and it would n't do anything . I gave up . My husband has a little better luck with it , but is also very frustrated with it not counting . Overall , I am very disappointed with this product and will stick with the Wii fit .
 It is very hard to get in a good workout when after a few lunges the system suddenly ca n't read what you 're doing and stops to try to tell you to `` put the nunchuck in the pocket , hold the remote facing up ... '' when they have n't moved . It 's just not good when the program prevents you from doing straight reps and adds stress instead of reducing it . This was a complete waste of money for me .
 The difficulty in getting my movement to register with the game makes the whole game pretty useless for me . To keep the leg strap from sliding , I have to tighten it very tight , which seems unwise -LRB- restrict the flow of blood to muscles you 're working ? Bad . -RRB- In many of the arm-movement exercises , my arm movements are n't registering well with the game at all . I spend at least a third of my exercise time not actually exercising , but adjusting and attempting to get the game to know what I 'm doing.Since I do n't have trouble with any other Wii games ' knowing what the Wiimote or nunchuk are doing , this seems to be a Wii Active specific problem.And I 'm not really getting much use from the game . Only frustration.Your mileage may vary .
 I was so excited to get this game , however , I 'm in agreement with many who have purchased the game and have given it low ratings . Though the workout regimes are structured well , the system would freeze alot and fail to pick up the remote signal . My avatar would be stuck on in a forward lung position or squat , the trainer would be prompting me to return to position , when I already did . I 've changed batteries to no avail . The system would freeze and state `` hold/stand still '' and it would continue stating that for more than 5 minutes . Do n't get me wrong , the concept is excellent , the layout is okay , but the delivery needs major improvements . Another drawback is having to hold the remote and numchuck in both hands with the exercise band . This is very cumbersome . They need to look into another interface for the system other than these bulky items . Maybe a wristband that sends signals to the wii system.My final disappointment came when I reported the problems to EA Sports . Since the product is still under the 90 day warranty they agreed to replace it provided `` I attach an image of the defect '' -- great -- how in the world am I supposed to do that ? Shipping cost to return the defective item is also not refundable . What great service ? ... I 'm frustrated with the program and service response , and equally disappointed . I 'm going back to wii fit ... Sorry I left it .
 I am returning this effective immediately . The sensors absolutely suck and I am not dealing with the frustration of a malfunctioning game while trying to get my overweight self in motion . The idea is great , the execution is TERRIBLE . I would make the motion they wanted over and over and over again , never getting it to register . I tried synching the board and the game about four times . Going back to cobbling together Wii Fit games for a half-hour workout ! Why ca n't SOMEONE invent a step aerobics workout for the Wii ?
 The sensors on this are terrible . It hardly ever registered what I was doing . The bands do n't stay in place well either . The concept is great , but the technology just was n't of good quality .
 The concept is fantastic but the wiimote/sensor interaction is too finicky . It made the workout too frustrating . Specifically : - Some of the exercises work great on one side but not the other . Moving the sensor does n't fix it . - If the way you hold the wiimote/nunchuck is off even slightly , the exercise stops and waits for you . You have to guess what it 's waiting for . - There reps are not timed to the music and there 's no consistency to the timing . Instead of getting into the flow of the reps , it waits for you before it does the next rep. There 's too much `` thinking '' time between reps making it hard to get a good flow to your workout . - When doing reps , it 's normal to anticipate the next rep , but this game does not allow for that . You finish a rep , the program goes back to the top of its do loop and then it does the next rep. It 's very choppy - there 's no smooth rhythm to the reps. - If you move even a little faster than the `` follow me '' droid it stops completely -LRB- like its giving up -RRB- , puts a note on the screen and waits for you to go back to the top of the rep. - The instruction videos take FOREVER to demonstrate a simple exercise . Between that and the delay between reps , there 's lots of down time.Overall , I found it very frustrating because every time my workout started to flow , something interrupted it . I 've had the Wii for over a year , and play with it daily so I do n't think it 's a learning curve issue .
 I was super excited to get this game , but day by day I became less excited to work out and began to dread dealing with hassles of it . It 's great in concept , and might actually be a very effective workout , but there are some issues that I feel get in the way of making it work .1 -RRB- In exercises involving the nunchuck the wire is constantly getting in the way , restricting , and often slapping me in the face . This really frustrates me and it slows down the workout .2 -RRB- The resistance band provides little resistance . It 's a pain to switch back and forth between workouts the do and do n't involve it . Getting it in to place quickly is a nightmare . This weak resistance band with its hand straps , plus the Wii remote and nunchuck , AND the nunchuck wire is a huge hindrance on my form .3 -RRB- The running does seem to be more accurate than the Wii Fit running , but other strength training is a different story . It takes me ten minutes to do 8 reps because I have to point the remote in the exact direction for it to register , and even if I do the movement often does n't appear on screen because it was too quick or I was concentrating too hard on pointing the remote and it was too slow .4 -RRB- I lose a lot of momentum -LRB- if I can get any going in the first place -RRB- with this because the game is constantly switching between exercises where my nunchuck needs to be in my leg strap , to ones where I need to be using the resistance band , to using the balance board .5 -RRB- I 'm told this game has many exercises , but I 've been doing curls and lunges for a week .6 -RRB- I 'm completely frustrated with this game , I want it to work because I spent a lot of money on it , but when I 'm done each day I do n't feel like I 've gotten a good work out , I just feel stress and frustration from having to deal with all the technical quirks .
 Wii Active is a huge disappointment . If you do n't hold the remote and numchuk in the correct position , the games does n't `` see '' what you 're doing and it either makes you repeat it until you get it right -LRB- meaning the position of the remote and/or numchuk -RRB- or it wo n't let you go on . It also locks up and wo n't register what you 've done at all , no matter what kind of gyrations you try to do to go on . I have n't gotten beyond the first set of workouts because it was so frustrating . The game wastes a lot of time having you take the band off and on , instead doing all the exercises using the band at once . I would n't recommend this for anyone .
 Ok , Im really shocked at how much others love this game . I was bored within the first 3-4 workouts . Im not by any means a workout pro but I felt this program was too slow for me . I just got it 3 days ago and will continue to give it a chance , but as for now Im thinking about returning it and just continue to hit the gym !
 I purchased the Wii Fit to get more exercise during the winter months . I really like it , but after so long I wanted something different . The EA Sports Active sounded like what I was looking for.It is the most frustrating game . My 30 minute challanges always turn into an hour or more just because of the way you have to hold the two controllers . You try over and over to get it right and it still will not register . If you do not have them held EXACTLY right , your Mii just stands there and the voice constantly tells you to try it again . You go back again and look at the video , checking for the correct placement of the controllers . You try again & again and continue to have the same problem . It is so frustrating ! I wish I would have read about this complaint before I spent the money .
 The software as good as it is , can only go so far . You would think EA would take more time to test the leg strap , and realize how frustrating for everyone heavy or thin , for this thing to stay on . I 've tried all the suggestions , but the strap still falls off . I think I 'm getting more of a work out , picking up the strap , and trying endless ways to keep the strap on , then actually working out . Seriously ! Finally , I stopped using the strap and figuring out ways to work with only the wii motes and nun chuck ... actually way more liberating ! I wanted to love this game , but come on EA think of the consumer ! There are quite a few `` honest '' reviews here who do n't overlook this . If you are willing to spend most of your workout picking up your leg strap , then I guess this wo n't disappoint . As for me , I expected more ... especially if the leg strap is a vital part of each work out !
 I wish I had been bright enough to wait for the reviews before I bought this , but I was very eager to begin a new fitness routine . I had high hopes for this one ! However , like many other reviewers , I 've found it nearly impossible to use . Maybe I 'm just a complete moron , but no matter what adjustments I make it rarely registers my movements . I 've also had trouble with the leg strap staying up , and I find it very awkward to have to worry about two different controllers while I 'm trying to work out . I think the concept of the game could be good if it worked properly for all users , but it needs a lot of improvements .
 I purchased this on launch day as I could not wait to try it out . I have n't used it since . The leg strap wo n't stay up and the game does n't recognize most of my movements . Save yourself the frustration and by My Fitness Coach , Wii Fit or Gold 's Gym Cardioboxing.The only reason -LSB- ... -RSB- because it did get me moving , even if it was frustrating .
 I bought this for my wife as initial previews sounded fun.I should have waited for the reviews.it would have been fun if it was n't for the poorly designed strap that slips off her thigh in seconds.she also hated it when she did what the game instructed yet it kept telling her she was doing it wrong!So we 're exchanging the game at gamestop today !
 I really enjoyed this product at first , got through the fourth workout in the 30 day challenge and it just started acting up . It would tell me to position the nunchuk and Wii remote , so I would and it would never restart ! I workout in the mornings before work , I just do n't have time for that kind of thing . I ended up making my own workouts and that seems to be working for now but I am looking for something that continues to work for me . I will still try to give it a chance but if you are on a time crunch , pray that you get the whole workout exactly right and do n't have to reboot the software .
 I was looking to up the intensity from My Fitness Coach , and this does n't do it for me . The resistance band is lame
 It seems that no matter what exercise regime I chose , what day it was on my 30-day plan all I did was lunge after lunge after lunge . The game should really be called EA Sports Lunge . After using the program for two weeks I woke up one morning and my knees now make a very loud `` click '' when I walk up stairs and are very stiff . Now , far be it from me to argue the quality of lunges but for pete 's sake , why so many ? I 'm most unhappy with this product since if I took the lunges OUT of the regimes I 'd be doing 3 exercises and be done in 5 minutes.All of the positive reviews really hyped me up for this but no one really mentioned the lunges . Besides , squatting would be slightly more productive anyway .
 I 'm surprised by all the positive reviews . For some context
 ... and that is exactly what happened . I would jump ... the game would n't register it and just sat there waiting for me to jump . Not very fun at all . Or productive .
 I was excited to get this game and start my workout . The choice and variety of workouts are pretty good . The problem I have with this game is the strap you wear on your leg . I can not get it to stay up on my thigh . I have tried on top of workout pants , and even on my skin , with no luck fixing the problem . For this reason , I will be sending mine back . It is too annoying to stop your workout to constantly pull up and adjust the velcro strap .
 I wish I could return this game . But Target would not take it back since its opened . It doesnt read your movements . -LRB- especially the arm curls -RRB- I did not break a sweat . The resistance band is extremely weak and the biggest complaint is the wait time between exercises . You never get your heart rate going.If you `` work out '' for 3 minutes and then stand there for 2 minutes waiting for the next exercise and the explanation you are never going to get anything from it.I really wish i could return this game . Such a waste . At least the Wii fit has cutesy games you can play . This is just a sham .
 This is a very personal trainer type of game -- you are told to do this and do that , for a dozen exercise ... i know , if I can do them , I will be fit , but since it is not so fun , if I have the discipline to stick to this training , I can also go biking and do weights every other day , and that gave me fantastic results too.Maybe because I am a guy , I do n't like to be told to do this and do that repeatedly . I would rather play the games on Wii Fit Plus , because it is fun , I need no other incentive to play it . And any exercise for 30 minutes a day can make me fit . Maybe the `` specialized '' training can have better results , but if it is not fun , then I wo n't do it , and there wo n't even be any result .
 I was so looking forward to this game ! Pre-ordered it and everything . Should have waited for the reviews to come out . It was like bieng in an exercise class with a blind trainer . A blind trainer who is obsessed with lunges . After three days I was so sick of lunges I dreaded turning the Wii on . And that freaking resistance band sucks ! It 's flimsy , gets stuck in my tennis shoes , and every time you want to do an exercise with it , you have to fiddle with getting it even so you have the same amount of resistance on each side . There 's no flow . Before each exercise , you have to press the A button over and over to get through the video , explanation , etc. . Yes , EA , I know how to do a lunge . You 've made me do hundreds of them this week . Oh , so this is different , because it 's a side lunge ? Give me a break ! The skating was so stupid . It 's just squatting and jumping . And since most modern day Americans have a concrete slab under their carpet , shoes or no shoes , this game is not good for your knees . The balance board is underutilized . The running is stupid . The rhythm to the exercises is choppy , and when you have to wait because it did n't pick up your movement , there 's even more of a delay and frustration . A good workout should leave you exhausted but satisfied and pumped up . This one leave you frustrated and angry and maybe mildly sweaty because you had to repeat half of your movements for it to recognize them . Of course the whole time the trainer is saying the same thing over and over . I could n't take an entire month of this !! This one will be very useful to me ... as a dust collector on my game shelf .
 The pace was very slow , even for someone out of shape like myself . So , it takes far more time to get half the work out.The exercise band was too easy , even for someone out of shape like myself . I needed to stand within five inches of each handle to feel a slight effort . I suppose I could use hand weights instead , but then it would be difficult to hold the wiimotes . I could buy more difficult bands , but it seems a a stronger one should have been included . A toddler would find this exercise band too easy.A lot of accuracy depends on the position of the leg band that holds the control , but I found out it slips off my pants easily . So , I was often pulling it up and trying to make it tighter , which affects my score.I found it confusing to determine what to follow
 This fitness product is so close to being excellent if only ... . Good variety of workout excercises , much harder routines than WII Fit , and good animated venues , however the product does not recognize the signals from the WII handheld devices in some of its excercises . I ca n't get it to work with squats at all . In others it takes a long time to receive/evaluate the signal even though it shows your avitar having completed the move and then it `` yells '' at you for taking to long . It is so close to being an excellent workout product . If you can live without some of the routines then go for it .
 I bought this after much research , because so many people liked the variety of workouts , etc. . I 'm going to pass it along to someone who will enjoy it more than I will.POSITIVE-Good how-to videos-Good tracking-Pleasant coaches-Lots of different workouts-pre-set 30-day workoutNEGATIVES-It 's dull . Really , really , really dull . That 's why I do n't exercise in the first place . -LRB- example
 I really enjoyed this when I first got it I 've owned it a little over 90 days . It keeps freezing up on me , telling me to follow the instructor which I 'm doing . I thought batteries , so I changed them , I thought , where I was standing so I moved , I thought , the WII bar so I 've adjusted it . Nothing worked , yet all my other programs work fine . I 've attempted to email EA , call EA , and have had no response . I feel this is poor customer service and a bad CD .
 So normally I do n't comment about stuff like this , but this is somewhat ridiculous . Anytime you run -LRB- which is every day in the challenge mode -RRB- , half the time you 're fighting the thing registering how fast it thinks your moving . It only has 3 speeds
 Buyer beware !! No left hand option ! Makes playing baseball etc difficult.Not a problem for regular exercises such as lunges , bicept curls , etc. though .
 I purchased EA Sports Active to add to my workout options . Those options being
 I 'm completely mystified by all the glowing reviews this game has gotten , and I felt compelled to share my own experiences with Wii Active.I bought this game because I had been using Wii Fit for about a year , and I was looking for a way to expand my workouts to make them a little more varied and challenging.The one positive thing I can say is that the exercises themselves are quite good , and the routines the game puts together for you should make you sweat much more than Wii Fit -LRB- and ache more the next day -RRB- . Unfortunately , that 's about the only good thing I can report . As a person who is used to the amazing accuracy with which the Wii Fit senses your movements , I find the Active interface so clunky and unresponsive , it 's impossible to get through an entire routine without 2 or 3 major glitches.With Active , you have an Avatar on the screen who 's supposed to mirror what you 're doing , but the Avatar 's movements lag at least 2 seconds -LRB- sometimes more -RRB- behind your own , which can be really distracting when you 're supposed to do an exercise at a certain pace . But the bigger problem is that quite often , the game simply can not sense what you 're doing . The routine will not continue until you complete the exercise `` properly , '' but because the game can not sense your movements , it will just get hung up while you frantically try to figure out what you 're doing wrong.For example , you 'll be doing a set of lunges , and on the 5th or 6th one your Avatar will just stand there motionless . You keep repeating the lunge , but try as you might you ca n't get the game to `` see '' it , and you ca n't figure out what you 're doing that 's different from the first several reps you completed with no problems . Or you 'll be jogging at a steady pace , but your Avatar is all over the place running and walking at varying speeds , and the game keeps telling you you 're not going at the right pace . Or you 'll be holding a squat , and suddenly your Avatar will stand up for no reason , and the game will make you do the exercise over because it says you did n't hold the squat long enough.I 'm fairly experienced with motion sensitive games and exercise programs for the Wii , it 's not that I do n't know what I 'm doing . I 've never had a problem like this with any other game , so I 'm certain the fault lies with the way the game itself was designed . It 's very frustrating , and it ends up taking twice as long as it should to complete a workout.It 's tempting to credit this game with at least giving you a good workout , but without properly functioning motion sensors and interactivity , you 'd be much better off just doing a fitness video . It would be less frustrating , and you 'd get a better workout without all the starts and stops and hangups .
 This is a better workout than Wii Fit . It needs some improvements though . The leg strap falls off easily and when it 's tight enough to stay up , feels like a tourniqet . The cord between the controls keeps getting tangled and is a bit of a hazard . The sensors are almost too sensitive and the workout stops when it feels you are n't doing the move properly , even if you are . I find the pace a bit aggrevating too . It 's too slow , not in time with the music and just does n't flow . I wish I had n't spent the money on this one .
 I just did my last workout in EA Sports Active . It 's an excellent concept , and the explanation videos are as good if not better quality than aerobic DVD 's . However , the game is so finicky about Wiimote/Nunchuk placement that it destroys the entire workout . I 'll do a rep , and the game wo n't detect my movements so it pauses for a few seconds . Even when my Wiimote placement is perfect , there is still a lag between reps while it detects where the Wiimote is . That completely throws off my tempo , and puts too much time in-between reps to burn any real calories . It 's so out of rhythm it makes me feel like a broken robot.My Fitness Coachis still the best workout you can get on Wii . If EA Sports Active would include a button to ignore the Wiimote placement , or be less strict on movement detection , it could have had that title.I 'm still waiting for the perfect workout game on Wii - the kind that will make me throw away all my exercise DVD 's . I know it will be released someday , but I want it now .
 Not fair ! You ca n't play tennis if you 're left-handed . I looked on the EA games website and they said that you ca n't do it ! You have to play backwards ! InWii Sportsyou can choose if you want to play lefty or righty for everything . That 's good , especially if you play baseball righty and tennis lefty . This was a BIG disappointment !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 I really wish people would rate products after having used them more than once or twice , otherwise EA Sports Active would n't have as many positive reviews ... on that note ... The workouts in EA Sports Active are for lack of a better word , boring . EA tries to make the program more interesting by throwing in activities like basketball , tennis , baseball etc , however most ca n't be considered workouts and they really are n't that fun . Detection for them is very crude and there is pretty much no skill involved , this is no Wii Sports.At first glance it appears that there are a-lot of various workouts BUT after about 5 or 6 workouts you discover that it really only has a lot of different ways of working the same muscle groups . The program concentrates on quadriceps , biceps with some shoulder and triceps exercises and the occasional kickback which kind of exercises your glutes . Forget about anything that will isolate abs or back . As for the program being continuous it is not , there is a loading time between the exercises and you need to press the A button to continue which interrupts the flow a bit , this is minor but enough that I would n't call this a continuous workout . All in all I would have to say that the range of exercises is disappointing.The thing that is supposed to make EA Sports Active worth more money as apposed to a ten dollar workout DVD is one of the things that ends up making it more frustrating . The detection of a few of the exercises is downright HORRIBLE , especially the bicep curl and upright rows . The program will sometimes get stuck and display a message stating that you need to hold the Wii nunchuck still , the message will not go away even if it 's perfectly still -LRB- including if you set both the Wiimote and nunchuck on something -RRB- this forces you to play -LRB- read redo the exercise over and over -RRB- with the controllers until the program recovers -LRB- which is almost always more than a minute and once for us was greater than 5 minutes . -RRB- The designers for some reason decided not to include a timeout or continue in case this screw-up happens which is very dumb in my opinion . Also , because it attempts to `` detect '' everything , for which is does rather poorly , your exercise timing is always off and since it detects your right side better than your left you end up with an uneven workout . As an example if you are doing lunges -LRB- which you do a lot of -RRB- you will hold your left side lunge much longer than your right.The balance board support is tacked on and really serves no purpose . I really do n't understand what others mean by it adding `` intensity '' to the exercises because that claim is false . What do you get with the addition of the balance board ? Stand on one leg or the other . Step off the board and on again , that 's it . There is nothing you ca n't do without it , therefore I would say that it appears that this `` feature '' was more of a marketing ploy and really adds no value to the program . You will get the same -LRB- or better -RRB- experience without the balance board . We disabled the use of the balance board after about 4 workouts because it was more of a pain then it 's usefulness to this program . I 'm still waiting for an application from Nintendo or a 3rd party that will justify the money spent on my balance board , so far no luck.The equipment included is pretty weak , as described by most people . The nunchuck band slips down . In fact you will probably get better use out of a pair of shorts with a side pocket to hold the nunchuck , the resistance band has very little resistance so having weights is probably a better way to go . Also , unlike most of the workout DVD 's I 've tried you can start EA Sports Active on HARD . I 'm way out of shape and the HARD on this is less of a workout than the easy workout on many of our DVD collections . Do you sweat , yes . Is it that difficult NO . As an example there are many workout DVD 's which I can not complete the beginners stages , however with EA Sports Active I 've had no problems completing the HARD setting . The two hardest workouts are
 it did not work . Defective . I installed it and it did not work . It did not work . It did not work .
 I ordered a SC-502 which sells for $ 25 . I received a SC-502T which sells for $ 16.99 and is poorly designed . The alarm is barely audible.The old bait and switch .
 I purchased this count down timer to use as a hand held shot clock/timer for basketball but you can not stop and reset the timer . Yes , you can restart the count down but you 'll have to wait until the time expires for it to reset . The manual is pretty sparse so if there is away to do this , it is not in the manual or on the Robic web site .
 I own two of these units , I use one for my home PC to mix outputs to my speakers and two different sets of headphones -LRB- one is a headset -RRB- , and the other for my audio studio . Both units have serious problems with hum and crackle . They are very poor amplifiers distorting the output in a way that makes listening to music quite unpleasant at times .
 it did not work . Defective . I installed it and it did not work . It did not work . It did not work .
 This item broke the first time my husband put it together . One of the screws did not fit in the hole on the bar , and the screw broke from its handle while trying to get it in -LRB- making one of the bars unuseable -RRB- . You get what you pay for with this product .
 First of all , you have to pay for the shipping . I did , so when I got them I immediately realized they are way to small even for my tiny 7 years old girl !!!! Quality is chip , so I would n't recommend it to anybody . I decided to return it and I have to pay for the shipping back !!!!!! yak ...
 I have ordered countless things online and have never been compelled to write a review before . I was completely ecstatic to `` Bears '' down my sons room . Let 's keep in mind that he is 19 months old , so he takes up very little space in his twin size bed nor does he actually ever use this comforter for his blanket . We have had the set for a whopping 6 weeks and already the Bear silkscreen is cracked and peeling off . Since we do n't use it for his blanket we have n't even put it through the washer , I ca n't imagine it being able to endure that since it has n't endured six weeks of being basically a decorative throw . Disappointed does n't even begin to describe how I feel .
 I 've had 3 of these already and the fact is , people say they do n't break , but they break all the time . For whatever reason the handle portion wears down and eventually shreds and eventually breaks off . Sure , my boat is at a marina with a lot of wake , but if these are the best on the market , how can all of them break eventually ? The ` warranty ' is nice , but I live far from my boat and I take public transit to get to it , so its not so convenient to try and get them replaced . Someone needs to invent a better product .
 This mat is good for the occasional exerciser ... Not to suitable for yoga although I do put my yoga mat on top if i am ever on a very hard floor . The cover being washable is good but a pain to get back in right as the cover can shrink ... yeah ... so you have to work it back in and it takes some time to get the shape back . The padding itself being the foam stuff will over time become thinner as you use it and wear it down . It rolls up nice , not too big . Also when or if you sweat a lot it can get slippery , if you use your hands for support . You will need a towel to keep yourself dry and not let the mat absorb too much of your sweat . It would make a nice camping mat or mat for child in daycare , or for sitting in the park , wherever you may sit or lay down and need an extra cushion ...
 No one has mentioned that one must treat the water for four hours to get the sterility touted . That 's a long time to wait for a drink !
 I ordered the BROWN metallic watch for my daughter at Christmas and they sent a Nike Presto Cee SILVER metallic watch . Maybe they thought I would not notice . Order one thing and get something different , what a bummer . I will never order from TimeZone123 again !
 yankees rule dont by this anyway it has bad cottton so by a yankee jerseyps this is just a fan but if it were a yankee jersey i would give it 4 stars
 I ordered this product to help my son with baseball . When it was shipped to me the ends of half the poles were all bent . I find it hard to beleive that the people shipping it did not notice all the dents . I warn anyone who is concerding buying this to try to get it at a store near your house , Atleast that way you can have your replacment parts before the end of the baseball season ...
 I purchased and used a Swiss Gear hikers tent several years ago and used it several times . I was so pleased with it that I turned again to Swiss Gear and purchased model 36289 when I needed a larger tent . I just used the new tent this weekend for the first time on a two day campout and it was a big disapointment . The plastic feet that the tent poles insert into are attached to the tent by a thin ribbon material . Before the tent was was even completely up , 1 foot sheared off the ribbon and I had to improvise to make it work . By the end of the campout another foot was almost sheared off and a third had started . The feet them selves are fine , it is the thin ribbon that connects the feet to the tent that is the problem . Since I purchased the tent on an end of the year clearance last year , I wo n't be able to return it . Therefore I plan to contact the company directly sometime this week .
 I bought the one with the white stripe -LRB- s -RRB- . First disappointment
 I bought two of these I swam 5 times a week the first week it was great then it started stretching a lot after a month it was see through so do n't waist your money on this buy the endurance ones .
 First of all , if you are looking for the best charger and batteries available , I suggest getting the La Crosse BC-900 charger and the GE/Sanyo Eneloop batteries . The La Crosse charger has multiple modes from refresh to charge , you can adjust the MA charge amount and it accepts AA , AAA and Cs and Ds with the included adapter . It also has proper LCD readouts for EACH battery indicating their condition , charge rate , etc. . The Eneloops are amazing because on a full charge they will stay stored for a year and still retain 85 % of their charge.Now , on to the Rayovac . I had the 4-battery charger edition -LRB- now apparently no longer on sale at Amazon , hence my review here -RRB- , and both essentially melted . They generated extraordinary heat during their 15 minute charge cycle ; one actually started giving off acrid smoke and set off my fire alarm , the other just warped into oblivion from the heat and gave up . Pure and simple , these should all have been recalled - they clearly posed a hazard . The second problem is with the `` 15 minute '' charge batteries . It sounds super cool - that 's why I bought the charger -LRB- s -RRB- and about 20 batteries . I use twin Nikon flashes that take 4 AAs each , and I have lots of remote controls and stuff ... charging a battery in 15 minutes sounded like the answer to a lot of problems . However , of the MANY rechargeable battery systems I have tried -LRB- including Radio Shack 's own brand -RRB- , the Rayovac 's were BY FAR the worst at holding a workable charge , and in heat generation after charging -LRB- they were literally too hot to pick up with bare hands -RRB- . Someone else has posted here that the 15 minute Rayovac batteries are about to be removed from production . I do n't know if it has anything to do with the problems I experienced , but it this product was a hit , and reliable , then it would seem very odd indeed that they would kill a success.Do yourself a favor and spend the extra few bucks on the system I mention at the beginning of my review . You will not regret it !
 The AAA batteries lasted only about 1/4 of the time that a Duracell Ultra II battery would . So if you have devices that hog the power you will notice it drain in about a 1/4 of the time . I would only recommend to get this if you want to be environmentally friendly . I will say that I was AMAZED that it charged the batteries in 15 minutes . Basically I charge them during breakfast they are done by the time I have to leave , but I have to charge them every other day :-LRB- where if I had the Duracell Ultra II batteries would last me a little more than a week .
 The power will be discahrged completely in 4 days even you do not use it .
 For the Redskins collar , they put up the COWBOYS ?! Are you kidding?I ordered this one , and they actually sent a Cowboys collar . Poor Fido , I put it on him , and it made him slow , unable to hit a moving receiver , and he started bad mouthing me in the press . With the Cowboys collar , he just could n't quite win in his championship agility competition for a couple years , he just kept coming in second place . -LRB- Also , he started dating this skanky blond cocker spaniel in the neighborhood , and she seems to be bad luck . -RRB- EDITED
 This company makes it hard to return items and charges you a 20 % restocking fee . Will not use this company again for future purchases
 These goggles reminded me of the old spectrum TYR goggles , a great silicone gasket set that never leaked and lasted for litterally years -LRB- I wore mine for 2 years without issue -RRB- . I was so impressed with them that I thought I 'd try these out.I was severely dissappointed . These goggles leak like mad , and tightening them only makes things worse , since the nosepiece is not adjustable . Shame on Speedo and TYR for making so many models without adjustable nosepieces !! It 's impossible to control leakage if there is excessive , turbulent motion to the face , so expect to get an eyeful of chlorinated water after that flipturn.Stray far , far away from these . If you want a soft silicone gasket that will last and practically never leak , stick with TYR 's tried and true Racetech style , or even better , try to track down a pair of the discontinued spectrum goggles -LRB- good luck -RRB- .
 I may return them but will likely just throw them in the trash .
 Do not buy this bike . I got to ride mine for about 35 minutes before it was broke . The crank is cheap aluminum and the peddals are steal , well the steal threads chew right through the aluminum in no time flat .
 Terrible assemble . I coudl n't even assembel front wheel.The axle is way short , and no axle nut . So there 's no way to place wheel in fork drop outs .
 I bought one for my team but it was slow - lost a minute or two every couple of days . I returned it and got another - same deal . Buy one if you do n't need it to be accurate and do n't mind resetting it a couple of time a week .
 Very cheap . Pay a few extra dollars for a good tube . So cheap I did n't bother to contact the seller for a return . The main problem is the quality of the stem . My pump could barely stay attached because it is smooth . The tube threading was missing so the cap would not stay on .
 The backpack looks great but , it is not the strongest . The stitching gave way at the bottom of the backpack .
 The bottle is extra large , so make sure you have enough room on your bike to attach this . Additionally , there are not directions on how to affix to the bike frame , and if your frame is oversized -LRB- not round , but ovals -RRB- you 'll have trouble -LRB- as I did -RRB- attaching this to your bike.Good price ... but I ca n't use it on my bike .
 They , in no way , hold 4 lbs water each , more like 2 . That is a disappontment . i got them for 7 bucks , btw.The counter can time you , but ca n't tell you reps unles you do curls . Sturdy , but 2 stars for being 4 lbs together .
 I bought this set as a gift for my son , and the three wood and the driver split off the shaft within the first ten days after only a few uses . These clubs should be noted that they are what they are , which is cheap and cheaply made . Do not buy these if you want something that lasts .
 I 'm more than happy with this stove ! I bought it along with a Camp Chef storage bag , a full-size griddle , a griddle storage bag , two flame diffuser and a pair of extension as folding table for the stove . I LOVE everything about the stove , except for the connection of the propane hose to the burner/temp controller knobs . Why ? If I leave the propane hose connected to the stove , it would protrude too far out when stored in its dedicated storage bag and may suffer from lots of stress . To prevent the hose from prematurely breaking off , I unscrew it from the stove when I put the stove in its bag for storage and transport . As an engineer , I think it 's a design flaw . For this reason alone , I 'm giving it a four-star . I 've used the 30,000 BTU burner to fry fish in a wok , and it 's more than powerful . I ca n't imagine how hot the 60,000 BTU can be . It must be great for heating a potful of oil for frying a turkey!UPDATE
 When opening the package , Both burners were not fully attached to the frame . Also , one of the burners was not attached at all to the hose assembly.Luckily the spring and air vent cover was still in the box , and one of the Cub Scout parents on the campout happened to have a socket set with them.Completely missing from the box was the small wrench used to attach the hose to the stove itself .
 The product is a good one , as described.My one rating is for the customer service.Shipment of my order took well over a month with many inquires as to my order status.Each inquire was responded to , but there was sparse order status communication from the vendor.If you do n't mind delay , the vendor has a good range of products and did eventually complete my order.w
 The item had two slices in the left front pocket.We returned it to Fogdog and requested a replacement be shipped and that we did not want a credit.when I next heard from them they said they were issuing a Credit . We sent a e-mail and again said we did not want a credit . The next thing we knew we received a e-mail saying that a credit had been issued . We are NOT HAPPY!Mary Maskill
 Airgun are not firearms , and because of that , they have very different cleaning requirements . You 'll never get copper fouling , obviously , and since pellets are made of pure lead and travel between 350 and 900 fps , leading is a rarely a problem . -LRB- If your pellets are traveling over 1000fps , you should be using a heavier pellet for accuracy 's sake . -RRB- Low powered guns really do n't need cleaning at all . Many target shooters do nothing but run a clean patch down their barrels between matches . PCP guns and bulk-fed CO2 guns should have a lightly lubricated patch run down the barrel once in a while to prevent the barrel from rusting . That 's because the rapid expansion of the gas on firing chills the barrel , which induces condensation . But excessive use of a cleaning rod on any air gun will cause wear at the muzzle that can , and will , affect accuracy.There are several problems with using felt pellets . If your shoot them out of a spring air gun , you 're going to eventually damage the piston , spring , and piston seal . You can shove half a dozen in and it still wo n't cushion the piston properly . If you push them down with a cleaning rod , there 's a good chance you 'll score the barrel with the rod . The steel used in airgun barrels is much softer than that used in firearms barrels , since airguns do n't need to resist the heat and pressure found in a centerfire chamber . Some airgun barrels are made of brass , and one pass of a metal cleaning rod is enough to permanently damage them.The best way to clean any airgun barrel is with a non-metallic pull-through cleaning system . No brushes , solvents , and no gun oils . You can make a pull through cleaner from a piece of .080 weed whacker cord - cut one end at an angle , so it 's easy to push through a cleaning patch , and melt the other end over a candle flame into a blob that 's just under bore size . Use a file to shape it , if necessary . -LRB- No sandpaper - that might leave abrasive bits in the blob . -RRB- Slide the patch over the cord , and pull through from the breech end . Run plain patches through until they come out clean . Simple .
 This was so cheap , the material was super thing and the flag is small . It lasted about 10 days before I bought a real yard flag from the sooner store for cheaper . Do n't waste your money .
 The flag is made of very thin material . It rapidly faded in the Florida sun . If you buy , keep it in the shade .
 From reading the previous reviews , the issue is either that the bag is too thick to allow adequate chalk out or the chalk powder is n't fine enough . Which ever -LRB- or both -RRB- is the case , I just ca n't seem to get decent coverage without really squeezing , which can become difficult after a long period of climbing.I did get the refillable version , so when it runs empty I 'm going to try filling some BD chalk or something else really fine ground and see if that helps .
 The chalk bag comes filled - however I found that out of the packaging it 's pretty worthless . I have to take it and basically throw it into my hand -LRB- like a baseball player trying to break in a glove -RRB- to get chalk on my hands . Gripping it I could get a light layer , but not really any significant amount.I did empty the bag , crushed up the chalk even more and did find it worked a little better . But the results are n't particularly pleasing . It takes either tight gripping of the bag or to get better results
 The material used for this sock is too thick and not porous enough . I can not get an adequate amount of chalk on my hands without really having to force it around in my hand , even then the amount of chalk is minimal . I actually think the majority of the chalk that does stick is from the residual chalk in my bag . I was using the Black Diamond refillable ball until it was taken from me . Needless to say I will be buying a new BD sock soon .
 I bought this item from a 4 wheel drive catalogue and was a bit disappointed when I opened the package . There were no dimensions in the listing that I ordered it from and was expecting the unit to be a little bigger than it is.It does seem to accurately show pitch and roll and the mechanism is OK if a little sticky , which is to be expected on an inexpensive unit . -LRB- sticky internals means that subtle changes do n't show on the display until the unit swings to correct it . If you do n't already know what I mean , just picture the gauges moving with 3-5 degree precision on the unit I have . The action is n't smooth -RRB- The clinometer is n't lighted , which may not be important to you . This model is n't advertised as lighted , so this is not a critiscism.I would have been reasonable satisfied with this product except for one unforgivable flaw . The compass is backwards . More precisely , the magnet in the compass is backwards , but the result ends up the same . If you are facing NW , then the compass will swing to SE on the indicator . The problem is as simple as a reversed magnet , but I do n't believe it can be easily fixed . Maybe this is an intermittent issue in production.In summary , given the compass issue , I would pass on this product .
 The pitch and roll never balanced perfectly , but I overlooked that until the compass stuck .
 I 've install this on my bike in all manner of style and it does n't really work . If I install it with the mirror up above the handle bar , my arm end up covering most of the rear . If I install it below the handle bar , it 's too far from my eyes , which ends up creating a split image of the rear . Also , in either configuration , I have to focus my sight at the mirror to clearly make out what 's behind me . The only configuration I have not try installing it is at the end of my handle bar , on top of my rubber grip and I was n't going to do that -LRB- looks ugly -RRB- . I ended up buying the `` Mirrycle MTB Bar End Mountain Bicycle Mirror '' and use that instead . I really like the Mirrycle that I end up buying a second one for my other bike . Do n't waste your money on this mirror and spend a few dollar more for a better mirror , you 'll be glad that you did .
 It does not hold position on the handlebar . I think a rubber pad between the clamp and the handlebar may help keep the mirror in place . More expensive mirrors use a rubber pad . It was inexpensive and cute for a 20 '' girls bike . I will be more pleased if I can get it to hold position on the bar .
 This is not a convex mirror and it must be positioned under the handlebars to not be obstructed by the arm . The handlebars must be turned to sweep and get a full rear view which is difficult to do at times . The mirror also , even when tightened considerably , still loosens with road bumps . It is also difficult to adjust because the axis 's of movement are oblique.I consider using this mirror more dangerous than safe . While I have my eyes on the mirror searching for dangers behind I find myself missing what is going on in front.I now orderedCateye BM-300G Road Mirrorand hope it will be a better choice . I wish I had ordered it first but still wonder if the same criticisms of this mirror apply . Look for my review there in a week !
 The arm/stem is very short and my son can not use it in the way intended on his bike -- he can not see behind him because his arm is in the way . Great size for the mirror itself but try another one .
 I took a chance on this because I needed a mirror . This product does not stay in one place , as the joints loosen during every ride . It also does not give a good field of view . I think it would work better , if mounted on the far side of the grips , but I could n't do that with my bike . After my experience with this product and talking to other bikers , I have switched to a helmet based mirror . -LRB- Bike Peddler Take A Look Cycling Eyeglass Mirror - works better -RRB-
 This mirror is great for getting the bugs unstuck from your teeth while racing around on your bike . It 's a 3in diameter compact mirror attached to an arm about 5-6 inches in length . Pee Wee Herman would be jealous of this wonderful mirror . The mount has been designed so that when you tighten it the arm can still rotate freely within the mounting bracket , making it fun to continuously adjust while riding . The bracket is expertly engraved with a large Made in Taiwan logo , it looks classy ! As other commenters have suggested , locking nuts from the hardware store might be used to secure the mirror in one orientation , but how boring is that ? For only $ 3 you totally get what you pay for .
 It took quite a while to get the mirror mounted and just the right angle to see cars coming behind me . It was wonderful for one bike ride . The next time I got on my bike it was no longer in the correct position to see and when I tried to adjust it , it swung down and dangled from the handlebars . Too much work for far too little use .
 I have been looking for the right bicycle mirror so I can see traffic behind me . I almost fell several times trying to adjust the mirror right . But I can adjust it to see me so that 's kinda cool . -LRB- joke -RRB-
 PROSOntrac delivered the package on the date promisedCONSCoghlan 's Rectangular Sleeping Bag LinerThis Item is actually an over-sized pillowcase that adds very little warmth and is extremely difficult to enter/exit while it is inside of a sleeping bag.Shipping cost was almost half the purchase price.It is unlikely that I will gamble by purchasing a Coghlan product in the future .

 First off I understand this product was only $ 13.00 and you get what you pay for . Although very short , this is finger joint construction like molding . This is not a single solid piece of wood . The points are obviously not inlays , but paint which is very poorly applied . Spend a few bucks and buy a better quality product .
 Just a cheap Chinese made que . It came with a leather tip and the grip has a nice design but it is not straight and true . You could do just as good spending $ 20 on some other Chinese que . The sticks that came with my table accessory kit are every bit as good to shoot with . You can not buy a que stick over the internet . It must be handled to feel the balance . This que is 19 oz . so if your looking for a heavier que this is not for you .
 I read the reviews prior to purchasing , the only one that jumped out was reports that the brake system was VERY hard to adjust.They are , the bike basically has NO brakes , I am a single mom of 3 boys , I 've assembled -LRB- 8 + bikes for my 3 boys over the last 22 years -RRB- And the brakes just do n't adjust properly.Also , the rear tire rim , has a Severe factory default , the hole in the rim , for the valve stem on the inner tube , is n't drilled in the center of the rim , so when you inflate the tube , it forms a bubble at the valve stem , and the tube Burst.I bought a new tube -LRB- thinking the factory tube was default -RRB- No , this one too started to form a bubble.We put the OLD rim from his old bike on the rear -LRB- it 's silver , and does n't match -RRB- and it inflates fine.Did I mention that the brakes do n't function at all?I want to return the bike , but it was on sale for $ 50.00 , with free shipping -LRB- $ 33.00 value -RRB- so It 's pointless to PAY to return the bike , -LRB- shipping for RETURN , + INSURED -RRB- is required for return , yet it was n't shipped to ME Insured ... for me , it $ 40.00 + the price of a replacement tube -LRB- $ 6.99 -RRB- If i return the bike , I am out $ 48.00 , with NO assurance that a replacement Bike will be problem free.A total disappointment , A waste of hard earned money and my son STILL does n't have a bike , Shoddy manufacturing . UNSAFE , and i do n't recommend that any parent purchase this bike for their their child.We now have a $ 57.00 piece of junk sitting in the living room as `` pop art '' ... Just say NO.F + F+F+F+F+F+F+F +
 as soon as i tried to put it on my lc9 it ripped i now have to send it backand figure something else out !!
 the grip ripped while i was trying to install onto my pistol grip.I was as carefull as i could be , i thought.now its trash ...
 This was to be used on a Ruger SR9C . I followed the directions and heated it before trying to put it on . It ripped before it was half way on . Poor quality rubber , I do not recommend .
 I like the grip it fit my hand well but it was tight to get on my gun and it ripped in The middle it was pretty cheap made I need a refund
 During installation while following the instructions , the grip tore down the seem with ease . Was installing it on my Keltec P9F .
 When reading the reviews for this grip , I found only one that related to the gun of interest , a Diamondback 9mm . Depending totally on this one review , I decided that a $ 10 investment was a low risk expenditure , so I ordered it . It does add some &#34; meat &#34; to the thin , comfortless handle , but not much . Once the grip is installed as far up the handle as possible , the protruding finger separator is too close to the trigger guard , unless the user has very small fingers , so the grip must be lowered which will then require trimming off the grip at the bottom . In short , I will not buy another generic grip for any gun , I 've learned my lesson . In sharp contrast , the Hogue grip I purchased for my Sig P238 -.380 is fabulous . This is not a generic grip , it was made only for this pistol . I do n't recommend this grip , at least for a Diamondback pistol .
 Many people recommend this product for the Kel-Tec P-11 , and though it took a little effort to work on the grip , it fit snugly , was n't going anywhere , and does a nice job of making sure you have a good hold on the weapon , since the perceived recoil on a 9mm this small and weight is `` significant '' ! I added the AG Laser grip pads for further improvement , and when I went to put the grip back on it just split right at the seam . Since others use the two products together , I can only surmise that either mine was defective or the P11 with the grip pads is just too much to fit . Because I 'm unsure whether I 've experienced a defect or not , and because a return is n't really cost-effective , I 'm just ordering the AG Laser sleeve that is known to work from ktaddons/AG Laser.Even without the grip pads , I 'm not wholly sure I can recommend this product to everybody . My hands are by no means small , and yet I find the slight swell between the fingers to make the grip feel rather big in the hand . Perhaps it 'd fit better on a PF-9 -LRB- although I do n't own a PF-9 , and I obviously can not test the one I 've got on it if I did ! -RRB-
 I used my pistol as a concealed carry pistol , and after putting this grip on it , it is not nearly as easy to get out of my pocket when needed . I had to remove it and is now in a drawer
 Tore after 3 use at the range . I will just make my own using tape and a youtube video . Thanks for nothing .
 Ripped while I tried putting it on my LC9 . The rubber is too stiff anyway . I bought a Pachmayr for my Ruger LCP and really liked the material , feel and comfort . I 'll look for something from Pachmayr for my LC9 as this Hogue grip does n't look like it would help with recoil as much as a Pachmayr grip .
 when trying to but on grips ripped a piece off rubber and then i toss then away . money spent foolish lee . will not buy this product again .
 it is a alright grip but it was stupid for them to recomend it when I bought the laser sight cause you can not use the grip if you put the sight on so I was sadly dissapointed . But if you take your sight off then the grip is well worth the few dollars it cost dont remember but under 10 buck . Not even worth returning . Did ship real fast got all in just 5 days including weekend .
 The package my grip came in listed two different handgun models that I own , neither of which it fit properly . Once installed it slid around and made the handgun unsafe to use . I would not recommend this product to anyone as it could easily cause a safety issue .
 if you have a glock 26 forget it ... . it wont fit its too small , it took A TON of force but I got it on and it needed trimming get something else .
 This seemed like a nice grip for my Springfield XD Subcompact .40 , but due to the cheap quality it ripped as I tried to install it . Pure crap !!!
 This appears in `` customers also bought '' with the Crimson Trace trigger guard laser for Ruger LCP . If you have the Crimson Trace , this product ca n't be used .
 This came up under a search for Ruger LCP accessories . While the width is not a problem -LRB- it will wrap around a Ruger LCP with some effort -RRB- , it is TOO LONG for the Ruger LCP . Some of it will hang out . I do n't recommend this for the Ruger LCP . If you really want to buy it for the Ruger LCP , then be prepared to cut some of the grip with scissors to make it short enough to for your Ruger LCP .
 This ripped when I tried to stretch it on my XD .40 sub compact . This is garbage and stay away from .
 Not much to say about this product , IT 'S JUNK !!! Bottom line it does n't fit the weapon , so I did n't use it , I could have made modifications but I was so disappointed in the product I just chucked it .
 Do n't buy this product . I tried to install it on a PPK/S without tools . It was extraordinarily tight and just from working it with my fingers it tore at the front strap . I am suspicious as to the quality control of the entire brand if they sell this substandard product .
 When my order arrived , all items were as advertised except the grip which was so old the rubber had hardened and become brittle . I was not surprised when it split upon installation . All other items were fine , but I will never order another rubber item from Amazon ... it 's a dumping ground for old `` stuff . ''
 When searching for the Crimson Trace laser for the Ruger LCP this grip shows up as `` suggested item '' . Do n't waste your time or money it is to large for the gun . Lucky for me it fits the LC9 .
 I tryed putting this on a Hi-Point C9 given the crappy ergonomics of the gun . I was sliding it up the handle and then the grip gave out on me and torn right down the middle . I do n't know , seems like it would help if the description was more informative , maybe give a sizing chart or an idea of what would fit your gun . I know the handle is not as long as most guns so I got this one , I do n't think it 's that much wider though . I feel like I wasted $ 8 .
 Could n't get grip on . Then my husband tore it . Not such a great item . Disappointed . Must keep looking . Wish guns just came with optional rubber grips for each model .
 I did n't have a good experience with this product . I followed the instructions closely , but somehow tore the grip during installation . My experience is probably due to my extremely huge muscles and lack of patience . For 7 dollars it is n't really worth returning and I 'll never buy this model again .
 it wo n't fit AR , nor walter ppk , just have no use for this small grip -LRB- love my colt grips from hogue -RRB- do n't know what type of pistol it will fit -LRB- might buy the pistol it fit 's if calb . is worth it
 I ordered this for a Taurus PT 140 after reading reviews from many different sources saying this gun used the Handall Jr. . We were really exceited when receiving the package , we boiled the grip to loosen it up and stretch it out . When we put it on , it was still very tough so we boiled it longer and continued to stretch it in between taking it out of the water and putting it back in . When it was finally stretchy enought to put on , we started slowly working it up the grip of the gun . Then it split in the seam of the grip and is now useless . I also bought the pink Handall Jr. for a Bersa Thunder , and had the same issue .
 Too big for the Ruger LCP . Required too much trimming , then after it looked like a cheap after market grip that was too big for the gun .
 I picked this up for a Ruger LC9 thinking it would give me a little extra thickness to work with but I was wrong . This grip was just floppy on the sides and jammed my index finger into the trigger guard . It 's just not thick enough on the side panels , especially if your stock grip has any variation over a square block.This grip can only make you less accurate . it 's to big for any 380 and definitively not right for any 9mm . i 'm convinced somebody is stacking the reviews in a positive light .
 Not a good size and hardly fits any of my micro guns . I had to cut it like the directions suggest , which just ended up being a disaster ...
 Ordered for Kahr P9 ; tore on installation rendering product unusable ; can not recommend . I 'll probably have my gunsmith install wrap around grip .
 Its make the grip `` fat '' or a lot wider . After you put it on you have to trim it with scissors or something else '' , hope that turn out good '' . It also makes your finger ride high on the gun , I install it and removed it , did n't like it . If you have a bigger or fat fingers , `` like mine '' this is Not very good item . Hope this review helps .
 I got this shirt because it looked different than any other patriots shirt ... This is a very thin shirt and runs VERY small . I usually wear a 2x and got that size and it did n't fit . I gave it to my daughter who is a large/xlarge .
 Pros-very comfortable , cheap price.cons-does not block out enough light or shade very well . These shades do not work well at all in very bright sun . On the the product tag it says something to the effect of `` does not distort colors '' etc. , but in doing that you will still find yourself squinting in bright sun . There is really hardly any tint at all with these shades .
 The lenses are not very good . . distort the vision . . the frame itself seems to be made well but it is the lenses that give it a poor product review
 No padding inside box . Just the sunglasses and a lot of box to tumble against Asinine packaging ! Sunglasses were very warped and could not be bent back into shape .
 Like another reviewer , these glasses were a little too big for my average sized head . I ended up returning these .
 Well , it was just a little annoying that practically every time I cleaned the lenses the lenses came off . They are pretty easy to put back in place . After only using these glasses for a few weeks my son had them around his neck in front hanging from a sunglasses strap . As the boat approached the dock he threw a rope over the dock cleat and knocked both lenses off into the water at the same time . Both lenses were lost.Other than that the glasses were pretty good for the price . However I will not be buying any others of this make .
 I ignored the negative reviews -LRB- 2 negative out of 19 , at the time -RRB- because I ca n't find any other mini-trampolines that claim a 300lb weight limit . I weigh 265 . So I chose to believe the positive reviews , hoping this one would work . Unfortunately , it did n't . First , one of the legs was not threaded , so could not be attached . I immediately requested a replacement leg.Despite only having five legs , it was stable enough to do a little test bouncing . So I hopped on , bounced GENTLY for one minute to start getting a feel for it , and was pleased to note how quiet it was . So far , so good.About 20 minutes later , I got on again for another -LSB- planned -RSB- minute , again GENTLY . Before the minute was up , one of the springs popped right out of the very cheap piece of plastic -LRB- or cheap metal - could n't tell for certain -RRB- in which the spring hooks . Broke the attachment clear through.This is the first time I 've ever had a purchase packed back up for return in less than an hour after it hit my porch ! Thoroughly disappointed and disgusted ! -LRB- Also , I found out later that I would n't have been able to get a replacement leg , and would have had to return it anyway . -RRB- If anyone knows of a mini-tramp/bouncer/rebounder that WILL hold up for a 265lb . person , I 'd sure love to know about it ! I 've had them before , and know what benefits this type of exercise offers , and would really like to have one again .
 This item was broken in two places within 15 minutes . Two springs just ripped through the metal frame that was meant to secure the springs . The item says 300 lb weight capacity . My husband weight 190lbs - it broke when he jumped on it only twice .
 My son and I both loved this trampoline and were jumping on it every day . Neither of us weighs much . I am about 115lbs and he is about 60lbs . We had had ours for a few months when it started popping springs . So far we can still bounce on it . -LRB- By the way , the spring ends literally snap off . -RRB- cut to JUNE ... and it has now popped about 6 more springs -- still jumpable , but barely -- and now a cloth tag that holds the spring braces has also popped . We ordered the smallest springs available for replacement and they are still too big . Unfortunately , this thing is DESTINED FOR THE GARBAGE shortly . I will have to buy another and I will not get a foldable one . Also , I will get the cheapest I can find since they seem to be disposable!Cut to AUGUST and we bought the kind with BUNGY CORDS . It 's amazing . So happy with it . It should last forever and has a much more fun bounce . I wish I 'd bought this one first . Do n't bother with the spring kind is my advice . -LRB- Also bungies are QUIET . -RRB-
 Within a week of purchasing , two springs had already broke . The trampoline was not used `` hard '' but rather for light bouncing that might fiancee likes to do to relax . It also squeaked from day one .
 We 've only had this item for a few days . It was difficult to put on the fabric that covers the springs . Also , the fabric is lax . I felt like the fabric dipped too close to the ground when either my son or I stood on it . I suppose that is because it did n't support the weight it said it did ? If you are over 200 pounds I would n't recommend this product . However , the reason that I am looking into returning this item is because after jumping on it the rubber protectors on the bottom of the legs are tearing . Please take note , that my feet never left the fabric . I only bounced , not jumped . -LRB- I ca n't really jump . -RRB- I do n't want the metal surface scratching my tile or ripping my carpets . This is the first trampoline I 've owned .
 The trampoline is not made by company Needak as nowhere on the machine does it state this . In addition , one of the springs flew off after only three weeks of use . I returned the item as soon as that happened .
 I have a table that stays outdoors but is folded up and under a tarp when not in use . This net is not made to be put on and taken off . It 's difficult to put together in the first place . Worst of all though is that one of plastic hook made for the chain to stretch the top of the net broke on day two . Even though I 've found a way to leave it on all of the time this net is still very mediocre .
 I would like to use this product . It appears to very sturdy . But there are no directions for how to attach the net to the posts . I give this manufacturer zero stars .
 awful net hard to set up , and does n't stand up does n't come with instructions either . . that 's all i have to say
 I bought a ping pong net from them and I tried to set it up the first thing that happened was the net got torn .
 This set does not come with instructions to put it together . A complete waste of money !!!
 The time , date and alarm works on this POLAR watch , but in terms of tracking calories burned this watch has missed the mark.I comapre calories burned on the watch indicator to calories burned on a Polar machine and it is so off kilter in terms odf # 's . I could burn 320 calories running for 30 minutes , but the watch will read 109 calories burned . I have reset all the settings and put my accurate ht and wt in along with my age and it still does n't work .
 Had to return the Polar F6 twice over the year . First one of the buttons would fall off and then it would stop working . This is only from Zumba and treadmill . Would not purchase again .
 This is my third polar watch . This particular watches screen went blank in 4 months after purchase . I am SO DISAPPOINTED in this watch . I wont send it back to get charged ` around ' 75 bucks and I wont buy another polar branded watch .
 I get really frustrated with this product , because every workout I have problems with it . I will jog , and the monitor will say that my heart rate is 38 -LRB- When it works properly , it will say that my heart rate is 168-180 when jogging -RRB- . Once I did a five minute warm up of cardio -LRB- jumping jacks , jump rope , jogging in place , high kicks , etc. -RRB- and looked at my watch , and it had zeroed out and said that in those 5 minutes of cardio I had only burned 9 calories . It is REALLY frustrating . The battery is fine , so I do n't know what the problem is . I wish it would work properly , because I love knowing where my heart rate is and how many calories I 'm burning , and I love tracking my fitness . I do n't know what 's going on with this product . It 's driving my crazy .
 I was very happy with my Polar F6 Heart Rate Monitor when it first arrived . It worked great and I love the features , so that 's not the problem . The problems are 1 -RRB- the strap -LRB- especially around the loop that holds the thing around your chest -RRB- is crap and tends to break , needing ongoing replacements , 2 -RRB- when the honeymoon has worn off and the batteries need replacing , Polar takes more money from you than seems reasonable to change a darn battery , 3 -RRB- after said honeymoon ending , the transmitter also starts to stutter and you 'll find yourself adjusting and re-adjusting and wetting for suction to try to get the right reading going.In conclusion , you 'll be happy at first , and then you wo n't be so happy .
 I am not new to HR monitors I 've been wearing one for almost 15 years . The one and only HR monitor/watch that I 've warn for years was a Polar . I had it for almost 2 years before I had to replace the battery . It took a simple A3 battery . The fact that I could replace the battery was why I had the same watch for so long . But , it was getting old and the strap was wearing out and I thought it was time to replace it with something more up-to-date and with a few more features . The old one was simple , just gave you the time and your HR.So , I bought a ladies Polar F-6 . I was shocked that after 5 months the batteries died and needed replacement . Unfortunately , I waited too long to send it back and the warranty expired . In any case , I tried to replace the batteries and found out you ca n't replace the battery yourself it has to be sent back to Polar and they wanted around $ 40 for putting in new batteries . I can surely find a new HR monitor for close to that price.Now , I 'm looking for a new HR/watch that allows me to replace the batteries myself . I will NEVER buy another Polar HR monitor after this experience .
 The heart monitor and watch work fine BUT the display is grainy , small , and hard to see . Far cheaper monitors and watches have far better , brighter , bigger displays.And - the beeps to warn that you have gone above or below your heart range are so low that there is no way to hear them on the exercise floor ! You have to keep the unit to your ear to hear them.People recommended this so I bought this but I am not happy with this unit .
 I am an older woman -LRB- 63 -RRB- . I am very active and was quite curious about how many calories I actually burn . I purchased this to make sure I did not `` overdo '' with my heart and for the calorie number . It worked -LRB- somewhat -RRB- on day one and then quit . I tried on two more consecutive days but to no avail . It just would not pick up my heart beat properly ... it would register 0 and then a few minutes later , 172 , a number that is too high for me . I returned it and did not want the hassle of trying another . I have not purchased a replacement .
 This is my third polar and probably last . Bought this one in July 06 and it got condensation under the face and then died . Disappointing for having it only 9-10 months . I rarely used it for water sports and it did this after working out on a hot , sunny day . The same thing happened on the other two .
 Love the features on this watch , but the band is made of a poreous synthetic material that is impossible to clean . I now have a two-toned watch -- pretty soft pink casing with a discolored greyish pink band . Does anyone know how to clean this ??? Buy this and you will soon be shopping for a basic black replacement .
 I bought this heart monitor on the recomendation of a friend who has one . Unfortunately the company -LRB- Joma -RRB- did not allow for a size selection . They sent a M which would not fit me . I called the customer service number to try and exchange it for a larger size . It took 25 min to get through only to be told that was `` the only one we had '' . I then asked how to go about returning it , and was told I had to print out a form and mail it in for a `` return code '' . However they only allow returns 30 days from when they shipped it to me , and since they took 3 weeks to get it here , and a week to respond to my email so that time is gone now . I would strongly recommend trying a different vendor of the item . Which looks like it would work great ... if only it was my size .
 I got this shirt because it looked different than any other patriots shirt ... This is a very thin shirt and runs VERY small . I usually wear a 2x and got that size and it did n't fit . I gave it to my daughter who is a large/xlarge .
 NOTE ! Only a 4 oz bottle ! Not 40 ! When they care enough to fix the title of the item , then I will care enough to write a review . Seems fair since I feel snookered going off a recommendation from a friend and thought 40z was worth the money . I now know how much that actually would have been ; however , I think the title should be clear and accurate since I am basing my buying choices off of what someone says . Until then , this post will force it to the bottom of the list nd allow the honest posts that I saw for 4oz to the top of the list.I will rate this correctly I only after they fix the falseness in advertising .
 I read a lot of reviews before I go online and order something . I read forums , reviews , ask my buddies , I do a lot of research before I buy something . With all the reviews and peoples opinions I read the woods wise brand was the only one they I really could n't find anything bad about , so I purchased it . When it got to my house I was really excited and I opened her on up and gave her a blow . Wow has got to be the cheapest sounding piece of crap I have ever heard . Earlier this season I bought rattle bag/deer call combo kit made by hunter 's specialties at Gander Mountain . I mainly bought it for the rattle bag since they all pretty much sound the same and was planning on throwing away the deer call anyway since a 10 dollar combo kit obviously is n't going to have a nice deer call in it . Anyway the deer call from the cheap HS combo kit sounds identical to this piece of crap . Sounds very cheap and nothing like a pig . You ca n't see it in the picture but there are actually 2 places you can blow into on this call . The larger one is for hog , the smaller for javelina . The javelina call actually does n't sound too bad , but the pig call is horrible . I ca n't express this enough do not buy this call !! Pigs are pretty smart , smarter than dogs actually , so I would either go with an electronic call or no call at all . I hope this helps anyone trying to figure out a way to bring home the bacon . Good luck and be safe everyone .
 Well , this product * does * anti-fog , as long as you coat your goggles every day and do n't swim for more than 45 minutes . But something tells me that there 's some MacGyver vinegar/baking soda formula that will work just as well .
 If you are considering buying the product because of the product image above , do n't . They 'll only send you one small bottle that might look like a special paintball lens cleaner but is probably no more than a bottle of cleaner for glasses .
 The actual advertisement in Amazon stated it included bases - apparently they no longer are included . The tee broke after 15 minutes of hitting ! Piece of junk .
 I 'm looking for a Millet 1 '' detachable Weaver style ring with a specific height . The Millet DT00703 has a height of .470 '' , which would meet my needs . But this item and other Millet `` High '' rings sold on Amazon do n't list the Millet model number or the base to scope body distance.The price here is slightly better , but what use is saving a few dollars if my scope slaps against my barrel when I try to mount it because the ring was the wrong height?I 'm going to spend some extra money and get the Millet rings that I know are what I want .
 The description said it was adjustable to fit anyone . I 'm 5 ' 6 '' about 155 with a 32 '' waist and it does n't even come close to fitting me . The cinch belt says `` Large '' on it and is tightened all the way , so are the shoulder straps and it is too loose . I 'll be returning it .
 My husband took our son and his friend for a ride and the trailer tipped completly on it 's side as he was coming up the driveway from the street ! The kids were well with in the wieght limit and he was going slow but both children were hurt and now I 'm afraid to use it . Be careful turning and going over bumps !
 I bought this item last year at Target and the item worked fine for about one month . The tires became warped easily and the hitch kept coming off my bike . The net result was that I returned the unit and bought a similiar one at another retailer which works much better .
 I picked up this unit from Target - it was very easy to put together . Kids were excited to go for a ride.I barely squeezed a 4 year-old and a 2 year-old into it , wearing only T-shirts . The manual states that it can handle up to 100 lb , perhaps if it is a single child , it might.We went for a ride ... Our neighborhood is hilly and I could not get it up a single hill . Where the road was flat , I was able to pedal it reasonably well , though much harder than when alone . Going down hill was the best , though I was worried about kids bumping heads cause they sat too close.Once I got home , I asked my husband to box it back and we took it back the next day ...
 I bought this trailer from Target in March 2007 , and the harness on the inside started to deteriorate about a month after I bought it . I called Target and they told me to bring it back with the receipt , but did not replace it . I called Schwinn and they did nothing about it either and every time I called I got the run around . The material in the bottom of the trailer also started to rip and I know my son was not heavy enough to rip it since he was 20 lbs . when we got it.The only good things about it are the big wheels and it was very roomy .
 I picked this up at Target since it was on sale and had good reviews on Target.com and Amazon . Trailer was extremely easy to set up . Out of the box and without instructions , it took less than five seconds . Other positives

 I bought a bunch of these shirts because I saw the good reviews . At first I was happy , they fit perfect , then I washed them once in cold water and they shrunk more than I ever seen shirts shrink in my life . My medium shirts became XXS . I wish I had a 8 year old son , because he would be the only person that would be able to fit in them now .
 These are not heavy shirts , and shrink like Swap Meet Specials . Order TWO sizes bigger . Not a great deal .
 I am a large person and ordered these in a 3X but the actual fit was more like a 2X , so I ended up giving them to a friend of mine . One other thing that I did not like was the material ; it was a stretchy cotton that does not breath much at all , it seemed much more like polyester to me ; I had to look at the tag to make sure that they were really made of 100 % cotton ! I recommend going to JCPenny.com and getting their Tees made of cotton jersey material .
 We buy these shirts at Target all the time in a size large for my husband , but Target was out of them so we purchased them at this online store , thinking they 'd be the same . They are TOTALLY INFERIOR and are sized incorrectly from the store bought version in same exact brand & size . And they are lighter in thickness -LRB- ounce weight -RRB- , which may be a plus to some people in our hot climate . They are 4 inches narrower in width around the chest & waist than the same one purchased at Target . We test washed one in warm water & low heat in the dryer to see if it would shrink & it did like another customer mentioned , and now it fits like a medium size . We do n't want to exchange what we ordered & get `` extra large '' , as the armholes will be too large . Very inferior product , they are going back for a refund !
 I bought these because of the Jerzees name . MISTAKE ! I bought 6 of these . 1 to try out , 5 to either keep or return . I will be returning the other 5 . The issue is the collar . Even though it 's ribbed , it basically stretched out of shape so badly after only one wash ! It looks like its had 30 + washings ! I will shop elsewhere .
 These shirts are great and never shrink , BUT this seller charges way too much for ONE shirt . I thought I was getting a few for this price and was very disappointed when only ONE shirt arrived . Can get this much cheaper elsewhere .
 I still have not recieved this item that I ordered . I did get the star spangle shirt and love it but I have yet to have recieved this one and am not sure of who to contact about it . Please let me know how to go about getting it . I was under the impression I would have recieved it a number of weeks ago -LRB- it was part of a going away gift of my better half who is deployed to fight the war now -RRB- and still have not had word or recieved it.Thank You , Holly Padilla
 First I would like to say that when I purchased this item it was advertised as the `` Hobby '' addition . When I received it I did n't think it was the hobby set so I called amazon , the operator said she did not know about this product and provided me with the phone number to who sold it to me . I called that number 3 times and left a message each time to please call me and I have yet to receive a phone call back . . When I gave this item to my husband for Christmas he confirmed my thought that it was not the `` Hobby '' addition . I was not only upset that I did not get what I was looking for but that no one had returned my call .
 The manufacturer fails to mention that the strap that comes with this mask is very small and wo n't fit any grown up . I kept it at the loosest setting and it still would n't go around my head -LRB- which is relatively small compared to most people -RRB- . Thinking it to be just the strap wanting to `` break in '' , I tried forcing it around my head . Within a few minutes in the water , it opened up from the strain.Again , this item is just unusable by a grown-up , which the manufacturer fails to mention anywhere on the product packaging or advertising .
 These are cheap plastic . Not real fiber optic . Not metal mount . ALL plastic . The `` fiber optic '' part can be bent easily with a finger . If you have no intention of actually using your slug shotgun , these might be fine . But if you 're like me , and not only use your shotgun , but beat it up in the course of a hunting season , avoid these .
 I took a chance on this mask for my son . The mask has a powerful polymer smell that makes it unpleasant to use , the plastic clips barely grip the vinyl ridges used to adjust and hold the straps in place , and the plastic clip broke off and was lost during the first use , rendering the mask unusable . Do not waste your money on this mask .
 First , when I started using it for my baths in my tub , it did n't work at all . It leaks water in and it is too tight when worn.It 's a toy . Refund policy was terrible . I basically wasted money . Looks very neat however , and possibly could be used for halloween occasions or some other creative reason . Maybe you can reuse the components for an engineering project , or use it for eye protection , or convert it into special sunglasses ?
 I received four earmuffs and one of the four had a whine in the left earpiece so I am sending it back . The foam wind screens are poorly designed as they have four very fragile prongs sticking up that hold the foam on . They are very easily broken off as they are not protected . They cost $ 8 a pair and are not covered by the warranty and are difficult to find , I had to order from Peltor and pay almost as much in shipping . I tell everyone to stay away from this product .
 Shipping was prompt and I received it the 4th day . The product quality was evident with one problem . The electronics were faulty . After trying the batteries provided with no results , I inserted a new set.One thing I want to mention , is that the battery compartment had conflicting information . On the muffs , it showed in which way to insert the batteries , on the compartment door , it showed the opposite way.I called the customer service number for Peltor and left a message . They called me back within an hour . She had me try a few things , and the results were that the outside of the muff opposite the batteries became very hot to the touch -LRB- like in microwave hot -RRB- . I 'm guessing electrical short and I 'm glad I did n't have them on my head.Tech support stated that they would contact their electrical experts , and would get back to me in the morning -LRB- it was after 4:00 EST -RRB- The next day -LRB- Friday -RRB- I never received a call back , and Saturday I packaged them up and returned them . Still waiting for my credit 4 days after shipping them back.I was recommended to buy Peltor Tactical 7S but I had found this model which had more features that was on sale.It could be just a bad example of a good company . The overall quality and workmanship of the headset was quite obvious of the quality materials , fit and finish . These were not a cheap knock-off of a better product , they were the better product.I understand that sometimes you get shipped a defective product . What I was unhappy about was not getting called back or contracted through my email . I was also not happy that the did not offer to ship me another set asap while I sent this defective set back.Peltor seems to be a well made and quality product , but maybe they are suffering from the bad economy just like the rest of us , and some of it due to my consistent bad luck when dealing with retailers of any type.I gave them the benefit of the doubt , but I had to run down to my local gun shop and buy a pair of cheap Radians about half the price . They were half the quality too and could not come close to the Peltor set I almost had.Had I not been in such a hurry , I would have gave Peltor another chance . The quality and feel of the product was that good.I went with the Radians Pro-Amp series and are quite happy with my choice
 I Received these today . They were dead on arrival . Instruction are very limited , which did n't help . Hopefully these are an exception to the rule , but I will find a different brand to get next time.I have since bought Pro Ears Gold . Now that is a great set of hearing protectors !!!
 This item arrived defective -LRB- electronics did not work -RRB- , and I returned it for an exchange . Amazon immediately sent out another one by overnight express delivery . Unfortunately the second unit was also defective . Since two other reviewers had similar problems , I can only conclude that the quality control for this expensive item is not very good . Even if I received a working unit , I would be afraid that the electronics would n't last very long . I returned the second unit and ordered a Howard Leight Impact Sport Earmuff instead .
 My Peltor Tactical Pro hearing protector was defective , and would not power on -LRB- batteries were fine , and inserted properly -RRB- . I saw one other reviewer , from January 2009 , that experienced the same problem . Amazon did not have a replacement in stock , so I had to order from OpticsPlanet .
 Does not work right out of the box . Cheaply made , poor quality . Given as a gift too late to return . one star because there is not a no star rating . DO N'T BUY !
 I was shocked when I opened the box , this looks like a $ 20 pair of muffs . I 'm not sure I want to keep these muffs , WAY overpriced for the low quality . Is this someones idea of a joke ? these ca n't be worth more than $ 20-30 . Do n't company 's care what consumer think anymore?Update 02/11/2012My review was short , so I will add some more information after taking them to the range about 20 times , I will not use without inner ear protection before putting theses on.I based my opinions on 35 years of buying quality products -LRB- before the time that we are forced to -LRB- buy made in china -RRB- products.most everything today is poorly made and wo n't last . These muffs are such an example . I do n't feel the need to be an expert in the field of hearing / Audio to give an overall opinion on the low quality manufacturer of this product . suffice it to say you can do better with a good pair of $ 40 pair of muffs .
 I am truly disappointed with this item . I accept some blame for an excited and hasty purchase of what I hoped would be a great gift for a real Longhorn fan . I relied too much on the illustration , the price , and the shipping charge to form an idea of what I was buying . It was only after the tiny package arrived that I rechecked the description to discover the small sentence at the end stating , `` Pole not included . '' Another big disappointment was the flimsy , tissue-thin material from which the flag is constructed .
 this was way to small . I baugth the Ex large the add stated 14-16 . It was way to small even my 17 year old daughter could not fit in it and she is a 10-12 . so if you want one that fits buy BIG !!!!!!
 I am 5 ' 2 '' 120lbs -LRB- 35 '' hips -RRB- . I ordered a 32 -LRB- I like my suits snug -- I do triathlons/compete and understand that tight suits are good and do n't have much of a chest to fit in there -RRB- . I have never worn anything larger than a 34 '' in a suit -LRB- and they were not particularly tight -RRB- , except when I bought a 36 for early in my pregnancies . So , I can not get the 32 suit past my mid-thighs -- yes for my height I have muscular thighs and bigger hips probably -- but I have to agree that this suit is sized 1-2 sizes smaller than normal , even for speedo.I will order the 36 and see how that goes .
 I LOVED IT WHEN I BOUGHT IT BUT NOW I NOTICED THAT THE AREA LOWER BACK TO BUM AREA IS THINNING . THE MATERIAL YOU CAN SEE YOUR HANDS THROUGH IT THAT 'S HOW WORN LOOKING IT HAS BECOME.REGARDSNADIA GHANNY
 I have bought many Speedo suits to swim laps and ordered this in my regular size . However , it is probably 2 sizes too small ... so , if you plan to order one make sure you get a size or two bigger than you normally do .
 This is not a size 10 . I have been buying swim suits regularly for 5 years , so I know . I like the style , it is just too small
 I understand what everyone is saying about needing to wear the suit tight and agree . I ordered a size up from the size I would normally wear I found it very tight but great for swimming laps.One thing that did NOT work for me was the fact that the sides are quite generously cut . If you look carefully at a couple of the photos you can see that the back is cut quite deep . I 'm pretty busty , and I found that coming up for a break after a couple laps I was trying to quickly tuck things back in ! I 'm a 36D so I 'm not even abnormally large but this suit is best for ladies with small busts . Will have to buy another suit now . : -LRB-
 I did n't particularly care for this suit . The material felt cheap , and I did n't find the cut to be particularly flattering . I returned the suit .
 I ordered my regular bathing suit/speedo size , and this suit was way too tight on me , could hardly get it on . Had to send it back .
 I orswe size 14 just to be in the saver side ; my swiming costume are between size 10 to 12 , but I was very desepointed by Speedo brand they are n't as good as I thought .
 I 'm very disappointed in this cart . I purchased it to move PC 's around the office and the cart would buckle under the 50lbs of weight . I called the manufacturer and found out its a china knock off . The manufacturer also said the real ones are at Lowes look for the `` Insta-Truck '' .
 I mounted this on my Mosin 91/30 but the mount is too high so I could n't get the point of aim to meet point of impact . There just was n't enough adjustment . The adjustment knobs do n't have good ` clicks ' in that as you go through a few clicks , some are good positive clicks while others are mushy and you barely feel them to count . I found the dot did n't really move a great deal in some adjustments but moved a lot in others . I finally gave up and it is just sitting in my safe.Battery life is good and the optics are clear enough . I see a nice circular spot which is bright enough even in daylight . Some complain about an oval or jagged dot , but that is actually their eyes and not the dot itself .
 I could not put the covers on at our shore ststion as it 's too tight of a fit and has no front lip to hold it in place , therefore I had to return them . It may be fine for trailoring but not for lift .
 I wanted to protect my Mizuno blade irons from nicks and scratches so I bought this product . They are way too big for any blade irons , and probably too big for midsize irons as well . I lost a bunch of covers over the course of a year , because they just fell off - the hosel molding did nothing to lock the club into place and the slot you pull it out of is a crazy 3 inches long . I bought another set , because the golf shop only stocked this brand . I 'm slowly losing these ones as well.Until they make a smaller version , stay away from these if you play midsize clubs or blades .
 Nice heart rate monitor , but POOR POOR service , please hope that it never breaks , because you will never get it back . I can not believe how great the product is but how bad the company sucks . I shipped the fastest method , they received more than two weeks ago , but have not even opened the box and confirmed it has been received .
 This is a great HRM with lots of functions , but if you intend to use this on your bike and you have a wireless bike computer like myself , DO NOT BUY THIS HRM BECAUSE IT WILL NOT WORK . I just wasted my money on it . Polar 's HRM 's pick up all the signals from your wireless bike computer -LRB- and they try their best not to tell you this -RRB- and your unit thinks it 's a heartbeat signal and as soon as you start riding it shows your heart rate jumping up to a ridiculous level -LRB- which it is n't -RRB- like around 230 bpm . I 've had other HRM 's that did n't pick up my wirelss bike computer signals , so I do n't know why Polar ca n't figure out how to prevent this from happening . Nice HRM , but it 's as good as garbage if it wo n't function where you need it to .
 The watch face just looks like rainbows so you ca n't see a thing . I returned mine for this reason . Otherwise , it 's fine .
 I get the idea , but it 's awful . Slightest `` miss '' and your player will hit their hand on the bar , unrealistic ball placement , unnatural swing . Good idea , but the design needs work . We threw it away . Wasted money .
 I bought this as a gift for my grandaughter . First of all there were no instructions or any kind of material with it . We did figure it out on our own . Also , a long metal pole with a semi-circle on the the end is not worth $ 78.00 . There is nothing to it . She did keep it and hopefully she will be able to use it .
 This was not the product as displayed on the website , so I returned it . Called the manufacturer and was told they no longer make the one shown on the website -LRB- not their problem -RRB- .
 LOL . Went to use it , could n't open it . Two others tried also . Luckily I always carry a lighter and back up matches anyway . Got home , tried to open it with tools . Still could n't open it . Finally used tin snips to cut/rip it open -- got my tinder quick and flint out and chucked it . Good thing it was n't an emergency ... I might still be out there ... frozen solid with the container clutched in my cold dead hands ... staring at the `` China '' stamp on the bottom ...
 I had a match box like this , a brass one , when I was a kid in my teen years about fifty years ago . I should have known by the price that this one would only be maybe a fifth of how well it is built compared to the one I had as a kid . You have to be really careful or the side straps will bend VERY easily . It will do the job of keeping matches dry but will not take any rough abuse like the ones built in `` the good old days '' would . I give it a two star rating since it will do what it is met to do if you are careful with it . http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HAB2TG/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleKen
 While I did n't exactly expect a top quality product , I was disappointed by the rough edges and shoddy workmanship of this product . I seriously doubt if I will ever order from this company again .
 I bought this to house storm matches and it is not long enough . It would cost more to ship it back then I paid for it in the first place . Consider yourself warned .
 I contacted seller to let him know this hasnt arrived , he told me to call around to local post offices to make sure they were not holding my item ... i was told the only way they hold item is if signature confirmation is required . . seller never returned money .
 First of all I 'd like to say how much I loved my Thighmaster . I got one four months ago from a Sportmart and it has been part of my daily routine ever since . I have much better thigh muscles and a lot more confidence in myself because that little invention made of foam and an industrial strength coil . With that said , I have a slightly amusing and mildly alarming anecdote for you.I was just beginning my strength training exercises and I had just done my second rep with the Thighmaster and all of the sudden I heard a loud pop and it fell to the ground ... IN TWO PIECES ! Now there are two things that immediately crossed my mind , `` Wow man , my thighs must made of STEEL ! '' and the other more likely scenario `` Wow man , it fell apart after four months , this must be an inferior product . '' Anyway I e-mailed SuzanneSommers.com in hopes that it was a fluke and that I had gotten the one crumby thighmaster . I asked them if it was possible to replace it , and sadly although I only owned it four months I was told '' It may be time for a new thigh master as the product is not designed to last forever . '' Last time I checked , four months is NOT anywhere near forever . A year , six months maybe , but when you divide the cost of a thighmaster by the amount of time I owned it , the costs outweighs the benefits . It is even less comforting that the company was n't surprised or alarmed by their product 's short lifespan . It seemed that if four months is akin forever to the people at suzannesomers.com , then the product 's usage expectancy is not much more than that . It makes me unhappy to have ruined such a handy little device with normal wear and tear , but I ca n't really afford to buy a new one every four months . I just wanted to give everyone a heads up and let you know that although it is theoretically a great product , the durability is highly dubious . And the suzannesomers.com , who referred me to the manufacturer 's warrantee only think that a thighmaster should work for three months maximum .
 I have an original thighmaster I purchased years ago ... thinking this Thighmaster Gold was going to be similar I purchased it to take to work with me . It is very flimsy-it seems to be made of very light weight material that is not going to hold up . My old thighmaster is very sturdy-I have been using it for years and it looks fairly new . This one will be ready for the trash can in less than a year . Save your money !
 This will be my 6th thighmaster purchase . Everyone of them has snapped in half within a year . I have tried other brands . . but their resistance is too weak . It seems to me that this product could be made much better and last a lot longer .
 Poor quality materials . We bought this Thighmaster Gold after the spring in our original Thighmaster -LRB- blue -RRB- broke in half , and now the spring just broke in this second one . My wife did like using it , while it lasted .
 Have bought 2 now and both within a couple months of use the spring broke , come in Suzanne summers fix you product , maybe you should make it in America
 im sorry but this product is extremely boring and is a waste of my money
 Bought for my son . Bought size 3 and was too small and are like size 1 . Did n't bother to return .
 The product itself is good however the sizing is quite off . I bought a size 2.5 for my 10 y/o daughter and they were at least one size too small .
 Just a heads-up for anyone looking for noise cancellation . These are padded earmuffs that reduce noise . The same as if you wrapped a pillow around your head . There is no cancellation involved , and labeling these as a `` Noise Canceling Earmuff '' is misleading . If you are looking for actual noise canceling , look elsewhere .
 For the price these are decent ear protection earmuffs . They in no way `` Noise Canceling '' and `` Professional ... '' is a gross exaggeration .
 I work in an office and I bought when there was construction in the adjacent lot - they where pounding supports into the ground . It did n't eliminate the noise but made it more bearable . It did the same for office conversation . We have a loud talker in the group . I can still make out every word but it makes things better.They are a good deal for the price but do n't eliminate noise .
 I know that plastic earmuffs are big , but WOW ! these practically double the width of my head ! I originally bought them because I wanted to wear them on the subway over my ear buds , so that way I would n't hear the subway noise and would n't need to turn my music volume up as loud . Nope . Not only did I look absolutely rediculous wearing these , I could still hear a lot of things on the subway . Yes everything was much duller to hear , but the fact that for the size , they could n't block out even conversations being had near me makes this not worth the money . Now they 're hanging up in storage . However I 'm sure they 'll work just fine for a more practical use , such as protecting your ears on a construction site .
 The product description is total deception . Noise cancellation requires an electronic or mechanical negative feedback system , which these earmuffs do not have . These are nothing more than noise reducing ear muffs .
 Honestly , I do n't know jack about hearing protectors , so I 'm not going to say whether this is a good product or not , HOWEVER , what I do know is that they did a horrible job of insuring it arrived safely . This product was shipped to me in the original flimsy box and nothing else . The box was not placed inside a sturdy shipping box , nor was there any bubble wrap , packing peanuts , styrofoam , or any other protective packaging to minimalize the possiblity of recieving a broken product . The box I received was torn and in terrible shape . I sent it right back to them just the way it was sent to me . The postman looked at me funny . . Like I care .
 The huge number of positive reviews of this product convinced me to buy these , but I returned them because they 're extremely uncomfortable and they do n't block sound very well . They are heavy and the band presses the top of your head so hard that my head hurt in that spot for hours after I had them on and I was only just trying them on for a couple of minutes . I adjusted them but to no improvement.For all this discomfort they do n't even block much sound . I turned the TV volume up and then put them on and I could still hear the TV sound pretty clearly -LRB- and I have an older TV , not a fancy new surround sound system -RRB- . I was tricked by the hundreds of rave reviews -- my time was wasted buying these .
 When I received this package , the prodct is broken and dirty , and it looks like a used product.The earmuff is too tight to wear for a long time .
 i was going to buy it but it says : California Proposition 65Attention California Residents : California 's Proposition 65 entitles California consumers to special warnings for products that contain chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm if those products expose consumers to such chemicals above certain threshold levels . We care about our customers ' safety and hope that the information below helps with your buying decisions.The general Proposition 65 notice is as follows : WARNING
 The hearing protector itself does work very well . The issuethat I do have is that the item description when I ordered thethe earmuff protectors does not match what I received . Do n't knowif this is a problem with the company selling the item listing itincorrectly or whether it was a problem with the Amazon web pagepointing to another item . At any rate what I ordered is not whatI recieved . The item I ordered listed earmuffs which were alsoheadphones with a radio and the ability to connect an externalsource to the headphones . What I received was simply hearing protection . This is NOT WHAT I WANTED . I would have been happyto pay more for what I wanted , just as long as I received whatI ordered . My concern was not the price , it was the function .
 It can block noises , but it is heavy . You can not expect to fall asleep with wearing it .
 This headset does not fit a larger head and has poor ventilation.I dropped them to the ground and they fell apart , not good for a product supposed to be of good quality.When working outdoors with noisy equipment you expect a product like this to be able to endure tough treatment.This headset clerly does not live up to the simplest standard .
 One of the reviewers said these were effective at blocking out annoying office noise , or neighborhood noise . Not true . Even when you follow the instructions -LRB- i.e. , avoid glasses , hair , and anything intrusive under the padding -RRB- , they still let in noise . These are probably appropriate for machinery and sounds in a certain decibel range , but not for reducing office or noisy neighbor noise .
 These work to block out sound , but they 're incredible uncomfortable to wear . I suppose for a small man , a woman , or a child , they may work , but a normal adult male , say anything around 6 feet or bigger , I 'd stay away . They barely clear the crown of my head , and end up crushing my normal sized ears . Making them uncomfortable to wear for long periods , which kinda defeats the point.The ear pieces need to be about half an inch bigger , and the top strap needs to be adjustible . Cheap headphones from a 1980s walkman had adjustable straps , this does n't ?
 I could tell that they would be great in the range , yet I never made it with them . As soon as I wore them around the house to get adjusted to them ; I came down with a headache and nauseous feeling . It squeezed my head so much that it would be unsafe for me to use at a shooting range . I returned them since they would not be useful to me . Not to mention , they are huge ! I am looking for an alternative earmuff , so right now I will be sticking with my Radians Remington earmuffsRadians Remington Womens Eye and Ear Protection Combo Packsince they are at least more comfortable wearing at the range .
 These headphones are heavy and non adjustable so the band at times can put pressure on your head and cause headaches . I can not use mine for long periods of time because of this pressure / headache issue . I suggest getting a different pair with an adjustable band . I favor -LRB- and consistently use -RRB- the AO Safety `` Economy '' or sometimes called `` Basic '' earmuff for its adjustable headband . This other style can be purchased on Amazon or at local hardware stores .
 Purchased for purpose of ELIMINATING low frequency sound pressure/vibration from apartment neighbors , i.e. as in improving reading/relaxing environment . Hoped that product would create vacuum seal about the ears . Sound is reduced , but disappointed that I can still hear low freq vibration/sounds ; in fact while wearing the product , low-freq sound vibrations seem to be clarified/intensified . Do n't doubt product claims to protect ears from LOUD volume sounds , but that was not my main goal . The product presses on nerves of face , and around ear , so wearing time is limited , as soreness results after about 45 minutes .
 I bought this product because I sometimes want to concentrate on my work in the lab but there are other people chatting loud . However I found this earmuff not an idea product for this purpose . I guess it works to filter out most of the high frequency noises -LRB- background noises from cars , machines and other things -RRB- but did n't do well in the range of human talking -- it only decreases the volumn . Effectively this is making the human voice even more obvious since now the background sound is lowered . It may still be good if you want to filter out machine noise in working conditions , which I did n't test .
 This does not easily adjust to an adult size head , maybe you could wrestle it into something that feels comfortable but I did n't want to bend it out of shape . The earmuff itself is too small for my ear or something , not comfortable . I was disappointed in the quality of sound filter . I can clearly hear everything people are saying to me in low/normal voices with only a slight muffle - almost could hold my hand over my ears for the same effect . My husbands head is even bigger than mine , not even gon na try that . Returned them all . Price was good and shipping was good too . Too bad .
 You ca n't tell from the photos because there 's no other object to give perspective , but these things are HUGE . Especially in the width of the ear cups . I mean , these things extending out more than you would ever imagine . It draws attention as if you have antlers . But even if I was n't concerned about appearance , I would not wear them because they are so width that they become a safety hazard by catching on nearby objects . Also heavier than I would like . I ca n't see these being practical in any situation . Get the yellow ones instead .
 BUYER BEWARE !!! I never received half of my order , and my entire order were gifts for people , and the half that I did receive took over 2 weeks to arrive . I had to call the seller several times . The 1st time they said they were reshipping it , but again it never appeared . The 2nd time , I was asked to leave my phone # & then was never called back ! I was finally sent an email stating a refund was to be given , but I was never called back & explained why . This has taken well over a month , which is totally ridiculous in my book !!! These people are awful !!!
 Do n't bother . The ScubaPro version is a rip off.You can buy this : `` Adapter USB 2.0 to IrDA - Windows 7 , MAC OSX Compatible MOSCHIP 7780 '' through Amazon , and it works as well as the above , for only $ 23.95 Works with my Intel-based MacBook Pro and Windows 7 .
 Weider products in general are good products . The basic ` you get what you pay for ' . So when I ordered the EZ Spin-Lock Tricep Bar I expected fair quality . Instead the tricep bar I received had an end bar welded on crooked , and an overall spotty chrome finish . Welds were sharp to the touch . Due to poor quality and construction , the product was returned to Amazon . On Amazon 's part , their service was the best !
 although reasonably priced , these tubes last a day or a few days and then get holes in them . i 've already patched the same tube twice , so if you order them , get a patch kit with them
 This visor is square in shape instead of oval , I have never seen a square visor before . It looks very strange . Also , it is not comfortable as it is supposed to be , it is uncomfortable at the location where the sides hug to my head . I will not be wearing mine .
 This visor is unbelievably bad . Most visors are actually curved to fit around your forehead and have soft terry cloth against your skin . Not this visor . This visor has the thin nylon fabric that covers the brim against your forehead , and under that , right in the middle of your forehead , is a raised hard block about 2 '' long by 1 '' high -LRB- with no curve what-so-ever to this 2 '' block -RRB- which is positioned and pushed right into the middle of your forehead . I have no idea what the purpose or reason for this block of hard plastic is . You really have to see it to believe it . It is absolutely the most uncomfortable visor , hat or other item that I have ever worn on my head . It is a total waste of money . How they can possibly call this a `` no headache '' visor is totally beyond me . It gives me an instant headache and is way more uncomfortable than the cheap visors from Target or Walmart that often feel too tight and uncomfortable after an hour or so . I ca n't wear this for more than 15 minutes without being in real , actual pain . It even leaves a clearly visible red indentation in the middle of my forehead . I would return this instantly if I bought it from a store . But having to pay for the shipping both ways makes it not worth returning . I 'm going to just through it in the trash . At least I got a few laughs when I showed it to friends on a recent cruise and let them try on my `` no headache '' visor . Would give it 0 stars if I could .
 The satiny fabric covering the visor is nice , but it is basically inexpensive plastic underneath and breaks easily . Additionally , under the fabric in the upper middle of the visor , there is a `` ledge '' of sorts , which leaves a very visible DENT in your forehead when you take the visor off . I do not recommend this product .
 It 's un comfortable and hurt my forehead . It 's stiff and unpleasant to wear . I would not buy it again . In fact , i had to buy another visor to repplace it .
 Bought a new one . It arrived falling apart at the seams and definitely causes headaches . Hurts to wear for more than 5 minutes .
 We bought one of these while staying at my in-laws for the holidays . The first night it was great . The second it would n't hold air , so we exchanged it and got a new one . This time it lasted a couple of nights -LRB- the rest of that stay -RRB- . We recently got it back out for another trip . We have to add air every night . It 's better than sleeping on the floor , but if you are sharing the bed be prepared to be rolling into each other by the time morning comes . Can not find a leak .
 Knowing Coleman products have usually always provided me with reliability and durability , I had no second thoughts about purchasing this mattress . The first time I used it , the mattress stayed inflated 95 % until the next morning with 2 mid-sized people sleeping on it for 8 hours.The second time I used it , I inflated it as usual and woke up 2 hours later with the mattress deflated 75 % . Our butts were laying on the floor of the tent and our bodies sagged to the middle of the mattress . There was no hole that we could find , and in order to send it back , I had to wrap it up in the box , find my receipt , and MAIL it to Coleman 's headquarters across the country . This 25 pound box cost a fortune to ship , and they also made me purchase insurance.This was my 3rd air mattress from Coleman 's that I have gone through . I thought the more expensive bed would last longer , but it did n't last as long as the $ 30 mattress that we used for camping last year.I am checking out the Intex Mattresses now that say they are the number one bestselling mattress on Amazon .
 We have owned this bed for a couple years now and used it probably a dozen times . It was great at first , we only had to put in a little air after overnight sleeping on it . But just recently the air mattress has leaked so much we are unable to use it anymore . This was our second coleman air mattress we have purchased . Very dissatisfied and will never buy another coleman air mattress . We were so excited when we found this air mattress because coleman said the air mattress was guaranteed not to leak . But we have learned otherwise .
 I was so excited to try this airbed on our camping trip . But ... it was a total disaster . Who ever designed this obviously did n't try sleeping on it . There are not enough separate cells in this mattress so it is one mass of air . Since my husband weighs more than me
 On June 7 , 2012 I ordered and received the Coleman Double-High Queen mattress . We had one for many years and were more than satisfied with its performance . We needed a new one and found it on this site . We did not unroll the mattress until we needed it while on vacation last week . It has a huge hole in the middle of the mattress ! I can not believe the poor , unacceptable quality control of the Coleman company ! This had to be inspected at some point ! To say that I am dissatisfied is putting it mildly ! I would NOT recommend this product to anyone !
 I had a Coleman air mattress that was 6 years old and never leaked . Since it was getting old , I decided to buy a new one . This one would not hold air no matter what . We used it for a week of camping and would fill it before going to bed . By the time we woke up it would have lost a significant amount of air . This happened every night . They sure do n't make them like they used to . I would not recommend this item to anyone .
 Never was able to sleep a full night on this mattress without having to reinflate . When coming home from a camping trip and unpacking , unfortunately , calling about the air mattress leak has never been the first thing on my mind , so now that I am finally thinking about it , the warranty period has passed . Would not recommend .
 Few things I have ever bought in all of my life proved to be as worthless as this . Previously bought Wal-Mart 's own brand air bed that cost half as much and lasted 8 years before ending up with some leaks . Thought I 'd replace it with this `` nice '' - double-the-cost - `` reputable '' branded Coleman . What a mistake . In less than 8 weeks - after only the second use - in the areas that one sees in the picture where the dips are contoured into the surface the seams manufactured there started to separate and the bed sprung leaks in two places . A comfortable bed initially - but when you wake up on the floor on deflated vinyl - and with a lot less cash in your pocket - you quickly learn the poor craftsmanship and manufacturing process of whomever makes this for Coleman . DO NOT BUY ! AVOID !
 Two brand new mattresses that did n't last four nights . First one completely deflated at the sheet clip . The second mattress was leaking slower , but unusable for even another full night . Best to use sheet suspenders instead as the clips really are n't strong enough for the intended purpose . Designing in too many features is the issue . The singular complaint about these mattresses is the loss of integrity , not that it needs sheet clips ! P.S. patching the sheet clip areas is just not doable .
 Ok , so I am a slow learner . We liked the idea of being up off of the ground , that was the selling point . We bought our third one of these recently , only to have it do the same thing the others did . Work great for the first night , deflate some the second night , more the third night , and you start to get the idea . Definately not leakproof . I was thinking this would be ok if the mattress were labeld disposable ... if that is the case , we need to make it a more `` disposable '' price .
 This is the SECOND Coleman bed I have purchased in just THREE MONTHS and just like the other one a few days AFTER the warranty expired it popped at the SEAM . I am NOT blaming AMAZON for this but I do blame the Coleman Company . Obviously they have found a way to dump DEFECTIVE merchandise on unsuspecting purchasers by going through a reputable company . I am so angry !!! Coleman Double-High Wrap 'N' Roll Quickbed , Queen
 I am very disappointed in this air mattress . I paid the extra cost in order to get a Coleman thinking I was buying quality ; however , I have had it three weeks now and am STILL having to reinflate every other day . I allowed for the `` stretching '' other customers have alluded to , but I have a long - term guest sleeping on it and think the stretching should be done by now ! I am going to return to Amazon , I believe ; but am caught between a rock and proverbial hard place -LRB- the floor ! Ha ha -RRB- because my guest is here for another six weeks .
 Be carefull today after 3 weeks of use i called coleman CUSTOMER CARE DEPARMENT for a replace or refund it TAKES 46 WEEKS , You have to send the valve , the bar code the receive and the label and WAIT FOR YOUR MONEY OR THE REPLACEMENT 46 WEEKS ONLY.This bed supose to be flat like all the beds but it turned like a ballon . It not funny you can not sleep at all .
 First , I must say that I purchased a Coleman Queen Double High Airbed that does n't have `` Wrap N Roll '' in the title . However , I believe it is exactly the same mattress , as it looks identical.The measurements on Amazon are incorrect . When I got the mattress the measurements were even less . A standard size Queen measures 80 `` L by 60 `` W . When I pumped it up , it looked great , but it also looked really small . I got out a `` full size '' fitted sheet and it fit perfectly ! So I got a tape measure and the mattress measured 75 `` L by 56 `` W. So , it is exactly the length of a full size mattress , which is 5 '' shorter than a Queen , and only 2 '' wider than a full size , making it 4 '' narrower than a Queen.Shame on you , Coleman . This is truly misrepresenting your mattress that has `` Queen '' in big letters . I realize the dimensions on Amazon were n't entered by Coleman , but the mattress is far smaller than a Queen . I 've purchased many Coleman products over the years , so my husband and I were quite surprised by this.I bought it from Walmart since the one I really wanted on Amazon had too late of a shipping date for our expected out-of-state company . They have a 15-day exchange policy -LRB- no refunds since people abuse it by buying one for a company and then return them -RRB- . So then I got a Ozark Trail Queen High Rise mattress . Love the size and the height , but it was the most uncomforable mattress ! The bumps -LRB- I guess they are suppose to be like coils -RRB- were hard . I had to double over a thick winter comfortable and put it under my mattress pad and sheet to soften the bumps . The built in `` pillow '' across the top was too high and hard . And worse , it would n't inflate properly . It sagged across the middle so it was like sleeping on a 40-year old mattress.So we took that one back . Since we still have an old Ozark Trail twin mattress that is very comfortable with the old tube-style rows , I looked for the same in a Queen size . It is small , of course , but very comfortable . Even our Grandson kept saying how `` awesome '' it is ! Well , Ozark Trail does have a Queen mattress that has the row style . Unfortunately we had to give up the idea of a double high which is extremely disappointing since we are young anymore and we give our bedroom to our company . Comfort is more important than height . The bonus is that it came with two detached pillows . We use those behind our backs when we go to our little auction on Saturday nights that has church pews for seats . The backs get very hard and uncomfortable , but these little pillows are very comfy behind the back . We are afraid to try sitting on them , though , since they are made for the weight of a head ... not a body.Hope my review helped you . By the way the Queen Size single-high Ozark Trail with the separate pillows comes in both the coil style and the tubes style , so you have to look carefully .
 I purchased two of these Coleman beds . Both failed after about 1 month of nightly use with only one person sleeping on the bed . I tried to patch the beds , but the patchs failed after a few days . Neither bed was abused in any way . In light of the first failure , I was especially careful with the second bed , but it failed the same way in about the same length of time as did the first bed . The seam split where the oval sections are attached to the top . All the air leaked out quickly . This product may work well for occasional use , but do not count on it as a replacement for a regular bed . I am going to switch to another brand , but which one should I choose ?
 Same experience as other reviewers , this thing is good while it lasts , but I can almost guarantee that it will start leaking on you and end up being unusable like mine now is.WASTE OF MONEY , DO NOT BUY .
 I bought this for a kid , the waist was fine in fitting . While trying it on the boy found that his legs began to feel discomfort and his blood circulation felt cut off . VERY BAD SELECTION ... SIZES ARE NOT THE BEST FOR TALL KIDS !
 The main objection I have with these is that the spining `` locks '' do n't lock . As I use the weights they tend to come lose . It 's not terrible , becausethey have to spin around about 5 or 10 times before they fall off , but it 's unsettling to have to check the weights after each use , so I ended up using spring locks in addition to the spin locks , which seems like overkill , but it works . Also , some of the spring locks are a tight fit around the threaded bar . Worth buying if you really need to save some cash , but I recommend spending a bit more and getting the traditional .
 When I bought this product , it was suppose to be BRAND NEW . I got a USED product , sealed in a crappy package that was pre-opened before me . I 'm sorry , did I NOT pay for a brand new product ? To further assist my statement , one of dumbbell closers was messed up so it would n't go all the way in . When I looked inside of it , it was a messed up , scratched , and in a really bad shape . THIS IS A NEW PRODUCT?You deserve one star . The worst thing I 've bought on Amazon , and it surely not Amazon ... whomever I bought this from know who they are . I 'll never do business with them ... ever .
 I purchased this for our blue road trip grill . It took a while but I finally got it to fit in the case . The first time I fastened the straps one pulled out of the seam . The grill was such a tight fit that I did n't think it would matter if it was not fastened . The first time we took our grill in the case tailgating the zipper started pulling out of the seam . I emailed Coleman but got no response . It 's a great idea -- too bad it is so poorly made . I feel like I wasted $ 46.00 .
 The case is too short in width to easily fit the grill . It is very tight and you have to work the grill down into the case slowly at each end . It will not rest at the bottom of the case but gets stuck halfway down so the cover is difficult to zip closed . We really need this case to work as we only use the grill away from home and transport it often . I assume there is no other alternative so we are using it the best we can . They should redesign it to fit properly .
 Unfortunately I did not understand the description to say that this unit does not fit the PRO SS . Otherwise a good idea .
 To small for red road trip . zipper seam ripped open first time I used it .
 The item was sent to me without instructions . Without instructions it was not easy to figure out where to store the separate grill parts and burners . I had to guess . This led to placing the grill on the wrong spot creating a big dent on the red top of the grill . The new grill now looks old and dented from the damage .
 There is nothing wrong with this item quality wise it just does not fit my Weber BBQ . I may very well fit if I just had the BBQ and no base . But I think almost all of these cookers are sold with the retractable legs , and this case will absolutely not fit if you have those . I think the same thing happened to the buyers that previously got my case as the box it came in was taped up so it was obviously sold before . I thought about taking off the base , but that is not a simple job and completely unpractical to take off the base , store , put base back on when you use it.If you only have the top part this case will be fine .
 I have the Blue Road trip grill , it was given as a birthday gift 4 years ago . I purchased this rolling bag right away to store and transport the grill . After about 2 years the handles on both ends broke off which made it difficult to pull around . I got a new rolling bag for Christmas and no matter what I did , it would n't fit . I was disappointed . I ended up taking my old one to a luggage repair shop and had handles sewn on . Amazon made it right when I returned it and shipped it fast when I bought it . Coleman is the issue and their lack of quality control .
 I purchased the Gill on a camping trip and ordered the wheeled case after we returned in June . This has now only gone on two other camping trips and the seam on the side by the handle has ripped wide open . I would have hoped that for nearly $ 50 this product would have been of the same quality that I have come to expect in Coleman products . to say the least I am profoundly disappointed with this product 's performance .
 I found this wheeled carrying case to be useless for our Coleman Road Trip Grill . We purchased a new Coleman Road Trip Grill , Model No. 9941A -LRB- the Blue one -RRB- in July . Although the ads say that this carrying case with wheels works on all Coleman Road Trip Grill models , this is simply not true . We could not get the grill to fit in the case with the stand , let alone the two side tables and the tank . This carrying case must only fit the older grills that are red in color and have the older fold-up stand . Coleman was not helpful at all and it took two emails and several weeks before they even acknowledged my questions and concerns . I returned the carrying case as it is of no use to us if we ca n't get the grill in it . Do n't waste your time if you have purchased the blue grill and think it will fit in this case .
 I 'm sure this is a great cover , however the description says the case fits ALL Coleman RoadTrip grills . This is not true ... it DOES NOT fit the RoadTrip Pro SS grill model number 9928 .
 really ... . grill wont fit with the handle on it . Poor design ... . would n't have taken much more thought or design to make it really nice . Disappointed !!!
 This product was very mis-leading !! It says it fits the Road Trip Grill LXE , But in fact it does n't . Unless you take the wheels off , which is a pain in theA $ $ . Not a good product ! Very dissappointed .
 I purchased this bag and was very impressed . The grill fit nicely and all the pockets through out the bag i though was really cool . . First time i took this bag out it worked out fine . . at home i notice the wheels broke off from the bag . I talked to serval people and they have had the same problem . . SO IF YOU BUY REMEMBER THE WHEELS WILL BRAKE OFF
 We are disappointed in the carry case that we ordered for the grill . When we opened the package , it smelled as if it were drenched in gasoline . We tried putting it on over the grill , but it was not easy or a good fit . Seems like it would be more of hassle to use than not use it . We will be returning the carry case .
 The case it great , but it does not fit the Coleman Road Trip grill we have , handle sticks out the top and it is unable to zip . Very disappointed in Coleman and it 's misleading advertisement for this case . Love the grill however ! Next time , make the grill lock shut so you can roll it without the grates falling off , and make a case to fit it !
 I am not impressed with this product . You must remove the handle of the BBQ or it wo n't fit into the cover . The tie down strap ripped apart on the first time I put the BBQ in the carrier . I would n't purchase this item again .
 The description clearly states that it fits all Coleman Road Trip grills . This is not the case as it was about 6 inches too short for mine . The good thing is that they paid for the return postage and issued a complete refund .
 It does not fit the Coleman grill with the wheels and handle . You would need to remove wheels and handle in order to use . We returned this item .
 In order to use the case , you have to remove the stand and wheels from the grille . What good is that ? How do you store the base and wheels ?
 I bought my husband the blue road trip grill , and according to the product description , this case would fit it . Not the case . Too small , can not zip up all the way.Very dissapointed , sent back !
 I like the cover with its inside pockets and the velcro straps and wheels . However , it does not fit all the grills as the description says . The handle sticks out of the case if you have a Road Trip LXE -LRB- red grill -RRB- so you can not zip it up all the way . I kept the case because it does protect it better than nothing and it does give us a way to store the extra grills , etc. .
 The case is nice , but for the life of me , I ca n't understand why they would design it specifically for the Coleman roadtrip grill and then not allow enough space to zip it up with the grill handle attached . I like the protection it provides when stored in the RV , but I would think twice if I had it to do over again .
 Had a big problem with this item.Housing was circular twist , same as most inexpensive brake housing , which would over flex when attempting to shift.Had to have a bike shop install proper cable housing so I could shift gears correctly.I would not recommend this product .
 I saw that other people really liked these sleeping bags for car camping , which my boyfriend and I intend to do . However , each one of these sleeping bags is massive ! We both fit in just one of them and they weighed -LRB- and took up -RRB- a ton of room ! I would not recommend these even for car campers .
 I ordered this sleeping bag to use during Christmas holiday . When I received it , there is a defective on sewing . Internal insulation material came out and I could see white insulation material between the seams -LRB- or joint -RRB- because of bad sewing . So , I I returned it at once .
 I heard about the Coleman Big Game sleeping bag when planning our car camping trip to Montana and Wyoming , and wanted one to work with a Coleman that served us well . Our colossal is rated 20 degrees -LRB- 5 pounds of hollow - core insulation -RRB- but really does not work with very cold nights at those altitudes . Actually , we had trouble sleeping on a camping trip to Bryce Canyon National Park in April during a snowstorm and night temperatures dropped to 18 degrees . My service dog wanted to join me in my sleeping bag despite his own , another 4 pounder Kelty.So I went to a number of e-commerce providers , comparing offerings . I placed my order after finding Amazon had three Big Game sleeping bags in stock for immediate delivery . That afternoon I received confirmation , but noting there would be a week-long delay before shipping . But , I could pay extra and receive two-day shipping ; they would find one of the bags and ship it out immediately.So much for free shipping that comes with a large purchase you make at Amazon!The alternative was to use one of Amazon 's partners , sponsored links like Meijer , Campersland , Campmor or Sunny Sports , because they do ship within a day upon receipt of an order . But with Amazon if you opt to use their Super Saver it will take over a week before they will even process it , and then you wait until it gets through the UPS system . And Amazon will `` lock in '' your order upon their receipt of it and only allow a `` customer '' to pay more - rather than cancel.So after waiting for over a week for the order to be processed -LRB- they notified me it was shipped exactly one hour after the seven days wait was up -RRB- I will make sure that it is the last order that will be placed with these marketing geniuses at Amazon.I really wanted the sleeping bag because the weather up north , with Spring waiting until July , can be a little cold in a tent . But the Big Game was a disappointment upon arrival . First , it is not 40 '' x 84 '' as claimed ; it is actually 38 '' by 81 + . '' Maybe that is n't significant , but I paid for the larger sleeping bag - for my dog and self . Yes , it is a big bag in any event , it just is not as advertised!The so-called flannel liner is the interior lining of the bag and it can not be removed between camping trips for laundering , as some other Coleman bags I have . It creates a problem because we camp out for three or four weeks at a time , three times a year , visiting national parks , monuments and forests in the Rocky Mountain area . This means that you must find a commercial laundry to keep the sleeping bag clean from the oily skin buildup - unlike many others in this price range . And it is just too darned big for even new front loading machines.Their suggestion
 This visor is square in shape instead of oval , I have never seen a square visor before . It looks very strange . Also , it is not comfortable as it is supposed to be , it is uncomfortable at the location where the sides hug to my head . I will not be wearing mine .
 This visor is unbelievably bad . Most visors are actually curved to fit around your forehead and have soft terry cloth against your skin . Not this visor . This visor has the thin nylon fabric that covers the brim against your forehead , and under that , right in the middle of your forehead , is a raised hard block about 2 '' long by 1 '' high -LRB- with no curve what-so-ever to this 2 '' block -RRB- which is positioned and pushed right into the middle of your forehead . I have no idea what the purpose or reason for this block of hard plastic is . You really have to see it to believe it . It is absolutely the most uncomfortable visor , hat or other item that I have ever worn on my head . It is a total waste of money . How they can possibly call this a `` no headache '' visor is totally beyond me . It gives me an instant headache and is way more uncomfortable than the cheap visors from Target or Walmart that often feel too tight and uncomfortable after an hour or so . I ca n't wear this for more than 15 minutes without being in real , actual pain . It even leaves a clearly visible red indentation in the middle of my forehead . I would return this instantly if I bought it from a store . But having to pay for the shipping both ways makes it not worth returning . I 'm going to just through it in the trash . At least I got a few laughs when I showed it to friends on a recent cruise and let them try on my `` no headache '' visor . Would give it 0 stars if I could .
 The satiny fabric covering the visor is nice , but it is basically inexpensive plastic underneath and breaks easily . Additionally , under the fabric in the upper middle of the visor , there is a `` ledge '' of sorts , which leaves a very visible DENT in your forehead when you take the visor off . I do not recommend this product .
 It 's un comfortable and hurt my forehead . It 's stiff and unpleasant to wear . I would not buy it again . In fact , i had to buy another visor to repplace it .
 Bought a new one . It arrived falling apart at the seams and definitely causes headaches . Hurts to wear for more than 5 minutes .

 I bought this thinking that my Rossi M92 was considered a type of long gun with a 24 inch barrel ... I was wrong . It did not work at all . I had to file the opening wider to get it to fit on the hammer . After I got it to fit it was so bulky the slide could n't go all the way back when working the lever . Tried turning it upside down but then it prevented the hammer from moving all the way back so it would n't cock . This is for SINGLE SHOT RIFLES ONLY !! I ended up putting on my Iver Johnson 410 single shot and it works great there .

 These weights are definitely made for men -LRB- I hope that there are n't any women with ankles bigger than mine !! -RRB- . I know that I am of slender build , but these weights wrap all the way around until the spiky Velcro attaches itself to the `` wet suit '' material . This makes the soft Velcro part useless . So unless you have ankles that are the size of a large horse I would look elsewhere . Although with them strapped up tight they do their job !
 I bought this for a kid , the waist was fine in fitting . While trying it on the boy found that his legs began to feel discomfort and his blood circulation felt cut off . VERY BAD SELECTION ... SIZES ARE NOT THE BEST FOR TALL KIDS !
 I 'm EXTREMLY disappointed with this ` skirt ' ! It is listed as a chiffon skirt , but it 's nothing but cheap nylon and spandex ! The quality is so poor ! How can a seller label their product completely inaccurately !? Do not order this skirt if you 're looking for a quality product !
 never will i substitute any gear for the best . I should of bought the hogue grips . which i wound up doing . the grips are not hogue and i will never settle for anything else . EVEN IF I MUST WAIT FOR A MONTH
 It 's a decent box to carry shells to the range , but I was definitely disappointed when I received it . - The picture is a bit deceiving ; it looks like this comes with some kind of trays for the shells . Upon receipt , and zooming in on the pics to compare , it does not . You just drop the shell boxes into this carrier like any other box out there . This brings me to my next point ... - It does n't hold 12-ga or 20-gas shells tightly in their boxes . The boxes bump around a little loosely in the box . Not horribly so , but I had thought something specifically designed to hold boxes of shells like this would fit them snugly , but this does not . - The latch is definitely cheap . It 's just a plastic flap . - There is no seal on it at all , so it can not be used as a dry box , and I would not take it hunting for waterfowl.For taking shells to the range , I think a fishing tackle box would work just as well , it would have more compartments , a better handle , and might have a little better quality construction.For taking ammo anywhere other than the range -LRB- hunting , travel -RRB- , I ca n't recommend this due to its questionable construction and lack of a seal . For this price you can buy a mil-surp or other high quality dry box instead .
 At three times the cheap air mattress at Wal Mart I expect this to be 3 times better . Instead it 's 3 times worse . The coleman has an old school valve , the wal mart brand has a two way valve so you can open it up and air it up without worry of losing air . For me the Wal Mart brand is still going strong , the coleman has already sprung a leak and has to be aired up every 2 hours . Save your money and just buy the Wal Mart brand .
 This mattress held air the first 2 times used - then started using air until after the sixth use held no air at all . I am returning it to Coleman .
 Leaked the first time I used it . Contacted Coleman to return but postage would cost 50 % of my purchased price . Decided not to waste more money on poor quality .
 Its fine , however , it did not have the ` Wrap 'n' Roll ' storage bag it boasts about so I 'm returning it .
 I purchased this air mattress thinking the Coleman label would be very reliable . Mattress was comfortable and easy to inflate using the Coleman pump . However , this `` guaranteed not to leak '' mattress deflated after one week of daily use . I kept refilling with air to no avail . I could n't tell where it was leaking air since I did n't hear air leaking from the `` air tight '' valve or the mattress . But it leaked down to a sixth of its size overnight . I will purchase a brand other than Coleman .
 I bought two Coleman Twin Quikbed air mattresses last summer . They are used primarily for sleepovers by my daughter and her friends . She is 14 , and knows not to jump on or otherwise traumatize the air mattresses because they are so expensive . We always use them on a carpeted floor and they are not up against the wall or anything else that might cause damage.They held up very well until recently , when each mattress developed a hole on the seam that surrounds the sheet clip -LRB- which we have never used -RRB- . Both mattresses failed within one use of each other . I do think this is a product design flaw . I could patch the holes , but feel strongly that another hole will develop on one of the other sheet clip seams in the near future.I know that the life of any air mattress is limited , but the fact that they both failed in the same way after almost exactly the same amount of use is suspicious to me . If you purchase this mattress , be sure to save your receipt so you have a shot at getting a refund/replacement from the Coleman website .
 It is very comfortable but I camp about once a month and get a new one in the spring and by about the november campout i usually wake up in the mornings on the ground because it loses all of its air . I dont know why , but they never last more than a year and I am not rough on them or anything . Very disappointed .
 I bought this mattress based on the brand name Coleman . But this mattress is worst than Intex brand . The Intex mattress atleast lasted more than 8 months . This mattress lasted less than 2 months . Now a big air leak has developed . Ca n't even hold air for more than an hour . I would like to give 0 stars but gave 2 stars for Amazon customer service . Amazon gave quick replacement even if it was out of the 30 day window . I wish all companies were customer centric like Amazon .
 Good points : * When it holds air , it 's a comfortable mattress to sleep on.Bad points : * Filling it without a pump is suitable only for fans of hyperventilation . * It began losing air after a few nights of sleeping on it , and within a couple of weeks it was unusable . I got a warranty replacement from the store , and that one lasted several months of daily use before failing the same way.Conclusion : Like I said , save the receipt . You may get a good one , and it 'll last for months of daily use , or a near-lifetime of camping . Or it could spring a leak after just a few nights . If you 're going camping far from the big box stores , buy something more robust , or bring a spare . Or find a way to patch them .
 This air bed leaked right out of the box and I ca n't find the leak . So , now I am stuck with it and the pump . Some stores will not do a refund if the box has been opened . How do you know if it leaks ? I will never buy another Coleman product because of this . Keep up the good work China .
 I bought the double Quickbed and the inflator . First time out , tent camping , the mattress was punctured and I ended up using it as a ground cloth . No it was n't on the `` ground '' , it was on the ground pad of a North Face Expedition Series tent that was in turn on a tarp.What a disappointment . How could I recommend it ?
 Buyer beware ! I purchased two of these Quickbeds , twin size , to replace one that the valve had torn out . These are more convenient to roll up and store than the prior ones that fold up because of the roll up package so they help break camp quickly . They blow up quickly too , with the proper pump.One of the two developed a leak along the seams after no more than about 10 uses which would be typical of a couple of camping seasons for us . It would not hold air for more than about 2 hours near the end of it 's life . This is definitely a manufacturing defect . 10 uses puts the age at about two years after purchase.Coleman customer service would not replace the bed because of the age in spite of their `` No Leak '' guarantee . So the take away here is
 These mattresses may be great for a week long camping trip but they do n't last longer than a week or two . We bought one for my step daughter when she visited us and the first one sprung a leak after 3 nights . Than we replaced it with another one which lasted about two weeks.Not worth the hassle and do n't even bother trying to patch one of these things if it starts leaking .
 I had a twin size colman mattress prior to this one that was amazing ... took it to India twice , Cambodia , Thailand , and Laos , chucked it around inside my luggage and finally after 3 1/2 years of solid use it started to leak -LRB- slow leak -RRB- . So naturally I did n't hesitate to buy another . Right away I noticed a difference . I blew this mattress up . It is an inch lower than the other -- potential not an issue and I was willing to fogive that since the weight of my former matress was the only downfall . But the rubber was of cheaper quality -- it was n't as malluable . It was clearly more stiff around the air-pockets ... still I was willing to work with it since I LOVED my last one . I took it to a friends house and used it on top of the bed they offered and after one night it seemed as though the air had let out some . The next time I took it to another friends -- again on top of the friendly surface of a hard bed , again the air was not staying in it ! The other mattress I had I could sleep on it for weeks without needing to put air in it.The other thing I noticed with both mattresses is that they are not good conduits of heat -- they really suck up the cold air or ground . I always have a liner between me and the mattress so I do n't freeze if I am any place where the temperature drops below 68 degrees.Coleman does offer replacements -LRB- cut out the valve , receipt and coleman name on side of mattress -RRB- but if the replacement is exactly the same , I would take it back to the store if that is an option and find another Coleman twin that is at least 6 inches thick . This one here is 5 inches -- seam to seam . Very dissapointed . Given the fact you can get a MUCH better twin coleman mattress for maybe $ 15 more that will last a long time , this one is NOT worth your money . I only wish I could find the leak in my old one so I could patch it up and use it for another 3 years rather than the 3 WEEKS this one last me .
 Coleman used to make decent mattresses . The first one I bought lasted me about three years of fairly frequent use . However , in the last couple of years I 've had no less than 8 of these mattresses go bad in less than a month . One of those lasted exactly 3 days . The only reason I keep getting them is due to the generous return policy of certain merchants , and the personal satisfaction I get from making a company such as Coleman take a loss on the returns for a poor quality product that should n't be on the market in the first place . . I 've determined that the problem is poor quality of the seal around the inflation area . Do doubt that they cut down on the amount of sealant applied to save a few cents per unit . You can fix it with a whole lot of duct tape , but that means you have to pull off the duct tape to reinflate the mattress 1-2 times a weeks , and plaster over the hole with a lot duct tape again . You should n't have to do this.Note to Coleman
 After 15 days it started leaking completely in a one night . I have to get it replaced .
 have big hands , but found this knife too bulky and heavy for pocket carry.plus all the S&W ; knifes have jumped in price no longer making them the deal they once were .
 I like this product , but , I 'm looking for a replacement.To order 2 units , the cheapest shipping is $ 15.00 .
 Upon getting her first pepper spray canister my friend was wondering about the effectiveness of the spray she asked if she could try it on me which she did . It took her 3 tries to get around the childproof trigger then after spraying it took 45 seconds for the spray to take effect . With her standing 10 feet away the spray hit her too causing her to cough and dry heave . As to the effectiveness the device caused partial-thickness chemical burns across my face and eyes . It was partially incapacitating but if I had the drive it would not have dropped me . I reccomend getting a stun gun if you actually want to get away from an attacker . This is best used for stopping a gunman when you have no other option .
 I like the design because it is easy to carry and easy to use . Unfortunately , that is not what matters . I run on back roads where every so often dogs like to chase . I was bitten once and swore it would n't happen again . This dog was part of a pack of three -LRB- I never see the owners despite all the barking -RRB- . The next time they came after me I was ready . When they were about 4 feet away I sprayed but the cloud did n't make it to them . I sprayed again and I think the wind caught the cloud because one dog looked surprised . Apparently not surprised enough because they came after me again the next day with the same results . The next time they came after me I tried to spray them but the device did n't work . I got home , opened it up , canister worked , but the mechanism that makes the canister spray was broken . A cheap little plastic part . So , if you think you are safe carrying this thing , think again .
 The damn thing kept popping off at the keyring and falling off . One day , it just popped off and I did n't notice for several hours . Such a waste of money .
 Pros * Excellent Design * Fumble free use * Small and compact * No leather pouches to openCons * Made from cheap plastic * Awful customer service * Fell apart when I tried to use itI unfortunately had to use the spitfire , and I pulled it off the keychain -LRB- a feature of this device -RRB- , and the thing fell apart in my hands . Luckily the threat was averted and it was not needed , but this is not what you want to worry about when your life is on the line.I would not purchase this item . Hopefully they read this review and make it with a strong ABS plastic and stronger fastening , because they sure did n't respond to my emails.Shame really , I truly wanted to believe in this product . Unfortunately , it failed me .
 I was sitting on my friends back porch in Costa Rica having some beers and some laughs with one of these lit not 2 feet from me . I got DESTROYED by mosquitos . Cool idea , does n't work .
 Just bought it today and after about 2 hours of play , the grip is starting to tear . STAY AWAY is the best advice I can give .
 It 's a pain to have to finish someone elses job . I now have to go get hardware so I can use . This on top of the double ship on my last order has been the breaking point .
 Item was extremely difficult to fold properly and one leg of decoy was missing fitted material in which to put hard support for attachment into ground .
 These grips are too thick and pump up my hands which makes them uncomfortable . I will be removing them asap and replacing with regular rubber hand grips .
 The product packaging indicates `` WARNING
 I bought this because I thought after several years my old foam grips must have given out since I have such a problem with wrist pain and numbness when I commute home on my bike . But these did n't help any and were no improvement over my 10 year old grips .
 This watch is pretty , well made , heavy and HUGE . I bought it for my wife , who is 5 ' 10 '' , and it looks like some kind of novelty gag on her wrist . It 's more cumbersome to wear than any watch I own , and I 'm not a small guy . Sorry Nike , but a pair of wrist weights would be a more appropriate athletic accessory .
 I love the saints , but this phone holder is very brittle around the clip . mine broke in pieces under the slightest pressure .
 So I bought this flag with the suggested 2 additional items bundled together for one EASY transaction . I have no beef the the quality of each of the individual items
 Have went through several pairs and Lycra does n't last long . Less than 4 months . Too bad that they ca n't come up with something that you get your moneys worth ... Bought my last pair ...
 What should have been $ 2 or less to ship cost me $ 31 to ship . Item cost less than $ 1 to purchase .
 I bought this product to get rid of black ants in my house . It did not help at all . I even tried mixing it with sugar and placing it where the ants used to go , well they just do n't go anywhere close to it , it really looks like it repels the ants , instead of attracting them . I have not found yet a product that work for my ants , except the spray that kills them instantly -LRB- but I can not spray it in the kitchen , and I have ants all around the counter top , even if it is cleaned to perfection -RRB- .
 Although the item is labeled as being a 12 pack they screw you over , send one , and tell you after the fact.I have filed a claim with the company . More information forthcoming .
 Much better versions out there , and it is always better to pay a little more and get the good one , then conserve , for a disposable model
 The shirt did not fit well . It was too loose . I ordered a medium which is what I normally wear but this shirt was closer to fitting like a large . Also the material was flimsy so it stretched out of shape easily . I would caution any would-be buyers to think twice about buying this product - you get what you pay for !
 Buyer beware -- this shirt is cut extremely small . I wear a medium in every other kind of shirt -LRB- including a terrific Jerzees tagless , which I ca n't find anywhere now -RRB- , so I ordered this brand based on other buyer reviews.Big mistake . These shirts run extremely small and the tails are very short , so they already look like they 've shrunk before you wear them the first time . The fabric is also fairly lightweight , so no doubt they do n't hold up to many washings.Based on my own experience , I ca n't recommend this shirt for anyone except very small teens . I 've sent mine back for a refund .
 THIS SHIRT IS JUST FINE IF YOU ARE NOT TALL AND ORDER ATLEAST ONE SIZE LARGER THAN WHAT YOU WEAR . THE COLOR IS GOOD AND MATERIALS ARE GOOD . BUT IT IS NOT WHAT IS ADVERTISED ON THE SITE . XXLT = XL REG
 These tank tops are not worth the money !! I have bought this brand in the past on three different occasions and it seems that each time I 've bought them for my husband , they are made worse . They are nearly see-through , the material is very rough to the skin and they lose their shape quickly . I will never buy this brand again . I do n't understand how they can even advertise &#34; heavyweight &#34; when that is not even close to the material these are . I purchased in three different colors and each of them are poorly made , with the white being the most see-through and the worst made . DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BRAND !!!
 Not heavyweight , not true to size -LRB- shrinks a whole size or more -RRB- and too short after washing . I wash my clothes in cold water and dry on low . It would have been nice to know that this shirt would shrink this much . It is definitely NOT heavyweight . More like medium weight . Hugo Boss `` A '' shirts are a much better shirt and value . I would order the next size up for any t shirts made of 100 % cotton .
 I purchased the Anvil tank tops because the previous reviews indicated that the length was short . Those who complained about the length apparently influenced the company to modify the tank tops . Now they are almost down to your knees . And to cut costs for the added length , the quality of the shirts are poor . They need to change their ad to read summer weight tank tops .
 if they 'd have been proud enough of their pedals to publish their weight , I 'd have NEVER bought them . Who needs 20 pound pedals on a bike you paid dearly for to keep it light weight ??? Sold them on Craigslist right after I opened the box .
 I purchased this item with the only hope that it would help remove bullet lube from the chamber . Unfortunately it does no better removing bullet lube than a boresnake . I may have to bite the bullet and purchase aWilson 1911 45 CAL CHAMBER CLEANING TOOL -LRB- 42445 -RRB- .
 the basket that was shipped to me is totally different from this basket . the basket itself is plain pink with a sticker that says barbie . the strap is not even similar to this one - the one we recieved has two straps that are more like ties . our basket is okay but i only downgraded this item but i was looking forward to a basket that looks like this .
 I 'm not doubting that this is a good product but my horse wo n't touch these things with a ten foot pole . Even if I crumble them into apple sauce he wo n't eat it . I thought I 'd try them because in the summer my horse is mainly on pasture with no grain and I did n't want to have to mix different supplements each day . Could be just my horse ... but he REALLY likes applesauce and it surprised me that he still would n't eat the crumbled wafer . The wafers are a great concept ... just not for my horse!Majesty 's Flex Wafers Joint therapy for horses 60 count bag
 I would not recommend buying this bicycle for everyday use . The components are very cheap and the bicycle is too heavy to lug around every day . The brake pads wore out after about a week , the chain is too long , the derailer is too noisy and jerky even after calibrating , the wheels must be trued as they come very unbalanced , the brakes are plastic and feel very cheap . If you live in a hilly area , this bike is going to be a nightmare . Weighing in at almost 50 pounds , this solid steel bike will wear out your legs even before you make it up the hill . Overall , I would recommend spending a little more money and buying a quality bike with quality components with a light frame .
 Never buy the cheapest product . This bike was excessively heavy -LRB- 50 pounds -RRB- compared to the normal 30 pound bikes they have . Thus , the cheap brakes were quickly worn down and eventually my derailer AND chain broke . I live in a hilly area so getting from one place to another required me to go uphill often , which was very difficult and energy-consuming . If you live in a flat area , I guess this bike would be okay , but going uphill constantly was terrible , and going downhill wore out those brakes . Biggest problem was that it was WAY too heavy .
 I was very unimpressed with these slimmer belts . It is actually two neoprene `` belts '' with velcro that you fasten around each leg . Exactly like the waist belt if you have used one of those , just smaller . The velcro rubs if you do n't fasten it just so , and it is impossible to get them around the problem areas ... saddlebags . Next time I will buy the whole short , should be much better .
 I bought this bike for my son for his commute between his dorm and his classes on campus . I was looking for something inexpensive , since bikes get stolen all the time on the campus . I was very disappointed with the quality of the components on this bike . Granted that I was not expecting a top quality bike for around $ 120 , however , I was expecting at least the wheels would be true ! The front wheel was so out of true , that the brake pads would grab the wheel . After trying to true the front wheel , I tried adjusting the cable on the front brake , but it was no use . Got to a point that I had to pay 10 % price of the bike and buy a pair of descent brake pads to replace the existing ones . I would say , the price on this bike should be $ 40 since the components are all lowest possible quality .
 This product was a huge disappointment to me . I literally had to throw it away as I would not display it in my home . The outside and wood were fine . However , during the packaging and shipping , the company put a large brown paper product on all the acrylic . When I opened the box from shipping , I had to use a razor blade and Goo Gone to even attempt to get rid of the brown paper . In doing so , the acrylic scratched so much that the case was unusable . It was not worth , at all , the money and shipping I paid for it . Unless the seller can get the brown stuff off first , do n't even bother to order . You will be unhappy . Anyone who plays golf at a country club knows you do not put sub-standard item in your home , ESPECIALLY to show off your prize golf balls !
 If you are buying a bike just to ride down the street , to the grocery store , or for short rides with your kids , this bike STILL would not fit the bill . Taking it out on the trail would be dangerous ; the frame is cheap and heavy with sloppy welds , the components are terrible , the cranks are undersized for any adult , and the shocks may as well be pogo sticks.I do not own this bike , nor have I ridden this one . I saw it in a department store . So how am I qualified to rate this product ? In the past I have been employed as a bike assembler . For two separate companies I have assembled and repaired perhaps 15,000 or more bicycles , most of which were the department store variety , I 'm sad to say . There are a few that were good buys for the money , most would be a disappointment for anyone who would like to use it for actual trail riding.A note about Pacific bicycles
 On assembling this product I was faced with the fact that the seat could not fit unto the bike as the shaft to attach it was too small and thus the screw could not be tightened . Further the gear assembly was broken and thus I am stuck with a bike without a seat and unworkable gears . I will have to spend other sums of money to get it workable . Amazon 's quality control in the products it sells comes into question .
 These bikes have many issues-1 . The seat clamp snaps esily-poor quality-needs a stronger clamp-2 . The tube is too thin/short-should be 2 inch longer3.The pedals are plastic not steel-slipery-4 . The crank is poor quality-not strong enough-Especially going up hill-5 . The front shocks are poor/cheap-not absorbing anything-6 . Aluminium rims and spokes-not steel7.Cheap rubber8.Heavy frame9.The rear hup is crap and the bearings are going bed after a few months-needs a new wheel-10 . Slippery chain-rusts easily-11 . Plastic guard-not needed-12 . Rear wheel woobles from side to side-13 . The cassette should be chrome not steel-14 . It needs 26 speed for such a heavy frame-15 . U will end up keeping the frame and the rest in the dumpster-16 . The rear derallieur needs to be protected by a steel cage-it bends easily falling off the bike-17 . Korean/Chinese made rubber-expect flats most of the time-Overall-its always some kind of problems with these bikes : One particular bike might have steel rims but plastic pedalsAnother one might have 21 speed but a short/thin tube-can ' t extend the legs fully-One might have disc brakes in the front and a poor crank -
 this only works adjusted all the way down . the screws provided do n't have enough range to hold the legs , so they pop up anytime they are extended .
 I purchased this bipod to mount on a 308 set up for long range shooting . It looks like a Harris but does n't perform as one . For the money it 's fine , but the legs are too easily bent and it does n't feel secure . I just think my other bipods made by Harris are better quality and more secure .
 -LRB- Total re-write 10/29/2011 -RRB- Before I complained about a Marketplace seller selling a counterfeit version of the Shooter 's Ridge bipod . That 's old news ... Now I focus my irritation and venom on a REAL Shooter 's Ridge bipod , purchased locally at an LGS . I originally decided to have this mounted on a M&P ; 15-22 plinker rather than on a bolt-action that I initially thought I 'd use it on ; I admit that I never really noticed any problems with it but then I rarely shot that particular .22 LR over the past year or so since I bought this Real Deal SR bipod late last year . The couple of times that I did take the Smith & Wesson plinker out I did n't notice anything bizarre using the SR bipod -LRB- used in conjunction with a Shooter 's Ridge Harris rail mount -RRB- , but then it was my nephews shooting the gun more than I was.Fast forward to today
 So ... amazon has this item listed as Shooters Ridge Bipod , but be aware you will receive a Champion Bipod . So , Amazon tried to ship me out a replacement order , but shipped me the same thing . I do n't know anything about Champion gear so I just wanted what I ordered . Amazon refused helping me a third time to make it right . Bad customer service . They 'll only help you once and expect you to return everything , get a refund , and re-buy ... and go through it all again.WTF ? If they do n't have it , then I 'll understand ... but supposely it 's in stock . MAKE IT RIGHT , thats all I wanted .
 These pants are very uncomfortable for use of any sort . Waist is n't elastic . Difficult to tie draw string so that pants stays up on waist . Would never order these again or recommend . Very difficult and uncomfortable to use .
 I was disappointed with the item I purchased . The item I received was an instruction video and not the 8 minute workout that is shown nor what I requested and paid for .
 When I recived the watch in the mail the battery that was in it was drained and the extra battery they sent with it was the wrong size . Worthless
 These watches were listed when we searched for waterproof watches . Did n't expect it to last forever , but it completely died after the first 5 minutes in the ocean . Was using it on our honeymoon as an easy , low-profile waterproof watch since we were abroad and did n't have cell phones to tell the time . Did n't live up to ANY expectations .
 I 've owned three because I really like the look and feel of them , but the band on all three broke within three months . Their packaging promotes a one-year warranty , but I 've emailed Hogwild and also gone ahead and just sent the watches back to them -LRB- two months ago -RRB- and have never heard a peep . I wore them all the time , and they are waterproof , but even though I never stressed the bands by taking them off and on often , all three broke within 90 days .
 Ordered `` Assorted Colors '' thinking it was what was pictured - many bands - but no . It 's just one . A purple one . Awesome.Not to mention the watch comes activated which means my battery life is already drained .
 This is a very cute toy but not as big as I thought . I did not pay attenion to the size when ordering so this was my fault . Have not played with it yet but it is cute
 Insufficient clearance between front wheel and pedal . So when pedaling , if u turn wheel in any direction , whatever foot is in the forward position , it will rub against the front wheel ; thus creating a safety hazard . Otherwise its a great product at a great price
 this item do n't worth the cost ... i have to do some costume cuts so it could fit my A-5 basic ...
 This bike is poorly made -LRB- cheep -RRB- . if you are over 5 foot you feel like you are going over the handlebars . I would never buy this again , or recomend it to anyone
 The glove works great . Looking at the image , it is a nice black baseball glove . However the other side of the glove is pink ! Nowhere did I see any indication that the glove was a girl 's softball glove . Looking at the little picture in the center of the glove more closely you might figure out that the softball thrower is a girl , but not from the image on the site -LRB- where it is clearly identified as a `` baseball glove '' . My son was not really amused - although I was able to use a red marker to make the pink look red .
 i received the ball on time , the package was not encouraging , it was like been driven on by a truck.the ball itself has a nice color , although the texture is not like in the photo , -LRB- you know , the shiny extra smooth -RRB- , the pump was a pain to use , so i used another one from an old ball.when i unfold the deflated ball at first , i noticed strange 2-3 spots , li'l bit larger than the diameter of a pencil , i would like to call them soft spots , because they were 1-bulging above the ball 's material 's surface,2-they felt different from the rest of the ball , you can easily guess that regardless of the linning of the ball material , these 2 spots were lighter or as if lacking some linning than the rest of the ball , this is the best i can explain these 2 spots to give you the idea.when i inflated the ball to the desired size , it did not last more than 15 min before it deflated few inches , i reinflated it again , but again , in few min it felt different while sitting and bouncing on it.i tried doing some exercises on it , like trying to semi stand without completely leaving the ball free , like a reversred squatt , but it felt horrible on my knees bec the ball size after deflation was less than it should be -LRB- i ; ve done this exercise before on another ball -RRB- . with time the ball seems more and more loosing air.i had 2 fitness balls before , one lasted around 2 years . i used it daily to bounce alone or while holding my 2 kids , the other one from duskin did not last more than a month , it 's deflated by itself to an unusable size , even the kids can not play with it , and strangely after this 2nd ball got deflated , i saw lots of bulging spots , same like the ones i saw in yoga ball , they only dissappeared after inflating the ball to the final size.the company did not reply on my eamil , not even saying we can not do anything , i ; m gon na contact amazon again and report this seller 's behavior .
 I recently ordered a 65cm pink balance ball from this listing . I received a 55cm purple ball instead . The package label said 65cm , but when I had inflated it , it measured at 56cm and was woefully too small for me to use.Fortunately Amazon has phenomenal customer service and promptly refunded my purchase , but I would not purchase through YogaAccessories again .
 These yoga balls have a strong plastic smell out of the box . I returned mine right away and got one that is phthalate free .
 I did not receive the item . I have tried to contact the vender to track shipment with no response from them .
 I had this ball for quite a while , it seems smaller then the one of same size I already had before , but was old and I needed to replace it . . it smelled pretty bad , now it is better , but I do n't think it is good quality material , very smelly and sticky , I do n't use it too much because I do n't like it . I am gon na replace it in future with some good brand name ...
 Returned because the advertized size for my height was n't big enough . Was well made and sturdy but not the right size
 Never really could get this blown up to the right size no matter how much we tried . It hardly ever kept the air in & the stopper was constantly messed up before it finally broke . Would have returned if I were n't pregnant & too tired to deal with it . Disappointed .
 The shoes I that arrived were threadless , not the threaded shown on the page . Mighty careless of Amazon . I sent them a correction , but the page was still wrong the last time I looked .
 I 've ca n't comment on whether these brakes pads are good or not , as I bought them from the picture alone without reading the title . These ARE cantilever pads as described in the text , NOT v-brake shows as depicted in the photo .
 wore them once and a hole formed at the tip of my left big toe . I have short toe nails , so that was n't a problem . Very thin . In all honesty , this is really just a dress sock . A cheap dress sock . Do n't believe me ? Just buy it . The packaging looks like it was done it a back room where they just slapped gi sock stickers on it .
 At $ 3 bucks a pair not worth the sock the foot came in ... send it back to CHINA . I walk outside for a living and demand to right equipment to complete my daily task . These socks will not get the job done .
 This bike was great - for the first 3 months . Then the console died . I called customer service who asked me if I had changed the batteries . Yes , I told her . Then she said no more parts were available . Now I use it to hang laundry . I wo n't be buying an Edge bike any time soon .
 Bike worked good in beginning months . After a little sitting and fresh batteries , console would not power up . I could n't give it negative or no stars , so a 1 rating will have to do .
 I liked the bike well enough for about the first year . I was unable to use it for about three months and when I tried to start riding it again , it had gone `` dead . '' I changed the batteries . Dead . It 's frustrating to have a piece of equipment that just stops working after such a short period of time . As the other reviewer points out , it would be nioe to plug in -- maybe it would work that way -LRB- maybe not -RRB- .
 Purchased the bike 6 years ago for big $ $ $ $ . Used it sporadically , just recently started using the bike on a daily basis . It started to shut down after 6 minutes into a program . Changed batteries . Still keeps shutting down . Not happy . Going to put it out for the scrap metal guy to take .
 This sun shade is terrible for a few reasons1 -RRB- It is a nightmare to setup . The fiberglass sections insert into metal tubes to make one long pole . The metal sections are just big enough so the fabric sleeves always snag on each section in multiple places up the sleeve as you try to slide the pole in . Imagine 5 or 6 of these each snagging 5-6 times up the sleeve . . This means you cant simply slide the pole in , you have to do it section by section and each metal piece will catch on the fabric .2 -RRB- If you setup in any kind of wind the first problem becomes exponentially worse and the tent requires two people . The fabric constantly catches air . You can guy the corners down temporarily as you setup which can help a big .3 -RRB- the order of the poles matters . The three poles crossover at the top of the shade . You should do the bottom pole , then the middle , then the top . If you dont you will scream as the poles constantly get stuck on fabric and each other as you try to slide the poles in .4 -RRB- In wind , the fiberglass of the poles will splinter . All my poles are broken after a 15 mph day at the beach . The whole thing is ruined after just 4 uses .5 -RRB- In wind , even if you guy out the lines , the whole thing is not very stable -LRB- or takes a really long time to get things tensioned right -RRB- .6 -RRB- approximate setup time even after 4 times is 45 minutes or so . The first time was over an hour in 25mph winds in the baking sun on the beach - not fun .7 -RRB- as you try to slide the poles out the metal sections will catch again.do not buy this for the beach or anyplace that is windy .
 I believe this product was poorly designed unlike the fantastic goggles . I ordered the original hard case . There is no snap , button , release , catch , or anything holding it together except a bump and indent . I will NOT trust this to hang on the outside of a pack as it could easiy open and drop my $ 100 goggles somewhere . I will have to carry it inside my pack . I do NOT recommend the regular hard case ts-235 as I am not happy with it .
 I wanted to love this product . It 's so hefty and shippy . But it sheds very little light . The bars running vertically along the cage block more light than it seems they should . No matter how high I raised the flame , the lamp did n't illuminate the cabin of even my tiny Montgomery 17 sailboat . The search for mellow , gimbaled , oil-based illumination continues ...
 I have a friend who has an oil lamp for his boat , about the same size as this . It is not Weems and Plath but probably a lot cheaper . I bought this lamp hoping to get the same warm glow in the cabin of my boat as he has in his -LRB- both 30 ' boats -RRB- . I got the premium oil , high quality , put it in the lamp and lit it . I was very disapointed !!! I let it burn for over an hour thinking the wick might need some conditioning . I could not read a book 2ft away from this lamp . It also oscillated , went from dim to dimmer every 2 seconds or so . This was in still air . I am returning this lamp !!!
 I received this as a xmas gift last year . Since then the minute hand has come disconnected TWICE . I sent it back for repair the first time , they sent it back , and about 1 month later the same problem occured . I have thrown it in the garbage now . Stay away . Cheaply made watch .
 I love brass yacht lanterns and have two amazing `` weems and plath yacht lanterns '' , they work great . this one i purchased used and the first time i tried it the glass broke , so i walked down to west marine and bought a new glass . it also broke that week . so i called weems and plath and asked whats up . they said maybe i was heathing it too fast so i tried to start with a really low flame , but it broke again . i bought one more glass from west marine and then gave the thing away . it must be some kind of design flaw . my other yacht lanterns have never craked , even when i turn them on high from the start . this lanters is unacceptable .
 This product is total junk and did n't work at all , even though we tried with 4-5 different set of new batteries . I considered it to be junk and false advertising by the manufacturer.Even though product did n't work , and I return it for being useless , but Amazon Market Place dealer changed the return reason to `` Customer Return '' , so that they do n't have to pay return shipping . I complained to Amazon also , but Amazon did n't do anything.This is one of the worst experience with Amazon or its market place vendors .
 I sent mine back the day I got it . It had several scratches on it . It also came without instructions . There is n't even a battery diagram ! . The sound level was not up to par . Thought I 'd save some money . Bad idea !!!
 The megaphone broke after 5 days of use and I need to get another one ?
 I could not get this product to operate at all . I thought it might be something I did not know about the operation . -LRB- however , all it needs is batteries -RRB- . A friend who would know about such things also could not get it to operate . AND it did not come with an extra microphone . I considered it to be junk and false advertising by the manufacturer.The Amazon Market Place dealer was very easy to deal with . My money was promptly refunded plus the cost of return shipping .
 It arrived quickly and well packaged , but the `` unidirectional condenser microphone '' did n't work . I did n't have time to return it before summer camp started , so I relied on the `` hand held CB style mic . '' This worked very well -- good sound quality and loudness -- until the microphone jack broke halfway through the week . Granted , it was at a summer camp for youth so it was n't exactly treated with kid gloves ... But it was still a disappointment . Not the best quality craftsmanship . In no way is it worth the `` list price '' of $ 60 . Luckily , they do n't charge that.The tune it plays when you press the music switch is -- get this -- `` jingle bells . '' It 's pretty awful . Sounds a lot like an holiday-themed car horn , strangely off-season ice-cream-truck or super annoying kids toy . Weird choice of tune.So , I 'm not particularly happy with the product , but the seller was prompt and I 'm hoping I can take it apart and fix it . We 'll see .
 The DVD is only 31 minutes long , and the first 4 1/2 minutes are breathing `` exercises '' . The DVD is not fast paced or `` power paced '' by any definition . The music is horribly relaxing . I had to turn on some other music in order to feel motivated to work out ; the music on the DVD is for relaxation . The exercises are not strenous . But most of all , there are glaring omissions in the exercises you can do with the circle . There are so many other ways the circle can be used that are not on this DVD.This DVD states that there is a bonus workout to `` take it to the next level '' . Well it is actually an advertisement for another DVD . The short routine does not use the fitness circle at all . It uses small balls -LRB- that you would have to purchase -RRB- . Then it ends with a picture of the Stott DVD they are trying to sell.I recommend `` Pilates Complete for Everyone '' by bodywisdom media . Even though the fitness circle is only a small part of the workout -LRB- s -RRB- , I feel I get more results for my time spent working out.I ca n't see myself ever doing the `` Power Paced Fitness Circle '' again , unless I was very sick or injured . Like most people , I do n't have unlimited time to work out . I need every minute to count toward results . This DVD was a huge disappointment .
 Ordered the first one and it was undeliverable , I figured it must have been damaged in shipping , Amazon resent , 2nd one arrived and top was busted and it almost all leaked out , Amazon shipped another this one arrived the day we left for camping so I threw it in the car to spray the tent when we set it up only to find the spray nozzle not working and 1/3 of the bottle leaked out in shipping again due to poor packaging AGAIN !
 Intended use was to waterproof horse blankets . I waterproofed the same blankets last year with a different product and all went well . Washed and dried blankets , then applied this product following all the directions . It seemed to be OK since water beaded up on the surface . But the first week out with the blankets on and I have cold wet horses , had to pull the blankets and put on lighter sheets that had been waterproofed LAST year with the old product . The rain went all the way through and it was n't even a heavy rain .
 I read reviews about Sky Mounti Inclinometer saying that it was easily broken while tightening the screws . These reviews were correct . I was very careful knowing that the mounting system was fragile . It is truly fragile I do n't recommend this product .
 Nice concept , but does not work well . very hard to set accuratel and bubble response is sluggish so that readings are not reliable . Personally I do n't think it is worth the trouble .
 The item I ordered did not arrive within the estimated arrival date originally given to me . When I emailed the seller , they stated they would respond within 24 hours and that did not happen either . Disappointing . This wo n't hinder my Amazon shopping , just from this seller .
 I used this battery with my Minn Kota 40lb . thrust trolling motor and it lasted for about 1,000 yards . It ran at full speed the first half and then faded to nothing .
 This battery was suggested to go with the small boat trolling motor -LRB- 30lbs thrust -RRB- . It does not have the amp hours -LRB- AH -RRB- needed for this motor . The manufacturer suggest a battery with at least 60ah while this battery has only 7ah . Do not use this battery with the SBM30 !
 It 's bulky . Shifts a lot.Defenately not good for boats where you will be sitting for an extended period of time.Very uncomfortable with seats that have backs on them . I used it in my seaeagle kayak for 4 hours and it was very uncomfortable . I 'm going to look at a neoprene vest that has a lot less bulk .
 Before ordering , we looked up the measurements on the Stearns website , so we could be sure to order the correct size . This arrived and is being returned on Monday at first UPS pickup . The size is NOT correct . XL is stated to fit up to a 48 '' chest on Stearns website -LRB- Amazon , inconveniently , does NOT provide ANY sizing info -RRB- , but this does NOT fit that way . FAR too small . It looked like my husband was trying to wear a child 's life vest when he tried this on - it rode up way too high around him on all sides , and while it did close in front , it just looked too small . He also said it just did n't feel right - the `` riding up '' all around meant that the shoulders did n't rest properly on his shoulders . This is NOT the insecure feeling you want when you 're swimming in Lake Michigan , esp . if there are one to three foot waves ! We are not water testing this - we got it last night , and it 's already packed up to be picked up for return on Monday.Amazon , please start providing sizing info -LRB- that you verify yourselves ... do n't just go by manufacturer 's stated measurements -RRB- so that your customers can buy with more confidence!I am still giving this two stars , though , because the quality SEEMS to be good -LRB- nice padding , good shoulder webbing , etc. -RRB- If only the sizing info were provided accurately -LRB- or at ALL ... Amazon , I 'm talking to YOU here -RRB- . I recommend buying this in store , in person , AFTER trying on . Do NOT buy this via mail or online order ... you 'll likely be disappointed.OTOH , the Body Glove life jacket that we ordered DOES fit correctly , just as per the stated measurements . We 're keeping that one . So it 's down to the usual
 This life vest keeps me above water , I suppose , but it is way too big and unable to be tightened sufficiently , so it rides up to my chin .
 Great cooler and the hard liner makes it very easy to clean . The low key exterior makes it perfect for discreet use in hotels that discourage mini-bar competition.Low rating based on Target 's slopping handling -LRB- product was cut when unpacked from China -RRB- and their inability to replace it .
 The advertised 5 `` x14 '' Taylor Made Bass Boat/Low Freeboard Boat Fender at Amazon.com by Grady 's Ace Hardware is actually a 4 `` x16 '' Taylor Hull Gard Fender . I found out after placing my order and immediately emailed Grady 's to cancel my order before it was shipped . Despite my request to cancel , Grady 's shipped my order the following day , then notified me via email to refuse delivery so the item would be returned and they would provide a full refund . Four weeks after refusing delivery , with assurance from USPS Postal Service that package would be returned to Grady 's , no refund has been received and Grady 's has not responded to numerous emails .
 These sunglasses from Blublocker -LRB- Las Vegas company -RRB- used to be a good product . Now , there is no warranty on the glasses . You wo n't receive any paperwork with the sunglasses , just a box with some advertising on it and no mention of what to do if they break . I have tried to correspond with their customer service group -LRB- or should I say customer service-less -RRB- and the lastest classic answer for my sunglasses purchased in 2007 -LRB- nose piece weld broke -RRB- is that the warranty does not apply after 2006 and they do not fix them . Very clever way of saying do n't bother us . I am a former customer and I recommend that you check into this product -LRB- not cheap -RRB- before dropping any hard earned cash .
 thought these were polarized . . nope . too dark for evenings . I was too late to return , so am stuck with them
 I work in the woods and in construction and I shoot so eye protection is an issue . I 've purchased and broken 50 pairs of these sunglasses during the last 15 years . They are comfortable , cheap and have saved my eyes from flying debris many times . What they are not is perfect . They make everything yellow look white and they make it hard to see a green light . They break VERY easily , the last pair I broke , fell apart when i tried to take them off . SNAP ! They are made in China and no longer have a guarantee . All in all , I 'm looking for another brand .
 The collar did n't work and have sent it back . Maybe it was just a bad collar . It did not fit the dog either .
 I have two large dogs that like to make themselves known to the neighbors . I liked how these NoBark collars were supposed to work and especially the safety features they implemented to prevent the dog from being hurt . This is my third , and last , go-around with these collars . I just ca n't get them to work reliably . At first I thought they were n't put on correctly , had bad batteries or that the dogs just did n't mind the occasional ZzzzzzzING ! These units work through vibration which may or may not be why they 're problematic.After a few calls to SportDOG -LRB- do n't bother imho -RRB- , it looks as though , at least for my units , they just would n't always work . Their support would suggest running the units , sensor side down , on something rough to simulate the dog bark . It should beep and the light will come on . Sure , sometimes . Most times , nope.Tried to get my first unit warranty repaired because it seemed to never work . I did n't have the original receipt , my bad . However , the manufacturers date stamp indicated that it was made within the warranty period which would indicate that it was absolutely still in warranty . Easy , right ? Wrong . SportDOG refused warranty without the receipt.I liked the NoBark collars for what they do when they work and for the built in safety features . However , after three purchases , along with new batteries , I now have three collars that really do n't work.I would not purchase these collars again nor would I recommend these collars to anyone else .
 We purchased this collar and a 4-pack of batteries for it . The audible sound works to tell you `` that its working '' but only the sound works . No shock . After hearing the dog bark with and without the collar , decided to try a new battery . Again , audible sound works and red light lights up but no shock . Finally , after being fooled that its working , I decided to try it on myself and can not , no matter how loud I get , make it administer a shock . The little red light will blink on and the sound will sound , but no shock . Now Im out $ 60 . Do yourself a favor and skip the rip off . Buy some other brand.I only gave it one star because I couldnt find a lower number .
 This works . However , it also goes off when a lawn mower , a truck , or a motorcycle goes by the house . So if you live near a busy road or have alot of outside traffic , do n't buy this . I felt terrible that my dog got zapped as my husband drove by on the lawn tractor.The holes on it are also WAYYY too big . I have a medium sized dog who is in a medium collar . I had to poke holes in this to get it to fit . I ca n't image what people with smaller dogs would do .
 I ordered two of these items , one for my dog and one for my Mother-in-law 's dog , and neither product worked at all ! Highly recommend you purchase a product from a different company , I returned both of the collars I ordered -LRB- still waiting for refund to post -RRB- . I can say that Amazon seems to have a great refund policy where you are not responsible for the shipping on the return of a defective item .
 Does n't work on a german shepherd I have , even after shaving its hair to have good contact . . I would not buy another sport dog product .
 Do NOT buy this product . I bought it for my 10 month-old lab who barks excessively at night . My husband and I tested the device before placing it on our dog -LRB- if it beeps when the sensors are run over a rough surface , it 's supposed to be working -RRB- and waited to see what the dog 's reaction would be . For about an hour he did n't bark at all , but every now and then the collar would beep , then he 'd shake his head and scratch at the collar , as if it were irritating . We thought he was just getting used to the feel of the collar . About 90 minutes after we placed the collar on the dog , he was munching on a rawhide toy not barking , growling or anything , when he leapt into the air about 3 feet , yelped and started crying and frantically running around . We chased him to try to hold him and take the collar off . But before we could catch him he was shocked again because he jumped into the air a second time and yelped . We finally caught him and took the collar off . The instructions say the dog 's first reaction to the shock will be the strongest , and we expected he would have some discomfort and be surprised but the dog WAS NOT BARKING when he was shocked .
 This sport collar states it is for small dogs , NOT true . I had to cut and add holes for it to fit -- only to find out that by its design -LRB- a belt buckle design -RRB- I can not put it on my small dog . To pull it tight enough for the prong to slip in the hole , it chokes my dog . I am worried it will damage his throat !! If it is loose enough that it wo n't choke him when I try to put it on , it is too loose to work . Now I am stuck with a collar that I can not use , or return as I added holes to it !!!
 I looked around for a pedometer for awhile , and coudl n't find a definitive review on any of them . This one is just okay . I guess it works okay , although it seems it might overestimate a little . The pulse thing is just okay . My battery falls out too easily . I got mine on sale , so I 'm not too worried about it . It was interesting to see how much I walk on a typical day .
 This pedometer was fantastic for the one week that I owned and used it . My only complaint was that it was hard to get it open . Well , that problem was solved when the latch broke altogether ! Now it 's useless and will be thrown in the garbage . Do n't waste your money .
 Do n't waste your money on this piece of cheap plastic . It only worked for about two days . Then the readings became meaningless . For example , I 'll walk for one hour and will indicate that I have taken 28 steps .
 I bought this pedometer and I usually read all reviews on amazon before I buy things . I do n't know if nobody had reviewed it when I purchased it or what because I would not have bought it with all those bad reviews . Anyway ... I have not had accurate readings with this pedometer . It might be because I run with it instead of walk but even when trying to test it around the house walking it does not seem acurate . I have also e-mailed the company several times from their web site with no response yet . I also agree with it being hard to open the cover . when you are running and want to look at your progress it is almost impossible to open the cover without messing up the reading -LRB- That is inaccurate anyway so what does it matter -RRB-
 On the operation manual everything is metric , is false , on my pedometer every is Emperial.Pulse meter does not work .
 I was extremely disappointed in this pedometer . It was never accurate in distance or steps ; sometimes it would n't register any distance at all even though the timer was working . I tried several stride settings and sensitivity settings , but it never worked right . Also , the blue backlight died after just 2 days . I am planning to return it because it is absolutely worthless as a pedometer . The only function that worked right was the clock and the timer , and I can use my wristwatch for that !
 It was great at tracking my steps , it was great at taking my pulse very easily , and it stayed securely to my waist . However , after about a month , the battery cover came off unbeknownst to me . So the unit is useless now . The only other problem I had with it was that the cover was extremely stiff to open . If I wanted to check my steps , I would usually think twice because it was a major event to try and open it.Now I need a new one , and I 'm not sure I 'll buy another one of these ...
 While I found the device fairly accurate - the hinged back broke over after about 3 months -LRB- just when the warranty runs out -RRB- it is plastic and on the flimsy side . I will check first , when I replace this.Without the proper mounts on the back , the device is essentially worthless .
 When I began to get serious about getting back in shape , I read the usual assortment of exercise books . They all emphasized the need to exercise in the aerobic zone -LRB- typically defined as being between 60 % and 85 % of your age adjusted maximum safe heartrate -RRB- if you want to burn fat . I was never very good at taking my pulse and figured that this little gadget would be the perfect tool to check my heartrate , especially since I was planning to do a lot of walking , where the pedometer would come in handy . One problem
 Cover broke after 3 months ; the battery falls out too way to easy.It 's a bad engineering design . Customer service has a backlog of cover replacements . It is plastic and its on the flimsy side , the device is essentially worthless and now my unit is sitting on my desk gathering dust now.I had called , wrote and emailed customer service numerous times for months with no response . I 'm sure I 'll buy never buy another one of these or any products made by/from Oregon Scientific the way they treat their customer base.Recommendations
 It 's tiny ... it 's fragile ... it 's not terribly accurate.Buyer beware .
 I received one of these as a gift , and immediately came across the problems highlighted in the product reviews above . I never knew about these reviews until I came across them while trying to find out how to return this gift -LRB- so at least some good came out of it -RRB- When you close the lid , it is almost impossible to open the lid without damaging the unit . The plastic shell is a very poor design , and I hold little hope of a replacemet unit solving the problem
 I read the reviews before I bought this product.I was hoping to use it to increase my exercise level.It wore it for several days , and yes , it IS lightand easy to use ; however , I noticed it was sayingI was doing a LOT more walking than I thought . SoI finally tested it . I walked 25 steps . It said 24 . Not bad , right ? Well , then I set it on a table andleft it there . There was NO MOVEMENT at all , noearthquakes , etc. yet several hours later it said Ihad taken 236 steps ! It seems to ` add ' steps overtime , regardless of whether or not you actually tookthem . Was very very disappointed . DO N'T WASTEYOUR MONEY .
 The price of this product is what sold me comparing to other pedometers . I bought it being aware of the problems other reviewers have stated . The `` happiness '' ratio seems about 40 % at best . The thumb clip has been problematic but you can work around it . But is that what you want in a product ? The biggest flaw I have found is in its accuracy . After several tests of 50 steps the unit averaged being `` off '' by being over 40 steps ... on the lowest sensitivity . Disappointing . I would n't mind it being off by being under because I would exercising more and thats good . But this way I feel like its cheating me at the cost of my health . I will continue to use this unit but I will be on the lookout for a new unit . I can not make a recomendation for this product .
 It sounded like a good idea ... Perhaps a higher-end model would work better - but this one felt awkward and performed `` cheaply '' . The poor design made it difficult to open and adjust . I put it on once to test it and it seemed to be somewhat accurate in step counting with only small error . Before I got a chance to read the directions to try other options -LRB- something I have never had to do with what I would have thought to be much more compicated equipment -RRB- it got some moisture in it and stopped working completely . Into the junk drawer with other quickly dimmed bright ideas . A nice idea , poor execution .
 This Oregon Scientific Pedometer is very inaccurate and a waste of money even at the cheap price . There is no point to even considering `` saving money '' when it comes to pedometers if the count is going to be almost arbitrary .
 Unlike another reviewer whose review I read , I found this pedometer to be inaccurate . It indicates many more steps than I actually take and is off by over a tenth of a mile in distance walked . I was especially disappointed when I learned that a friend and his fiance had purchased a different pedometer -LRB- for the same price as I paid for this one -RRB- that records their steps and distance travelled extremely accurately , even though they are completely different in height/weight characteristics . Moreover , theirs has a `` talking '' feature which tells them how many steps they have taken , etc. . And , it looks nicer , with a black and silver case .
 Others have indicated that their pedometer would ` count ' on its own when sitting on a table ... well mine did too !! I packed it back up as soon as I opened it and mailed it back today for a refund !! Also counts steps when you open and close the cover . Try another product .
 I decided to purchase this item even though several reviews spoke of difficulty with this pedometer . The extremes of the reviews , from 5 stars to 1 had me wondering if a few people just got a `` lemon '' OK - please listen to ME ! It IS a waste of money . It IS difficult to open . It DOES NOT calculate correctly . I walk 10 steps and the readout varies from 14 to 256 ! I did reset , I did put the sensitivity button all the way to the left . It just is not a good item . Save time and choose another model/maker . I am returning mine .
 This product was never reliable . The battery did not fit properly and would lose contact .
 The unit I received did n't keep accurate time and was too sensitive even with the slider all the way to least sensitive . Pros = unit was light and easy to read with a good backlight.Cons = Info I was reading wsa wrong !
 Having a pedometer is fantastic , and definitely inspired me to make sure I was more active . However , this product is not up to snuff . The first one I ordered was next to impossible to open , and returned to Amazon within a day . The replacement I received worked fine , and then stopped working completely after 2 weeks . I have decided to research pedometers and find a good working model that will work consistently for a reasonable amount of time .
 I ordered 24 pedometers for a weight management class that I teach . 3/4 of the pedometers do not work correctly . The majority overestimate steps taken . A few froze and will not work at all . My group is very disappointed in the quality and has requested that I return them . I have used other pedomters in the past for my groups -LRB- America on the Move pedometers -RRB- and have had no problems .
 I 've got blisters on my thumb from trying to open this pedometer.I have suspicions that it is n't really accurate , but I ca n't tellbecause I ca n't get the thing open . -LRB- I 'd like to check it severaltimes a day , but my thumb hurts . Ouch ! -RRB-
 Well I was all ready to give this product a decent review but ends up it is n't worth it . It is hard to open but I can live with that . Some of the buttons are not that responsive as you ca n't flip back and forth from distance to steps to calories that easy . It seems not to like that very much . However it was doing the job . I tested it out several times and it was only off by a couple of steps on each test . On average though it was very accurate . No phantom steps and no counting while i was sitting . I would test 100 steps at a time and it came within 1-5 steps . This made me happy as this is what I bought it for . So why only 2 stars ? Well as soon as it reached 1000 steps the readout went extremely dim . I switched modes and it was fine but when I went back to steps it was dim again . I reset it to 0 and it was ok again . I ran a few tests and each time it went over 999 it dimmed out to a point where I could n't tell what the numbers were . did I walk 2340 steps or 3246 steps ? Now that is a big difference . Now put that big issue with the smaller ones and this product just does n't cut it . Too bad because it was accurate , light , and compact . I 'm taking it back and trying another product . With all the other bad reviews the chances of you picking a good one looks 50/50 . This company has to really look at this product because selling something with a track record like this is not right .
 This pedometer was horrible , and I returned it to Amazon -LRB- which was a painless process , by the way -RRB- . I noticed a problem when I took off the pedometer and put it on my nightstand at night -LRB- and then cleared the steps -RRB- - and woke up in the morning to have 100 + steps ! The pedometer never moved but steps were added . I counted out my steps on the way to work one morning , and it was off by 20 % . Very unreliable product , in my experience at least .
 The first one lasted a day , one day and when it fell out of my hand while I was passing it to someone to wear , it D-I-E-D . The second one -LRB- totally great return policy Amazon ! -RRB- was taken care of as if it were fragile crystal . It lasted 6 weeks before it also found it timely demise upon hitting the floor.I think the concept is remarkable , the tool itself is fabulous , it really does count steps with great accuracy , but it is not durable at all . I am sadly disappointed .
 I found this pedometer was not everything I expected . The pedometer does not fit on pants well , and mine actually broke when it fell off my pants onto carpet . I will try replacing the batteries , but as of now , I am not pleased .
 This pedometer is so much cheaper -LRB- ~ $ 7 -RRB- than the typical decent ones -LRB- that go for about $ 18 - $ 20 -RRB- . . now I know it is for a reason . . the buttons are flimsy , the package looks very cheap , the one I bought and presented to a senior citizen - did not work , also found that the Sr Citizen found it very hard to use the buttons on this little device . . terrible ergonomics/form factor.Would recommend spending a bit more and getting the Omron/Oregon Sc $ 18 pedometers - much better form factor , high reliability and quality .
 This little thing was perfect in size , but not sound . Every step I took , it made some type of clicking noise . I stopped wearing it shortly afterward because the noise was making me crazy !
 This was a very inferior product . I teach Pilates to young women between 35-40 years of age . They are very health-conscious and would use a quality product on a daily basis . This product was not sturdy , kept falling off with minimum exertion , and it was very difficult to follow the directions . I would not recommend this to anyone !
 I 'm not sure just how accurate this pedometer is . I 've been SITTING in front of my computer since I put it on and it reads 141 steps so far and I have it on the lowest sensitivity level.More importantly , the tip of my right thumb is killing me from wrestling with the lid to get it open . The release button does n't push in and release anything . You auctually have to use your thumb to pry it open.I will try using it tomorrow without closing the lid , but this seems to be a bit ridiculous.Oh , It now reads 148 steps ...
 Pros
 I ordered this product because of the great reviews that I read about it online . Once it was delivered , however , I was extremely disappointed with the purchase . First of all , I find it very hard to open . It requires a lot of force and is even more awkward to open when it is placed on a waistband -LRB- versus just holding it in your hands -RRB- . I was also surprised that , not only is there no way to turn it off - it is constantly on and wasting batteries , but after leaving it on my dresser overnight I woke up to find out that it had walked 27 steps on its own while I was sleeping ! Pretty amazing , huh ? I am very disappointed in this product and surprised by all of the other reviews . Hopefully this one is just defective !
 I love using a pedometer and recommend the simplicity and ease of use of this OS model ... However , after buying many for friends and family I have to note the calibration is highly inconsistent . My husband kept bragging he was doing between 20,000 and 30,000 steps every day and I could n't figure out how since I have a hard time getting in 10,000 steps a day without including a daily cardio workout . I wore both pedometers for a few days with the same settings and his is calculating 3X the steps as mine . I later learned a pedometer I had given as a gift was also over counting steps as well . Also the newer models are very difficult to open .
 I threw it out the window , ran over it with my car , beat it with a hammer , put it down the garbage grinder and it just will not cease to exist . Sure , it does n't work anymore ... but it never did ! The thing would add a hundred steps if I just looked at it the wrong way . If I actually tried to use it while walking , it informed me that I had travelled to the moon and back while driving over to get a take-out pizza . Listen , a lot of reviewers seem to be excusing the shabbiness of the product by extolling its price . In that case , yeah , the rock I found on the beach does n't keep very good time but you ca n't beat the price ! I mean listen , people , if you are happy with a pedometer mostly because you paid little for it , you need to admit that you are just a cheapskate . If you are not interested in accuracy , why measure at all ? And pedometers are notoriously inaccurate , despite what their manufacturers would have you believe . For one thing , you can blow me with that stride length malarkey . A person 's stride length is in a state of flux and is especially not well represented by the stiff , self-conscious steps you take when you are trying to determine your stride length . Ever hear of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle , baby doll ? Well , I do n't wan na get too technical on you . The whole pedometer concept is for the birds , you dig ? If you cheapskates are serious about measuring distance , why do n't you open that wallet that makes a sound like a creaking door in an old horror movie and bats fly out of it and once you have cleared away the cobwebs , take out your credit card and place an order for a Polar or Nike SDM . That 's Speed and Distance Monitor . These are accurate to 97 % even without calibration . But , oh , prepare yourself for a coronary
 I bought this for a friend for his birthday . It feels solid , but beware do not use for anything else other than decoration . He was practicing swinging it in the air , when the blade completely fell off ! The blade is not properly secured to the handle -LRB- not full tang . . just glued -RRB- on these sword . Even though it was n't sharpened , he could have seriously hurt himself . using this sword as a decoration is the most you do with this . these kinds of swords are made from scrap metal , unsharpened and improperly balanced and/or not configured for use .
 This was a waste of money . It was a little more expensive than my first model of pedometer but seemed to have some good features . Unfortunately , the step counter was completely inaccurate . It would rack up hundreds of steps while I was sitting at my desk . It would reset itself about two or three times per use . I had to check it every 20 minutes or so and try to keep a running total in my head in case it `` reset '' itself . I was so frustrated with the inaccuracy of the thing , I finally tossed it .
 This pedometer requires 3 batteries to operate . It takes 2 LR43 batteries and 1-12 volt battery . It comes with the batteries initially , but the replacement batteries are n't easy to find . I had success at an ` all batteries ' store .
 I totally agree with a previous reviewer - it counts movements when there are none , continually , and keeps resetting the total , over and over . I bought this one for the safety cord because I kept dropping the Sportline 360 which I love otherwise but I have broken -LRB- 3 -RRB- and lost -LRB- 1 -RRB- . Needless to say , the cord is useless because I no longer bother to use it at all . A huge disappointment .
 To my great disappointment this gadget is a real hassle to use -- it frequently `` resets '' itself and the alarm is not well designed for any practical use in an emergency . Not recommended !
 My husband purchased the Pedometer with FM radio for me . I loved it and used it non-stop for about a week . After a week the battery case top fell off so I could not keep the batteries in . The FM radio worked only once - I thought I had a short in the headset . Good idea but really did not perform/last for the money .
 Although it kept time -LRB- which indicates the batteries were good -RRB- this did n't work the first day I used it . It worked the second day . It stopped working by the third day AND the battery cover broke off sometime during the day and was lost . This was a complete waste of $ 19 .
 This was a piece of JUNK . Neither my husband nor I could ever get it set correctly -- we wound up throwing it away , going to Target and buying one of their 10,000-Steps pedometer . THAT works great .
 The radio actually never worked on this pedometer , which was OK as that was really an ` added bonus ' . However the pedometer itself has stopped working after two months of use . It has n't been dropped , it has n't got wet ... it has just stopped . Perhaps it is the batteries , but it 's such a plastic , little toy , I do n't want to waste the money on buying new batteries . You get what you pay for .
 This is the second one of these I 've owned ... my first one the screen went blank after about a month and a half ... not an uncommon problem with this , I can see reading the other reviews ... But I thought maybe it was just a problem with that particular pedometer , so I bought a second one ... Big mistake!As far as the radio , what a piece of crap . I live about 20 minuters ' drive from downtown Houston ... maybe there are too many radio stations around here . It just wo n't lock on to anything , not even the strongest stations . Tons of static and stations fading in and out . I bought a pedometer with a radio because I wanted a radio while I walked . If you 're selling a pedometer with a radio , the radio should work.I would give this 0 stars if I could .
 I bought this a few months ago and I was pretty disappointed . It does n't say anywhere in the instructions what all of those numbers mean . I have emailed and called the Oregon Scientific Customer Service office and they have not yet responded . I still have lots of weight that I need to lose . I am especially heavy up top and am impatient about getting rid of my manb -- bs . The radio is good , though , so I gave this one star .
 This product is worthless . Save yourself the hassle and frustration of trying to get the radio and readouts to work and buy something else.I 've never been able to get the radio to work properly and the counters have gone blank . I 'm really surprised that Amazon continues to sell this item with such terrible reviews continuing to come in .
 Pedometer part is fine . Radio part is useless .
 This is a very expensive pillbox being represented as a pulse meter . It is impossible to get your finger positioned over the sensor so that it will take your pulse accurately . Approximately 50 attempts have yielded not one useful pulse reading .
 These were recommended by the well known bike expert Sheldon Brown , as a replacement set of calipers for vintage 10 speed bikes that required an extremely long reach caliper to reach the bike rim . FAIL . Due to this calipers overall cheap construction and the very long reach , they did not work . When applied at full force , it took well over 10 feet to stop . With such long arms , it just becomes a physics problem ; Not enough torque.I 'd recommend restorers to go to a machine shop and have someone make you a set of drop bolts so you can use more modern , better calipers.I ca n't say as to how these would work on BMX bikes -LRB- their original application -RRB- , but I am guessing by how flimsy they are that they would n't work well .
 After viewing a great TV commercial , my kids HAD TO GET THIS for their dad for father 's day . They were very excited ! Unfortunately , the first day was spent charging ... cooling ... cycling ... cooling ... charging ... cooling the batteries . The next day our maiden run was VERY highly anticipated . The unit had VERY poor range randomly varying from 8-30 feet . The unit responded to radio-controlled commands just as randomly . Within HALF A MINUTE of our first run , the unit did not respond to turn commands within close range and ended up in a patch of grass , flipped , and the propellor broke . FROWN ! Good concept , POOR PRODUCT . DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL TO ANYONE . I should mention , that my husband is an engineer , read the entire manual , and has much experience with radio-controlled products ... therefore my point is that the problem was NOT operator-error .
 DO NOT BUY !!! I ordered this airplane for my 17 year old son for his birthday . To start with it is never a good thing to see that the package includes super glue !! The thing was broken before we even got it out of the package !! We fixed the rudder -LRB- the part that was broken -RRB- and took it to the park for the test run . Guess what ... it took a nose dive on the first run and cracked down the middle . The seller `` does n't accept returns of damaged items '' . So now we are stuck with a broken , uncontrollable , styrofoam peice of junk that the company wo n't stand behind . If you are looking to disappoint your child then buy this , if not ... look elsewhere !!
 I bought this from the NAVY Exchange online ; didnt even come in any real packaging ; looked like some guy found a box in his garage ... Well anayway ; it has just enough power to drive it into the ground ... mine has probably a grand total of 46 seconds of flight time in about 8 tries ; I 'm not a skilled pilot but I doubt any more skill would help much.If you just want to use it as a boat that might work ; I tried hand launching ... maybe take off from water would work better ? Sure would make landings softer ... but then you have to swim out to get it because chances are it wont be upright.The elevator and turn flaps are 2 position only so you have to feather it to maintain control .
 This plane has horrible controls , First they are not proportional , when you turn left , its full left , up is full up , you cant turn `` just a little '' , this makes controlling this plane a real big pain.It 's very durable , no complaints in that department , but its a real bad in terms of controlling the plane.The worst part is that power is controlled by some sort of `` 4 speed settings '' Slow - > medium - > fast - > fastest.Engine is not proportional this results in a very very very dificult flight , the plane will go up really fast or down really fast.It seems to be a cool RC , but fliying it is a real deception .
 This toy looked great in the video you can find on-line , but by the plane in real life is not that great . controls needed tuning right out of the box . Battery life is quite shore considering a 20 minute recharge time . After recharging , or use for that matter , you need to let the battery cool prior to use again for about 5 minutes , adding to the charge time.Neet idea on the charger system using a car 's cigarette adapter instead of a bunch of D-cell batteries , but this means repeated trips from your flying area to a car for recharge . Also , changing the battery out for recharge is a neusance as it is stored within the fusalage , requiring a screwdriver to remove the screw -LRB- which is begging to be dropped and lost -RRB- to then remove the battery . Could n't this have been done with some kind of latching mechanism?Yes , I know , make one myself that 's better ... I just wish we could bring back quality construction and mix that with todays technology ... Imagine what we could achive as a people !
 I purchased this Toy Chest since it was in sale and got it today and we started assembling . When we put the screws and tighten the wood cracks in several places . I do n't know how many days its going to last . I dont know why people use pressed wood for this kind of piece and sell it for $ -LSB- ... -RSB- . This piece is not definetly worth the money . Please starting using solid wood or anything that does not crack . I love the look , but that deceives . My son loves to sit on it , but I am worried that it will break someday . By the way the Instructions for Assembly given with the product is should be much more clear and step by step .
 I figured for over $ 100 I would have received something of better quality . There were minor scratches on most pieces and the graphics were slightly smudged . Nothing major enough to go through the hassle of taking it apart , packing it back up , and dealing with the return process . Assembly did n't go well , the included screws broke -LRB- I broke three of them , only by using a handheld screwdriver , the heads twisted right off -RRB- . I ended up having to drill extra holes since the included screws broke off . Also , the instructions -LRB- the usual Chinese wordless instruction sheet -RRB- did n't put things together in the right order , so you ended up having to improvise . Parts of it are little more than cheap press board . I have my questions on whether or not it is going to last in my son 's room more than a year or two.All in all , just know you 're paying $ 100 for a cheaply made Chinese made novelty item , not a real piece of furniture .
 This was a horrible experience in gift giving . I ordered this toybox as a baby gift . First , the website did not let me send a message stating it was a gift , from whom , etc. . Amazon was absolutely no help in this arena and placed the blame on the website of the seller . Then I found out the package was delivered to my friends in Albuquerque -LRB- I live in Atlanta -RRB- with absolutely no assembly instructions . The box was void of any phone numbers or other references to figure out how to request instructions . Without my knowledge , my friends finally found a website site and tracked down the manufacturer to request assembly instructions . This was my first time buying anything from amazon.com and it will be my last .
 On the surface , this seems like a great product
 These were really cute online while I was shopping for rash guard tops for my trip to Florida . I ordered 2 of these and when they arrived I could not even put them on . The neck opening would not fit over my head and after several tries of pulling and tugging I finally got it on . It was extremely too tight . I ususally wear a medium , but ordered a large because I did n't want a tight fit . I thought this shirt must be a childs size.I will be returning both of them
 According to the information on the website , these socks were listed as being 79 % cotton , 20 % stretch nylon , and 1 % spandex . When I received them , the label on them says they are 67 % cotton , 17 % acrylic , 15 % nylon , and 1 % spandex ... this is not what I wanted . Also , they are very thin and run small . I am disappointed and will not buy socks again online .
 Gold Toe Women 's Classic Crew SockThe socks are thin and instead of elastic to hold them up , have one tight thread around the top . They might do the job if you always wear socks down and need thin . The name `` gold toe '' lead me to believe it would be a quality , thick walking sock .
 Main issue on 50cm frame
 This bike is very sturdy , but very heavy . If you are 5 ' 8 like me , you 'll be too short for the bike . It 's made for a 6 ' person . If you like speed and light weight , this bike is not for you . It 's slow and clunky .
 Have an '85 Pontiac Fiero with a oxidation , fading and blotching in the fiberglass finish . Knowing the Meguiar name , and having been satisfied in the past with other produts , I bought this product with the expectation of it helping restore the finish , at least a little , as I 'm not much for expectations . It did n't . After all three steps , the blotching between the fading sections and good sections was more pronounced , and other problem areas were not helped at all . I had better results before with a cheap liquid cleaner/wax , and about the same with some polishing compound . The product is not worth the price or effort . Skeet Pick in San Marcos , CA .
 I purchased the 3 step oxidation remover -LRB- polish and wax also -RRB- and it did NOT live up to my expectations . I had fiberglass that was really oxidized . I followed the process and I am very disappointed by the claims made . I would NOT purchase this product again based on what it could NOT do which is remove oxidation . It did make the fiberglass a little brighter but nothing to write home about . I feel like I wasted my money .
 This product works absolutely great to remove sap , black marks , and dirt embeded in the roof of an RV . Unfortunately , any residue or placement of the product on painted cap tops or the side rails of the roof results in quick UV fading and peeling of the paint . I will avoid using the product in the future and look for something safer for painted surfaces beyond the white roof top .
 Bought this on Black Friday lightening deal and used it for a ski trip . It holds my snowboard and a ski very well . The installation is easy - no screw driver required . It also comes with key locks so I dont have to worry about leaving snowboard on roof rack while having breakfast in McDonald 's on the way . -LSB- Update - My snowboard fell off the rack on my 3rd trip ! -RSB- The roof rack did a great job for my first two snowboard trips . The third time I used it , the snowboard fell off the roof rack when I was driving on freeway at 60mph . Thank god it was an early morning and there 's no car behind . But I had to stop my car on the freeway and ran back to pick up the board on the freeway!I would never trust this thing ever again , I 'll buy two bike chain locks to secure the roof rack next time I use it .
 Description says it fits round bars but the picure on the box shows it only fits oval and square . Instructions inside says to get an adapter for round bars . Of course Amazon does n't carry the adapters since they think it fits round bars , so I found them at another website for $ 40 . Might as well spend the extra money and get a quality item from Thule or Yakima . These do seem like poor quality the upper part of the rack hits the lower plastic piece before closing and looks like it will eventually cause damage . I will be returning these and have to tell one of my friends they ca n't go snowboarding this weekend .
 Bought for long ride across Illinois . Valve stem pulled out on my son 's bike during air up and valve stem broke on my bike . Not up to hard use with lots of hang pump airing . Fine for the kids ' bikes .
 when i saw the other review for this item at 2-stars i thought this person was just a hater . particularly since the other tubes by sunlite had earned much better reviews , it seems that this size of a tube was remarkably different from the others , this size tube by sunlite is no good.to be fair , the title for my review is a bit of a hyperbole . the tube stayed inflated for a few quick rides but something was up with the valve stem . when i first put the tube in , i noticed the valve stem was crooked and hitting a few bumps on the sidewalk made it deflate . i thought it was a fluke because i re-inflated and went on a few more quick rides and it stayed inflated . however , i did a similar ride on a bumpy sidewalk and lo and behold it deflated again.i have 26 x 1.5 '' tires on a mountain bike , which are thinner than normal mountain bike tires but come on ... it should be able to ride on the sidewalk without crapping out . i tried inflating it again but it began leaking directly out of the valve , or possibly there 's a small hole around the valve stem.anyway , i was disappointed by the fact that this tube crapped out on me so quickly . my mountain bike is a cheap department store model that bike blogs warn against buying and the tubes it came with were still good when i decided to swap tires/tubes . i had ridden the old tire/tubes at least 500 miles easily whereas the new tube crapped out in less than 100 miles . maybe i messed up and should not have inflated it when i noticed the valve stem was crooked , maybe i got a bad tube , who knows ...
 We bought this item for our Grandson 's , ages 4 and 5 . It is basically a standard hardness tetherball , with a thin rubberized coating.I blew it up to about 3 lbs of air pressure , and it IS HARD!There is no way this can be called a `` Soft '' Tetherball , and contrary to a previous reviewit would be very dangerous to allow very young children , especially boys , to bat bat this around apole , at each others faces .
 Kids have fun with it , but only for a few moments . the darts do n't stick and bounces off really easily.but it is a safe product for children .
 I 've had this for over a year now . I bought it looking for wind protection and am very disappointed with the breathability of this product . It traps moisture inside and I end up with a visibly damp shirt and have to turn the jacket inside out to dry . That 's what happens in dry weather . The fit is comfortable and it 's otherwise conveniently designed . The fabric in white is quite see-through . Later I purchased Turfer 's `` Womens 's Light Weight Endurance Jacket '' for $ 14.95 and that 's been the perfect windbreaker . It 's now up to $ 19.95 and I 'm ordering another color .
 $ 15.33 for 1 pair ??? I was shure stupid not to check the number of pairs of socks I was getting . it will not happen again !
 These socks are warm and comfortable . Unfortunately , a hole was worn on the toe by the second time I wore them .
 Never available in Large , the single most popular size ? What kind of marketing madness is that ? Makes no sense at all .
 I gave it 1 star because there 's to many 5 stars.The socks are real thick on the bottom half like these lovers say , but they did n't say that the top half , ankles , are made like CHEAP DISCOUNT STORE GRADE SOCKs . They FIT TIGHT & CUT YOUR CIRCULATION . They are fold over and stitched at the top cutting off circulation to your feet . I do n't care if they are so thick you do n't need to wear shoes . If you have a deep groove around your ankles you are cutting of blood flow to your feet.I am keeping the one pair I bought to see if I have some use for them but I wo n't buy more . The bottoms are so thick you could n't wear with the shoes you have . You would need a size larger shoe .
 One pair of crew socks was included in the sale . This was n't made clear in the product description , especially since most others come in multiple pairs . This item is very expensive and not much better in quality or comfort compared to the less expensive crew socks I 've tried .
 Very thin walled cheap steel will bend if you weigh over 200 lbs and ride over any kind of rough terrain , not worth the time . Some BMX shops have the same configuration at much better quality but those are harder to find .
 I contacted the seller told him charger overheated.they told me to return.Also was told I must have installed my batteries wrong.the batteries are installed right the charger I have for my other scooterworks on this one just fine.I just didnt want to share charger with other scooter.It too is a 24 volt 500 watt scooter . . cost of return and to ship new one back to me more than new charger.so I will just take the loss . . mike wallace .
 This a great game with many great improvements , but only if you get a disc that is not flawed.This is true of my disc and if you search forums on the internet you will find the same thing happening to many others . During certain , and repeateble times in the game , the game stops and you get `` Disc may be dirty or damaged '' error . I experience this when trying to load my 3rd Tiger Challenge and during season mode . Also , when playing St. Andrew 's , when Hole # 2 is trying to load , I get a black screen and am not even able to access my dashboard or shutdown the console via the controller . My disc is completely free of scratches or anyother cosmetic damages.Neither Microsoft nor EA will replace the discs , each laying blame with the other . Many think the blame should go to EA for using discs that arent good quality.So buyer beware , great game but flawed hardware .
 DISLIKES : The graphics on the 360 version are poor in my opinion for the following reasons
 EA has obviously listened to the maddened consumer who screamed for more detail in something other than Tiger Woods face . The problem is they 've overcompensated.Pros-More courses , a driving range , better customization for game face , excellent multi-player modeCons-Obscene ball control , no new golfers worth a damn , an introductory that makes the game unenjoyable for the 1st 20 tournamentsThey goofed . Instead of making a better golf game , they just made it more difficult . I 'd learn to play real golf if I wanted to try this hard.They HAD a chance to shock and put Mickelson in as a playable golfer , besides a name on the leaderboard.They might NOT have made your golfer 's improvement worse than VCR instructions.They COULD have realized a smaller hole legend is just annoying.They MAY have recognized that Tiger Woods is a golf game made to be fun , not homework.If you have ' 06 , take a pass and pray for next year .
 In order to give you the `` experience '' of becoming a better golfer , this game severely handicaps you when you start out . You have to waste hours of your life putting up with random horrible shots because the game does n't want you to be too good too fast.I 've played all of Tiger Woods 2005 and most of 2006 - if you want to play a golf game , play one of those instead . 2007 on the 360 is a waste of time .
 The regular 07 version for classic xbox is the best golf game ever made . This one however , is not the same ! I have no idea why they would alter it so much - really butchered it into a piece of crap . If you want the fun version , get the old one !
 We received this sled today and upon opening it my two year old daughter went crazy . First off , this is one of the most beautifully , hand crafted sleds I have ever laid eyes on . We could not wait to get out in the snow . Upon sitting my daughter in the sled I started to pull her and was amazed at how easy the sled glided across the snow . However , the excitement less than ten feet away when we came to the first part of the slightest uneven ground ; the sled tipped over and my daughter landed face first . I cleaned her off and set her back in the sled . Several times we tried to pull her around just in our yard . Every single time we came to the slightest incline or uneven area she tipped over . After the fifth tip over she was done . We were both disheartened as this would have been a keeper , however , I do n't want to hang it up in the den for its beauty . I need a functional sled simple as that.I contacted Mountain Boy and explained the issue and Kevin just did n't know what to say to me . With such high craftsmanship the actual sled -LRB- bottom -RRB- should have been designed far better . Even using the same slippery plastic material would have suited if there was a wide channel cut down the middle and it acted as two skis as opposed to a solid bottom . We live in Ohio and have about a good six inches of snow out there right now . her old sled was designed for 6-24 months so she outgrew it . it was a Pelican and never tipped over because it had a center channel to funnel snow acting like skies.I would have given this sled 5 stars for the woodworking craftsmanship alone , but it has to be functional and work well . The sled is described as stable and looking at the bottom one would think so . Mountain Boy , redesign the sled with skies and a channel down the middle and you have an absolute winner ! This sled may also work better in powder snow . Either way we are saddened by having to return it as its just that beautiful to look at .
 Received the sled in time , hid the package from the kids , and played Santa on Christmas night . Big mistake . The sled came cracked at the front plank , just where the rope holes are . The plank is cracked , it might or might hold , not that I care as I 'm returning it.The really infuriating part is that this crack has been there from the very begining , or is part of some lousy manufacturing process . The paint and varnish got into it , which to me means it was there already by the time the sled was still unpainted . It looks like someone went there with a circular saw while watching `` Big Sister '' at the same time.Which brings me to the '' ... Oh , so beautifully handcrafted !!! '' part . I do n't know if anything has changed since the last reviews , but this thing is far from perfect.I could give it a `` decent '' grade , if not for the sloppy crack/saw job . But nothing more : - The screws which hold the side rails look plain ugly and are too visible , proudly displayed as `` will not rust '' on the tag or not . - The bottom plate is held to the wooden part of the sled directly with screws which seem to pull it in every direction , instead of centering them with shims . - These same screws holding the plastic bottom are screwed unevenly enough to put it under tension and to leave little gaps between bottom and wooden plank . And this - at the front , where it is most exposed to snow ingestion . Imagine a large , flat tupperware box you would be pulling on the snow , with the lid not tightly closed . This is exactly what you 're getting . Snow will get in , and melt once you put the sled to dry . Whether it will manage to dry or not is another story.Yes , it 's no big deal , but such little things make all the difference between `` beautifully handcrafted '' and `` hand assembled '' . There is a clear difference between the two.On a comparison scale , this thing is in no way better assembled and for sure not better thought than an average Ikea chair . Actually , it might be a bit worse.So we come to the important part
 We bought the sled living in a snowy area for our 21 month old to take him with us while XC skiing . BUT the sled is not steady and tips over sideways throwing his face straight into the snow . We returned it very sad . He had really hoped it would work because it 's beautiful .
 I purchased the Mountainboy Sledworks Bambino Grande Pull Sled and the pad for it for Christmas for my 17 month old grandchild . The sled is very well made out of quality wood . However , your description indicated that it is `` large enough to accommodate two tolddlers . '' This sled , although well made , is in no way is large enough to hold two toddlers . It just barely holds one . As for the pad , the ties do not not stay tied and the pad continually slides down.I chose this sled thinking that my grandchild would be able to use it for two seasons , and that her baby brother would be able to ride tandem . She will probably be too big for it halfway through this season.Perhaps it would be more useful for a much smaller child , but there are no safety straps or harness to keep the child in the sled . It also tipped over on uneven , icy snow.Needless to say , we are very disappointed in the way this sled was represented in Amazon 's online description . It was an expensive purchase based on the limited use it will receive .
 First of all the lock should be great when you get it brand new . This one rattles around a lot and does n't seem very solid . Also the key with the `` light '' does n't even light up when you squeeze it .
 This lock is very sturdy and successfully protected my bike quite well ; a few times overnight in bad areas of NJ . However , after 3 years of heavy use it has become incredibly difficult to open . It requires a surgeon-like finesse to get the key to turn . Or , at least it used to . Now , it does n't open at all . After lubricating with graphite , pounding with a hammer to loosen any stuck interior components and paying a locksmith to try to open it , the lock is still seized on my bike and my primary mode of transportation is disabled . There are numerous reports of OnGuard locks seizing on the internet , so my case is not isolated . My recommendation is to look to other brands for high-end u-locks .
 I purchased this lock for my commuter bicycle in Washington , DC in May . It seemed sturdy , did not have problems with the key breaking off in the lock -LRB- like many of its competitors -RRB- , and was hefty but not too heavy . For the price , it seemed like a great deal in the beginning.Like some reviewers have said , the plastic piece that attaches the lock to the bicycle is not strong enough , so I had to either strap it to my bicycle 's back rack or sling it over the handlebars . This was a minor hassle , but no big deal . Unfortunately , this abuse proved to be too much for the lock . Its cheap , internal plastic components must have cracked during one of my commutes , because when I got to work it completely came apart , revealing cracked plastic parts.If this lock can not handle a few bumps on my 3 mile each way commute for 2 months , I do not trust it to secure my bike !
 OnGuard brand locks have dissapointed me on all three occasions that I have purchased them . The first was a cable , easily cut through and my bike stolen . Second was a U-lock similar to this and then this U-lock . The plastic casing on both u-locks broke off within a month on both . Shortly after , the locking mechanism froze to where the key would only turn 1/4 of the way . Purchased a Krypto -LRB- a bit more pricey -RRB- and it hasnt let me down yet . Far worth the avoided headache to pay a little bit more for a better brand lock ... . I will definitely avoid OnGuard brand locks in the future .
 The plastic lock holder that is supposed to hold the lock on the frame broke after just 3 weeks of normal use . The weight of the lock is way too much for the plastic to handle , and it chipped away at the holder until it was useless . Now there is no easy way to carry this beast of a lock , short of a backpack or basket .
 When it gets cold ... ice/snow ... this lock simply wo n't open . Needs to be heated at each end to allow locking mechanism to disengage . In my case I was able to wait for the weather to warm to above freezing -- then it would open .
 1 . The bike mount attachment is ridiculously fragile as it is just plastic . I tried to use it at first but it became impossible and VERY DANGEROUS as my U-Lock fell 2 times on the road while I was biking . I soon decided to buy a basket so I could put it inside -LRB- I even put scratches on it so it would not move an inch while riding -RRB- .2 . My U-lock litterally felt apart one day without no reason after just 5 months of use.So okay , I just told that my U-lock fell at the beginning b/c I was trying to use the attach . But after that , everything went perfectly fine for 4 months ... until last week ! I unlocked my lock and it fell apart in 3 pieces -LRB- the upper part of the lock with the plastic sides and the metallic part of the center -RRB- . It was really creepy because I could clearly see that some little parts of plastic were broken and that it was only plastic inside !!! I really do n't feel safe now ! I went to my bike store and they gave me another lock -LRB- same model -RRB- for free.I 've had the new one for one week now and I can already see that it is not reliable . It has trouble closing and today I saw that the plastic part that is connected to the metallic part was slightly dislocated . By pushing on it , it went back to its place but it is absolutely unacceptable for a 1 week U-lock that never received any shock !!! You could say that it was bad luck but my husband got the same model and is having some troubles as well . A few weeks after buying it , he noticed that the upper part of the lock was moving when the lock is closed . He kept using it until now -LRB- it 's been 5 months -RRB- but it is getting worse weeks after weeks ...
 I bought this lock last September . This lock is heavy but sturdy . The problem is I can not open it now after a rain . I think the water makes the lock rust and seized . I saw previous comments in which people mentioned the same problem . I regret failing to take them seriously . : -LRB-
 Product was enormous in size and had to be returned . We read numerous reviews and info on the product to try and determine size for a middle school boy of an average size . Quality was fine but the vest swallowed him .
 I also owned a Spyderco knife about 5 years ago and was upset when I 've lost it . I was really looking forward to receive the one that I 've bought but was supprised to see that it had changed ... the knife does n't feel robust as it used tothe materials seems cheeper then it used toeven the sounds it does -LRB- clicks and clacks ... -RRB- are not was they used to be.all in all I 'm not very pleased with Spyderco 's latest knife , would look for different brands next time
 I live in a pretty high bike theft area and was naively sold this U-lock from the local bike shop . Within 6 months of using this lock , it was cut right through with some kind of buzz saw and my bike was stolen . The bracket is awful ! It would n't secure the lock and I 've had the lock fallen off the bracket while riding . If you live in a low to moderate bike theft area , this lock may do but I would go with a sturdier lock like a Kryptonite in the future .
 I am writing this review 6 months after I purchased this lock . You see , I 'm the type of person who tends to drop things all the time and after 6 months of dropping this lock on the pavement , it finally broke apart into 6 pieces . My Master lock and my Kryptonite locks lasted longer.If you are a clumsy person like me , I would not recommend this lock at all .
 To begin the lock itself-the mechanism and shackle-are very sturdy and would be reliable BUT the part that has the key insert is fragile . Mine started coming apart . The two black parts on either side of the center part -LRB- with the key insert -RRB- started coming apart . Maybe it was from when I dropped it once when I was unlocking my bike . But it was like 3 feet high ... my old Bell U-lock from Walmart took those same accidental falls over and over.The Keys : - are not made from metal and feel like they could snap like a pencil -LRB- maybe thats why they give you 5 keys because they expect them to break -RRB- -LRB- And im talking about the actual key part , not the handle part of the key ... of course thats plastic -RRB- - get stuck unlocking/locking the lock if you arent careful , and so if you do end up buying any OnGuard lock -LRB- which you shouldnt -RRB- please be careful and patientThe Mount : - I threw it away because this lock is so long it wont fit on any bike . I have a large framed road bike and wouldnt fit anywhere - Probably wont install on oval shaped tubeAll in all somehow none of my keys would not unlock my lock this morning . I tried every key and sprayed some WD40 in the key hole but to no avail . I now have a lock that wont unlock.I do not suggest you buy any of their locks until they fix their locking mechanism and keys . And I 'm not being very critical , I loved this lock , dont get me wrong , I would have trusted it anywhere , but I cant open the lock with any of my keys .
 When I purchased the lock I liked that is a good size , got good reviews from people who test locks , and seemed to be good value for money . I bike to work five days a week.I used the lock regularly for eight months until today , when I dropped the lock part without the shackle attached . This was the first time I had dropped it . The plastic cover of the lock broke into pieces and flew off in all directions . The key would no longer turn to close the lock with the shackle in place.Lock went into the nearest trash can and I hope to find a different brand that can make a quality product .
 The lights are fine . The thing you attach to your bike that you mount the light on is cheap . You ca n't easily take the light on and off your bike . Mine broke the second time I used it . I have no bike light to compare this to , so maybe they are all like this . But this thing is a piece of junk in my book .
 I bought 3 of these lights for my family.This light set does have its plus sides ... rear light functions are great , it is very bright , and it installs very easy and out of the way . A + on the rear light.Front light dual light sources are very good . Extremely good coverage and is very bright . Light source A + . It 's all down hill from there : Batteries are difficult to remove , there is a design flaw the actually pins one battery in once installed . A work around is that you can you needle nose pliers to remove . Front light is very cheaply made , and DO NOT DROP IT . I had one in my back pack and it fell to the floor from about 3 feet and the light inside was in pieces . My wife had hers slip out of the handlebar mount and it shattered ... I could go on but you get the picture.The worst part of the set is the handlebar mount ... with in 3 weeks all 3 of the mounts quick release tabs have broken . Meaning the lights just slip out of the holder and fall to the ground -LRB- and shatter -RRB- unless you tape them onto the mount . I tried to contact Bell Manufacturing directly and of course they do n't offer a replacement part , nor a guarantee.My advice is - Buy a different light set . Or else this one will end up shattered , taped to your handlebars , or ... as we have done ... used for camping .
 I ASKED FOR A LIGHT SET WITH ALL THE LIGHTS NOT JUST ONE , ALTHOUGH IT DID WORK IT WAS JUST A SINGLE PRODUCT
 I love the features offered by these lights , however , like several other reviewers , the headlamp stopped working after two uses . Apparently it had faulty circuitry that `` blew '' after battery power was put through it a couple of times . Too bad . If the product had lasted , I would have given it five stars . Maybe it was just a single bad batch from the factory since others have had good luck with theirs . Definitely worth the price ... if it works .
 I went through two lights in one week during the winter . The cheap plastic breaks easily . The shells are hard to separate to change batteries . The attachments to the bicycle break . The light is bright , but not worth the price . The rear light is broken . The front is held by packing tape . However , the lights are bright and good for protection . Shame on Bell . Spend a few more dollars for better quality that will last .
 I had to return this product on the day I received it from amazon.When I opened up the product to insert the battery , the light set literally crumbled in my hands . And I was being careful.In my disbelief I inspected it further and new pieces kept falling apart . The very tiny and cheap plastic piece holding the bulb fell apart next , the tiny metal and precariously soldered piece holding the circuit just gave up doing what it was made to do . And all this 10 minutes out of the package.God forbid I actually have to mount this thing on a bike and expose it to the elements.I returned it immediately . Poor product , poor experience and I had to eat the shipping cost .
 My main issue is with the tail light . You ca n't just turn it on and off . You have to cycle through all the blinking options -LRB- 7 -RRB- in order to turn it off . Plus , you ca n't do this quickly because sometimes the inconveniently placed , micro-sized on/off button gets stuck inside the casing -- especially when trying to go through the stages quickly . And forget about messing with this light if you are wearing gloves .
 The tail light has worked well for quite some time , has many light modes , and stays on the bike well , but its construction is not that great so I 'm just waiting . The headlight is another story.This was given to me as a gift and that 's the only reason I have it . I 've never known Bell to make quality bike parts and the headlight is no exception . As others have noted , the lamp mounting design is terrible where it easily falls off while you are riding and ends-up into a bunch of pieces when it hits the ground or you run over it.I 've been able to keep mine working by taping it together , but finally I took a fall the other day and the base of the light that slides on to the handlebar clip broke into a million pieces -LRB- very cheap plastic construction -RRB- and no amount of tape/glue/etc will ever hold it . Also had on my bike a Cat Eye LED light -LRB- that I 've had for years -RRB- that took even more force from the fall and it was n't even scratched .
 Perhaps the build quality on these lights is spotty , and that accounts for the wide range of opinions on it . Mine broke after I got back from the first ride . The front light part of it became loose , and fell , and it does not work any more . I would not buy this item . In the time it did work , I thought the beam of light was much too diffuse . I have previously owned a cateye light , and it was much more sturdy and had a better beam of light .
 The light itself is so-so . The mount is cheap and poorly designed . I put one on my Stepdads bike it fell and broke on the 3rd week.Don ' t buy it .
 This is an overall good light . The only problem with it is the clamps that are provided . If dropped , the light breaks into pieces that can be put back together again , but that takes time . Is not user friendly to other clamps . The light is good but the clamps make it not worth the purchase .
 The front light was DOA and the back light took me a day to figure out . I resorted to finding instructions written by previous owners.The back light seems to be working just fine . I 've not yet mounted it but that appears to be the consensus with previous reviewers . Flipping through the various light modes I felt like Kate Reid in the Andromeda Strain . It 's BRIGHT & I 'm seeing more stars than this product 's reviews.You get what you pay for , basically .
 The lights on this thing work . That 's nice . However , neither of the fittings are big enough to fit my bike . I have an Iron Horse Competition mountain bike . So unless you have relatively thin handlebars and seat rod , I 'm avoid this product . I 'm stuck with a useless set .
 I used the headlight for a few weeks before the device that allowed me to take it on and off the bicycle broke . The headlight is now stuck permanently on the bicycle - even if I have to leave my bike out in the rain or in a high-theft area .
 My husband bought this for me for my commute home from work . Although it is fine on main city streets , once I turned onto my cross street , -LRB- no street lights -RRB- I was pretty much on my own in the dark . Cars would be able to see the light in the dark , but it was n't powerful enough to illuminate the street before me . I am returning it after one use .
 At first I thought this was a great light , very inexpensive , pretty bright , several modes and all . I bought it becuase I always ride home after dark , and I wanted to see ahead of me , and let cars see me . First of all , it isnt all that bright to see the road in front of you , but more than bright enough for cars to see me . Second of all , the day I bought it , I was riding home and as I was cornering , it came right out of the clip that holds it and went underneath my tires and broke . I was very disapointed . The same day . What a piece of crap.P.S . From all the use I gave it , the tail light worked great .
 Very poorly constructed switch . Press it just a little too hard and its internal glue breaks . After that it lets rainwater in to short everything out . Not a terrible unit for the price if you are very careful with it and never use it in the rain . Flashing mode is adequate for letting people see you , but not otherwise particularly bright . It 's an inexpensive unit that may last a couple of months .
 Back in 2005 when i bought my 1st Bicycle i also got this light combo -LRB- Whereas my front light was gray in hue , unlike the black/gray one you see here -RRB- thinking it was a good buy , wrong!This product is as shoddy as most `` BEll products '' are.The rear light went out first , then the front light shorted out after a minor drop.Later after having my bicycle stolen while using a Bell bike lock i 've learned not to trust the viability of `` Bell products '' ever again.That 's why i 'm now a `` Cateye 's '' and `` Nite Ize '' product fan.Learn from my mistake and avoid buying this product at all cost .
 I used to use this lamp . The good
 Fell apart the very first day I used it . I happened to hit a small bump in the road , since the head light contained 4 AA batteries it was heavy and broke off the mounting . Hit the the road and smashed into pieces . I would not recommend at all .
 This thing changes time each time it is slightly bumped . The carabiner and housing is rather sturdy but the first sentence is the deal breaker . I do not recommend this watch at all .
 I ordered This almost 20 Days Ago And still Havent recieved it.So Im Completely Done With this seller.If you Expect it a Certin Time Dont Bother .
 I owned a similar Columbia jacket years ago -LRB- not sure exact style -RRB- but I know that even then I would n't have spend an arm and a leg on it , so I figured it was reasonable to compare the two . This jacket feels incredibly cheap ! It 's ok , keeps me warm . A nice light fleece , but I was expecting something a little heavier and more durable . Hanging this over the back of my chair , I was worried that the posts on the chair were going to pop a hole through ! They are n't pointy and are a good size , at least an inch , and this was n't by exerting any sort of force on the jacket.The seller shipped me the wrong color anyway , and I 'm supposed to be getting a full refund . Otherwise , I 'd likely return it and fork some money out for something worthwhile .
 Although I ordered the size I usually wear , the sleeves were much too long and it was n't large enough around the bust even though it was advertised as being loose fitting . Apparently this item was designed for tall , slender women with long arms . The advertising is misleading .
 I was trying unsuccessfully to replace a really nice white Columbia fleece jacket that I bought some years ago which resisted stains amazingly , looks really nice on me , and goes with everything . This is not it . This -LRB- Benton Springs Style Number 209 WL 6114 -RRB- is a cheap imitation of my old fleece Columbia jacket -LRB- style number 207 WL6114 -RRB- . I bought three Benton Springs jackets on 1-27-2010 at Sports Authority and I 'm returning at least the two white ones , where the difference in quality is really noticable . I 'm going to keep a navy blue one where the inferior cut , styling , workmanship , and quality control is not as noticable . In white , mine look cheap and slightly flawed , workmanship wise . I have another white fleece jacket from Walmart with the same problem that came as a liner with a -LRB- cheap -RRB- white raincoat.Another difference is that the new ones are fuzzier , softer and thicker and the white is pinker . That would be fine if it hung and fit nicely like it 's predessor.It 's so hard to replace women 's clothes when they wear out , even in classic styles . Often I have to go to another brand to get the same thing since it 's `` out of style '' in the brand I start with . Are they assuming it never wears out ? The zipper eventually broke on my original Columbia fleece jacket , not before I got a lot of wear out of it , and a white jacket can not stay stain free forever even though this fabric was very stain resistant .
 I ordered this item through Amazon from The Fashion Rack on December 8 , 2010 and never recieved it . I have ordered many things from Amazon and have always received them , but did not recieve my order from The Fashion Rack or a response from The Fashion Rack . I watched the USPS tracking as it came to my state then went to a totally different state . I emailed The Fashion Rack through Amazon and never got a response to my email . I have emailed a second time still waiting to hear something .
 I ordered this columbia fleece in a size small . I received it today and it was a medium . The tag on the inside of the jacket says medium , and the sticker on the bag it was packaged it said medium , but the price tag said it was a small . The jacket is way too big for me , and I would like to return it . I am hesitant though , because I 'm worried that if I return it and order from this seller again I will receive another jacket in the wrong size . Has anyone else had this problem ?
 My whole life , people have made unflattering assumptions about my strength . This little Asian girl , they think to themselves , is surely incapable of throwing that ball weighing less than 1 % of her body mass . News flash
 I was satisfied with the lock until the key broke within a week of using it . The locking mechanism was jammed and when I gave the key the slightest bit of pressure , a 1cm piece of the key broke inside the lock . The way the keys are cut , the skeleton is way too fragile and flimsy to handle any excessive torque when turning the lock.I contacted onguard customer service and was able to return the lock and receive a replacement chain lock with a code lock instead of the key lock .
 The lock itself is great ; it 's sturdy , compact , and easy to use . Multiple keys are handy , it unlocks without much trouble , and it 's just the right size to go around my road bike frame and tire . Google `` Sheldon Brown bike lock '' for a good technique , this lock works perfectly for his recommended method . 5 stars for the lock.The mounting bracket , however , is terrible . The cinching strap never tightens enough to keep the lock from moving all over the place , the tightening bolt strips out entirely too easily , and the most recent issue is that the actual slot that the lock sits in broke out , rendering the entire bracket useless . Now I either have to hook the lock around the frame and listen to it rattle around and scratch up the paint , or put it in my backpack . 0 stars for the bracket.Bottom line
 This lock worked well for the first 6 months until the locking mechanism started to have trouble engaging . A few months later , the lock jammed and the key broke off inside the unit . A locksmith could n't even salvage it . Replaced it with a Kryptonite Evolution 4 , which appears to have a more robust locking mechanism .
 The lock jammed within 2 days of using it , after it rained . Now its locked outside a shop luckily a block away from my house . I 'm afraid of breaking the key . I 've walked to my bike on three different occasions to try to jiggle it free . I 'm going to try to use motor oil to maybe loosen the pins but in short , unless you want your bike stuck somewhere , where you ca n't free it without looking like a thief , do n't buy this lock
 After using this lock for only two days i accidentally dropped the lock from a foot or less off the ground only to have the whole casing for the lock come off . After trying to put it on for 15 minutes i finally gave up figuring out that the plastic holding -LRB- yes it is plastic , not rubber as you would think -RRB- the enclosure together was broken.Now i have a naked lock that is probably going to rust and have my key break off in it anytime soon . If you take off the plastic enclosure you see that all that technology that onguard claims to have is basically a cheap mastercraft lock with a plastic enclosure to conceal its true identity.Bottom line if you want a durable lock which does n't have cheap components and might last you more than a day . For those of you who think you wo n't drop it , think again . You will try to lock it but the locking mechanism does n't hold the lock and you let go -LRB- at least this is what happened to me -RRB- .
 I purchased this lock at a bike store . I ride my bicycle 5 days a week and move it about 6 times a day -LRB- so the lock gets used 12 times a day -RRB- , and I always bring my bike inside if it 's going to rain . After about two weeks , I inserted the key and the lock simply would not turn . I tried using WD-40 on it with still no luck . I ended up having to get campus police to break the lock off my bike , and I ended up missing a class.Although it is sturdy and a good design , I do NOT recommend this lock at all .
 It is a lot of pain using this lock . The metal of the keys are `` soft '' , easy to be bent when rotating inside the lock for the purpose of locking and unlocking . Once they are bent , it becomes a `` tricky '' task for locking and unlocking . Typically I paid more than one minute for this process every time , and I am surprised to find every key -LRB- they give us four -RRB- has same problem . Even worse , I just got my key broken into two halves when trying to unlock it , and one half got firmly stuck inside the tiny little hole of the lock . I had to use a saw to cut the lock off to get my bike back . I feel depressed and angry . Btw , the lock itself is also hard to use.I strongly recommend nobody uses it -LRB- any more -RRB- .
 The construction quality left much to be desired . The key provided was very flimsy and after 2 weeks of normal use , the lock it self became jammed . NOT recommended ...
 OnGuard customer service offered a replacement but I decided to move on to Kryptonite locks . I would n't want to get another OnGuard lock and have my key get stuck in the cylinder again . It took me 30 mins just to unlock my bike only to have my key get stuck once opened . Never again , OnGuard.I 'll give it 2 stars because it does offer great protection and it worked fine for a year . Perhaps I just got a bad lock but I would n't risk it again .
 This lock would be great if the key did n't snap off or permanently jam itself into the mechanism . -LRB- Other than the fact that the bracket attachment is a completely worthless black plastic piece of trash . UNFORTUNATELY , the key does snap off and or jam irreversibly with literally almost zero effort on behalf of the user.Thank God I was able to unlock the thing with my key still jammed into the hole after trying to lock up to a tree near my apartment . I now have the option of using both pieces as paperweights for separate , lightweight , easily blown materials , or I can stick the two pieces together to hold down heavy duty things like tagboard , or perhaps a single cardboard box . If only the key could be removed , I could potentially even use this to continue securing my bike ! Would n't that be a treat ? To no avail . Thanks for nothing OnGuard . I wish nothing but bankruptcy and class action law suits on you .
 I 've left my original review below so you know what I thought about this lock when I first bought it . Fast forward to this morning when I 'm trying to lock my bike up and the D-Lock explodes into pieces . I 'm not talking about something falling off , I 'm talking about it completely collapsing into a number of broken pieces and being completely unusable ! I will never buy another lock from this company again and will now have to fork out more money on a lock that will stay in one piece . Before you consider buying this lock , think about it ... if the lock breaks apart ON ITS OWN , whats going to stop a thief from breaking into it when its locking up your precious bike?DO NOT BUY !!!! ORIGINAL REVIEW : I 'm an avid cyclist and have been cycling for many years . I have a more expensive bike back home that I lock with a very expensive lock . Now that I am at school riding a refurbished bike from the 70 's I do n't place as much value on locking it up but I have a basis to compare this lock with the high end locks . The first difference I noticed is that these are nowhere near as hefty as my expensive locks . Most average cyclists would prefer this lower weight though as it makes it easier to ride around whilst carrying the locks . The other point I can compare is that instead of a cable , my high end locks uses high density chain instead . Frankly , in my experience , cables are completely useless . Any thief with a pair of bolt cutters can slice through that baby like butter . When you lock your bike , put the U-Lock through your frame and if you can , also put it through a spoke -LRB- preferrably in the rear -RRB- . This leads me to another complaint . This U-Lock is TINY . A lot of times I have tried to lock my bike up and there just is n't enough room between the U-Lock and my bike to fit it back together . Take my advice and get the bigger size and you 'll be better off.Overall , the lock does a very good job as long as you position the U-Lock properly and just use the cable as an extra measure -LRB- I put mine through the front tire and connect it to the U-Lock at the back -RRB- . The size is a little small but it seems hefty enough . The size is partly the reason for my low rating but its heftiness kept it up a little . What also really brought it down was the bracket they give you . It is completely useless . It is a very flimsy plastic piece that holds this heavy lock onto your bike and through normal bouncing and riding it breaks ... VERY FAST . In fact within a week of getting this lock , the bracket had half broken off . I do n't even use it anymore . This is not a problem for me as I have a tray on the back of my bike to carry it but my girlfriend has the same lock and now she 's screwed . Do n't rely on it .
 i 've had this lock for about a year now , but only started using it regularly since cycling to work a couple times a week this month . i 've used it less than 10 times , never dropped it , and kept it indoors , used in covered parking lot.the last time it actually locked , it was really finicky and gave me hell when i tried to engage the lock and then yesterday , this stupid lock got stuck . key goes in and turns lock/unlock but once i try to connect the u part to the lock - the key gets stuck ! i ca n't turn the key -LRB- engage lock -RRB- nor pull the key out unless i remove the u part.no amount of wd40 to all ports engages the lock to actually perform is intended funtion - lock together.gonna buy a kryp like i should of in the first place : -LRB- its cute , small , hefty and looks like it will be work like a kryp ... . but . it . is . a. piece . of . crap ... . or now a repurposed wd40 soaked paper weight and horse shoe .
 So at first I had problems with the holster breaking since it was made of cheap plastic . They were not helpful at all in replacing that low cost piece.The lock itself is completely falling apart right now . Granted I purchased it in 2009 and here we are in 2011 , but I would expect something that 's supposed to be super sturdy and strong to last much longer than 2 years . All I can say is that the engineering , construction , and quality of the materials are all cheap . I will never buy another OnGuard product again .
 I bought this two years ago and used it sparingly since I normally ride without stopping . This little bugger has worked alright , there has always been some difficulty getting it on/off . Recently , I locked my bike at work and the locking mechanism is now stuck and will not let me turn the key fully . I will have to cut this off to get my bike back .
 First off , this lock is still functional after about a year of constant use . So that 's why it gets two stars . It 's just that everything else is lacking : The bike mount broke after three months . Apparently you can only adjust the position once or twice , and then the mechanism strips out . Had to buy a new one of a different brand.It 's about a half inch too small . I know the small size makes it stronger , but that half inch would help soooo much . I need the cable to lock my front wheel , and to lock to anything that is not a bike rack.It 's begun to rust everywhere . I ride my bike in the light rain , and the inside of the lock is fully rusted . I 'm surprised it still works.It 's really heavy.It rattles a lot.I know many of these minuses are a fact of life for a heavy duty lock , but the rust , rattling and bike mount are just poor design .
 Bought this lock about a year ago . I used it everyday until with minimal troubles until about a month ago when it would take me 5-10 turns of the key to unlock or lock the bike . Finally today , after 3 twisted/ruined keys -LRB- no wonder they give you so many -RRB- I have given up on this lock . It should not take 5 minutes to unlock/lock your bike every time !
 The lock itself seems sturdy enough , but its accessories are useless . The lock holder -LRB- to attach to your frame -RRB- broke after 3 rides , and the key seems fragile enough where I believe I could -LRB- and will -RRB- easily break it off within the lock ; maybe that 's why they give you 6 keys.Fat lot of good this lock will do me if I ca n't take it anywhere .
 What follows is my email to OnGuard customer service -LRB- I 've yet to hear back -RRB- after getting my THIRD bracket replaced with the oft-mentioned `` updated '' bracket . This is what you 'll have to deal with after you purchase this lock : I requested a new/updated mounting bracket from you earlier this week -LRB- after mine broke twice in a year -RRB- and just received the new-and-improved bracket in the mail ... Great , right ? Wrong . Here 's what I discovered :1 . Zero documentation of any kind with the package or online.Ok , that 's not too bad , I 'm a crafty guy ... 2 . Oh , I have to cut the protective plastic on my u-lock to get the spline to fit?Sure , I can handle that too ... 3 . The spline is on the u-lock , but what 's this ? It does n't fit snugly after I tighten the screws ? No , it just slips right off - even at max tightness ! Should I shim this sucker ? That does n't seem right ... And that 's as far as I got before I gave up and decided to send you a message with my issue -LRB- s -RRB- . Here 's what I 'm looking for :1 . Documentation -LRB- of any kind -RRB- If I 'm not a total idiot -LRB- which I may be -RRB- and I did n't miss some vital piece of information/understanding to secure the spline to my u-lock2 . A new bracket -LRB- one that fits * and * comes with instructions -RRB- And -LRB- god forbid -RRB- if that does n't work ,3 . A refund -LRB- or new lock -RRB- and explanation of what you 'll do in the future to fix this problem and retain my continued business.Regards , REDACTEDLoyal OnGuard CustomerPS
 i bought this after the key broke off in my kryptonite after a couple of years of solid use . i was disappointed with the quality of the locking mechanism right off the bat and after only 1 weeks worth of use the key got jammed in the lock and would not come out . bad news bears . buy a chain and pad lock instead -- wo n't stop a serious thief , but then again , what will ?
 so i 've used this lock a total of 2.5 times successfully . on the third try i was trying to lock it and it was putting up a fight . then it locked and i tried to pull the key out . the key would n't come out ! so i unlocked it and it still would n't come out . i started struggling with it -LRB- gently though because i 've read the other reviews -RRB- and then it happened ... my key broke . i guess i 'll try to contact the company but for now i 'm just going to use the cable and cross my fingers that my bike wo n't get jacked . yeah right .
 I just got a new hitch mounted bike rack for my car . I needed a good lock to make sure that my bikes were safe when I was not with the car . I researched as many locks as I could and decided on this one . When I received the lock , I was surprised at the weight of the package . I am sure this is a very good product , but I did not want such a heavy , bulky lock as this one . Definitely a bull dog . In addition , I was surprised at the cable that came with it . Not as sturdy as the lock , for sure.I should have checked the description of the weight of the lock before ordering . I returned the lock and cable . In this case , I should have just gone to a local store to see and study bike locks first .

 I bought the onguard U lock after a thief cut my cable lock and made off with my brand new bike . It is heavy , but easy to use . I was very happy with it for a month and a half until one day I tried to unlock it and it no longer worked . Key only goes in half way . Luckily it was not on my bike at the time .
 I do n't know if the label is correct but I got a lock that looks different from the picture . I had an old lock like the one in the pic that I liked . I like this one less as the key gets jammed more .
 I lost my OnGuard lock that looks like the one in the picture , with the silver insert in the middle , which worked fabulous for a couple years.Unfortunately , this is not the product . This one is a bit longer than that , is all black on top with yellow emblem , and yellow rubber covers at the ends.I almost always have trouble getting this lock to close and open . Seems like the locking mechanism is incredible finicky and ca n't seem to align right . I took it to a bike store and they tried to oil it up and make it work better but it has n't improved at all.Hopefully Bulldog will replace it under warranty ?
 I purchased this watch in March 2006 because I liked the features -LRB- laps , timer , two time zones , etc. ... -RRB- While it was impossible to determine from the promotional photos , the first thing I noticed was that the band was molded to the watch body and would be difficult to replace . I was discouraged to have my suspicions about the band confirmed by reviewer Henry Perkins -LRB- who states that Timex does not make replacement band available -- I have not personally verified this with Timex -RRB- . It is now almost June 2007 and over the last weekend , the watchband band cracked about halfway across -- approximately 15 months after I purchased the watch . I wear the watch daily and , as a watch , it seemed to function well -- I also used the lap function regularly ; the timer and alarm functions occasionally , and the second time zone rarely . I did notice that the second time zone seemed to auto reset on occasion and for some reason the total laps went from 150 to 137 , but I never really investigated or followed up on these issues so I am unsure what the real problems were . The faceplate fell off several months ago , which made the watch unsightly and very easy to scratch the crystal . Nonetheless , the watch remained functional until the band cracked . Now it is junk.I used to have a Timex Ironman on which the band failed every six months or so -LRB- at least the new watch band lasted 15 months -RRB- . On the old watch , it was easy to replace the band . While I was unhappy with the poor quality of the old Timex band , at least it could be replaced . This new version is a dud -- I 'll have to throw away an expensive watch because it can not be serviced.I recommend you look for a different watch -- that 's what I 'll be doing .
 Be careful when ordering this item . The description says mens competition ball but it is size W5000 -LRB- womens or varsity -RRB- not W6000 so look for the right size .
 This not a real military grade canteen . I was under the impretion that it was when i bought it but i was sadly mistaken . The reason that i had purchesed this was because i wanted one like my dad who is now retired from the military . It is still a good way to hold water but i was looking for better quality .
 Was hoping this would be the same as the standard issue canteen I lost but instead its made of a good deal thinner plastic and is much less heavy duty .
 If you need a military looking bottle for show , then this canteen will do . But , if you want to take it outdoors where it will get shaken and squeezed , it will leak all over your gear . Cap does n't hold any pressure .
 For something this was designed to carry water , It failed because it leaked . A LOT.Maybe mine was just a bad one . Still shouldnt happen . But the seller was easy to get a hold of and did n't give any problems for my return . Seller Was Captain Dave . I give them 5 Stars .
 Knew it would n't be heavy duty for the price , but I did expect it to actually hold water . And it does , if you do n't turn it upside down . I tried several careful cap screw-ons , to make sure I was n't mis-threading it , but no , every time I held it upside down and shook , it dribbled water out . If you just need something that will mostly hold water for a day outing or to carry water out to the plants or something and you can keep it in the upright position all the time , it 'll get you by . But for any kind of use where it gets stowed in a bag and jostled around , this is n't it . Even for a low price , something described as a canteen should be water tight.Update
 This canteen is nothing like I expected . It is a lot thinner than the other military grade canteens I own it is more like a toy canteen you would expect to come with a cheap halloween costume . Would not buy again , do yourself a favor and go to an army surplus store and get the real deal . It does hold water and does n't leak , otherwise I would give it one star .
 Not a bad canteen ... besides the fact that it LEAKS EVERYWHERE !!! After a thin s *** ty piece of rubber fell out of the cap , the canteen became as useful as carrying a full glass of water everywhere around with you . It also is made with extremely thin plastic compared toMy other good mil-surplus canteens . Not too impressed with Rothco right now ...
 I bought these as an alternative to storing my comics in ugly boxes , hidden away . My comics are all from the 90s-current . The sleeves are too wide . When I put the boards in between each comics -LRB- i 'd put two , one facing each way with a board between them -RRB- there was still a lot of room on each side to allow the comics to rub against one another . Also , I guess I did n't realize before getting them that the top of the sleeves will always remain open , allowing air , moisture , and anything else to get in . If you dropped the binder , and it turned upside down , the comics could also slip out.I guess this can be avoided with keeping the comics in their own bags inside the sleeves , but that just seems too messy for me .
 The description & pictures show clear pages with a pocket , sized for comic books . What I received were 8x10 photo pages that are way too big for comic books ! There is nothing printed on this box that states these are the comic book pages , only for 8x10 photos , so I do n't know how you can mistaken them !
 Great shipping received it fast . But it was not what i thought it was . There is no laser with this product you have to buy it too . So my fault for not reading description enough !!
 This sounds delicious . It would be nice if I had actually received it . Someone on my list went without a Christmas present & I still do n't have a refund . SportsKids claims that these folks shipped my sauce set to someone across the country according to Amazon . This set gets shipped third party . Maybe I 'm the first person to write a review because no one has actually seen this set of sauces .
 We had parents that graciously donated this to our little league football team and unfortunately the durability of the carrier did not hold up . The part where you hold it broke on both sides . The part that the water bottles go into stayed intact . Just ca n't hold the carrier as it is intended w/o the handle part . Wish that it would 've held up better ! Did not last throughout the season -LRB- maybe only part of -RRB- and too bad the parents did n't get what they paid for .
 I bought this for my husband after he lost his Hydryx Workout Towel . He says this Cramer workout towel does n't even compare to the Hydryx towel . It does n't feel the same and when it dries , it dries hard so it 's not comfortable to use .
 We were disappointed in this product . It said that instructions were enclosed , but they were not . It would not connect to my Christmas tree light set , so it is just a plain , blue ball -- no Giants logo or ID at all . I would not give this any stars , but your program requries that I do in order to submit my review .
 There has been absolutely no snow in the state of Minnesota this year . This being said , I bought my nephew a sled for Christmas which has become a joke because I told him maybe he would be able to use it next year . Since Christmas , there has been enough snow for 2 neighborhood sled days . I say neighborhood sled days because there are not any extreme hills or rough terrain to sled on in their neighborhood . The brake broke the 1st day ! A broken brake does n't keep this sled from being usable & it is fast -- but I think if you are going to have an option like a brake on a sled that as a customer I should expect it to last longer than a day . It IS built as a `` kids ' sled '' . Unfortunately , they did n't tell me about it breaking right away so now I missed the return deadline .
 I purchased this sled as a Christmas gift to my son . I received the item in a timely manner , however , the sled was damaged in multiple areas . The seller only packaged the sled in a black plastic bag and it offered zero protection for the sled . After contacting the seller , who was courteous and understanding , and notifying them of this they told me that they could n't put the sled in an actual box without charging more for shipping for an oversized package fee . They then refunded my money.The sled itself seems to be somewhat durable yet flimsy at the same time . It seems like it would go over snow fairly easily but any excessive use would ultimately break it in a heartbeat.If anyone wants to purchase this sled then I would highly recommend them purchasing it from a company that will ship it in a box to keep it protected . A black bag is not justifiable protection for a thin plastic sled .
 Purchased for Christmas , first time out the end of January and it literally broke in half the first time sledding downhill ! My 12yr old 72lb son was on it and did n't even get to use it a 2nd time . Would ask for a refund if I thought it was worth the trouble of fighting them for it ! Would not recommend to anyone !
 This sled was a birthday present for my 13 year old son . He was thrilled on that early December day . We finally got a chance to use it on Dec 26th . He only weighs 60 lbs but the sled was cracked in 2 different places in less than an hour . This is very disappointing ... especially for the price we paid . After this sled broke we resorted to sledding on those $ 6 roll up pieces of plastic and had a great time . And they did n't crack . I will attempt to get a replacement or a refund on this Paricon Winter Heat sled .
 Used this sled the night of a new snowfall - worked well for a few runs . Came back the next day , when the snow was more packed from more sledders using the hill . After the first run , a handle and side cracked off . On the second run , the back corner cracked off . On the third run , the other side cracked off . The fourth run was never completed ; the sled literally cracked in half . The front of the sled kept going , the back just lay there while I was sent aimlessly rolling down the hill . This product is amazingly cheap . Would you let your kids use a sled that breaks up into sharp plastic bits ? I guess it depends how much you like them . Zero stars .
 I have ordered may products via Amazon and this is the first time I am not happy ... this toboggan arrived in poor condition . I am unable to give it as a gift as intended due to the used appearance . Do not intend to order from the company Paricon , Inc again .
 We were very disapointed with this sled . We bought it to take our two year old sledding . On the very first run my husband went down it broke ! The whole handle and side piece . My husband is n't overweight -LRB- 6 ' 1 &#34; - 180lbs -RRB- , so we were really bummed that it broke right away . We then bought a cheap $ 11 one from Ace Hardware and that has lasted multiple trips , sometimes with three moms on it !
 We have n't had a chance to use the sled yet , but it looks sturdy and friends of ours have the same model and are happy with it . Still , i am disappointed that we got a RED sled when the product image is BLACK . I ordered this sled on purpose because i did n't want any bright color , but at this price it 's easier to keep the color i do n't want than mail it back at my own cost .

 I ordered this from `` MetaRetail Inc '' which is what was the main seller at least when I bought it . The price was marked as `` $ 8.59 -LRB- $ 2.86 / Item -RRB- '' which means that I was supposed to get 3 as the picture showed . But I was only sent 1 . The price for the 1 is n't THAT bad but the listing is clear that I should have gotten 3 . False advertising .
 Gold Bond works much better than this stuff . It cools better and seems to absorb better too . Anti Monkey Butt does nothing that Gold Bond or the generics do n't , and I do n't like the fragrance at all . It smells like a diaper mixed with perfume . The monkey butt gimmick is just that - a gimmick to get you to buy a mediocre product . I 'll be going with another brand .
 I ordered a new expensive powder that is for athletes and purchased just one in return I get 3 bottles of stuff I could have bought down the road without the expensive shipping . I called to tell them and they were young girls who were rude !!! So now I have to spend more money shipping it back when its now my fault for false advertising and people who ca n't read one bottle not 3 !! Dont shop here !!!
 According to the information on the website , these socks were listed as being 79 % cotton , 20 % stretch nylon , and 1 % spandex . When I received them , the label on them says they are 67 % cotton , 17 % acrylic , 15 % nylon , and 1 % spandex ... this is not what I wanted . Also , they are very thin and run small . I am disappointed and will not buy socks again online .
 Gold Toe Women 's Classic Crew SockThe socks are thin and instead of elastic to hold them up , have one tight thread around the top . They might do the job if you always wear socks down and need thin . The name `` gold toe '' lead me to believe it would be a quality , thick walking sock .
 I love the cooler it holds a alot . My problem with it is the zipper broke the insertion pin on the zipper broke of the second time I used the cooler . If you buy this DO NOT TAKE OF THE LID !
 Although the machine is well constructed and the motors are excellent -LRB- basically the same as all the other ball machines -RRB- the company who designed the electronics for this machine does n't have a clue what they are doing ! The electronics SHOULD be simple , but they are not , they are a total kludge and WILL burn out on you in a few short months -LRB- if you 're lucky to get that long -RRB- . Replacement parts are EXPENSIVE if you try to get it fixed from the manufacturer . It is a known problem with this machine , I spoke with several repair companies and they will not touch it because they know the problems with it.So Avoid at all costs !

When I received them , the label on them says they are 67 % cotton , 17 % acrylic , 15 % nylon , and 1 % spandex ... this is not what I wanted . Also , they are very thin and run small . I am disappointed and will not buy socks again online .
 Gold Toe Women 's Classic Crew SockThe socks are thin and instead of elastic to hold them up , have one tight thread around the top . They might do the job if you always wear socks down and need thin . The name `` gold toe '' lead me to believe it would be a quality , thick walking sock .
 DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY !!! The Major problem with these Pedals is the Polymer/Plastic Body incasing/housing the Spindle.They simply do not hold up to stress , & repetitive use.I got a set of these on a Schwinn Race Bike , -LRB- stock -RRB- only dubbed `` Cycle Magic '' in short the left Pedal BLEW OUT within a few weeks time ! BOOO Schwinn !!! Shame on you for using inferior components on expensive DEALER ONLY Bikes !!! Even though the name on this , & other polymer pedals very well may be different , or not present at all you know as well as I do that OEM 's produce products for various companies , -LRB- the exact same products -RRB- and the truth remains the same . Any pedal with a thin Plastic Sleeve housing the Spindle will either wear through quickly , or EXPLODE like a firecracker on the 4th as one of mine did . Think `` Alloy '' Body , -LRB- preferably Aluminium -RRB- or you 're simply wasting you Time , & Money !
 I bought this one because the brand has a good reputation and the cost is very good , but in the second play with this glove , the support of the basket broke . And that is because the material of that support it 's not for fast throw , it 's very soft . The other things of this glove is good , confortable and good for soft play .
 I played with this glove no more than 6 games and now it is broken , it ` not a good glove , the price is really good but that glove does n't works !!!!!
 Poor Gloves . . Plastic ... My son used just once , them it is broken . . Bad option for a softball glove , despite the price
 These things are very cheaply made and do n't snap shut solidly . I 'd recommend caps with real latches . I replaced mine with Weaver brand .
 I tried $ 50 - $ 60 sets from Regent -LRB- who apparently also does Spalding -RRB- , Franklin , and Sportcraft , and only got a usable set by combining parts from 2 sets -LRB- alternately , one should check out manufacturer part replacement policies in advance , including who pays Shipping costs -RRB- . Regent and Sportcraft had several handles with too few threads , inviting breakage . Franklin wood and threads were such that 1 mallet 's threads stripped when tightening by hand , and 1 had poor threads because the wood narrowed and flattened . Some Sportcraft end caps rolled under , and they claimed their 2 '' balls were 3 '' -LRB- if they were rounding , why do n't they round their 3 5/16 '' balls as well ? -RRB- . Franklin 's stakes had different tapers , and about 1/16 '' different diameters . On the personal preference front , Sportscraft 's handles are grooved , Franklin 's balls are , and their wickets are narrow . Regent 's colors are dull . Rated 1 Star because sets tend to be priced by the size of the equipment , and this is too expensive for mislabeled 2 '' balls .
 I purchased this poncho several years ago as a lightweight piece of raingear for my backpacking trip through Central America . When I received it , I tried it on with askance , dubious about its longevity due to the thin material . Several weeks into my trip , a heavy rainstorm erupted and I reached for my poncho . When I put it on , it ripped down the middle ! I tried to adjust it to minimize rain exposure , but this only served to exacerbate the situation . The poncho literally self-destructed on me , and I was left soaked and unhappy with this piece of -LRB- crap -RRB- .
 This poncho works while it stays together . The problem is the heavy -LRB- no , it is not light as some reviewers insist -RRB- PVC material . It is waterproof , yes , but it rips and tears easily . At nearly one pound , the alternative ponchos made out of superior materials like ripstop SilNyl -LRB- lighter and stronger -RRB- are an easy choice over this one.I bought mine from Amazon in 2008 and carried it daily for about a month before it started to rip at seams . I repaired it several times with duct tape -LRB- especially around the collar area -RRB- before upgrading to a stronger and lighter poncho made of SilNyl .
 It does not look as good as the picture.We also ordered a black color , but we received a green one .
 This is definitely not worth the money , , its way too thin and the neck is too small to go over the head .
 PANCHO , Size is very big , its says select a size price 5.47 and 9.38 , they send me -LRB- 10MM Universal size which is too big -RRB- , Big size big money I did n't order big size still they send me universal size to make more money . smell chemical I have allergies I Cant use this.Very Bad material and quality . Stay away from this PANCHO . What a waste of money . . in picture look very good . .
 I purchased this poncho with the hope I could use it more than once . That was not the case . I used it once while backpacking in the High Uintas , in Utah , and I wo n't use it again . The Poncho kept me dry during a torrential downpour , but when I got back to camp I noticed a large 12 inch + tear -- I do n't recall snagging any branches . Then , when I tried to remove the poncho , I put a little pressure on the snap and it ripped out . I was very disappointed and not impressed by the ponchos performance .
 I did not inform myself what .10 mm means in regard to thickness or weight ; so , I was a bit disappointed with this product . But , it does keep the rain off and did fit my 6 ' plus son .
 This is a lot bigger than I thought it would be and the material is pretty thin .
 As another reviewer noted , this poncho is not high enough quality to stand for multiple/regular use . I have worn this poncho on 4 different occasions when riding my bike in the rain
 Unfolded this poncho on the first rainy morning after purchase . I pulled it from the packaging , unfolded it and put it over my head . Halfway down my torso it tore on the neck seam rendering it useless . So I missed my walk and wasted money . Extra star for the color , reflective portions , shape and low price . Spend a little more on something that will last more than zero wearings .
 I bought this poncho to protect me from rain during bike rides to the office . this barely held two rides before the bottom snaps on both sides tore as well as the hood on one side . now it 's completely useless . all I did is ride with it for 10 minutes . I would n't recommend it at all !!
 This item is very misleading . It looks like you 're getting a dozen `` DZN '' balls which were originally priced at $ 102.29 , dropped down to $ 6.99 , now on sale for $ 5.99 , at a $ 96.30 -LRB- 94 % -RRB- savings . Instead , you pay $ 6.99 for ONE BALL , plus another $ 7.00 + for shipping and get RIPPED OFF !! When the receipt came , there were no phone numbers for the seller that I could use to contact them , nor was there an e-mail address . I am still researching that , but wanted to write this review so others would know that this ad is BOGUS and know that you will not get the big $ 96.30 savings on a dozen balls as shown !!!
 The o-ring and slilicon were fine , but the battery was dead when I received it . Had to go to a store and buy a different battery .
 Through all the `` Designed by a Colorado sledmaker , crafted entirely by hand '' and `` heirloom '' talk , they failed to mention these are Made in China . Nothing Made in China is an heirloom , unless it 's from the Ming Dynasty .
 Just recieved the Mountain Boy 52 '' sled for a special event . Should have listened to the reviews here . The packaging from Amazon was so poor that the sled arrived broken . But I decided to fix . Then discovered tthat like many others have said beware the center pivot screw . It had already rattled apart in shipping . Still not willing to give in I took the sled apart and repaired the center screw . Then when it came time to assemble the steering arm discovered that two of the three needed screws were missing . Thought , OK I 'm a machinist and can deal with this . Checked the threads and discovered they were metric . Went to hardware store and purchased the correct replacement screws . Then discovered that the holes had been drilled in the incorrect place and needed to drill new screw holes in the steering arm . So now I have a sled with a broken side rail and three extra drilled holes in the steering arm . Tomorrow going sledding and we 'll see what else can go wrong . When Mountain Boy says that this sled is designed to be passed from one generation to another they mean as long as it is hanging on a wall as a decoration !!!!
 The sled we got for Christmas lasted two runs . Then the front part fell off and something started rattling inside the plastic cover under the front section . Disassembly showed that it was a washer and the nut that held steering section to the bolt . You can see the head of the bolt on top of the rear section . The nut and washer are under the plastic cover.The nut is a stop nut with a nylon insert to hold it place once it is tightened . However , the nylon insert never engaged with the bolt . There was no thread cut into it . Further analysis showed that it could never have engaged because the section of the bolt that stuck out of the board was too short by at least 1/8 '' . It is not clear why that section was too short , either the bolt is too short by design or the head is not countersunk properly.The steering section of this sled is fairly heavy and if it comes loose unexpectedly , it can cause serious injury to anyone riding the sled . My friends and I were lucky , but I recommend that any owner of this sled check the nut . If the nylon ring does not fully engage with the bolt , send the sled back or demand a longer bolt.A note about < heirloom > quality -LRB- I do not know if the manufacturer claims this or just reviewers -RRB- : Having the threaded section of a bolt pass through anything as a pivot pin causes excessive wear and disqualifies the item as heirloom . It will last at best one busy season . The correct bolt type to use is a shoulder bolt , but the mountain boys may be too cheap for that .
 The top steering portion came off on the first day of use . The screw is exposed and we can hear the rattling under the plastic cover that presumably is the nut . Very disappointing for an expensive sled . Will definitely return this product .
 The sled is beautiful , but super heavy , and not durableWe bought it thinking it was an heirloom type toy -- one that the kids could enjoy now and it would become part of our family traditions . Two years later -LRB- beginning of the third season of use -RRB- the deck completely cracked into several pieces.The first year AND THE SECOND YEAR the handle completely broke in two , but we made a new handle out of plywood each time and considered it good as new . With the deck split , a repair is more like a total rebuild and I do n't see it being worth our time . Considering that a season for us is measured in weeks , not months , this is not a good deal.We also have another Mountain Boy Sledworks sled that despite being kept inside during and after the season the finish has completely puckered/chipped off -- not just the polyurethane finish , but the actual top layer of the plywood . So much for being a conversation piece.I would have written a different review last year , but for the money , this is really junk . We really liked the way the sled looked , and even though it was heavy it was fun to use something so substantial and handsome , but we will not be buying another Mountain Boy Sledworks sled to replace either of ours.This year we bought cheap Snow Boogie sleds by Wham-O and those are holding up really well , are lightweight , easy to use , super fast , and are n't so expensive we will be disappointed when they fail .
 The sled looks really cool on the pictures but they are a little deceiving . The craftsmanship of the product was subpar and had many flaws including
 I recommend you do NOT do business with this company . I bought the sled for my son for Christams . I was thrilled to see they even included a screwdriver so that one can easily put the handle in . That 's until I found the thing was not prooperly drilled . The holes simply do n't line up . I guess this is a problem . They include a note telling you to go ahead and drill your own holes . Next time , I 'll provide the screwdriver if they properly drill the handle . You can imagine how much fun it 's going to be to ship this thing back .
 This sled is not what it pretends to be . It 's poorly made in China and not worth the money . The side grab rails are downright dangerous ; they are too narrow and can trap and break fingers . Top of wood is super slippery - good luck staying on it if you do n't add sticky tape or something . The only reason to buy this sled is if you plan to sled on loose snow , which does n't really work out anyhow .
 This sled made a beautiful addition to our Christmas morning , but by Christmas afternoon the back had come un-attached . Fortunately my kids also received Swiss Army knives for Christmas and we unscrewed the top part and reattached the back half , but it only stays attached for a few times down the hill , even after going home and reattaching it with the proper tools.The few times it works are lots of fun , but not worth having to cut short our sledding adventures each time . If there were some sort of fix that would keep the two pieces bolted together even while steering , I 'd change my rating in a heartbeat to five stars because it races down hill in both powdery and packed snow , but seeing my kids fall apart because they are only going to be able to sled down hill a couple of times after spending 45 minutes packing into our snow gear is too much hassle for me.We found the handle easy to attach and were grateful for the included screwdriver , which would have been hard to locate in the midst of Christmas Eve chaos - just wish the sled stayed together .
 The holes did n't line up to mount the steering bar . Might be acceptable on a 20 dollar sled but a 100 dollar sled . Get the quality right . Back it goes .
 I received the sled and immediately found out the handle holes do n't line up . The instructions invite me to drill new ones if this happens . What ?! They knowingly accept this defect ? What else ? I 'm handy and have the tools , but am not going to bite . This junk is going back at their expense .
 I owned a predecessor model of this watch for many years - wore out the band at least once . Finally the bezel cover separated , so time to replace . This watch is exactly the same function-wise , BUT , instead of two discrete buttons on the front to operate `` start/stop '' and `` reset/split '' , there is now one intergrated , covered area with buttons THAT CAN NOT BE OPERATED EXCEPT WITH MANY TRIES AND GREAT DIFFICULTY . Also , the changed strap design offers few adjustments , and would be very difficult to replace in the future . A classic case of ignoring the `` if it 's not broken , do n't fix it '' rule .
 I 'm a bit puzzled by the overall positive reviews on this chrono . Two poor design issues - 1 . The top info -LRB- Date/Day -RRB- or in Chrono -LRB- split time -RRB- are hard to see and partly hidden . 2 . The chrono split and Stop/Start buttons are very small so ... if you running -LRB- or whatever -RRB- you really have to concentrate to hit them . Not ideal . Also , the watch is not all that ` bright ' - hard to read . I 've had really good Timex in the past ... not this one .
 This isnt a bad gun , for a beginner . it is vey accurate , but VERY delicate i bought this gun on january 26 , and it came by the 5 of febuary . The gun doesnt hurt but gives a sting , you can hit a person from over 100 feet away . within the first week i sold it to an airsoft buddy for 50 $ but the day he tested it and used it in battle the magazine broke leaving me with only a CO2 pistol -LRB- wich is one of the best side arms -RRB- overall i would recomend it but be carefull with it
 If you would like this gun , which has gotten alot of good reviews then I strongly recommend you buy it from anybody other than AirSplat . I purchased this gun for my son 's Christmas 2011 and AirSplat said it was in stock , acknowledged the order , sent me a tracking # , and charged my card . Problem is they never shipped the gun ! Got an email the day after I was billed saying the tracking number had been rescinded and now the gun was out of stock and would n't be available until after Christmas . Then they would n't return my emails and only after I filed a claim through Amazon and threatened legal action did they finally issue a refund . I will never buy anything from AirSplat again and advise you to consider my experience if your interested in this gun .
 This was my first purchase of an airsoft gun . The gun seemed fine but i quickly learned that the hop-up feature made it very inaccurate and worse , the sight on the gun fell apart within a week . So i ca n't really recommend this product . But even more disappointing was the interaction with the seller . They were willing to take the gun back for a replacement but i had to pay return shipping ; it took almost a month for them to ship the replacement item and then that item never arrived and they claim it was lost by UPS and they would not ship another gun until they resolved matters with UPS . They simply have no concept of customer service . Thank god for Amazon who are exactly the opposite and have helped me every step of the way . Ended up buying a new gun from a different seller.Update
 i bought this gun in june and when i received it the first time out of the box it did not work , the gun does not fire the bbs just get stuck in the barrel and with much shaking they may come out , it is very unreliable and on the occasion that it does shoot it is with very little distance and accuracy , i would advise you to not buy this product
 This gun looks great in the pictures but its horrible . Its so flimsy that the scope broke within 5 minutes of me getting the gun . Because it is spring powered it shoots one pellet at a time so it is not a sub machine gun . It is basicly a oversized pistol . A cheap $ 5 shotgun is better than it . It is good for beginners but when it comes to airsoft veterns it is a gun that is just a waste of money .
 On the second day the clip broke and you have to hold it up side down to fire and even then it migh not fire . Just save your self the troble and get a different mp5
 I ordered similar guns directly from this company . Their return policy is NON-EXISTENT ! They say you can return , but they will only `` attempt '' to repair and send the same gun back and say you only have ONE chance to send the gun back then it is yours . So we have 2 broken guns -LRB- because they do n't hold up for any length of time -RRB- and spent $ 200.00 . I am also going to report this company the BBB and Amazon.com . Order at your own risk -- if it breaks or never worked -- it yours and you are out the money ! DO NOT ORDER YOUR GUN FROM AIRSPLAT !
 this gun sucks i got this piece of crap a while ago and the barrel fell out a butt load of parts came out the stock brokethe reason all the other reviews are like 5 tars cause it is the dude selling it if u buy it youll be sorryIT IS JUST A PIECE OF CRAP GO 2 WALMART AND GET A SHOT GUN OR A PISTOL
 It broke in a month pice of junk dont buy , buy the g-36 instead ok ok
 this gun sux.for one reason its got really low fps only like 40 fps and its made of cheap pastic.i would recomend this gun to people who like women who ride motorcycles and smoke in an alley behind a dumpster , but someone besides that ya ur gon na fail in an airsoft war . this gun i rated one star because its not very good but i like it because i just mess around with it so ya . for all u noobs out there i luv u.
 Frist Of all i really wanted a Air soft Gun so i can play my friend who has a a automatic Gun as well but i can not shot it ! waste of time energy and money

 We ordered this item because it was fully automatic . IT IS NOT AUTOMATIC !!!!! Although the instruction claim batteries can be inserted for automation , there is not place to put the batteries . I have been trying FOR WEEKS to return the item with an occasional email from airsplat claiming they need more information to process the return . I still have it in the original package sitting at my desk . Be careful when ordering from this company . Frankly , I expected more from Amazon .
 This product has deficiencies regarding the durability of the bracelet , power of the gps antenna , and durable appliance provided the adional holding the gps to the athlete 's body . As stopwatch for training is excellent but as gps is very limited . After 6 months of use the problem began to clamp the body gps -LRB- fatigue -RRB- and two years after the strap broke .
 I was confused about what was being sold.I ended up with something that had to be installed in a device which I did not have .
 I bought these googles for my daughter to use for her summer swim team . She only had them for 3 weeks when they broke in the middle of a swim meet . Will never buy anthing made by lane 4 again .
 I have pretty normal size hands and fingers and this is huge ! If you put it all the way on your finger it goes over your knuckle and you cant bend your finger . However , if you put it on half way so you can bend your finger -LRB- obviously you need to bend your finger to play -RRB- it with fall off sooner or later and does not feel like you have full control . But like I said if your hands are like Hendrix then this is the slide for you . Good price though .
 I purchased this as my first guitar slide . I loved it for about one month , then it fell off my finger and shattered into tiny pieces . I almost cut myself ! I will never buy a glass slide again , I recently bought a Dunlop brass slide and love it . The difference between glass and metal is that glass is a muddier , mellow tone , and glass is crisper , louder , and does not break . I would not suggest this to anyone . The metal ones are about the same price , they do n't break , and sound way better . There 's a reason ALL pros use metal ! The review below is wrong . Slides are meant to cover your ENTIrE finger , all the way to the tip . You do n't bend your finger to play slide . You retune your guitar to an open tuning . Just thought I would point that out .
 Bought this watch today as a beater for exercise and working in the yard . The metal band is not adjustable . Do n't buy one of these unless your wrist is jumbo sized .
 MY clock went out when the electricity or surge went out . But I , when something fails to work on me , tend to open it and try to disconnect the power cord or the computer cord and then I see if I ca n't fix it . When doing this to this item , i noticed that there is a nickel 3v battery -LRB- $ 2 -RRB- , like a watch battery but the quarter size . I replaced it and that was it . I even ordered more batteries just in case . BUT the package nor the insert did n't say anything about it and when you open it , you have to look around for the battery . SO , do n't throw it away , change the battery.I love the product but because the battery issue was n't disclosed or on the package and people are n't always eager to open things up like me . I feel like this product is one star , until they tell you how to fix the issues with the battery then you ca n't make people buy your product and then have to replace it every time the battery goes out ... thats not right .
 I have this product for a month now and part of the red LED numbers no longer work . This is the second on I have had and both have had the same problem . It looks great , but do n't expect it to last long .
 Item was defective upon receipt . When plugged in , display lit up only a couple of numbers and only partially at that . I ordered this through Amazon Marketplace . The process to return the clock and/or receive credit was lengthy and complicated , but I did eventually get reimbursed . Note
 After just over a year of using this lock , it no longer stays connected for me . On more than one occassion , I have locked it around the seat on my scooter while riding home and in the middle of the ride it will just pop open . When I went to unlock my scooter yesterday , I did n't need to bother . The lock had openned up on its own and was just laying on the ground next to my scooter . For a lot less money , I could have just gotten a normal bike lock that would do a better job .
 For those that believe `` a picture is worth a thousand words '' , you still have time to change your opinion . With each and every picture shown of these streamers it shows what appears to be about one inch in length or so of what I assumed to be what one would lace up over their existing handle grip , thus securing the streamers to the handlebars . Not to be . You receive the six individual streamers , about 6-8 inches in length each with some little plastic thing that is supposed to be inserted in the existing hole in the end of your handlegrips . This is for $ 9.29 . What I found out via e-mail from the company is they do have `` other '' streamers that they sell for $ 25.00 should one expect to receive actual streamers like it shows in the pictures . If one has a spare $ 10.00 bill they have no use for , these are for you .
 If you 're looking for a cheap rower that 's good to use for a short while , then this may be ok for you . If you are actually serious about doing rowing workouts , you 'll want to go another way.The machine itself is easy to put together ; the only problem I found was that the sensor wire running to the electronic meter came out really easily . They used glue instead of solder to keep the wire in the circuit board . The customer service rep was helpful with this and quickly sent a replacement part , though.The worst part of this rower is actually using it -LRB- which can be quite a problem -RRB- . Two weeks after I first got it , the seat just tilted under me when I was in the ` drive ' portion and just fell off the body of the rower . Just like that . I somewhat managed to get the seat popped back on , but it moves up and down the length like an old man , even after greasing it . I 've also noticed that the machine really is n't that quiet ; it 's very creaky , on and off.Like someone else mentioned , the footpads are troublesome too . If you do n't pull the velcro tight , your feet will come out , but pulling too tight will bend the metal ring that holds the velcro . This is just really annoying to worry about while working out.Last , the major problem for me is that one of the pistons will arbitrarily lose all resistance as I pull back on it . There does n't seem to be any reason or rhyme to it , and it can be really offputting , especially to your rhythm . And it has been happening constantly for me , at least.So , there you have it . My recommendation , if you 're really serious about rowing , is to splurge a little and go for a flywheel system , where you wo n't have to worry about these resistance problems . On the other hand , if you just want a nice , easily stored , cheap rower for occasional use , go for it , but always remember ; caveat emptor .
 If my feet could stay in the foot pads and stop coming out after the velcro comes loose maybe I could get a work out from this product . My shoes are 9 and 1/2 so they are not particularly small . I am heading to the hardware store right now to see if I can find poxy and some plastic to lengthen the heel bracing part of the foot pad . Wish me luck !
 I do n't know . . But so far , I have n't got any fish on these.Only time will tell if there are any catfish who eat these .
 If I could give this lock 0 stars I would . Yeah , sure , the lock looks great and it comes with a bunch of spare keys , which now that my bike has been stolen means I have no bike and plenty of keys.I only had my bike for about a month and a half , it wasnt a super nice bike -LRB- Giant Escape 2 -RRB- and I always locked it up with care -LRB- through the front tire , frame , bike rack and if I could stretch it , back tire too -RRB- and then one day when I got out of work , my bike was no where to be seen.When I bought my bike a a local shop one of the employees had recommended this lock when he saw me looking at a larger , heavier and more expensive Kryptonite U-lock . Now I regret not buying that U-lock , if you are getting a lock for a bike worth keeping make it a U-lock , and make sure to get one with stolen bike reimbursement .
 I gave this product a try TWICE . I did not want to try Angel Eyes . My mistake . I gave this two stars just because the sellers were kind . But it did not work AT ALL . If it works for your dog , then good . It did not work for mine . I will choose my own dietary supplements .
 This sword is terrible . This is not a sword . Its a piece of flimsy metal . The sheath is even worse . It does n't feel like a real sword . I bought this for a costume and i was n't pleased . The sword is bent and the sheath is already falling apart .
 Unless you are a total sword fanatic , pass on this . Sword is flimsy and dull ; I guess it would make a great over-sized letter-opener .
 I purchased this fly sheet combo in April of this year . . first the leg straps connection tore out , then the belly band strap tore out - I am sure glad I did not put it on my horse that is rough on sheets.I will say the neck piece is in great shape . It is now July and it is unusable definitely not worth the money
 The shorts were top-notch quality , but they were n't what I wanted . The product 's description did not adequately tell me what I was purchasing , so I had to send them back .

 Gold Toe makes good dress socks but falls short on athletic socks . These socks lack the padding and comfort of Wigwam and are just not as well made as Gold Toe dress socks
 I have been buying gold-toe socks for years . Until about three years ago , I was very pleased with gold-toe . However , in the past few years I have found that the socks stretch out of shape after only a few washings . To claim to make a sock that fits sizes 6-12 shoe is patently impossible . Oh , at first it may . But I wear size 7 1/2 shoe and guess what ? You got it ! After a while it is at least an inch too long and the heal comes up on the Achilles-tendon . These socks are clearly not made for the smaller foot size.Unless you start making a sock that fits a lower range of sizes , you have lost a long-time customer .
 I got this -LRB- or the 5038 , Amazon used both numbers for the same item -RRB- along with a shorter and slightly thicker version of the same lock , the 5037 . My first impression of both was very positive . But I 've now returned them . On this lock , the casing around the end that inserts into the lock cracked after some sun exposure . It 's mostly cosmetic , but when it falls off entirely -LRB- as it is sure to do -RRB- , it will leave an exposed metal crimp to mar whatever you 're locking . That 's the smaller problem . There 's a much bigger one . The lock stopped working . Luckily , that happened with the lock open . It simply would n't lock and the key would n't turn . So , it went back . Meanwhile , the lock on the shorter one I also got -LRB- the 5037 -RRB- started to get fussy too , so I returned it as well . I 'm not satisfied at the overall quality of these locks . I 'm disappointed , because they were stout and exactly what I needed otherwise .
 THIS WAS JUNK CAME BROKEN CA N'T EVEN USE ... . BELEVE ME DO N'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS ONE .
 This lock worked great for the first 90 days , then it started to get difficult to lock and unlock . I used WD-40 as described to lubricate the locking mechanism but it did not help . After 90 days of light use -LRB- 2-3x per week -RRB- it would no longer unlock even after trying several keys . I then called the 1-800 number for customer support during normal business hours 2x and got a voicemail machine.I would not recommend this lock . But I have also stopped purchasing from Onguard in general given their lack of live customer service.I am now purchasing a Kryptonite lock and will see if that works better .
 The seat appeared to be well constructed when it was received but during our first trip out on the canoe , my wife leaned back in her seat just a bit and one of the straps pulled out at the seam . She nearly fell over in the canoe ... could have gotten hurt as she is pregnant . Even pregnant she is still only about 150 pounds , so her size/weight should n't have been a problem .
 Straps are just sewn onto the vinyl-style material ... easily & QUICKLY RIPPED away from side and chair is USELESS as a back-rest at that point ! Terrible product !!
 One of the straps pulled loose from the chair the first time it was used . Another strap has come partially loose as well and this is just from one time use .
 Bought this item for canoe and after about 2 hour on the water strap tore out of back of chair ! I am not very large guy either 6 ' 180lbs . I also sent the other back as after looking at it , not sewn into any thing but fabric covering set back . I have used Pelican procucts for years but this one is made by product by someone else . Do Not Buy This Chair ... I ordered a different one and the return dept at Amazon are great . I will let you know how new on works !!! Better I HOPE !!!
 The game board arrived undamaged . The paint quality is poor and the board is warped . Very low quality at a very , very high price ... I guess the company is taking advantage of the nostalgia of the original product .
 If you have kids who play hard ... DO N'T GET IT !!!!! This piece of junk will break apart on you ! It 's not like I remembered as a kid . This board is a fake ... I WILL PROVE IT TO YOU ... I have a original that for whole 1 says 1st and then 2nd and 3rd etc. . This board says 1th , 2th , 3th , 4th etc. . Are they serious ?!?! Move on and do n't buy this . RIP OFF !!!
 fun game . but this product must be made in china ! ours came with dried glue spots all over and the paint job was bubbly and strange looking . the game is fun , but i want to return the board to get a fresh looking one ... not sure if they all look this damaged .
 The item was cheaply made , and the painting was terrible . Not the same board and we played as a child .
 Accuracy is not so good . I could not predict how far my paint is going to hit my target with this barrel . As soon as I started using my old 14 '' unknown-brand barrel , my shots improved its accuracy . I used the same paint , same setup on my A5 . I use CO2-tank with an expansion chamber . Despite the good reviews that I 've heard about this product , I would n't recommend buying this . Thanks !
 1 . The quality of the rack looks good , but the mounting screw is not.It was damaged when I use a dewalt to put it into the wood .2 . It fits well for one road bike , but none of my three mountain bikes could fit . The distance between two bars is a little bit wide .
 I received a black rack though the colour is supposed to be silver/metal . It has only one screw -LRB- as in the photo -RRB- so it 's swung over to one side . it ought to have two screws . It 's pretty narrow for 2 bikes . You have to have the 2 facing opposite directions and turn the handle bars to get them to hang . I expected the rack to fold up , out of the way , when the bikes are removed -- no such luck -- and if I want them held up I 'll need to tie them.This is worth $ 12 no more .
 I ordered this product because I needed to get two bicycles off the limited space on my garage floor . No problems with delivery and the rack itself is well made and looks good . Installation was also easy - one screw in a stud . -LRB- The screw is cheap metal and strips easy -RRB- My major problem is that the rack only holds ONE bike , not two . I know it 'll hold only one 'cause I tried every concevibale angle to hang the two bikes and it just does n't work . If you want a rack for one bike - this will do , but if you want a rack for TWO bikes - find another product .
 The only way you can get this to work for two bikes is if you want to remove the handlebars ! Also , there is only one screw in the center , so it does not handle girls bikes where the bar is a diagonal ... it rotates around the center screw .
 First of all
 The the package came in perfect condition . After reading the sloppy directions i found the stud on my dry wall and screwed in the little screws provided . After 15 minutes everything was installed and that was when things went downhill . The wall mount claim to hold up to 80lbs ... what a joke . My mountain bike weighs at least 45 - 50lbs and it barely holds its weight . Now my bike is hangig slanted on my garage wall .
 This leash is made poorly and it arrives looking like it was left in the sun . The Cowboys logo is almost yellowish . Not happy with it at all . Shipping was awful too .
 The description of this pad says that it is designed with a woman 's body in mind . I am not really sure how this is any different from the men 's pad . I ended up returning this for a men 's large since it is 5 '' wider and MUCH easier to sleep on . If you have the room go with a men 's large
 I am furious . I bought the advertised thermarest because it was rectangular and would link to the rectangular one I already had . They sent me a teardrop shaped one . I could have bought a teardrop shaped one in my local camping shop for half the price that it cost me from this shady outfit . We had already started our camping trip when I discovered the bait and switch so I had to use it thereby preventing me from returning it.I am still looking for a large rectangular thermarest .
 Dissappointed in the prodicuct it is a basic clip with NO Steeler logo just wording . Money better spent in my opinion . I should looked closer at the product . Good thing my 4 motnh old will not know the difference . .
 On Christmas Eve my husband was putting this trike together , and at one point I thought my daughter was not going to have a tricycle Christmas morning . The rear axle is too short , and he was unable to include the washers in the assembly . The rear piece is forced on after getting bent . We will only be using this tricycle on Christmas Day . Afterwards , we will be purchasing another tricycle . We are not confident that the rear wheel will stay on .
 this little bikes where a gift for a pour children shelter in Honduras Central America , 4 of them were wonderful , but 1 has a missing back tire ? i dont know what happen , i cant send them back because i shipp them exactly as they arrive on my house , was a real shame those people on china really need to improve themself .
 Roadmaster Duo Deck 10-Inch TrikeTrike was about as expected for $ -LSB- ... -RSB- -LRB- retail $ -LSB- ... -RSB- -RRB- Poor paint job , plastic front fender , & the most objectional component - lack of an actual threaded axle w / nuts & lock washers for rear wheels . The tap-on cap nuts did not last more than 3 minutes w / a 2 year old operating the trike . Solution
 peddles are to small seat is not proportional to handles and peddles a waste of money got kid another bike
 Assembly was a pain , there was a missing bolt , the seat wiggled even after tightenting it .
 Finishing of the product was poor and assembly of the seat in general was really loose . As soon as my son sits on it the seat will displace . Also , the assembly at the rear wheels is designed in a way , which makes noise when it is ridden . I returned this product finally .
 The trike box was obviously not new , but had been opened and then taped back closed . The box also had some damage -LRB- the outer Amazon box did not have damage -RRB- . I opened the box and the components were still in bubble wrap , but the parts bag was incomplete -LRB- but sealed -RRB- . So basically it looks like someone returned this , and the factory did an exceptionally sloppy job of `` refurbishing '' it -- did n't include all the parts , did n't repair/replace the box , taped it back together with a sloppier tape job than I 'm returning it with.This may be a great trike ; I have no way of knowing . But this experience does n't make me want to buy another Roadmaster product .
 My two year old was so excited to get this bike ! We noticed that the box had A LOT of packing tape on it , as though it had been opened previously . Once opened , we noticed that was not a &#34; parts &#34; section in the owners manual , then we noticed that several pages in the manual were repeated , then noticed that several pages were missing ! The manual pages were as follows
 The boxes were pretty beat up upon arrival , checked out contents , all parts are there . Smell from tires was so strong in the house had to put trikes parts spread out on porch to air out . Of course everything comes from China and we do n't know what garbage went into making the tricycle wheels . These are going to be Xmas gifts for 18 mos . old granddaughters if the smell is gone by then . Would I buy these again , No .
 The look and price of this trike was just what we wanted , but we have owned it for one year and it has been a slight disappointment .1 . Upon opening the box the bike smelled awful ! It took at least two weeks of sitting outside before the chemical smell was gone . Do not plan to open/assemble the night before Christmas and Birthday , it will stink up the whole house .2 . It was missing a nut and bolt from the part of the bike that came assembled ! This meant a trip to the hardware store .3 . The seat came off -LRB- after just a month or so of light use and we had a friend rivet it back together -RRB- 4 . Now after one year of use the seat/frame has come apart again and must be welded back if we want to use it again.Bottom line , I would not buy this trike again .
 I purchased this for my child . Within a few weeks , pieces were starting to fall off . The seat would not stay in place . The wheels were coming off . The paint was already starting to rust . It was an all around poor purchase .
 I do not know where they keep their stock , but beware if you are asthmatic as it reeks so badly of smoke ! I washed it 4 times and it still reeks !
 The family just opened their Christmas gifts this morning - the tricycle was the main event . My son put it together from the package sent . His 1st comment that it 's a very flimsy tricycle , and he questions if it 's going to last very long . He was quite disappointed and it made me feel awful . I just went by the review you rec 'd - and I was quite surprised that he was upset with the quzlity of thie item . He said the bushings were only made out of plastic ? He thought it should be better items to put it together . Now I feel so inadequate that I sent this gift by going by your photo and reviews - very sad . I would have bought something MORE advantageous instead - hope many read this review and think twice ? elaine andersen
 I was so excited to read the great reviews on this trike when we bought it for my 2 year old son . I researched trikes for weeks before deciding on this one . Now I 'm only wishing my husband had saved the box so we could return it . Basically we 're just taking the loss on the money paid and buying a different brand entirely.The construction is TERRIBLE , the seat does n't tighten and just falls to the side no matter what you do , and if anything at all even slightly touches the metal , the paint chips right off . We are extremely disappointed - as is our son who ca n't even ride his new trike because the seat 's so completely unsafe .
 We bought 4 of these for our child care center and I was disappointed with plastic parts which do n't hold and fairly lightweight metal . We need equipment that can stand some abuse , and this is definitely not for heavy use . Maybe for 1 kid only who just rides back and forth to church on Sundays .
 We received this trike as a gift for my son 's 2nd birthday . It is being shipped back ! The box had already been opened before we received it and despite this initial disappointment , we excitedly began taking the pieces out . Our excitement was short-lived because the quality is poor . The front tire was mounted on crookedly and there was a horrible wobble when we tried to roll it on the floor . We will try the Radio-flyer and hope for better luck .
 This trike is awful ! It 's just junk . Spend the extra money & get a better trike . You 'll waste too much time assembling the thing & it wo n't be a good ride . Plastic clips & pieces that do n't fit together well . The steering handle bars twist out of line . I 'm quite sure the front wheel is n't perfectly round , because it does n't roll smoothly . I would have returned it but was n't up for the hassle of boxing it & shipping .
 I bought this for my 3 year old for Christmas and my husband put it together for him . He had to keep fixing it and tighting up the screws but it still kept having problems so he had to buy new screws for the seat and the handles . But it still kept having problems , then my dad got tired of it and hammered some nails to the chair too so that it will quiet moving . NOW it is fine but if I knew how cheap the product was I would have never bought this . Next time if I am going to buy a new tricycle for anyone , I sure will not buy this one . It is not worth the price .
 Ordered trike and received it in a timely manner , but there were screws + nuts + bolts + washers missing from the box -LRB- best guess is that there was a whole bag of parts needed for assembly , and it was absent -RRB- . The packaging was a clear indicator that the trike had previously been returned , so it seems likely that something happened with the return / resale process . Had to send it back . Very disappointed . Boo .
 Received this Trike and was struck by how small it seemed for an advertised size of 10 inches . Upon measuring the front wheel in actuality it is only 9 inches , and the rear wheels , instead of being 8 inches as advertised are approximately 6-1/2 inches . Be advised for those that may be sensitive to chemical odors that the rubber tires have an extremely strong smell coming from them . This out gassing as it 's called may linger for a quite sometime and the Trike may have to be kept outdoors . .
 After reading some great reviews I 've decided to give this trike a try and purchased it on Amazon for my 3-year-old . Price was the determining factor . I wanted something my son could play for few years and move on to a full bike , I was n't looking for the most durable product.The package arrived on time , but items seems to be `` open-box '' , as I can see dents on some of the parts , all tires had signs of use as I can see specs of dirt on them . This is the first time I 've gotten a `` returned '' item advertised as `` new '' from Amazon . Let 's just hope that this experience is one time thing , and will not happen regularly with Amazon.Pro : Amazon 's great return policy.Con : Got an open box item -LRB- probably with some parts missing -RRB- The tires smelled awful.The front wheel is smaller than the advertised picture.The trike is smaller than expected .
 Once this tricycle was finally assembled with all the right parts , my 2 yr old granddaughter loved it . The original shipment was missing parts . The manufacturer was contacted and sent replacement parts to the wrong address . After contacting the manufacturer again , the parts pack was sent to the correct address but parts were still missing . Another go-around resulted in the wrong parts again . Finally , we went to the store and bought them ourselves . When my granddaughter finally got on the trike the pedal kept coming off . After that was fixed the trike was great . We would have returned it , but by the time we were done trying to get the correct parts , it was too late to send it back . I would recommend never buying this product . I would recommend tha Amazon stop carrying it . Amazon was great however . They did refund my priority shipping .
 First shipment was missing most of the parts even though the box had not been opened . Second shipment had most of the parts but had to use some from first shipment . Very poorly constructed . Ca n't adjust seat to hold . The handlebars wo n't tighten so that they wo n't get out of alignment with the front wheel . The axle nuts wo n't stay on . SAVE YOUR MONEY and buy a different brand .
 while the trike is apparently made of steel , the rest of the pieces are cheap , many plastic , and fit together poorly . The instructions are also terrible , with tiny print -LRB- i have 20/20 vision and had a hard time making out which pieces were which -RRB- , and confusing making it quite difficult to assemble , even with correct tools -LRB- note
 \ \ The picture of this bike for sure looks much better than its look in the real life . For some reason the made the front wheel in the picture bigger than its actually is in reality.When you openned the bike package I got this weird smell , I think it was the paint , which lasted for few days , and then went away thankfully.Also the front wheel was twisted a little . I should have returned this bike , but my kid was expecting it for few days , I could not make him for few more days till I get another one . My kid is two years of an average height , but he barely can use it
 We purchased this bike for my daughter for Christmas . We put it together as the instructions said , but it never really worked . The seat would not adjust and sat on the bar no matter what we did . We thought maybe we had a missing piece , we tore apart everything trying to find it to no avail . There was nothing we could find that we had missed in the instructions . It squeaked and barely moved when she tried to pedal . You would have thought it was 25 years old and rusty the way it moved . We should have contacted the company , but with two little ones running around , it just got put on the back burner until we finally gave it to a charity for someone who had more time and/or ability to deal with it . I would never purchase this bike for another child and frankly think it 's a waste of money . Granted , I never tried to contact the company to tell them of the problem . Do I sound old when I say , when I buy something I just expect it to work properly ?
 I ca n't rate what I have not received . It was supposedly shipped on 7/13/2010 , but has not yet arrived . This has been my most disappointing purchase through Amazon.com . All other products I have ordered through Amazon , arrived in a timely manner .
 I can not rate the item itself . The 1 star is for the seller of this item , Speedytoys . I placed an order for 3 of these on June 29th . I was was given an expected arrival date of July 5th-10th . Today , on July 6th , I just got a message that my order had been cancelled . I went to place a review on Speedytoys page here , but evidently I ca n't since their canceling the order made it so that I never actually bought anything from them.I wanted these to facilitate some reality based -LRB- yet cheap and safe -RRB- training for a work thing that 's coming up in the next month . Since these are cheap replicas of the Glocks we use , I thought they 'd be ideal . I figured they 'd be shipped in time for the training . Instead , I got screwed by a seller who took 7 days to tell me that they did n't have any in stock . They should n't have had the item listed in the first place if they could n't back an order.As far as the item itself goes , it looks petty decent . Not as durable as some of the higher end models but decent enough for someone looking for a light intensity training investment or someone with an idle interest in airsoft toys . The amount of research I gave this particular model and make seemed to indicate that it was an okay entry level airsoft pistol . Just do n't try to order them from Speedytoys .
 I ordered this piece because of its size -- it is decidedly smaller than an inversion table or the ab lounge , both of which I have used with some satisfaction for stretching my back and relieving back pain . The ab lounge was by far the best , because I was able to do a full inverted `` u '' curve , in which neither feet nor hands were engaged . AHHH ! that was wonderful . It was just too big for my small apartment . The inversion table was gigantic , as well and had its own issues . I thought this would be a great pared down version of the ab lounger . When inverted , however , my feet are still on the floor , or up in the air and I am unable to achieve the satisfying `` u '' curve where my spine is supported and the weight of my dangling limbs tractions my spine . Alas . My search for the perfect back stretcher continues .
 this product is a total waist of my money after using it a few mornings I noticed that the middle of my back now aches me , it actually makes my back feel soar , i would not recommend this to anyone plus it does nothing to your abs ... waist of my hard earned money : -LRB-
 directions written in broken english does not do what you think it does you do the stretching it does nothing but deplete your wallet
 We 've had this device for a couple of weeks and I have my doubts as to its ability in firming abs . It does a good job of stretching the back , but in doing so , wreaks havoc on my neck and makes me feel like I 've been on a roller coaster . It does not come with much instruction and I have attempted to try it several different ways including adding more support for my neck . I am about 5 ' 4 '' , so perhaps this device is simply not built for me . My son , who is 6 ' uses it to stretch his back and the frame fit seems more suited to his size .
 I purchased this machine from Brookstone , and I was disappointed when I put it together . Though it is well built and sturdy , its main purpose is to stretch your back . If you are purchasing it for that purpose only then I highly recommend this product . . If you think you are getting the best bang for your buck by getting a combination of the two . . think again ... Go with the Ab Rocket . It works the abs efficiently and concentrates in that area . This machine is solely for your back and I think they should take that off the product title .

 what a joke ! I get an extra small dog collar and I need a large one . I call and ca n't understand the foreign customer rep , but am told if I do n't want to pay return shipping , I can go to a Petco and return it for a store credit . Ha ! I ordered it online from here because I did n't want to go to the store in the first place . Wo n't be getting anything from Petco again !
 Package says `` Quick tab release '' but it 's just a simple fold over friction buckle . If that 's quick release what 's slow release ? I assumed it was the kind you could pinch and it would open and then you could put it back together at the same length . No such luck . It 'll hold you sleeping bag but there is nothing quick about it .
 My bike was stolen last night . Two clean cuts is all it took . The cops said it probably took about 3 seconds to cut through this cable . `` Strongest , most flexible and cut resistant cables in the business '' , bull ! DO NOT BUY ! You a better off not securing the bike at all than getting this cable ; you will be at less of a total loss if you do -LRB- you wont be down the money you spent to buy this crappy `` security '' cable -RRB- .
 11/28/08 - I had two bicycles stolen -LRB- over $ 1400 value -RRB- from my garage when a thief cut through the cable in one slice . Looks like they used a chain cutter . Unless you 're using this as a theft deterrent or for low value items , do n't fool yourself that you 're buying security .
 DO NOT BUY A BIKE LOCK LIKE THIS . I had my bike stolen because the thief cut right through the chain . This lock would have been useful if I had a U-lock in addition . I learned my lesson ... Spend the money and get a nice lock ! Your bike will thank you .
 11/28/08 - Buyer Beware

 Good quality but the 6 -12 month size is big on my 16 lb 7 month old . Also , the velcroe on the side , no matter how you fasten it , is VERY VERY sharp and i have yet to figure out how to keep it from digging into her armpit when it is on her ...
 This was a total waste of money . it is very thin and very SMALL , it would n't even go around the spokes of a bike and the bar you are securing it to because it is so short .
 11/28/08 - Buyer Beware
 ... and bike was stolen less than one month after delivery . I have HALF the cable now.Good price and attractive product for a LOW security environment .

 When i received the product here at my address i had to ship it to our son in kentucky for our GrandDaughter.He opened it up and found there was no screws to put it together and it had dings and marks all on the wood from not being wrapped good for shipping purposes.I am sorry but we are very disappointedDavid Gagnon
 WORTH THE PRICE ? Maybe not . The lock replaces one bolt . There are 3 other bolts that assemble the Allen bike rack I purchased . The lock bolt attaches the rack to the hitch . Another bolt can be removed to steal the rack . However , doing this would require the thief to somehow purchase the missing peice to attach it to another hitch . The missing piece may be cheaper than a full rack . Also , the nut for the lock bolt did not easily fit on the lock bolt . It was n't machined properly . I used the bolt from the screw pin that came with the bike rack and it worked . Not sure if another manufacturers bolt would work .
 This product is so simple , what could go wrong?Well , like another reviewer here , the included nut seized up on the pin the very first time I installed it , and as a result , there is no way to get the bike rack off of my vehicle . And I ca n't figure a way to cut it off because the design of the bike rack and my car 's hitch leaves no way to get a hacksaw in or maneuver it . So this product has already cost me hours of grief and inconvenience -- and I STILL ca n't figure out how to get it off.The manufacturer is supposed to be sending me a new pin , but that wo n't do me any good until I figure out how to get this one off -- and I 'm out of ideas . I 'm hoping I can get one of the ends to snap off but have n't been successful so far.If you buy this product , do NOT use the locknut with the plastic insert which is provided . Go to the hardware store and buy a regular old nut -LRB- which can be easily removed -RRB- and use that . So long as you 're using the locking shaft behind the nut , there 's no way it can back off the pin , and you wo n't have to endure all the grief I 'm going through.One star - a product that creates far more problems than it solves is not a good product .
 Even though I hand tightened the nut on to the bolt it seized up on me when I tightened it with a wrench and then the head of the bolt snapped off . Cheap Chinese steel is what I assume was the problem . I 'm looking for an American or European made lock . Any suggestions ?
 Just like a few others , nut with plastic stuck on pin . Absolutely unremovable and will need to be cut off . Not much room to do it in but a recip saw may work . Crappy nut ruins product .
 Plastic lock nut siezes on the bolt , then the head of the bolt breaks off and you are OUT OF LUCK !
 Like 2 other reviewers here , the included nut seized up on the pin the very first time I installed it . Could n't figure out a way to get it off & eventually I had a mechanic friend dremel it off . He even broke his dremel cutting disc . What a mess : - -LRB-
 Be careful - pin replaced under warranty . The Allen hitch has been fine . This locking hitch pin installed OK although it was stiff to put on . Taking it off resulted in the stop nut -LRB- with interior plastic collar -RRB- SEIZING and the hitch pin head broke loose and unscrewed - it is supposed to be permanently fixed to the pin ! The nut is jammed but good so now I have to cut the pin off near the nut . Should take about an hour with a hacksaw and it wo n't be fun . When it 's off , I 'll use the original unlockable pin with a regular nut , not a stop nut . Now that I think about it , if you just use a regular 3/4 '' nut on the locking pin , maybe with a lock washer for long trips , then you will probably be happier than I am right now.Later , the manufacturer replaced the pin under warranty and I think it will work fine as long as I use a plain replacement nut instead of the included stop nut . I would revise the rating to three stars but my initial rating seems permanent .
 Bought this allen locking hitch pin to go along with the allen bike rack . Was suppost to be an anti-wobble locking pin , but did not keep it from wobbleing . The bike rack still moved and moved back and forth and mangled the latch for our pop-up camper and was unable to get the tongue of camper off ball on truck . Only made it out of my driveway for that to happen . Nightmare ... Bike rack garbage along with locking hitch pin.Returned all products . And then $ 400.00 later to get pop-up camper fixed since could not be towed , had to have a service call come to us .
 Amazon you should remove this item from your store . It is expensive and flawed . As many other reviewers have experienced , I could n't remove the nut from the bolt after the first application . I had to cut the bolt with a Sawzall to remove . I got this for Xmas and did n't try it until yesterday so I am beyond my return date . Terrible experience all the way around !
 While I was installing this for the first time the locking nut seized up on the nut . While trying to get the nut off the hex bolt head came un-welded from the bolt shaft . Not sure if this was a defect or the product of me putting a tremendous force on the bolt trying to get the nut off . If you get this you might want to spend about $ 2 at Lowes to get a standard nut and a locking washer .

 We intended to use the water bottle to monitor how much water we drink each day . The little computer did n't work well and was difficult to use . It 's sitting on the self . I do n't recommend it .
 For a cheap call it sounds okay . Seems more like an beginner call . I just got it for some diversity on my lanyard but it is not as good as my other calls which were the same price if not a little more

 Product is poorly advertised . Here I thought I was purchasing a Basketweave Bianchi OC Spray Pouch when in fact its the Gloss finish version.In text the product states that it 's `` High Gloss '' but displays a basketweave product . The products image should be updated so future costumers do n't get more upset than I. Fortunately , the gloss finish does n't look too bad on my belt , so I 'll keep the product rather than waste more money for return shipping .
 my husband ordered this jersey and received a plain generic reebok jersey with a number 13 on it with warner above it on the back . theres no cardinal on it anywhere . it looked nothing like this at all . we are very disatisified . we really wanted this jersey and cant find one anywhere .
 This sweatshirt runs true to size , but it is too short if you are over 5 ' 2 '' .
 I wanted an aerobics dvd -LRB- for seniors -RRB- so that I could a get a workout that could be done at home . What 's in this dvd is a short session , which showed some basic steps , that was less than 10 minutes long . Then the suggestion was to find an aerobics class that suited one 's needs or level , and that was exactly what I did NOT want.I 'm unsure of Amazon 's policy of returning a dvd -LRB- cd , etc. -RRB- , so I 'll check into that today . If I ca n't return it , I blew $ 15 on an item that 's useless .

 The collar kept stretching out , only had it a week and it would constantly stretch out to the largest size possible for it . Eventually would fall off ... then the pup chewed it up ... oh well , I 'll get a walmart one next time
 Product Description says
 You 'd think this product just lights right up and helps start your fire . Wrong . It does n't . I wasted 3 good matches trying to get this to light . I finally had to cut it up into slivers and start my fire the old fashion way . I would n't carry these with me on my next backpacking adventure.FYI - people who review shipping costs in product reviews must not be very bright .
 I was going to order 12 of the items at 1.41 each . Imagine my suprise to see the shipping & handeling at 53.00 . This is a complete and total rip off.needless to say I canc the order
 We have n't even gotten this thing together yet and I 'm disgusted :1 . Many , many missing parts .2 . Hardware diagrams are labeled as `` actual size '' while the actual parts specified do not match up with the drawings .3 . Customer service center that is closed on weekends , when most people would be attempting to assemble this and might have questions . -LRB- Most likely complaints . -RRB- Reebok and Lifetime Products clearly do not have any respect for their customers and should be ashamed of themselves . I wo n't be spending any money with them again . This item is clearly intended for children and will disappoint many of them . I 'm glad the other reviewer had a better experience because I would n't wish this on anyone .
 This is crap ! It leaks . The black inside part comes right out . I will never buy another mug like this again .
 the cup was everything the add said it was and the green bay logo is great . i enjoy the cup very much and would buy another one if needed

 Insufficient padding to provide any noticeable protection . My current Under Armor padding is far superior .

 This product was crap . The suit i received did n't look anything like the picture . A friend and I ordered the same suit , so I thought , but I received this flimsy gray suit thing that looked liked something from the 80s . I went a head and put the suit on . It was so uncomfortable due to the fact that there were rubber band used around the neck , arm and ankles . I had to pull the rubber band from around the neck so I could breath . after two workouts the suit started to rip in the crotch . A few days later my friend received hers , which was the correct one like on the picture .
 The shorts are a nice fit and wear well , however as a warning , the color of the shorts are actually army green , not brown .
 Despite the title of the advertisement and the seller 's adamant description these are indeed olive drab and NOT brown . My department specifies we use brown slacks/bdus/shorts and I thought I had finally found some brown shorts that looked decent -LRB- the shorts themselves are worth more than the price just realize , they ai n't brown , no not at all and do NOT look like the item advertised herein -RRB- but alas they are Olive Drab and looks like I have to use Amazon 's A-Z return as no response back from seller : -LRB-

 Do n't know how it is . They sent me a AZ Cardinals clock instead . It was close to Christmas so I gave as a gift .
 Though the ` quality ' of the clock looks good , the clock loses anywhere from 2-4 hours each day in keeping time , even with fresh batteries .
 This is a great game for learning to count money quickly , but my 6-year old finds it difficult and not very fun . I am going to keep looking for a better game for her .

 I had butterflies eating my garden to the point of having plant skeletons rather than lush greenery . Not wanting to foul the environment , I decided that catching the butterflies would be the appropriate solution . Thus , I ordered and promptly received this butterfly net.Yes , it 's clear from the picture that this net comes without a handle.And , yes , I understand that the error was mine in expecting a butterfly net to have a handle.So , I 'll accept the responsibility for the handleless net . And for the 30 minutes it took me to find a handle that would more or less fit this net.However ... my net had a rip in it that had obviously been repaired before mailing it out , making my net a second rather than first quality product.Add to that the fact that the net was mailed in a flimsy cellophane covering , no box , no protection whatsoever for the net.I am not a happy camper .
 Not to beat a dead horse , but I was surprised and disappointed to find that the net DOES NOT come with a handle . Seems like that ought to be clearly stated in the product description . The low-quality packaging provides no protection , so be prepared for a warped net . While the net is big , it is very hard to catch -LRB- and keep -RRB- something since the net does not close over . There were many inexpensive nets to choose from when I was shopping , and I am sorry I picked this one . More work -LRB- fashion your own handle and try to get packaging film off net without creating damage -RRB- than it 's worth .
 The tools in this `` value package '' broke upon first use . They look good in the photograph , but they 're of very very VERY low quality . Steer clear of this company.One tip of the watch band remover just broke clean of -- the steel is not tempered . The watch band link remover is a piece of junk
 I purchased these gloves for some hand protection which I needed for my motorcycle class . I wore these for the duration for the class which , while not a lot of time , gave me eight hours to test them out in summer heat.First off some good points . They 're vented which aids in keeping your hands cooler than plain leather . The pad on the inside of the palm is thicker than the rest of the glove which , usually being the first place to hit the ground , makes them a touch more durable . Also the leather itself is more supple than most cowhide.Now for the bad news . While they 're vented , the cooling it adds is negligible . Also the seam for the leather is on the inside and that is its biggest flaw . As you ride the seam digs into your skin and starts irritating it.Overall , they 're cheap but it might be worth it to spring for a nicer pair if only to avoid the inner seam .
 Descriptions states this is a `` SET '' of flags and that `` EACH '' flag is a certain size , fabric , etc.Very poor and false advertising.Product FeaturesColor
 so thin , when it rains it may be a good choice if u do n't have a raincoat .
 It has been difficult writing a review for this dvd since I sincerely like the woman , Serene , after watching it . She just seems sincerely nice and excited about communicating how good it is for people 's health to eat raw food.So what are the dvd 's downfalls in my eyes?First ... The Film is not clearly described as an entirely raw food plug , no cooking at all , so that was a bit surprising.That could be ok , because I am trying to move my family to healthy living and eating and using our garden and local farmers markets . I would love some great recipes and information on raw food . However , neither are in this dvd.Second , although Serene is a friendly , energetic cheerleader for the lifestyle she has chosen -LRB- eating raw -RRB- it is very difficult to follow her as she jumps from thought to thought in a hap-hazard manor that is disorganized and leaves the viewer without many completed thoughts and given whiplash trying to pull those partial thoughts together . Serene , I do n't blame you for this your producer should have organized the various segments better for you -LRB- just a note from my husband there -RRB- . The very few recipes given have no amounts either spoken in the dvd nor written . They are only a handful of jumping off points ... So Third , I did not obtain one new recipe from this dvd . I am not a chef , nor am I an expert cook , but that is why I purchase cookbooks and videos ... to learn something new to make for my family . My favorite example -LRB- outside of making a salad , which does not belong in a dvd unless it is something special with amounts noted that leaves you feeling like you now can bring something new to the table -RRB- is the recipe for bananas and water blended to replace a milk shake ... Fourth , I would have loved some facts and studies or something concrete she had discovered in her own journey to raw food . I do n't think many people who are at the beginning or even in the midst of their own health journey view all sugar as poison , but her Momma states that she has been taught this from her childhood as if it is common sense to the rest of the world . This is just one example of a thought left out there without enough information to support it or let us know what to do with that little bit of information . Does she view raw honey or sucanat as a poison in any quantity ? How about sprouted grain ? What about oxalates ? What about soaking nuts and grains to remove phytates ? Are somethings unhealthy to eat raw ? I know one person can never answer all of these questions , but none were touched on in this film.I think raw is wonderful and I think Serene maybe too ... the content of this dvd is just incomplete and not useful to me .

 I was n't pleased at all with the light output and the battery life is n't good either
 The retention device does not consistently release the trigger guard when drawing . I would not trust my life to this holster ... so I returned it .
 These look like nice gloves . Chiba Sports did not deliver my order and will not respond to my email . Do n't do business with Chiba Sports .
 I owned this product and ended up throwing it in the trash.My daughter wanted it because it had the princesses on it , but let 's face it ; the manufacturer could sell any piece of junk as long as it has a cute character on it . This has got to be the cheapest helmet and pad set I have ever seen . The pink plastic covering on the outside of the helmet actually peeled away from the styrofoam core , and like the other reviewer stated , the straps are all but impossible to adjust and use properly . I find it disturbing that a company like Disney would put their stamp of approval on such a cheap , poorly made product . And scarier still , this is a product that is supposed to provide our children a measure of protection when they are riding their bikes or other similar activities . Please , do n't buy this . You will be better off spending a bit more money on a good quality helemt and pad set . It might not be as cutesy as the princess one , but your child will be safer .
 I bought this for my daughter who is almost 4 and there is no way this is for an average sized toddler . This is not a snug fit at all . Very cheap . I am returning mine soon and going with something that will protect her brains if she falls off her skates or bike .
 The helmet comes with minimal , but useless instructions on how to properly setup the straps and the manufacturer even warns that you should follow the instructions carefully . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 I bought a Motorola headset for `` all series '' two way radios from Amazon , on a link from a page for the Talkabout T5500 . What I got was a headset with a jack that does not even fit my T5500 radios . I found that it only works with radios starting at around $ 200 , a far cry from the $ 30 for two that I paid for mine . When I contacted Amazon to get the situation corrected , they gave me a complete run around . You soon find out that you can only reach them by email , and their email responses are completely unhelpful . By the way , the third party retailer that Amazon reffered me -LRB- to to get two more headsets that Amazon could not supply -RRB- was much more helpful and quickly remidied the situation . Amazon is great if no problems occur , but once they screw up , like they did with this product , they are terrible at correcting their mistakes . I no longer deal with Amazon any more , since I am still holding two headsets I ca n't use , and they were totally incapable of resolving the situation .
 The headset is a bit bulky . Not very comfortable to wear . I could hear the other person talking to me very clearly . However , when I spoke , he could not hear me at all . The boom microphone was not working from the first use . Would not recommend you purchase this .
 The item served its use ; however not the quality I thought it was priced at .
 the end plug on the device , didnt work on any of my phones and the coknnection was horrible at bestif i had not thrown out the packagiung , it would have been sent back alnmost immediatelywould not recommend this to ANYONE
 Plugged this into a Talkabout T6200 and it just transmitted . Transmit button did n't work , VOX did n't work . I have a pair of some older model , I should try the headset on those.Would give this 0 stars if I could .
 This product did not fit my needs for use with motorola walkie talkie .
 After receiving this boon mic , I found it did not work consitently . Losing contact with lost words , and the mic had to be held to the lips , therefore it was not truly hands free . I require a mic that I do not have to touch to work and can be used with VOX
 I did not get what I thought I had purchased , I thought I was buying a headset for a Motorola cell phone , but it was for a 2-way radio . The description for the item I thought I had purchased was not very clear .
 Motorola 53725 SLK Headset with Swivel Boom Mic -LRB- Black -RRB- Once I received the head sets , we tired them out . They worked for about 5 minutes . Afterwords , they stopped working . We tried them again the next day . Nothing . So I returned them .
 The head set did n't work for the radio I had . I should have been more careful . It was a good price , but not if it does n't work with what I had!If someone buys this , they need to make sure and check their model against the list on the head set of models it works on .
 After spending an inordinate amount of time removing it from the packing it was defective . I was going to say more but it 's simply this SAVE YOUR MONEY on this item .
 Did n't have the PTT button I need for it to work with my motorola talkabout radios .
 Not a bad item , but there is no push-to-talk button on it , forcing you to use that horrible VOX . Heavy breathing , talking to other people -LRB- not intending on talking on the radio -RRB- , any anything else loud in the area will trigger it.If you like VOX , it 's okay . Otherwise , there are other options on the market .
 I bought a new pair of Motorola Talkabout FV300 radios and it simply does not work with them . When I plug it in , turn it on and press the PTT button , the radio starts transmitting and does n't stop until I shut the radio off . I knew the VOX feature would n't work , but it was my understanding that it was supposed to still work with manual operation of the PTT button . It does not . However , it does work with my older Talkabout which is a T5000 , but not with VOX . I 'm giving it two stars because they should have been more clear as to which radios work and which do n't .
 I bought two of these , one leaked so i returned it and got a new one , now they both leak and my window to return has lapsed . When i say leaked , i dont mean the pouch that holds water , the mouth piece continually drips water and most likely will drip water onto your clothes , so unless its raining , its very annoying and if it doesnt drip on your clothes , its dripping the water you hope to drink in the near future . Do n't buy this water pack if you really want a water pack , go with the Camelbak brand , that is what I have now and it was worth the money .
 For the price this item is hard to pass up . The mouth nozzle is terrible after just one use it wont stop leaking so by the end of the day my middle layers were soaked .
 I have used these type of hydration products for years and this is the worse one I have ever bought.It constantly drips from the mouth piece which is totally annoying .
 The pack completely fell apart . The water connection on the bottom leak as well as other part of the water bag . The water swell up to the storage pocket and damage my phone . I only use it twice a week since purchase . That is not even a month of use . Now I ca n't return it since the return date has pass .
 I purchased a `` High Sierra water back pack '' . It worked great for 2 weeks but after that it started to leak . Out of the piece you suck on a stream of water was flowing out all over my shirt . I will still buy one more and give the `` High Sierra '' brand a chance but we will see . I will let everyone know if it happens again . God Bless !
 I tried to tell the boy to save up and wait until he could afford better , but being 10 , he knew better . Day two
 It leaks ! the valve does not work properly , you 'll lose most of the water because of this issue , moves from side to side when running , should have a larger side pocket .
 Not a good product . Mouth piece does not seal after few uses . I bought 2 and same result . Trying to get warranty from manufacturer .
 After 3 times I used my hydration pack the plastic components to hold the straps started to crack , unfortunately I 'd have to buy something else and endup spending even more money ... should have bought a better one in the first place !
 It is a good quality bag ... small and convenient but unfortunately , it does n't have a cross strap therefore , the bag keep sliding down on your back once it is filled with water -LRB- weight -RRB- . So , you will be wearing this bag in the lower back rather than up high like a normal backpack .
 Wore it hiking one time and loved it . Wore it a second time and the seal broke and I had water all over my back . Spend the extra dough on a camelbak .
 Not sure what the problem is and i ca n't find a way to contact them , but we should have had this product 5 days ago and when we looked it up just now , it still has n't shipped !! REALLY ??? And so tell me then what the deal is !
 Extremely hard to close . The mouth piece leaks constantly . There is a resting place on the shelf just in case the hurricane comes & I must use it .
 Estoy extra & ntilde ; ado con lo sucedido , pero despues de un mes todavia no me llega el producto , me gustaria que me confirmen cuando lo enviaron , Gracias !
 I returned this product because it was not very tight in the upper part and was like going down when I bend my knee !
 Emblem is what I expected but will not remain on wall which was cleaned and allowed to dry before locating emblem . Scotch tape is only way to keep it on wall.Truly disappointed .
 The problem with these type of Nike watches is that the bands are n't very durable and are expensive to replace . The curved display is cool , though .
 Lousy service from seller and Amazon . Arrived with a broken sprayer handle . No help from either seller or Amazon.One star for the bad service.Good product , though .
 I purchased 12pk OLB3 baseballs and just arrived today.However , 8 out of 12 balls are terrible - balls have not good stiches and few dents on its surface.I know I bought at cheap price , but I can not satisfy with the condition of balls -LRB- I know Rawlings is the best at baseballs -RRB- . I hope the seller would be more careful with keeping their stocks so that future buyers can satisfy with their purchase .
 These balls are trash . They fall apart after being hit a few times with a wooden bat . They however are good for pitching , my curveball , slider , and change up have great movement with these balls . Yet they do not carry off the bat and they fall apart easily , so it is not worth the money , even though they are cheap .
 i have these brakes on my boardman team , i have had to replace the tension bolt in both front and back brake as they have both snapped while i have been cycling , i have had to service the brakes countless times as they hardly every sit strait . they are ok but if you can afford Shimano 2012 105 Caliper Bicycle Brake - BR-5700 then defo upgrade ! i would recommend these if you are cycling only a few miles a day as they will cause more problems than they will solve
 I ordered one of these to get the calorie and distance tracking that myOmron HJ-150 does not provide . After trying it out for a day I have decided to send it back - my first ever Amazon return of seven years of Amazon ordering . Every little jiggle set the thing off on steps , even when I decreased the sensitivity . If you take it off it adds steps , bound up the stairs with a bounce it adds extra steps , shake it a tad it adds extra steps . You can also hear the mechanism inside rattle with movement . It drives me crazy . I guess I am spoiled with my Omron . I can take it off and shake it like a maraca and it will not add anything to my steps . It also does not make a bit of noise - at all . The Omron is just spot on . I wish the High Gear had been the same , because it is thinner and keeps track of things the Omron does not . Oh well , I guess I will be looking for an Omron that has the features I am looking for .
 If you want to turn this off you can only do it by taking out the battery ... which is not easy . Not easy to adjust to your step ... always over estimated the number of steps I took by 10 - 15 % . If you are just looking for something cheap and easy to get an idea of your number of daily steps , this will do the job ... but if you want anything else ... definitely upgrade to a more expensive device .
 I ordered 2 of these . They are difficult to set . It took 3 people to try to figure out the directions and no one had any luck . They were cheap and not even worth the postage to return . Do n't bother purchasing !
 I personally feel that this product is not very effective . The clock on the product works great but i took it on 4 different runs on a course where i knew the distance and thsi product failed miserably . The distance count was off anywhere beween .35 and 1.05 miles on every run . I do not reccommend this product as anything more than a watch .
 I received this pedometer wrapped in a flimsy plastic covering along with two other items I bought . I spent over one-half hour trying to get it to work . Do n't these people check things before they send the product ? The battery seems to work . At least there are some digital characters on its face.I read the entire instructions , but when I tried to set the time by inserting a stylus in the little holes , nothing worked . Also depressing the other features did not work.This $ 10.99 product is not worth that price when there are far better ones that are a lot cheaper . and I have had several of those that work well . I 've just lost that amount because I ca n't send it back because they did not include a box in which to return it.I am very disappointed in Amazon and the companies they use . I have used them for years , but recently , there seems to be a deterioration in their products . This is the second item I have wasted money on their products . The other product was a rather expensive item that I waited too long to return.At this time , I do n't plan on buying anything through Amazon for some time , if ever .
 This was not a good Pedometer . It worked for two weeks and stopped working . I would not recommend you to purchase this product . Pay a little more and get a better pedometer . Very disappointed .
 Pedometer did not work properly . I contacted the seller but got no response . Amazon credited my account
 One of the reviews says it 's a great pedometer for $ 5 and many of the other reviews mention it 's so good for the price . It 's $ 10 now . Amazon has doubled the price because it was ranked high . Really sick of that .
 I bought 3 NFL collars , one for each dog . None of them lasted . The NFL collars are thin and have cheap plastic pieces . The Raiders collar was a goner in two days , the Browns collar lasted a week , and the Seahawks collar lasted three . Perhaps it 's a preview of the upcoming season ! Do n't waste your money .
 Product is 6 &#34; short of the 9 ' advertised length and the backing material is very thin -LRB- not much thicker than a piece of indoor/outdoor carpet -RRB- . When I bought this exact same product 5 years ago , the backing was much more substantial , and I was happy with my purchase . This time I 'm not and will be requesting a refund .
 I placed an order on December 18th and as of today , February 1st , I still was not able to receive the product I ordered . First , I was told the shipment will go out on December 20th . Few days later I received an email notification that the item is on backorder and will be shipped by January 29th . Today , February 1st , I contacted The Golf Warehouse directly where I found out that manufacturer did not deliver the item to the warehouse as he was suppose to , which was January 31st , according to the representative . The next shipment is to arrive on February 14th . Wish me luck ! This might turn out to be a Valentine 's gift instead of initial idea of a Christmas gift . Luckily , I received an email to review this product from Amazon , where I initally placed the order from , even though I have nothing else to review . I rate this product with one star just because that is the only option I am allowed in order to submit this review ; otherwise quite frankly , no star would be preferred and that is for the vendor 's service and delivery . Actually , no delivery just yet .
 Expedited shipping was erroneously entered for this order . Tried to change and then cancel it minutes after entry and repeatedly until it came to no avail . Refused package a month ago . Exorbitant charge made to my credit card and I will have to seek resolution with them , since Amazon takes no responsibility . Vendor has not responded to over 20 calls and emails to cancel/refund order.AMAZON PLACES ORDERS WITH SKETCHY VENDORS LIKE THIS AND THEN YOU 'RE STUCK WITH ERRONEOUS CHARGES . BEWARE !!!
 I am using the product for myself to improve my tempo and stroke . Because of the return aspect of the product it makes it easier to continue to practice . By adding the gutter sections there is variety in the length of the putts . This along with the ease of setting the product up have given me different prospective of how I can improve my putting which is 47 % of the game . With consistent use of the product confidence and skill will improve which will reflect in a lower score .
 I had about a 3 page negative review that amazon declined to post because it was too long -LRB- complete with all of my emails to customer service -RRB- , which I can supply anyone with ... Here 's the Cliff 's notes version . I ordered this on Dec 20th . After back and forth emails I was finally given the customer service phone number on Jan 1st . I called them up on Jan 2nd -LRB- which is the day the BBQ set was to be delivered -RRB- and the item still had n't shipped because it was backordered -LRB- it was in stock when I purchased it -RRB- . I was finally told over the phone this almost TWO WEEKS after purchasing the item . I missed my father 's Birthday which was the 2nd and had them cancel the order over the phone . I ordered the same thing from the actual NFLshop site on Jan 2nd and the following day got an email that my BBQ set had been shipped from the AMAZON NFL SHOP . My order was apparently never canceled , so I then had to go back to the real NFLSHOP site and cancel my order with them . TODAY January 10th -LRB- OVER 3 WEEKS FROM WHEN I ORIGINALLY ORDERED THIS -RRB- it finally showed up and I was able to give my dad his very belated 65th birthday gift . Thanks for nothing ... go directly to the NFLshop site and order from them , their customer service is a 1000 times better .
 same problem the plastic broke , it should come with a rubber or plastic sleave to fit over the head to protect it . . can I buy a new head ...
 I received this as a gift . The circle broke after only four times of use and the one pin is also broken . This might have happened in the bag and during transport . The shaft is in good shape . Can I purchase another plastic retainer and reassemble?Thank You
 I purchased this seat from Amazon and as usual , fulfillment was great ! Then , I installed the seat and began riding . I do about 8 miles per day on flat to gentle hill bike trails for exercise . The seat was pretty comfortable UNTIL , I hit a SMALL bump in the trail on my suspension MTB last week and the seat up . I came down with full weiforce onto the top tuibe of the bike and and crashed . When I say blew up , I mean there were seat parts all over the place.What appeared to happen during the catastrophic failure of this poorly and inadequately designed product was the attachment rails that fit into the seat post clamp bent down in front of the clamp when my weight came down on it going over the small bump -LRB- less than 2 inches -RRB- . This bending , in turn , put undue pressure on two plastic attachment posts at the saeat 's rear breaking them at the ends of the attaching screw . This detached the poly foam seat itself from it 's metal attaching rails . The two posts connecting the rails to the seat are held by VERY SHORT screws going into the posts less than 1/2 of their length . The sheer point was a full inch below the bottom of the poly seat moulding.Theese 2 posts appear to be molded directly into the seat and are only about a half inch diameter each and are hidden from view . They are essentially plastic cylinders 1 1/2 '' - 2 '' long that capture the screw with a wall thickness of only an eight to a quarter inch at most . CLEARLY NOT ENOUGH STRUCTURAL STRENGTH to maintain structural integrity when stressed . As I mentioned , the undersized posts are NOT VISIBLE because they are surrounded by two rubber bumpers presumably designed to absorb shock -LRB- clearly not functional -RRB- . The rails also are not made of material strong enough to function as designed as they bent down so easily at the front . They appear to be cold steel rather than tougher stainless or magnesium allow that would resist bending.The injury I sustained to my perineum and spine has not yet resolved and I am considering legal remedies for all the discomfort , pain and distress caused by this faulty product . This seat 's inadequate design is NOT SAFE and certainly NOT DURABLE . IF YOU VALUE YOUR HEALTH , DO NOT BUY THIS SEAT .
 I would not recommend this product to any one . Had tears in the seams within a week of using it .
 the product doesnt look like it was pictured and the velcrow fell apart within a week .
 The glasses in the picture are not the pharmium glasses I found out.The glasses I received are still good and I do like them so I decided to keep them , however they are NOT the glasses pictured.So , be careful , if these are exactly what you want then look elsewhere.The glasses pictured are about $ 120 bucks , not the $ 89.99 quoted .
 The pictures shown are not of the Pharmium model . I think the pics are of the Kickflip model . I have a pair of Pharmium glasses . Great construction , lasts a long time with good lens quality .
 We tried to buy this item under my wife 's account . She could not remember her password and the sell was rejected . So , I opened another account in my name and bought this item . The next day her bank account was debited for the total amount . We ended up getting two orders . I called and the lady assured me that all I had to do was refuse the first one and we would not be charged shipping charges . BUT WE WERE!As I told the lady , if anyone can go into an account without knowing the password and buy something , then there is a real problem somewhere . Unless this is cleared up , we will not be buying anything else.Blessings , BJ Hudson
 This holster is made to fit a SW J frame . I bought this for my SW 317 . The retaining strap is at the wrong angle and too short . I took photos of my gun in the holster and returned it to the seller . The seller was very nice and refuned my money immediately upon return . They were also appreciative of all the information I included with the holster when I returned it to them . From the reply I got , it sounds like they were going to try to redesign the holster so it would fit properly . I would buy from this seller again but not this holster .
 This was a horrible experience in gift giving . I ordered this toybox as a baby gift . First , the website did not let me send a message stating it was a gift , from whom , etc. . Amazon was absolutely no help in this arena and placed the blame on the website of the seller . Then I found out the package was delivered to my friends in Albuquerque -LRB- I live in Atlanta -RRB- with absolutely no assembly instructions . The box was void of any phone numbers or other references to figure out how to request instructions . Without my knowledge , my friends finally found a website site and tracked down the manufacturer to request assembly instructions . This was my first time buying anything from amazon.com and it will be my last .
 I purchased this Toy Chest since it was in sale and got it today and we started assembling . When we put the screws and tighten the wood cracks in several places . I do n't know how many days its going to last . I dont know why people use pressed wood for this kind of piece and sell it for $ -LSB- ... -RSB- . This piece is not definetly worth the money . Please starting using solid wood or anything that does not crack . I love the look , but that deceives . My son loves to sit on it , but I am worried that it will break someday . By the way the Instructions for Assembly given with the product is should be much more clear and step by step .
 I figured for over $ 100 I would have received something of better quality . There were minor scratches on most pieces and the graphics were slightly smudged . Nothing major enough to go through the hassle of taking it apart , packing it back up , and dealing with the return process . Assembly did n't go well , the included screws broke -LRB- I broke three of them , only by using a handheld screwdriver , the heads twisted right off -RRB- . I ended up having to drill extra holes since the included screws broke off . Also , the instructions -LRB- the usual Chinese wordless instruction sheet -RRB- did n't put things together in the right order , so you ended up having to improvise . Parts of it are little more than cheap press board . I have my questions on whether or not it is going to last in my son 's room more than a year or two.All in all , just know you 're paying $ 100 for a cheaply made Chinese made novelty item , not a real piece of furniture .
 This ball is not a `` Full Grain '' leather football . It is a composite that retails between $ 40 and $ 50 not $ 121 as stated . The price is probably worse than what you would find at your local sporting goods store . I did buy and return this ball for a full refund , a bit of a hassle but got all my money back .
 This is a lousy product . It only has 4 straps on each side and nothing to hold the cover down on the front or rear . There is no way you could ever , ever trailer with this cover like the ad says you can . The worse thing is you can not return ! Stay away from this cover .
 This was the most boring video I have watched . I have attended many spin classes and when I go , I want someone that `` makes '' you get up and spin your butt off . This guy let you choose your intensity and just did not encourage me to do my best , instead , offered a way out at every level . I know that if you ca n't keep up it is ok to sit and rest and then resume , I am for that , but I need someone to make me get up and do my best .
 I have these cricket balls and one lasts only 15 overs hardly . Do n't go for these , rather look for other brands.Ashok
 This Galco holster is a durable holster made by a great company with an excellent reputation , but it is n't right for me.I tried to break this holster in for about a month after receiving it and have not been able to get the retention just right for my Fourth Generation Glock 22 . The holster hugs the Glock much too tightly for a smooth and clean draw , like I 'm used to . I have even taken the retention screw completely out of the holster and the gun still sticks when drawing.The holster is also uncomfortable when worn and does not bend enough around my hip . I have to tighten my belt to an uncomfortable tightness in order to make it look okay when wearing it . If I do n't tighten it really tight , the stiffness of the holster creates a large gap between my pants and the back of the holster . I am 6 ' 2 '' and weight about 205lbs , just to give you an idea of my frame . Someone a little heavier may not have as much of a problem as I 've had with this.With that being said , the quality of the holster is amazing . It looks very appealing , and I like how the 3 belt loops allow you to cant the firearm back and forth.If this holster was comfortable and allowed for a smother draw I would have given it 5 stars . You may want to find this in a store and make sure you like it before spending so much on a holster . I ultimately decided to buy a much cheaper plastic paddle holster for my Glock and could n't be happier .
 I bought this because I liked the size , weight and cost . I end up having several different types . Each quarter I review what is in my basic overnight pack , which is a single strap over the shoulder . I have replaced these with Adventure medical kits 8.5 ounce Bivy . Much more expensive ; but for the weight and size it offers much more capability . i would not buy these again .
 The width of these is 50.75-51 '' if you hold completely stretched out.Amazon says it is 52 . The shorter dimension is the one that is most important that it covers your body when you are laying down . I also use them to cover windows in the hot summer and cold winter .
 I received my package today thinking that I would have 10 packs inside , since that is what I ordered . Instead , one pitiful package fell out which was n't even the same as the one pictured above . I assume that there must be something wrong with the shipments going out of this business . I hope they remedy this quickly since they still owe me 9 more packs .
 This delivery was prompt - HOWEVER - I have opened 3 so far and all of the 3 are not cut properly and are torn on one side . If you have ever worked with his item you know that it will tear very quickly if there is the slightest cut . The first is in the garbage and the other 2 had to be taped . I have to assume that the other 7 are the same .
 I tried to open one of these and it was stuck together - I could n't unfold it without it tearing . The reflective lining was also missing over most of the blanket . It would be completely useless in a survival situation .
 I bought this product as a pack of 10 . They seem to be what I expected , except when I opened the box -LRB- there were other items shipped along with this -RRB- , the `` pack '' -LRB- really just a plastic bag -RRB- had been opened , and there were only 8 blankets - not 10 . I am upset with Amazon - rather than the seller - because their only remedy is for me to ship them back to them -LRB- at Amazon 's cost -RRB- , get a refund , and re-purchase them . Well , the problem there is that I now have to pay shipping , which is pretty much the same as the cost of the item . Why should I have to pay to re-ship an order that Amazon screwed up ?!? I guess that this is a lesson learned for me and anyone who reads this review
 false advertisement man . . its a film not blanket . . rips like toilet paperman so sad i wasted my hard workin earned money on it
 I do not care about bargan or cheap . That seems to ba all folks care about . What about get what you pay for ?????
 not effective . I tore one of the sheets unfolding it so I could look at it . I think in an emergency this would be a real let down .
 These are very thin . Afraid to open one up as it might rip . Disappointed in the quality , really expected something a little more durable .
 item clearly says pack of ten , yet I only received one blanket for $ 8.19 Wanted these for prizes for a Civil Air Patrol party and now we go without because someone ca n't count to ten .
 I ordered 2 packages of 10 `` emergency mylar thermal blankets '' . When I got the package , there were 2 individual mylar blankets ... not 2 orders of 10 .
 I suppose these are ok -LRB- I have n't used them -RRB- however , I only received 9 of the 10 and they are n't in a ` pack ' they are just thrown into a box individually .
 Product specifications list these as 52 inches x 84 inches . I just received my order and they are labeled as 82 inches . If size matters , and it does , this item comes up short .
 Emergency blankets are usually used in -LRB- oh , I do n't know -RRB- an EMERGENCY . That being said , these blankets tear extremely easily . They just are too thin . Do n't waste your money .
 I ordered this and it came today . It came in a very small package . I opened it up and it was only ONE large emergency blanket . Did you all get ten packages sent to you because I sure did n't .
 the item is really good but in the desciption say is a pack of 10 i just recieve 1 blanket so were is my other 9 blankets plus i wait like a month to recieve this
 What appears to be a nice , handmade product is packaged in a careless way . Sled arrived in a thin crushed cardboard box without cushioning , and wooden frame was broken . Now it is my responsibility to deal with repacking and returning . Really disappointing . A better packing job would have prevented such waste .
 This kicksled ships in two boxes . Apparently , there is no record of this in the Amazon system . I received only one box - a chair , but no runners . Customer service is not at all interested in even checking to see if the other box is in the warehouse - returning it is the only option . So much for the Christmas present ... It might be a better bet to buy this from someone small .
 I was using a Dyna Disc Balance Cusion in physical therapy.I paid more to purchase the brand name product , and was disappointed in the size.It is about an inch smaller in diameter than the Dyna Disc at Physical Therapy , and much less comfortable to sit on and use because of the smaller size .
 I made a significant effort to get this instead of a cheaper look-alike . I bought two . One was a factory reject . The air valve is a disintegrating blob of white rubber or vinyl or whatever . Air can go in but can not exit . Every attempt to adjust amount of inflation results in liquid rubber in the inflation pin making it useless . It seems only a matter of time before it can no longer keep air in the cushion and becomes a total waste of money . They is is the first and only disappointing Amazon purchase . And because we are continually traveling , a return or a claim is unviable . So we are quite screwed on this purchase . The OTHER Dyna Disc works fine but 1 out of 2 is unsatisfactory . Future Amazon purchases will certainly be affected by this bad deal .
 this product is great however , it does not last . It cracks and breaks near the pump hole . This has happened to two of the same discs in the same location . We will go with another product in the future .
 the instructions were fine , however the many different types of nuts , bolts and washers were not separated , labeled or otherwise designated so that it made for a very difficult assembly process . i even assembled one section erroneously and then had to disassemble the section and find the correct nuts , bolts & washers . this could have been avoided by separating , labeling or otherwise designating the many small parts . i tell you this because i usually enjoy assembling complex units and do so a lot . after the one mistake i feel confident that i got it done right , only to find that the upper struts move and creak and are imperfectly aligned . there is nothing i can do about it , because it is a byproduct of mass assembly , oh yeah and i can not imagine how i could get the incredibly heavy parts back into the cardboard box that barely survived the journey to my house , i probably would 've had to ship it in several packages , so i 'm stuck with it . it creaks very loudly as you do pull-ups -LRB- a loud metallic bang ! -RRB- , and yet it is relatively inexpensive and has increased my gnarly-ness -LRB- har ! -RRB- and these are the only reasons i give it two stars .
 I bought this product after reading a lot of reviews on it here on Amazon . It arrived quite on time , and thanks to the reviews I read , it had a heads up on the instructions booklet -LRB- It is unreliable -RRB- . When I opened the package , I noticed they had made some update in the instruction booklet . Although , it 's still not 100 % reliable , the screws are still wrongly labelled and I had to figure it out and do some measurements and mathematics . As a result , it took me about 2hrs to assemble.The reason why I am not happy with this purchase besides all mentioned above , is the fact that my hubby and I wanted a power tower for the sole purpose of performing dips . I am 5.2 , 144lbs and my hubby is 5.6 , 168lbs . The dips handle is uncomfortable and TOO HIGH UP . It 's so high that we exert too much pressure on our shoulders so that we are unable to concentrate on our dips.I wish I had known the appropriate height this product was intended for as per dips , or better still that the manufacturers made the dips handle adjustable -LRB- height-wise -RRB- . It 's just been two days since we assembled it , and we do n't know what to do now . I feel like I made a bad decision in purchasing it . I would n't recommend it if you intend using it for dips and you are not a tall person .
 Positives : Easily assembled following included instructions in about 90 minutes.Materials seem like they will last.Negatives : Space between uprights is very narrow . I 'm 6 ' 2 &#34; and 170lbs -LRB- aka bean pole -RRB- , and I find the space between the uprights to be minimally acceptable.The base is not wide enough , nor heavy enough , to provide a safe feeling while doing dips ... mine wobbles back-and-forth . The inner chin-up bars are too close to the back-rest making them worthless because my body is pressed into the back-rest while gripping them.The holes for the locking pins that hold the dip/ab handles in place do not line up quite right making it a pain in the rear to switch modes.Overall : I would not recommend this stand to a friend . It suffices for pull-ups , abs , and dips . It does not work for chin-ups . I do not always feel safe while using it .
 Product instructions were outdated and did n't make sense . Some of the parts were rusted and paint was blistering . The main supports wobble no matter how much I tighten the bolts ... bottom line is you get what u pay for ... i am very disappointed ... and i shop on amazon almost everyday . spend the money and buy something else .
 Does not trap heat . Still feel cold after wearing in winter weather . Do not recommend for winter weather . Feel a bit itchy .
 So , we had a blizzard , and my heater died the day it hit and was out for 10 days . I bought a few oil-filled electric radiators and dressed in multiple layers and was OK , except for my feet . I ordered these , and bought a couple of pairs of Dickies insuled work socks from Wal-Mart , and some more substantial Carhartt wool work socks from a local Western wear store to tide me over till they got here.The Dickies were OK , but not great . The Carhartts were better , but not perfect . When I put the Dickies on first , then the Carhartts , though , it was really awesome.When these got here , they were so much thicker than the other socks , I thought they 'd be a lot warmer , but that was n't the case . I guess the weave is n't as tight . I tried wearing the Dickies under them , but they were so thick that with the Dickies underneath , I could n't fit my feet in my shoes.Again , it 's not really fair to write a critical review when I used them for a purpose other than that for which they were intended . If you 're planning on layering them , though , I 'd recommend buying your boots a size larger than normal .
 super rough fabric and way too thick . you would not be able to wear same shoes with these socks on
 these socks shrank and i still cant were them am a female 8 , very hard to put back on , do n't buy .
 This product is not awesome . It provides some trivia for the sports lover . But compared with other games out there today and for the price , I think there are better ones to choose . I would not purchase it again .
 Not what I ordered . It was described AND pictured as having a handle . It arrived ... NO HANDLE . It is not a mess tin its a storage box . Good quality Aluminum you will need to take a file to the edges though as they are very sharp !!! Could n't even be bothered to send it back . Its a miscellaneous screws and nails bin in my garage ! Here is their link ... http://www.amazon.com/Trangia-327567-P-Mess-Aluminium-Tin/dp/images/B008YW70EK/ref=dp_image_x_0?ie=UTF8&color;_name=x&img;=0&s;=sporting-goodsI see a HANDLE !
 You can get a large box of them for a few bucks at your local Walmart . Much more cost effective .
 My Omega bladder never really gets `` funky '' ; however , the tube usually gets algae in it from continued use . After trying bleach , I decided to get the official Cleaning Tabs along with the brush set . Initially , I tried one tab in the recomended amount of water for five minutes -LRB- recommended time -RRB- , but the only result was the water turned slightly blue . So , I waited about an hour and used the tube brush , but nothing happened . At that point , I put in another cleaning tablet and waited overnight . Again I used the tube brush and still no affect . Granted my tube had some tough algae which had been in there for a while , but I expected some of it to be removed . This product probably works okay as a maintenance protocol , but if your tube has not been really cleaned in a season or two you may just want to order a new tube instead .
 I ordered this product and received it in a timely manner . It was in good condition when it arrived . However , when I tried putting my Sig Sauer P226 Elite into the holster it was a very tight fit . So much so , that I had trouble preventing the slide from being pushed back . Once I WAS able to get my gun in , it was near impossible to draw my weapon quickly . In fact it was near impossible to draw it one handed . I had to use my left hand to hold the holster while attempting to draw my gun . And still it was with some difficulty that I was able to accomplish the task . In reading the directions that came with the holster I found that the company expects the holster to be tight . They want you to loosen it by using your fingers to stretch the leather . When I tried this I could tell it was going to take quite awhile -LRB- if ever -RRB- to get it to where I needed it to be able to draw my gun quickly . They also specify that you can not use any type of oil to aid the process . Feeling that the holster was too much work for how much I spent on it I returned it without feeling any apprehension . So if you dont mind working with it I would say go ahead and buy it due to the fact that it is quality construction . Or if you 're like me , you know there are other holsters out there of similar quality and price that wont take any work . As usual , Amazon made returning the item quick and painless .
 The ball is ok . It comes with no inflator . The shipping is a rip off .
 Make sure you are ok with the shipping rate ! Turned out to be $ 13.95 for this item .
 These are not sunglasses . They have yellow lenses with black stickers at the bottom . Not what I thought I was getting .
 Bought it yesterday , it is going back tomorrow . Absolutely poor design and construction . That bar sticks right in the middle of your back ; you can not get it tight enough so that it does n't slant down when you sit on it -LRB- and I 'm 145lbs -RRB- ; the seat itself is about the size of a dinner plate and the seat is covered with nearly zero padding ; need I say more ??? I ca n't even say this is good for a short sitting , let alone a half day hunt . Go back to the drawing board !
 I ordered 2 of these and will be retuning both soon . I am a road racer . Racers want everything on their bikes to be an exact fit . We do not like `` sloppiness . '' I felt like this mount made my the computer/handlebar look `` bulky . '' The sides of the mount stay in a `` flared '' out position , and it just does n't look Pro . I am surprised Polar would even manufacture such a product . I realize that people have different diameters of handlebars , but the thing should at least hinge to make it `` form fit '' the bar . I guess for some people , this mount is fine , but if you are a serious roadie or mtn biker , I think you would be better off finding a different mounting system.Just my 2 cents , Stew

 Like most Cold Steel knives this knife is a very high quality piece of equipment . The edge is razor sharp , the handle feels good in the hand and the design of the knife allows it to be deployed with lightening speed . This knife was a birthday gift from my little brother and I carried it daily for about 6 months until a design flaw became so painfully apparent that I never carried it again . The knife is carried using a pocket clip in a position to where the tip of the knife blade is at the top of your pocket -LRB- point up -RRB- . One evening I was riding my motorcycle and pulled into a gas station to fuel up . It was cold outside so I took off my gloves and I went to pull my wallet out of my pocket -LRB- which I kept next to the knife -RRB- and promptly sliced the tip of my finger so bad that I needed stitches . Blood everywhere and as you might imagine it hurt pretty darn bad . The little tab on the blade that operates as a hand guard and allows it to open one handed had worked the knife open about an inch , but the blade is designed in such a way that the tip will just bite right into flesh as if were nothing.I do not recommend carrying this knife in your pocket unless you tighten down the swivel screw so tight that it defeats any possibility of accidentally opening on you -LRB- I never did find the `` sweet spot '' -RRB- . Of course if the clip were the other way around I suppose you could cut your leg instead of your hand , but at least this would allow for the tang/hand guard to be at the top of your pocket rather than the bottom where it gets constantly bumped . I did try carrying it for a while with nothing but the knife in my pocket and that did work out better but truthfully , there are better designs out there to be had without all the fear of self injury.Great quality knife ... incredible design flaw .
 This knife looks cool and gets such outstanding reviews , so I took a chance and ordered one . I was excited to receive it , but that faded quickly as I checked it out . It does n't really open all that easily as advertised . The tang that is supposed to catch on the corner your pocket for quick opening is so sharp and edgy that it will rip the corner of your pockets apart in no time . Even using the tang with your finger or thumb is edgy to the touch . One thing I will say though is that it arrived very sharp and the blade appears to be of high quality ... although with a significant amount of wiggle . There is no way this knife is worth the $ 70 retail price . With the $ 40-ish cost from Amazon ... you decide . I decided to return it .
 second cold steel knife and both do not hold a edge . if you want a good knife buy a kershaw .
 Insufficient padding to provide any noticeable protection . My current Under Armor padding is far superior .
 Very unhappy with the hat I received . There is a black smear above the logos . Tag is torn off . And it is soiled.Was supposed to be a surprise gift for my husband who loves the Eagles . Must return it . Really wanted that hat !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 No wonder they wo n't show a picture of these . Even Elton John on his worst day would n't wear these sunglasses .
 I first purchase the WE 1911 about Christmas time , and initially I was underwhelmed . The shipping took three weeks , which is alright for something coming from China , but the estimate said 5 business days . Upon receiving the gun in the mail , I was very impressed by the feel of the it . I own a real 1911 from World War 2 , and they have similar weights to them even with no magazine . I was very intrigued by this gun , and took it apart numerous times to discover how it worked . To my satisfaction , the parts inside were very similar to a real 1911 , and field stripping it was just like the real thing.However , the good things do n't last . Unfortunately for me , the gun is made of poor quality pot metal that happens to last long enough to make a return impossible , but shoddy enough to become brittle at the smallest catch . One night whilst out on vacation , the recoil plug broke , leading to the bending of the barrel bushing . This was a serious problem , and required replacement parts . However , I was not content with just fixing the gun and waiting until it broke again . I wanted a permanent fix . I discovered that the recoil rod , which guides the spring into the recoil plug , had been too long for the gun , and over time had slammed into the recoil plug , causing a small lip -LRB- which I might add is NOT present in the real thing -RRB- to break off , thus allowing the full force of the spring to press into the front of the gun -LRB- barrel bushing -RRB- . Long story short , I researched the problem , and discovered it was widespread . Not only has nothing been done about this problem , but there really is no quick fix . Filing down the guide rod might fix the problem , but that does n't help the poor metal quality . Buying a strong barrel bushing will cause the cheap slide to fracture . Replacing the parts will over time cost more than the gun is worth.Overall I rate this gun 2 stars for it 's lack of good quality build , and uneasy fixes . The gun , while in working order , is fantastic . Uses a lot of gas , and is n't super accurate , but that is to be expected of a sidearm . If you are only going to use this once , and just want to fiddle with it and display it , then this is the gun for you . However , if you plan on using it regularly , then forget about it . Spend the extra money for a better brand.Would I recommend this to friends ? No . Would I buy it again ? No . Do I regret it ? No . The reason is because it was fun while it lasted , and really does have the feel of a 1911 . That ca n't be easily replicated , and getting that feel for this cheap might almost make it worth the money , Almost .

 I set up a heavy thick barrier around a new pond and the frogs -LRB- north american bullfrogs -RRB- did n't seem to mind the smell at all . The snakes living in the surrounding grasses fled , but the frogs made themselves right at home .
 Used this to repel a black snake that insisted on hanging around my front door and slipping into a gap behind my front stoop . Useless . I watched the snake slither right through the stuff on several occasions . Turns out that moth balls from the dollar store works better !
 Have watched , with my own eyes , garter snakes simply slither over a fresh barrier of this without little more than a pause . It certainly is not a sure thing . Smells a bit like mothballs so it might keep them away .
 We applied the Snake Away spreading it like the video suggested . The snakes just laid on top of it . We could not believe it ! It was a waste of money . Ca n't find it on the store shelves , so we ordered on website . Maybe the stores have determined that it does not work and will not carry it anymore . Bought two different times to get the amount we thought we would need to go around the house . Now I wish there is a way to get my money returned . Please tell me how to get my money back ! If you like wasting your money , this is a way to do it .
 The product does work , but only for certain snakes . The deal breaker for me is that it gives off a very strong smell of mothballs . Mothballs themselves would probably work if you ground them up . They cost more than the Snake Away . We unknowingly put it where the fumes could get into the house via the air handler and it was pretty awful until the stuff wore off.So , if you have a problem with the strong smell of mothballs , then you need to find another way to control the snakes .
 I was disappointed when my purchase arrived . The way that the advertisement for this product was written , I was led to believe that this hakama was comparable in quality to another well know product which I currently use . Unfortunately it is not even close . If I had known that It was not a `` high quality '' tetron hakama I would have not made the purchase . I am currently trying to return the product and have sent an e-mail the the seller with no response .
 Love Cathe but this one is just not for me . The complex step choreography left me extremely frustrated -- I spent half the time just watching the TV screen , completely lost ! And Cathe was cuing AS she does the moves , which did n't help . I simply could n't keep up . Give me a straightforward , athletic workout where I do n't have to learn a whole lot of fancy footwork , and I 'm happy . That being said , if you 're experienced with step workouts or you 're very coordinated , then this might be for you . It looks intense & challenging . Beginners and people with two left feet
 I bought this gun and loaded it after one shot spring shot out the front of gun . Complete junk !
 First of all the factory edge is not good , it tore and frayed 550 cord right out of the box . Expect to sharpen the blade upon arrival , I took this knife on an overnight camping trip and used it lightly , sharpening sticks , stripping small branches , cutting para cord ... etc. . Everything went great , I was very happy with the knife I liked the weight and the grip . I got the hard sheath and it was very secure even without the snap fastened , you have to use your thumb to release the knife from the sheath . This did n't bother me , I prefer security over speed when taking out a knife this size , especially if your mounting vertically on a pack strap or your chest . I decided to touch up the blade after the camping trip , I was messing around throwing the blade into the railroad ties around my patio , on the 5th throw the blade stood fast in the wood , but the handle and guard broke at the bolster and went flying . I could n't believe it , with all the great reviews and tested military feats I broke a Ka Bar ? It could of been a factory defect , but it turned me away from Ka Bar for good . I looked on their website and did n't see anything about a warranty or return , I will call them this week and see if they will reimburse or replace the knife . I will update when I get more info .
 This is my first purchase of a much heralded Ka-Bar , I was so excited to open the package . The knife is beautiful and feels great in my hand , the kydex sheath is also very nice . The blade came as dull as a butter knife . I had read reviews that had said that the blade may need a little sharpening out of the box , but this is ridiculous , the blade is unable to cut a sheet of paper . I am extremely disappointed Ka-Bar ; the knife looks great and feels to be of high quality but a knife sold as a `` fighting/utility knife '' should come with a better edge than this . I was not only disappointed , but actually embarrassed in front of my friends when I opened up this very dull knife . I sincerely hope I just got a bad apple from the Ka-Bar bunch as the brand has an excellent reputation preceding it , unfortunately , I could never recommend this knife to anyone looking for a sharp blade out of the box .
 I was about to go on a major camping trip and wanted to buy a `` good '' knife . I did n't have much time to shop , so I bought the Ka-bar due to the historic name . That was a huge mistake as the knife is made from a very soft 1095 carbon steel . The problem is that the long blade is too thin for soft steel and can actually be bent sideways with little effort . I found this out the hard way during my trip only about a week after I bought it . After several uses simply shaving wood , I looked at it and noticed it looked slightly bent . By placing my thumbs on the side of the blade where it connects to the handle -LRB- in technical terms , on the blade 's heel , just above the bolster -RRB- , one set of fingers near the tip and the other set on the bottom of the handle , I actually straightened it back out with only my hands ! The problem plagued me throughout the trip and the knife was never used again . Since it had actually been used in the woods , the store would n't take a return so I lost out completely . There are other knives out there in the same price range with MUCH better quality.The SOG SEAL Pup is actually $ 12 LESS , still has a serrated/straight edge combo , and is a higher quality steel blade . Gerber and Cold Steel also have comparable knives for roughly the same price as the Ka-bar .
 It is a well designed backpack , I think ... But the photo is very deceptive . It is huge -LRB- looks so cute on the photo ... also it does n't really give you the dimension , what 's up with that ? -RRB- and the color is really off green -LRB- not refreshing at all -RRB- and the worst of all , the fabric has metallic shine -LRB- that I do n't like , seriously ... -RRB- that is not shown on the photo at all . I think it 's a good product but totally not what I have expected from the image . It 's a poor advertisement that makes me mad not the product itself .
 When you shoot the target , the bb 's hit it and hit right off it , they do n't stick to the target ! Do n't buy !

 I installed the this fitting at the end of my hose and tested it . The first couple times it leaked so I tightend the screws a little each time . Before the screws ever got tight enough to stop the leaking they pulled through the top portion of the screw hole . I had to buy a metal fitting of a different design .
 Bought this halter because the headline said `` Yearling '' halter . NOT MINI YEARLING which is how it arrived . I 'm so angry they need to be very specific with their advertising whether these are actual HORSE size or miniature horse size .
 We have a baby -LRB- 3 year old -RRB- shire who keeps breaking out of his halters , and any replacements we find are all too small ... I was pleasantly surprised that this piece was too big for our little guy - we made a new hole for the buckle under the chin , and have no complaints . Even though the description says 1100 + pounds , it 'll fit your 1600 + Draft with no problems . : -RRB- Edit
 I bought this to saw down yucca sticks . It broke quickly and did n't hold up at all , breaking after less than 10 cuts . It has stopped me from purchasing another from Gerber . I guess the saying , `` you get what you pay for , '' plays out here . It was cheap and performed poorly . I did waste my money .
 I should have read the other reviews . Do n't let the picture deceive you . There is only 1 ball ! IMO , this is way too much $ for just 1 ball !
 I would not purchase . Get the brass one with the metal band to secure hose . This one leaks and then pops of hose . A wast of time and effort trying to get it to work .
 It was reversed bladed , but the blade was flimsy . The sword was n't folded and the point was n't facing the correct side , i found a better one at a comic shop
 Insufficient padding to provide any noticeable protection . My current Under Armor padding is far superior .
 I was disappointed with the quality of these balls when I received them . One of the two that I ordered split after only one slight use of it . I would consider something different if I were buying again .
 it 's terrible , the rubber was rediculously cheap and actually gota hole in it just from the needle to fill it up , there was no great pressure while inserting it either , it just punctured it like it was paper , so that wasa bad start but the ball still could be used , just needed to put a little air in before use , but then a week later a kid kicked the ball and it hit a vent in the gym and broke , it was n't even on anythign sharp it just busted , terrible ball and cheap rubber , plus it took 2 and a half weeks to get it for it 's 1 week use , waste of money
 I got my order on time and it was correct , but the ball wo n't hold air properly . I think this is due to the way it was packaged and shipped . It arrived deflated and folded up . Once I pumped it up full of air , it still had crease marks from where it was folded during shipping . Within an hour of pumping it full of air , it starts to go flat .
 three of the balls are shaped like eggs . I did not want to pay for shipping to send them back but I was dissappointed with the quality . Balls need to be round to roll properly .
 The balls arrived quickly and were just as they were described . However , the orange one began losing air within the first week and had to be refilled almost daily . Unfortunately , it was completely dead within three weeks . The kids are playing kickball on our blacktop playground , so we need balls that will last longer .
 The 8 '' ball arrived oddly shaped like an egg . It exploded when only half way inflated . The 10 '' ball lost air after the kids played with it two times.Still waiting for a refund to show up in my bank account . Slow email response from this company . We found a similar ball at Walmart for a dollar less . This ball has been in several adult kickball games without a problem !
 Good for the price but not long lasting ... . they pop ang get slashed easily . Would be better for an indoor gym not best for outdoor blacktop or concrete .
 I thought this would be the ideal light weight chair for reading at the beach but I was wrong . You have to keep the straps pretty short in order to sit up but then you find you kind of are folded up in this thing leaning back at an odd angle . It sort of looks like your a child whose fallen into a potty . Loosen the straps though and you find you really are n't sitting up . The whole thing also wraps around you because there 's no bracing so it digs into your thighs and back . This is not ideal for sitting and reading at the beach . I 'm really disappointed . This is not a good chair for reading at the beach .
 Bought these for use at Animal Kingdom at Disney , which , if you 've ever been there , is HOT . These kept us cool for about 5 or 10 minutes , literally . Yes , you can rewet them , but they are n't any better than a regular bandana for that purpose . What a disappointment !
 I ca n't believe I fell for this !! A man in his elder years should know better . But , it gets hot on the Arkansas River fishing in the summer and I was a little desperate . Fact is , this thing did not do ANY cooling that I could tell after about 2 minutes . I agree with the person who said that it DID seem to block the wind , making you hotter . The crystals the seller talks about were all in one wad , bunched up near one end of the little shoestring-like scarf , so how could the crystals cool anything ? I sure do n't have the answer . What I DO know , however , is that these things are purely and simply RIPOFFS !!! Amazon should not allow obvious fraudulent gimmicks to be sold on their site . Hopefully , Amazon has a system for checking out products that receive really negative feedback like this one and can `` outlaw '' future sales of those products . I am probably dreaming , however .
 Product arrived but I discovered that the product is not a triangular bandana as I assumed but a tube of cloth filled with a water obsorbing substance . Returned product for a refund and bought a Chilly Pad from Frogg Toggs instead .
 I was placing a lot of hope in these bandanas helping me make it through the t-ball games . There are cool to the touch but sweating did not seem to activate them . It just was n't cool enough to cool me down at all . If you put them in the refrigerator it was much better but they did n't stay that cold for long . In my opinion , they blocked the breeze when there was one .
 Very disappointed . There is some chemical on this product that gave me quite a bad reaction . It caused insomnia , hyperactivity and a skin eruption like I get when a chemical has me overloaded.Its a great idea but since it is not washable to get this chemical off they will go to someone less sensitive than I.
 I bought the 10 pack , based on the reviews.It definitely worked great the first time I used one . It kept my head cool as I played tennis on a really hot day.But the problem is , It never completely dries . I washed it , and put it in dryer , it never completely dries . Once the stuff inside soaks water/sweat , you can never get rid of it , and soon enough it starts to stink.I had to painstakingly , slit a small hole in each of the 10 , take out the chemical particles , and now I just use them as bandanas for sweat .
 They do swell up in cold water , but you definitely have to do it for at least an hour and it helps to keep them in the refrigerator during that time . You also have to keep turning it to get the cool effect . I will use it when gardening because it 's a little messy for good clothes .
 I prepared the Bandana per instruction . I had them in the refrig over night forthe next day . That next morning I went to put the bandana on and some of the gelbeads were sticking out of the materal . I took those off and then put the bandanaaround my neck . The coolnest only lasted maybe 20 minutes . I was very disappointed!I went back to my stand by , which is a cold wash cloth that had been in the refrigand it lasts at least an hour . I would never buy this product again .
 They did keep us cool , but the colors ran on to the neck of the shirts . Which is weird as we gotten the patriotic ones also and they did not run .
 I got these for my family members who work in a hot warehouse all day . They work great at first but then after a couple of uses they dont really work well . I think they could be good for light use but not everyday use .
 A friend gave me a similar item she had purchased at a fair . It was wonderful!The beads inside were plentiful , stayed plump and cool several hours . After soaking item , able to wear it right away without clothing getting wet . Material was soft cotton , that layed quite nicely when tied . Thinking these were the same , I ordered 2 sets . Not nearly the quality that my friend had puchased . Not enough beads inside , cloth was stiff . Unable to wear after wetting material , it soaked my clothing .
 No more effective , but 8 bucks more expensive than a wet rag . Oh well , it 's just the 874th scam-that-sounded-like-a-good-idea that I 've fallen for .
 Product is cheap . One of the 4 coolers did not have enough crystals to inflate.Neckcooler material bleeds all over your clothing . Does not stay cool after about 45 minutes . Design is bad , when inflated , cooler does not want to bend easily around your neck . Feels like you are wearing a tire . Do n't waste your money . I have purchased other neck coolers far superior to these that actually are comfortable and work well .
 I was so excited to get these , but how disappointing ! The cold did not last long and they are just useless .
 Item received was not as described on Amazon . Amazon listing said `` Lures - 1/12 oz - 3/4 oz . '' The picture showed about 8 Lures with a cost of $ 47.00 , which had been reduced to $ 2.95 . I placed the order and a 5 days later received only 1 single Lure . This Lure I could have bought at Walmart for about $ 2.00 . I called the company and they blamed Amazon for making a mistake on the listing , but they have done nothing to correct it . I am unhappy and very disappointed with this company .
 This ball is not totally round . It actually looks square . The fabric is easy to get dirty and hard to clean . It is not really softer than the regular balls . I wanted a practice voleyball for kids but I think I 'd rather buy a regular voleyball .
 three of the balls are shaped like eggs . I did not want to pay for shipping to send them back but I was dissappointed with the quality . Balls need to be round to roll properly .

 I was disappointed with the quality of these balls when I received them . One of the two that I ordered split after only one slight use of it . I would consider something different if I were buying again .
 it 's terrible , the rubber was rediculously cheap and actually gota hole in it just from the needle to fill it up , there was no great pressure while inserting it either , it just punctured it like it was paper , so that wasa bad start but the ball still could be used , just needed to put a little air in before use , but then a week later a kid kicked the ball and it hit a vent in the gym and broke , it was n't even on anythign sharp it just busted , terrible ball and cheap rubber , plus it took 2 and a half weeks to get it for it 's 1 week use , waste of money
 I got my order on time and it was correct , but the ball wo n't hold air properly . I think this is due to the way it was packaged and shipped . It arrived deflated and folded up . Once I pumped it up full of air , it still had crease marks from where it was folded during shipping . Within an hour of pumping it full of air , it starts to go flat .
 I had one of these put ahead of a Gilmour 9400 timer on a hose bib connection . BAD IDEA . The timer shut-off causes a lot of water hammer and this broke the tee . That is , the hammer , after about a month , caused a crack in the tee that allowed a LOT of water leakage.If you 're just looking for a tee for convience then this is a nice one . The knobs on the valve are big and easy to use.Just DO NOT use it in a constant supply situation where there will be any sort of hard shut off as the plastic WILL crack .
 Simply put , this is a cheap piece that breaks under regular use . It 's a poor value . I 've replaced two in three months .

 Worked for the first day or so . Then trying to switch the valve off only works 50 % of the time -LRB- switching off does n't shut off water stream at all -RRB- . Not recommended .
 I have gone through two of these in six months . The resistance band snaps after a couple of months of use . They should include extra bands and lower the price and I am not even sure it does anything anyway .
 I used this as instructed and it did n't follow through with its promise . It is cheaper and more effective to do just old fashioned crunches . This is just another better than crunches gimmick .
 within six usage of the cross crunch all of the tension bands snapped . was inable to purchase or have bands replaced after less then 2 weeks of use . was also refused a cross crunch replacement

 I had bought this sprayer in the past but now they are made very cheaply and if dropped , the sprayer selection part separates from the body of the sprayer leaking water all over . Not what they used to be .
 I bought this last fall , and it had been working fine . But today -LRB- it 's summer in the Phoenix metro area -RRB- , when I went to use it , the thing had warped and it leaked and whistled . Obviously , most of us keep our nozzles attached to the hose , and of course the hose is stored outside . This all-plastic device could not stand up to the heat .
 I bought two . One leaked as received . Got a replacement . Then , the second one leaked . Gave up . Leak comes from o ring too skinny and plastic not strong enough . Slightly higher water pressure caused the leak . Need to shut off the water after iuse . Very inconvenient .
 After only 4 months -- using it perhaps twice a week , at most -- something inside must have burst , and water is spraying all over . I 've had the Orbit version , only a few dollars more , for a full year , with much more usage weekly , and it 's in okay shape . I would steer clear of the Gilmour products based on my experience .
 the wrist support is worthless , poor design , wobbles , is totally unstable ... if you want a slingshot without a wrist support , it 's not too bad comfy grip , weak bands . you can do better at Walmart .
 Got this to ward of varmits but my life was in danger after less then 75 shots when the tubing and the leather pouch broke.Thank God I was quick on my feet when I had to make it back to my casa with furry critters on my tail.Not a good product .
 Our crossbow slingshot broke after minimal use , just a day after I gave it as a gift . We got a replacement , so we 'll see if the issue was specific to the individual product or to this product overall -LRB- all Barnett Crossbows 17066 Diablo Slingshots -RRB- . I was really annoyed that I had to pay the return shipping for the product in order to get it taken care of .
 The crossbow seemed nice for the first two shots I took with it , however on the third shot the leather pouch broke making the device pretty useless .
 the pouch broke after about 250 shots , which is a little dissapointing because i was going to reinforce it later .
 Let me start out by saying I was refunded all my money , so they are honest . Product is of questionable quality . When I received it , one of the two legs for the arm brace was incorrect , ie they send two right braces instead of a left and a right . Second item , the first time I used it -LRB- without the brace for obvious reasons -RRB- , the leather pouch that holds the .38 shot , tore . This item is now placed in the circular file bin , ie the trash . Someone could get hurt very easily using this defective equipment if the leather pouch that holds the shot tore while you had the sling fully retracted . DO NOT BY THIS PRODUCT .
 Reading some of the review for this backboard made me reluctant , but I ordered one anyway . Took about 10 seconds after unpacking to decide to return it . The 1/4 '' PolyCarbonate backboard material deflects well over 1/4 '' with gentle pressure from a finger . There is no way this will provide a fair bounce off the board as it is stiff where the frame is but very flimsy in the sections between . I 'm amazed that Spalding even sells something like this . Reinforcing the frame everywhere -LRB- eliminating the current large spaces with nothing but the thin backboard -RRB- would make it usable , but I think I 'll just find a better set.The frame seems adequate , and the rim assembly also appears to be solid -- 1 star for that . But the backboard itself just ruins it for me .
 This product is almost impossible to install alone . I ordered the proper installation kit for installing on either a pole or flat wall . I chose to install on a garage wall above the door . Some of the holes were improperly spaced . I had to cut one of the pieces shorter and re-drill a hole in the rim . It would have been much easier if you had a second person to hold the rim while you attempted to install it . The instructions were very confusing as well . Some of the mounting hardware still is n't tight due to incorrect fitting holes .
 The product itself is OK , but the installation was a nightmare . We had to go out and buy parts since those enclosed were not adequate . The instructions were all wrong and the board could not be assembled or installed by following them . The item had to be returned once because the box was all beat up and there were parts missing The second time the box was also delivered in a very poor condition , but no parts missing . So we decided to keep it since this was a Christmas present for my grandson and this was already the middle of January . We did not expect the nightmare that followed . I would n't recommend buying this Backboard from this supplier to anybody .
 I had high expectations for this backboard considering it was the one recommended by Spaulding since they did not have anything in stock for me to purchase direct . Amazon did a great job in getting it to us propmtly , and for free . As soon as I took it out of the box I knew this would n't last too long . It was fairly simple to replace the old broken backboard with this new one , a few bolts here and there . The problem is how cheap the `` polycarbonate '' backboard is . Topping in at a measly 1/8 '' thick board , I felt as if it should have said `` Buyer Beware '' on it . It has no reaction when a ball is shot against it rather all you hear is a resounding `` THUD '' and the ball falls straight down . The frame is cheaply made and has severe wobble to it when a shot is made . Even with 200 lbs of water in the base and the goal squatting at 8 foot , it has way too much movement . I suppose it will be fine for my 8 and 5 year old but I 'm sure glad I did n't have a 3 on 3 tourney scheduled with the guys after receiving this .
 Ordered 6 of these for a facility , three were installed about a month ago and 2 of the 3 rims have broke off from the backboard . I contacted Spalding direct and they did not offer to replace the rims they just offered a website to purchase replacement parts . Not happy with quality !!
 The backboard sucks!season 1 - Flimsy backboard , no rebound action and sounds terribleseason 2 - Backboard becomes unglued at the edges - had to reglueseason 3 - Becomes unglued again and cracks - no longer functions R.I.P.
 This product has been sitting on my garage floor since the day it arrived , I got as far as opening the box and finding the instuctions . The parts list is concise the instructions however are not . I can not even discern which option to choose from to determine which mounting procedure to follow . I have the old backboard removed , so I called Spalding with instructions in hand only to be put through to a voice mail/answering machine . Needless to say after leaving a detailed message and return phone number no one ever returned my call . I consider myself handy enough to complete this task once I had some help Getting Started , not having a Spalding rep to speak to is frustrating . The product seems nice enough but the support desk is non existent ! I have been left frustrated and disatisfied by this purchase .
 Leaked all over the place when I first attached it to my hose , then cracked . I would n't buy this model again .
 Insufficient padding to provide any noticeable protection . My current Under Armor padding is far superior .
 I wish I could have examined this product before buying it . I surely would have bought one of higher quality .
 I needed new ping pong paddles for our table and ordered these online . Must say very light compared to the old set . Not very sturdy at all . Completely disappointed . Will never buy again .
 I also owned a Spyderco knife about 5 years ago and was upset when I 've lost it . I was really looking forward to receive the one that I 've bought but was supprised to see that it had changed ... the knife does n't feel robust as it used tothe materials seems cheeper then it used toeven the sounds it does -LRB- clicks and clacks ... -RRB- are not was they used to be.all in all I 'm not very pleased with Spyderco 's latest knife , would look for different brands next time
 We ordered this for our three year old and it seemed to work well until the ball actually hits the rim and then the rim falls down . Total junk .
 This item is really for young children only . Strictly a toy and not a training tool or substitute for a real basketball hoop . Was expecting a more sturdy device .
 Not what I expected . It looked a lot better in the picture . Disappointed . It is small and really does n't work for five year old twins
 This short as a product is terrific but the description is not correct . It is mens and it does not say that anywhere . It is huge on my daughter who takes Ladies small . I had to reorder and buy youth size .
 Item received was not as described on Amazon . Amazon listing said `` Lures - 1/12 oz - 3/4 oz . '' The picture showed about 8 Lures with a cost of $ 47.00 , which had been reduced to $ 2.95 .

I called the company and they blamed Amazon for making a mistake on the listing , but they have done nothing to correct it . I am unhappy and very disappointed with this company .
 The blind is big . And conceptually , it could be a good blind . Very poor build quality though , from puncture holes due to poor stitching , to actually being able to see pin holes in the fabric in the middle of the walls and ceiling . Perhaps I just received a completely defective unit , but I am not willing to gamble again-returned . For the price , it should be of higher quality . Felt like an $ 80 blind , not $ 150 .
 The 30 caliber slotted end piece broke after about 5 swipes down the barral . Made of plastic ? Just not strong enough for intended use .
 This Hoppe 's Cleaning Rod set -LRB- Item # 3PU -RRB- consists of three aluminum rods and two plastic slotted attachments -LRB- .22 & .30 caliber -RRB- . The rod with the handle on it swivels . Open the plastic package carefully if you want to keep it for storage . The aluminum is n't finished or polished . It just looks like raw stock . I cleaned it before first use.The first set I ordered , the end rod -LRB- rod farthest from the handle -RRB- was slightly bent/warped . I returned it and got a new set . The end rod was bent on this set as well . It still fits down my .22 barrel , but there can be a slight bow and rubbing when force is applied to the rod . I expected better quality from Hoppe 's . My last Hoppe 's rod set was perfect and lasted me 15 + years . I 'll probably try an Outers rod next .
 the controller arrived quickly , but when my son first tried to use it -LRB- on Christmas Day -RRB- the left trigger button on the back of the controller was non-functional . We tried to reset the controller , but nothing appears to work . NOW , we ca n't figure out how to contact Amazon to see about returning it -- and it looks like we ca n't return it anyway , because in order to use it you have to take it out of the packaging ... and the rules say that items can not be returned unless they 're unopened ... so we spent $ 40 for a piece of junk !!
 I bought two of these XBox controllers and either one of them worked two days after the kids started using them.Would not buy one again because I have no idea where to return them .
 This is a good blind once deployed but I was disappointed to discover that the stake poles do not fold and they are not sharp . They are simple lengths of fiberglass with blunt ends . So if the ground is at all hard you will struggle to get this into the ground . Also if you are backpacking in as we do when turkey hunting the poles are too long to easily fit into your backpack . This is just a so so product . I would not recommend and I think I will return it .
 Insufficient padding to provide any noticeable protection . My current Under Armor padding is far superior .
 Pros
 The net does not stay on . Otherwise , it is a sturdy , fun hoop . that is my only complaint , but it is significant because the net falls off so often , my son ends up shooting without the net which is n't as much fun .
 I bought this for my 8 year old son . Although he is more bookish than athletic , he was thrilled.The thrill was quickly gone when the rim broke on his second throw!I replaced it with a much better piece .
 This is poorly made . The backboard hangs at an angle , so it does not allow the door to close properly . The hoop has thirteen hooks , and the net has twelve loops , which is comepletely stupid . The ball is cheap . Stay away .
 These shirts are a great price . My husband is a 4xlt and with one wash they shrunk drastically . Mostly shrunk in length . While they were a great deal - with only wearing them one time . . they have now become too short for him . I followed the instructions for washing also ...
 This is a nice looking hoop . Appears sturdy . However , everytimeit is hit with the small basketball that it came with , the basketcollapses . It goes down into a fold position . My son is very frustated with it . At this point I think I have to hot glue it to get it tostay in place .
 Broke easily . Bought another one and that broke also . Went to a metal version , so far so good .
 these tires look cool but for mountain riding , they stink . the rubber is too soft within riding about 40 miles on rough terrain the knobs have fallen or ripped off the tires . granted i do ride them hard on mountain trails with lots of rocks and cactus but if you need it for the street , they look great .
 Pros
 This is by far the worst basketball game I have ever played . I bought it in a bundle on eBay and having not played a basketball game for some years I thought I 'd try it out for $ 4.95 free shipping.Worst game ever . I could n't even shoot . I snapped the game in half . Cut my hand open 13 stitches.POS .
 this game is absolutely disgusting . DO not buy this game unless you love wasting your hard earned money . DO NOT BUY AT ALL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 first these decoys are smaller than the original ones that were made in italy and they are hard not soft and the price is tow high for such a cheep quality the decoy has a wooden clip glued on the bottom and it is also bad quality and i received some of them broken . second the color of the decoys are not the same of the turtle dove . i was shocked of the quality and i expected something good for the price i payed 50 $ i would hardly recommend these decoys for this price .
 The Tanglefree dove decoys were a very poor imitation of the actual bird in that they were very poorly matched colorwise and the clothspin type anchoring sysytem was poor in holding the decoys in place if there was much of a wind blowing .
 Maybe this game is hit or miss , but I ca n't stand it . I 'm not a fan of the new controls , as I find it awkward to use both sticks at the same time . Also the slower frame rate , like in Madden , makes it look choppy , though not as much as it affected Madden . As some others have mentioned , it 's impossible to hit anyone in the game and I find it so annoying that you either use the classic controls , which do n't feel complete , or the new controls which are horrible.The AI in this game is much better , but honestly , it even on Rookie I find myself taking 100 shots and still in close games , where the computer scores on 1/8 shots , which is ridiculous . You really have to use all of the controls , including the dekes and I ca n't stand it . I ca n't play the game enough to get used to a new system and wanted something more arcade-like , like NHL used to be . For those who want a sim , this might be great , but otherwise it , to be frank , sucks.I am never going to buy anything in the NHL series again . This game is too much of a sim and , with fewer controls , even more annoying then those games that use every button . The only thing that would have been worse would have been using that useless Sixaxis feature .
 Overall this game would be great , but EA has had some programming problems in this particular version of the game ... Pros
 I ordered 6 chains . Was charged $ 6.69 for a package that weighed only 3 ounces . Did not even bother opening the package , since even one chain weighs more than 3 ounces , so I am guessing that I received 6 of the masterlinks . I could understand the wrong picture being posted with the item description and have seen it before . I order a considerable amount of bike parts mailorder and this is the first time that I have ever seen only the picture used and the item information and description ignored . I returned the item and received a refund of $ 7.44 . Returning the item USPS First Class was just a little less than $ 4 , so combined with the original $ 6.69 shipping , this fiasco cost me about $ 3 . I guess this was one of those situation where I should have known that it was to good to be true , but either way there are plenty of other online stores that would not pass the cost of their screwup onto the customer .
 I also had this net for only a few months before the material became shredded -LRB- with relatively light use and a normal basketball -RRB- and white dust particles fell in peoples ' eyes . The net is in a spot that gets a lot of sun -- maybe that had something to do with it . I am about to replace it and will get a different net .
 This net only lasted a few months before becoming weathered enough to tear . When making a shot there would be lots of white dust stuff falling down because the material was coming apart all around .
 Spend the money and buy GHG or Flambeau Storm Front decoys ! Paint lasted only half of duck season horrible decoys !
 This game is the pretty much the same since ' 06 . I wish these sports games would stop creating optional games like `` The Crown '' and focus more on off-season and in-season stuff . The player trading is just as dumb as '06 -LRB- the pc wo n't trade draft picks -RRB- . And why in the world wo n't NBA Live and Madden create conditional and future draft pick trading ??? The rookies are better in ' 08 , especially the second rounders that were n't even worth drafting in the previous versions . My recommendation
 this game to me is like live from last year ... it sucks ... . i played this using cfw but played only 1 quarter before i quit playing . i dont know why the other guy gave a 5 star review , because this game is horrific . . its exactly like live from last year , which i regrettable bought and played for about 10 games before i bought nba 07 from sony . that game played much better than live and i assume the same can be said about this years version . the graphics are choppy , the controls stink , and i took luol deng to the basket and instead of laying it up , he did a hook shot underneath ... pathetic game . . stay away from EA ... theyre going to go defunct as soon as they lose their madden license ... caveat emptor
 I like my hats to have a straight bill meaning its not curved/bent . This one came curved . The top of the hat also looks kind of shriveled like older hats that have been washed or wet become.I 'm thinking of returning this hat , but its such a pain in the butt .
 My one star review is based on the fact that the product description clearly states the 2 flags are included in the shipment , however i only received one . If instead I received both flags I would 've rated the product high marks as the flag is somewhat nice , okay quality , goes on and off door window easily and even comes with a thing to mount it on a wall instead .
 As the previous reviewer mentioned , it looks really really cool . . The catch is , it doesnt hold anything at all . . I need a spare tube , a Topeak tool kit which is fairly tiny , a compact pump , patch kit , a pair of tire lever . . Absolute minimum in case of a flat . I can not do without any of them . Now , i can only fit at the max three at a time . The rest should go in my carry bag . . If you are my kind of a guy , look for something else . . If you prefer looks over functionality this is the tool bag without a doubt . .
 AS SOON AS I GOT THAT , I DOUBTED MY EYE . . BECAUSE I COULD NOT SEE THE TIME . . TOO DARK . . IT WAS JUST FASHION . . I COULD NOT LOOK THE TIME . .
 Initially the bladder was okay ; however , on the 4th use , the hard plastic where the hose enters the bladder cracked , causing it to leak . I looked on Nalgene website and found no information re

 I concur with various reviewers of this tyre ... It is the most difficult tyre to mount that I have ever come across . So far I have broken 3x tyre levers and 4x inner tubes trying to fit it ! AND i still have n't managed to get it on without a leaking inner tube!I then tried to put my other tyre back on and it went on with no hassles what-so-ever . Seems to me that continental have no idea how big a wheel rim actually is.It is totally ridiculous ... Buy at your peril.once on -LRB- albeit with leaking inner tube -RRB- it is quiet and does not get hot on the trainer .
 The reviews are right on , I blew four tubes getting it on my wheel the first time , so thinking its me and my lack of patience , I went to my LBS and had them mount it , only to have it blow another tube after one training session.Now , I 'm fairly adept at changing my regular tires and tubes with no levers or other tools anywhere , anytime , so to me the problem is that the tire is too small for any rim , just a little larger would make a world of difference . But thats not going to happen so I would avoid this tire and buy yourself a cheap one for half the price . You 'll be able to ride in a few minutes , rather than days after having to go buy new tubes .
 The DVD is presented in Mandarin , but the translator and audio English translation are pathetic . Virtually all that is attempted to be interpreted and conveyed in English is confused or muddled by the very poor translation quality .
 These shirts are a great price . My husband is a 4xlt and with one wash they shrunk drastically . Mostly shrunk in length . While they were a great deal - with only wearing them one time . . they have now become too short for him . I followed the instructions for washing also ...
 I started reloading 4 months ago . My first tumbler media purchase was 10 pounds of Lyman corncob . I wondered why I had to tumble for 4-6 hours to get my cases shiny when other folks reported that it took 2 hours . I continued wondering for 4 months while I used up the Lyman media . Then I bought some corncob media packaged by another company , and knew as soon as I opened the box that something had been horribly wrong with the Lyman . The new media was very consistent in particle size , the particles were larger , and there was no dust . Sure enough , my first batch of brass was like new after two hours of tumbling with the new media , which , by the way , cost half as much as the Lyman .
 The selection and description of quantities led me to believe that I would get at least 3 times more . This is undoubtedly the smallest amount of heat shrink I , ve ever received for the amount I paid ... . Very disappointed !
 As stated by another customer , the back inside of the shoe wear out immediately , leaving your heal exposed to a sharp piece of plastic . I previously bought multiple pairs of these from a variety of teams -LRB- for the price -RRB- but in the end , every pair had the same issue . Pointless purchase . .
 Bought these shoes lasted 2 months with minimal wear , the inside plastic piece , wears through bery quickly . Making the shoe uncomfratable to wear
 The door mat is just ok -- the actual item received does not match the picture on the website at the time of the order -LRB- 12/17/11 -RRB- . I was ordering based on the image as much as the description -- the doormat pictured looks really cool , the one received is plain and boring . I could return the item , but it 's a gift and there is n't time to order something else . Normally Amazon 's images are accurate , but in this case it is not . Hopefully they update the image with the correct picture .
 This is the first thing I 've ever gotten from under armour . Everyone on my football team has good luck with their products but mine seems to be defective . After one wash the logo starts cracking and the second time worn the logo starts peeling ... wishing for a refund , bad luck I guess .
 Great fabric and tight fit . Problem is that if you are over 6ft tall , then all Under Armour products will be too short in the torso . This company does not listen to the customer .
 This is the first time I 've had anything negative to say about Under Armour , and my complain is not really about the product , but the company , as the 2 shirts I ordered was to be short sleeved , and they arrived as sleeveless , It was a birthday gift to my grandson , and he assured me it was OK . I went along with him , but when I received this letter asking if I would rate the transaction , I had to tell you.I will think twice before I order again , this was a plain and simple order , and you messed it up.If I had had time I would have returned them for the right kind , but they were delivered on the birthday so I gave the package to him as it arrived , ibg1105
 thought the product worked great ... only problem had was first time was too small ... second was that not happy with cost to ship ... way overpriced
 I purchased one of these shirts from Sport Check and paid $ 30 for it . It was comfortable and I had no problems with it until 1 day I noticed some white flakes on the front of it . When I tried to wipe them off I saw that it was the material that was flaking off in a perfect circle . The more I brushed the bigger the hole grew . Now you can see through the center of my shirt like some nylon stockings , which looks pretty girly . For a $ 30 shirt I sure expected to get a lot more wear out of it .
 I purchased an Under Armour compression tee at a local store in a size Large . The shirt fit fantastic . I wanted a back up so I purchased this one online size Large , different color . The shirt arrives on time , open the package and it is a Large but does not even fit over my shoulders ... . I contacted the vendor for an exchange . They do not do exchanges but will allow me to return the shirt . If the shirt was worn it has to be washed before returning it ... no problem for I could not get the shirt on anyway so tags etc were all in place . If you pass 30 days , there is a restocking fee of 20 % which I was unaware of.When I questioned the vendor why I have a Large and ordered the same size it did not fit . The vendor stated that Under Armour has different sizing charts for different shirts . That just did not make sense . How are you to buy a product with `` floating '' sizes.So , I went online to Nordstrum to find the same exact heat guard compression tee . There was a size chart that could be pulled up to check size before ordering ... . only 1 chart for Under Armour . I did all the measurements correctly to find that I was to order a Large.I know the shirt fits tight but since I already HAD a large that fits , and the chart from Under Armor at Nordstrum confirmed that I had ordered the correct shirt size , the statement that there are different size charts for different Under Armour shirts '' just does n't fit ! '' . I personally will visit a store and actually try it on to avoid the hassle and disappointment of waiting for a product that does not fit , seemingly was ordered correctly , and then had to be mailed back .
 I did not expect this top to be skin tight . The other Armour exercise shirt I have is a comfortable fit . It is partly my own fault because I did not realize the significance of &#34; compression &#34; fit .
 Nice shirt but runs really small . I understand they are to be worn tight , but my 14 year old could n't get it over his head . Have to return it .
 The picture and description is of a shirt , what was sent was a sleeveless tank-top , open at the arm pits . Do n't order this if you expect a shirt or plan to use it for submission grappling .
 Great shirt in most respects , but way too small . I bought the Adult Small for my 12-year-old son , who is 5 ft even , 115 lbs , and it is so skin-tight he could barely breathe in it . I 'm exchanging it for the non-compression version .
 I like my hats to have a straight bill meaning its not curved/bent . This one came curved . The top of the hat also looks kind of shriveled like older hats that have been washed or wet become.I 'm thinking of returning this hat , but its such a pain in the butt .
 I placed an order and received only one hook - I emailed the company and that 's how they sell them one per order . Does n't make much sense since you need two of them to hang a pool skimmer . The company should include two hooks rather than just one . I am unable to use the hook unless I order a second one and pay nearly twice the value just to ship it .
 It does n't work . It looks cute ; makes a whirring noise and DOES NOT KEEP ANYTHING COOL EVEN , let alone keep it cold . I have even tried taking frozen soda in with me in the morning ... by noon , it is room temperature in the mini `` fridge '' . Do n't waste your money . It is a rip off .
 Be warned . This is not a refrigerator though the packaging and the description here call it a `` portable mini-fridge '' . Indeed it is technically not refrigerator at all since it does not have a condensing unit but uses some type of capacitors to make the temperature inside the box a bit lower or higher than outside of the box . It does n't really cool things and it does n't really warm things though it is also described here as a `` Cooler Warmer '' That seems a bit more accurate since it can cool things a bit and warm things a bit though it certainly can not cool a warm can of Coke to drinking temperature nor heat up a can of soup . The best description of this thing might be `` Device that somewhat slows the warming of cool things and somewhat slows the cooling of warm things . `` You do n't need this .
 As noted by other reviewers , this is neither fridge nor warmer oven . It is a `` cooler/warmer '' which is something I doubt anyone one wants or needs . This device has a tiny fan and maybe a little compressor and heating element . It is capable of slowing the warming of already cold items or , in the warm mode , slowing the cooling of already warm items . It is not capable of cooling warm items -LRB- like a can of soda -RRB- nor capable or warming cold items . I can not think of any practical use for it nor I bet can many other people ... which is why it is being sold by a liquidator .
 I was just looking for something small to put under my desk in my office to keep my lunch cold -LRB- you know , sandwich , yogurt , standard stuff -RRB- . The unit is a great size , but really does n't get cold enough . I kept this running for 3-4 days , thinking that maybe it needed to gear up for a while and get colder , but no luck . The back wall of the unit gets pretty cool , but the inside cavity does not . I finally had to return it and was told I 'd only get a full refund if the unit was defective . They ended up charging me a 20 % or so `` restocking fee '' for the return and said they tested it and that it worked fine for what I had been trying to use it for . I respectfully disagree . If you 're looking for something to get soda about 10 degrees colder than room temperature , this is your product . If you 're looking for a small fridge for your office , keep looking .
 I bought this to keep bottles in the baby 's room -LRB- and hopefully avoid trips downstairs to the kitchen fridge in the middle of the night -RRB- . It seems to do absolutely nothing . I understand that it is only intended to cool to 20 degrees below the room temperature , but when I plug this device in , all it does is make the quiet hum that you would expect from a mini-fridge , but does n't cool anything or heat anything , or even keep cold things cool or warm things warm . This device was a complete failure .
 This is a waste of time and money ! If you want to cool a drink fine , it will not chill anything ! The coldest it will get is about 20 degrees cooler than room temp . Do not buy this item !
 I bought this mini fridge based on the reviews and the size of it but I was highly disappointed . It BARELY cools the items in the cooler and there is no temperature setting to make it colder or warmer , just a switch `` cool , off , and warm '' . Also the company will charge you a 25 % restocking fee to return the item so that means if you choose to return it you are out $ 22.50 plus the cost of shipping it back which will probably cost 22 dollars as well . So now you are out 45 bucks at least . Trust me do not buy this product .
 The selection and description of quantities led me to believe that I would get at least 3 times more . This is undoubtedly the smallest amount of heat shrink I , ve ever received for the amount I paid ... . Very disappointed !
 This was a nice bat for about 1 1/2 months . After that bat cracked . Sent for a replacement warranty bat which cracked after one month . Miken did nothing to replace or refund a second time . Do n't purchase from Miken .
 If this product worked as advertised I would be very happy , but Polar has replaced the watch three times in six months under warrantee because of defects . First the watch would not produce audible sound -LRB- chirp -RRB- in order to transfer data to my computer ; then it acted erratically displaying clearly erroneous speed data and turning off while riding -LRB- among other things -RRB- . This last watch could not be reset to work with the speed and cadence sensors so it would not accept any speed or cadence data.It it worked the CS 300 would be great , but Polar 's quality control problems make me wish I had purchased from another company .
 I have had this Polar CS300 watch for almost two years now . It does keep track of the vital information after a ride is complete . I use it every weekend all year long . So I get plenty of use out of it . At times it will loose connection with the watch for Heart Rate and Cadence . The numbers will go to Zero . Then all of sudden kick back in . I have replaced the battery in heart rate strap . Did n't make a difference.I have been only able to update to the web site once . Polar support stinks . I have contacted then more then a few times . The reason I had purchased this watch was to keep a log of my exercising with out me having to keep a spreadsheet . The weblink software just does n't work properly.The next time I purchase another cycling Heart Rate monitor I will look at other products before considering another Polar product . A lot of the cycling clubs in Miami / Fort Lauderdale area recommending the Garmin products . You get a lot more useful information while you are riding and easier to read when getting bounced around on the road .
 I would not recommend this product as it did not work out for me . Within the first month the top button broke so I could only move thru selections in one direction.When I called the company they wanted to charge me $ 44.95 just to look at it and potentially repair/replace it , they made sure to let me know I needed to mail it at my own expense and I would be charged for any repairs.The HR Monitor does ok , but it loses connectivity and all of a sudden during a workout your heart rate goes from 140 to 00 for about a minute until it creates a new link . The read out on the watch would be different than what was broadcast on cardio machines at my gym.All in all , a very poor product , I have had much better luck with Timex and Garmin . I will never buy a Polar product again .
 I believe that my not so good experience with this product have been kind of unique based on what I have heard about the CS 300 . Nonetheless , I think I should report it in this review . I had problems with my CS300 ; the computer simply restarted itself several times during my cycling and workouts . The unit was sent to Polar technical assistance in NY for test / review , so fair I am still waiting for their response . Another issue with this product is related to the data transfer through `` sound link '' , it does not work smoothly.My older Polar , which I have been using for about 3-4 years , works very well .
 I used to like the CS 300 as a general HRM . There are several problems with this unit tat you do n't find for a while . - No option for stem mount . Strap mount is hard to use if you need to take unit off the bike for other uses . - Forget about the connecting this unit to the Internet software . It uses an internal modem that you are supposed to place you computer mic next to the cs300 and it communicates with the Polar site . Good luck . This feature is worthless as it just plain does not work . Tried 3 different computers and 4 mics . Support was useless . - Stops receiving HR for no apparent reason then starts up again . It can take up to a full hour of riding before I get an accurate heart rate reading . I tried using the special electrode contact gel but still no good . - Sensor and strap roll over while swimming.I have purchased cycling computers for much less and they outperform thin piece of JUNK .
 Hi , The Polar CS300 broke after the 1st time I went into the water . It simply got mist from the inside of the dial face and stopped working a day or two later . I sent it back to Jomashop which claimed they fixed it . But when it came back the same thing happened . The watch was either unsealed or is cracked somewhere that can not be detected.Polar USA claims that Jomashop is not a certified reseller and therefore I DO NOT recommend buying Polar products from them although they are sometimes much cheaper.Currently I can not use the watch and after trying unsuccessfully to reach Jomashop and get their feedback to why the watch broke the 2nd time , I decided to give up and donate the watch to my kids collection.I had very good experience with other Polar watches that served me for many years but this experience made me consider other brands .
 I received my fourth , yes my forth replacement watch from Polar yesterday , and I 'll be sending it back tomorrow . The first one , the one I bought , worked fine except that the sonic link tones it produced were so low it could take 45 min . before you would get a successful upload to the website . When I called Polar I was told that they had had a problem with a batch of watches and that they would fix it . I sent it in , got a new one sent to me which did the exact same thing . I called them again , explained the problem again and was told they had sent me one of the bad watches by mistake . The third one was fine , for about two weeks . While on a ride the speed stopped displaying . Then it would start again but the cadence would quite . Then the heart rate would go nuts , the speed would quit , the cadence would go nut , the speed would go nuts also , and on and on . I called back , they sent me another one , my fourth , which I received yesterday . I went for a ride this morning , got back , went to upload my data and nothing . Not one chirp from the sonic link . I have had it with this thing . Time to get my money back and find a monitor that is NOT made in China .
 This must be one of Polar 's worst products . No way to delete files , one just has to wait for them to go away by themselves . The weblink sucks . If you 're lucky you can get it to download data maybe one out of every ten times . Polar support non-existent .
 I 've had this unit for a couple of years , and haven been really disappointed with it . The heart rate monitor is really erratic . Even though I live in a rural area -LRB- Santa Fe , NM -RRB- , stray signals -LRB- from who knows what in this sparcely populated area -RRB- through the heart rate monitor off . The batteries in the cadence sensor and the heart rate sensor have to be replaced about once a year . Even worse , when the battery in the speed sensor is drained , you have to buy a whole new sensor . My speed sensor battery died in about two years . The cheapest price I 've found for a new speed sensor is about $ 35.00 , before shipping . I 've decided to spend that $ 35.00 on another heart rate monitor . It will not be a Polar .
 I bought this unit about a year ago and have never been able to get any of the functions to read correctly . The cadence will register for a while but the heart reat will not . The speed will work for a while but the cadence wo n't . It just stops and starts randomly and Never measures all three correctly at the same time . I thought at first it was power lines creating interference , but the speed does n't register correctly while I 'm on trails in the mountains either . Do n't waste your money !
 Well , do you remember Windows 3.1 ? You was working at computer and they just rebooted ... some think like that occur w / this Polar ... You are in a hardly running or cycling and the Polar - some times - reset , making you loose the current data ... Bad , but is not only it ... The Weblink/Soniclink just not work . If you have plan to transfer the data from Polar to PC just choose another type of communication . I had succes only two times and have tried a lot of ... The byke mount is a piece of junk two ... The older Polar model is much beter.The odometer also does not works w / precision , some times they continue increasing value , but the byke is stoped ... The cataye ciclocomputer have more accuracy and precision.Well ... The heart rate works , some times fine .
 I have a Tippmann X7 paintball gun and it does not fit . The bottom fits loosely on my gun and the top does not fit into the standard hopper that the gun came with . Return item promptly . Still looking for the right product .
 Okay basically when I looked at this item it was described as an offset rail mountfor a sight , not an offset hopper mount . So when I purchased it i got exactly what it is described now . So it was a whole waste of time . Thankfully DoroSports were awesome and helped me out to get the right items i needed but ofcourse it was a little more expensive . So thanks for nothing Amazon . I guess it 's their only mistake through the whole time I have shopped from them , but still . Anyway the offset hopper mounts are huge just so you know .
 This product worked well for 14 months -- it was covered by a 12 month warranty . At that time the lock release for the keypad quit working . The company offered to replace the unit for $ 80 . For the price of this unit I expected it to last much longer . The original batteries have lasted longer than the safe .
 it is a very cool looking gun but i shot it the first time in my house and it curved up , then the second time it curved down , the third time it went right , and the fourth time it went left . u cant controll wer the bb goes . DO NOT BUY !!!!!!!!!!!!!
 In my opinion the Howard Leight R-03318 Leightning L3 Shooter 's Premium Earmuff is way better quality than these muffs . The Howard Leight ones have padding on the head band and are much better to wear than this Peltor . Only leg up that these have over the Howard Leight is that they fold up and take up less space in my tactical bag . If I had to make this purchase over again , I would have bought the Howard Leight ones .
 I bought this item from Amazon.com . Item arrived in a well packaged box . I paid around $ 40 for this . The worst thing about this item was the shipping charges and custom duties -LRB- accounting for > $ 10 -RRB- . I use this item during household activities such as vaccuming and during work related air travel -LRB- on small jet stream air crafts -RRB- . Pros : Comfortable on my ears.Soft materialCons : Does n't seem to cut out noises effectivelyVery fragile - after 5 careful uses , it seems that the outer layer of the ear muff may break soon.Amazon.com is very bad at not shipping items in Canada!Costly shipping and Customs FeesSummary
 Right side was blocked sound pretty well but left side made a whistling side . Very annoying . Had to return it .
 Gerber must have changed the manufacturing outsource for this knife before I got one , because it 's junk . Absolute junk . The machining quality is poor , the mechanism is absurdly stiff -LRB- opening it one-handed is basically impossible -RRB- , and it was n't even particularly sharp when I got it . The open edge of a tin can would be sharper.There is no country of origin mark on this knife , but I have been informed that Gerber is now outsourcing the manufacture of some of its smaller knives to China . I suspect this is the motive behind this knife 's significant price reduction in recent months.It 's really too bad . I have some older Gerber knives that are of exceptional quality , and they have always been razor sharp until now . Gerber , what happened to you ?
 I bought this mug on appearance alone and thought it was going to be a good purchase based on the 2 previous reviews I read . First of all , the cover doesnt screw on correctly . . everytime you screw it on the mouth piece that you would drink from is at a different angle . . also once the cover is screwed on there is no ventilation so there is absolutely no flow of liquid when youre trying to drink it . This mug will now be a decoration in a cabinet full of less attractive looking mugs that ACTUALLY DELIVER DRINKS INTO YOUR MOUTH !
 This thermos is made with cheap looking plastic . It is roughly made . The glass inside has blemishes in addition to the traditional small circles . It does n't look great . Given its numerous defects , it is too expensive . And worst of all , it does n't even keep beverages really hot for 6 hours.And why has it not been made in America in accordance with its touted reputation . This one is even made in China of all things . Here in Europe , most of our thermos pitchers of quality are still made here ; and their equivalents have a more sophisticated look , and better , smoother craftsmanship.John EichrodtRetired English TeacherMulhouse , France
 I was disappointed to find this model watch has a soft plastic crystal that scratched the first day I wore it to work . I work around stainless steel and sharp tools . I did return the watch because the description stated the crystal was mineral . Amazon promptly refunded my money . Nice watch , I stand by CASIO watches . I have had many . This watch just was n't rough enough for my abuse .
 Window sticks out the case . Therefore it is easy to scratch the window . My friend bought different color but the problem is the same . Other than that , I did not have any problem with the watch so far .
 I like the watch but the one I was ordering had a different band and the one I received is ok . I like the watch it does what I wanted it to do I was just disappointed that it did n't match the picture .
 Why is it so difficult to find a decent-looking yet functionally sound digital watch ? This watch is nice looking and has a lot of the enhanced functions a digital watch should have -LRB- countdown timer , alarm , etc -RRB- . But there are several key problems :1 -RRB- The thermometer is absolutely useless . After spending valuable time trying to adjust it , it still does not give you the real temperature . That 's time I 'll never get back .2 -RRB- The face has become scratched in several places . How in the world a watch company can get away with having a raised face and a soft crystal is beyond me . It 's not like glass is expensive . This is the most significant problem .3 -RRB- The alarm is not loud enough . Certainly not loud enough to wake you up , and very easy to not hear if there is background noise .4 -RRB- The watch hands are not easy to read and they at times block the date and digital time , which is highly annoying . I have to say I do n't understand why so many digital watches are analog/digital combo - what 's the point ? You have to set each individually BTW.I 'm very disappointed .
 Do n't bother with this watch , you will be annoyed at it because :1 . The analog hands ALWAYS cover something on the digital display2.The analog hands are superfluous-bad design3.The thermometer shows a temperature of 84.2 , my body temperature is 98.6 whereas the room temperature is 71 , what temperature is 84.2 which the watch displays and what is the use of it ? 4 . The watch does not display the year and month5.No indication anywhere of the expected battery lifetime under average conditions6.No indication anywhere as to what type of battery is used by the watch
 I ordered this for my father 's Christmas present . It came promptly , but the box was damaged , so much so that there were holes on two sides and the box was bent . Upon inspection the product itself was damaged as well . I called customer support and , though they were friendly and there was no hassle when talking to them , the only thing they could offer me was a reimbursement and return shipping . There was no system available for sending me a replacement - I would just have to purchase ANOTHER value pack.I wo n't be getting reimbursed for the product until they get it back , and because of my financial situation I ca n't afford to buy a second value pack - I will have to wait for the reimbursement until I can `` buy '' the product again . Considering the condition it was in the first time , I wo n't be waiting around counting the days until Christmas for my money back just to worry whether or not the second will come on time and in one piece . I 'll be getting my father something else .
 What I did n't know when I ordered these was that all dropouts have different dimensions and these do n't fit my bike , so double check before ordering .
 These things suck . The bend very easily and are super sloppy . I would n't put them on anything except a kids bike . I will never buy them again .
 After a couple of years , this watch showed definite wear - not on the case or crystal so much , rather the buttons got corroded and would n't work consistently . I had n't exposed it to water . The watch is quite attractive , thin and weighs next to nothing . The band breaks easily but is replaced by generic bands easily and cheaply . I 've retired it though in favor of other Casio watches . For the short term , it 's cheap and expendable/replaceable .
 This watch has all the bells and whistles that I wanted , but loses about 20 minutes a day . I complained to Amazon and asked for return authorization . No reply was received . The watch gets a 1 and Amazon gets a zero .
 Hat said size 8 but , it had to be at least a 9-10 . This hat swam on my head , maybe the manufacturing country of origin was the problem . Definitely not a size 8 .
 I was looking for a dance type of workout video , like Zumba . This had decent reviews so I went for it , bad choice . Not only is this a terrible workout video , it is an awful dance video . Do not , I repeat do not waste your money . If you are looking for a workout and dancing Zumba is the way to go . Two thumbs down for this one .
 I expected this to be a more athletic , high paced type of dance exercise . It is not . If you are looking for a fast moving , make you sweat dance video , look elsewhere . I was disapointed .
 It 's a nice looking watch at a decent price , but after one week the dial fell off . They have an 11 year warrenty , but now I have to go through the trouble of sending the watch to get fixed and who knows who gets to pay for shipping . I 've had Fossil before and I expected better quality .
 I bought this watch before I started college in the fall of 2008 . I bought it in early August , and by January , I had to send it back to Fossil because the minute hand was loose inside the face of the watch . It took them two months to get it back to me . In April , it just stopped working . I thought it was the battery , so I had it tested . It was n't . It was a problem with the watch . So in less than a year the watch had two problems and apparently died on me . I sent it back to Fossil for the second time last week and I 'm currently waiting on them to return it . I asked for a new watch and I hope to get one . I liked the way the watch looked and fit , but it just did not consistently work .
 I would be mad if I were in Iraq and someone issues me these goggles . If you look down for more than a few seconds , they fog up . Very disappointing .
 Wiley promised glases that would be good in a combat situation where a soldier could jump out of a plane and be involved in a firefight . So I thought they would atleast work well as carpenter safety glases . Well I do n't know if soldiers can see throught fog but these glasses continualy fog up . Whats worse is that there web site brags about an anti bolistic anti fog coating . The ten dollar pair of safety glasses I bought at lowes behave better than these and never fog up . The only good thing is the gogle like strap that you can attach . For a carpenter in high places this is a plus
 We received the hat in great time , however there was nothing on the back of the hat like the picture had shown . Nephew loved the hat , but I am sure it would have been better received if it had the fish with lightening bolt on the back of the hat .
 I hear so much about Tracy Anderson and I own a lot of fitness DVDs , but I was disappointed . I think she has a great body and G. paltrow speaks so highly of her , maybe my expectations were too high.She does n't give the right amount of instruction-you constantly have to watch the screen to know what she is doing as she moves to the next move or changes it without any verbal clues . She has very odd facial expressions and bashes people with muscular bodies , saying things like women do n't look good with six-pack abs . Hmm , good to know what you think , but not helpful in my life ! I do 3-4 DVDs per week , I rarely pull this one out more than once a month . I only do because it was so expensive and I figure I must be missing something ! I wish I had gotten a ballet conditiion tape instead-her moves seem to be based of that , but it is not an effective DVD .
 This DVD is not a mat workout . It 's Tracy doing Physique 57 chair moves in part , but the rest is her movements/dancing . There is also only a small part that is a mat workout . The standing movements are not very challenging . If you like to dance - this may be for you . If you want a decent workout , I would recommend another DVD .
 I was extremely disappointed with this DVD . As other reviewers have mentioned , Tracy gives very few verbal ques and simply moves from one sequence to another . The moves themselves are basic , dance-based moves and very repetitive . Her demeanor is also very strange
 I am an avid exerciser and am always up for a challenge however I was very disappointed with this DVD . Tracy Anderson looks like she is too concerned about how she looks while doing the moves which is annoying and she never ever gives full instructions ! I do n't recommend this video at all I would say go with Jillian Michael 's now she is a real trainer ! -LRB- Sorry Tracy for the harsh criticism but do n't quit your day job whatever that may be . -RRB-
 Maybe the third time would have been the charm , but after my second Tracy Anderson Method dvd would n't play I gave up and asked for a refund . I ca n't rate the exercise program , because neither one of the dvd 's they sent would play correctly . I will say that the seller was always extremely prompt in responding , quickly got my replacement out and then immediately refunded my money .
 I ordered this DVD and recieved a scratched one that did not work , but the company quickly responded and refunded my money . Good customer service , but unfortunately the product was not satisfactory .
 I bought this to use with my IPhone & Mp3 player . The problem is there is no volume adjustment & you can barely hear it . You have to use the volume on your mp3 or iPhone but the sound is louder if I just use my iPhone . Waste of money !!! Needs to have volume switch so you can make it louder !!! Volume was up all the way on both mp3 & iPhone . Still had to put my ear up to speaker to hear . Booooooo !
 The cooler looks good but not worth the money . The sound system is very - very poor ; I do not recomendI am happy to sell the one that I purchased for $ 20 .
 I own two of these and they will soon see the garbage . These do not clip evenly across a bag of chips . I closed a family sized bag of chips and picked it up by the clip . Luckily I was fast enough to catch the falling bag of chips . I did not pick it up by the part that opens and closes it . I tried a clip half of it 's size that I have been using for awhile . I picked up the same bag of chips by that smaller clip and it stayed clipped to the chip bag . I even carried it around to my computer room and back and it stayed attached protecting my chips . Stale chips taste lousy . Avoid this clip as it need some quality built into it . 1 Star max .
 It never got delivered to where it was supposed to go , so I do n't know .
 I would give this 3 stars if the price were around $ -LSB- ... -RSB- , because that 's about what these were worth . Very time-consuming to fill up all the little dumbell chambers ; the dumbells themselves were a little awkward to use since the weight is distributed differently from regular dumbells and these are also bulkier.It 's a great idea , and could be helpful if you 're travelling to one place and staying there for a while , but it 's too much trouble to empty and refill them if you 're moving from place to place . Just do keep in mind that they 're not going to match your regular workout .
 I recently purchased a set of Aquabells for weight training while we travel . We are often either flying or traveling in an RV . In either case , weight and size are big considerations.Unfortunately , since I am not in shape to start with the full weight of completely filled units , I tried to add only a couple of pounds to each side to begin with . No matter how I adjusted the plugs , they would pop open after a few minutes and pour water all over the floor.I called the company and they had no suggestions or help . I eventually had to pay the postage to return the ` Bells ' , since I had purchased them through Amazon .
 It is a great idea to pack to take with you but these weights are way to big for a small girl like me . I would only suggest them to certain people .
 took this thing camping for the first time using this chair . One of the four foot posts that hold it up cracked and broke rendering the chair uselss . We had 4 other similar chairs that have been used many times before and since . Horrible quality.I was very excited to use this chair as the design is great . Too bad its a POS >
 I did n't care for any of the meals that came in this sampler . They were very bland compared to other brands I 've tried . They are lower in sodium than most freeze dried rations and that 's a plus , however , I think it 's probably why they are so bland .
 I have nothing against the Ripkens . Cal was a decent hitter . However , if you are trying to learn the correct way to swing a baseball bat and generate top bat speed , go to batspeed dot com . Jack Mankin is the master of hitting . Check it out before you purchase this and ruin your kid 's swing .
 Thought I was getting a deal on the hat but i would have been better not buying from e4hats . I could not really tell what the hat really looked like since it was a stock photo . when I received the hat it looked cheap , and is thin/flimsy . The bottom rim of the hat was ok i though it would be thicker , but the top was a total disappointment . the top is very thin , not the same material as the rim , the hat is suppose to be water repellent not sure that is possible with this hat the moisture will come in at the top . Also the hat did not fit , I ordered a large still did not fit . It fits like a grandma 's hat.When i contacted to get a refund they wanted me to pay to ship it back . when I explained that it makes no sense because i would spend almost as much on shipping it both ways then what the actual item cost , they did n't care . $ 14.99 for the hat + $ 6.59 for shipping = $ 21.58 + $ 6.59 for return shipping = $ 28.17 $ 28.17 - $ 14.99 = $ 13.18 . They wanted me to spend an additional $ 6.59 in return shipping to get back $ 1.18 on the entire transaction , plus the effort and stress . No thanks , fool me once shame on you , full me twice same on me . Does no good on returning the item because it will cost me more in the long run instead of just throwing the hat in the garbage can.I wo n't being buying from them anymore .
 When I received this shirt I tryed it on and it fit great . I washed it and 2 weeks later pulled it out to iron and noticed it had a hole in it . The hole was by the last button . Needless to say I was very disappointed .
 This is a replacement . Hit a bump -LRB- not bad enough to damage my wheel -RRB- but makes the speed sensor erratic . Product should be more robust . Also , can not mount the receiver on the handlebars - has to be worn on my left wrist as otherwise reception from the speed sensor is very poor .
 It 's like the printer cartridge replacement program where companies make more $ $ $ on replacement cartridges than the product i.e. Polar CS100 bicycle computer speedometer . I refuse to pay $ 40.00 every year or so and into the garbage can it goes ... It 's close to robbery .
 I loved this product until the battery failed . It is insane that you can not replace the battery yourself .
 I ordered two of these watches , one for myself and one for a friend . This watch is big enough for my 6 year old son . Very disapointed with the product . I am currently deployed in IRAQ and cant do anything about this situation right now but intend on getting my money back for this product . Will try to order another two watches from another company .
 But it is only the rear tire . There 's little indication until you add it to cart . beware!It would be great if you removed the photo of TWO tires and changed the headline to read `` TIRE '' and not `` TIRES '' . It looks like a great tire and I know this is a reputable seller , but this listing should be revised ! I have not installed it on my bike yet because now I have to order a front tire to match .
 I got it fast , put in my 3 yrs old grandaughter , played in the pool for about two hours , went to lunch , took a nap , at three pm , tried to zip the zipper with no luck , -LRB- the begining of it , at the bottom , would not slide one into the other -RRB- had to returned to Amazon . Got one star due to the fast RMS service at Amazon .
 Child tips forward -LRB- face first -RRB- in the water . Tried it with lots of kids who 've come around - all 2-3 yes old . Might be better for older kids . We use the puddle jumper instead , love it .
 My son is 2 , 25 lbs , wore a small that was too tight . We took out 2 of the floating devices , btw they are just foam bars . They are meant to be removed as your child grows so we were using it properly . He jumped off the first step and sunk . We did n't wait to see if he would float back up . One mishap was enough to return it . Amazon was great about the return . Fast , easy and efficient .
 I was initially pleased with the jacket but after using it for a week on holiday the stitching on the zip started coming away from the jacket so we could n't use it for the rest of the holiday
 My daughter is 3 years old , her Chest size
 If you do n't mind your child serving as a walking billboard for the manufacturer , it 's a decent jacket . I 'm upset by Konfidence 's choice to print a slogan that consumes much of the back of the jacket , and surprised that an image of the rear was not included on Amazon 's product page , given the impact the slogan has on the overall look of the jacket . Please take a look before buying this product .
 First , the Jacket works great - we used it with our son in Hawaii and it was a hit . HOWEVER , what none of the marketing materials show , here or on the website , is that the back of the jacket has in huge letters
 Ok , so I had the pleasure of using the Speedo Begin to Swim Vest , and this highly touted Konfidence Jacket.Konfidence Jacket 's bouyancy is slightly below average . If you 're teaching your child to swim , expect for them to drink lots of water.Konfidence says that this was designed to fit , thus not needing the strap that keeps it from moving up or down . After receiving this , I realized that it was just designed without it . Its physics , you cant beat physics . If this fits tight , it will move around less . . same goes for all other jackets . But if it doesent fit tightly , or perfectly , this thing will act like any other jacket without the strap . People buy this because it does not have the strap , but keep in mind , neither does it have anything special in place of it . There is nothing on this jacket to customize a fit , and that to me is a flaw . -LRB- My daughter is 25 months old , and is within range of the size chart so she should fit quite perfectly -RRB- . The materials ... touted to be more superior , is the exact same as other non-plastic life jackets . The only plus here is that you can remove the floataion inserts one at a time as your child progresses . . thats a plus , but realistically , you wont be removing these each week or so unles your child is already a decent swimmer/floater so chances are , you wont be removing this -LRB- especially when all 8 can barely keep the childs mouth above water -RRB- constantly . Its better to get the Speedo at 16 dollars a pop.Oh , and the logo behind their jacket is HUGE . They should take a huge chunk of change off their price since youre doing plenty of marketing for them . The price is unjustifiable . Material quality is same , flotation worse than its competitors , and the fit is not adjustable -LRB- and their reasoning for it is flawed -RRB- . Seriously , do yourself a favor , get the 16 dollar speedo . It even looks better and fits better because of the straps that keeps the vest where it should be .
 They came in on time and undamaged . So I had to check these out to see how they taste so I started with the breakfast banditos . Ok , opened it up and they were mostly powered . Followed the directions and waited the 12 minutes . The mix looked liked the cosistentacy of wall paper paste . So I cooked them up like scrambled eggs and still stayed about the same . So far not looking so good . It tasted like Elmer 's kid ` glue with a horrible after taste I can not describe . . I could not eat more than a few spoonfuls because I could not get over the after taste killed my taste buds and stomach . The potatoes never fully rehydronated themselves . I will save these for the last of my ratios if I ever come across the need to be that hungry , I think I rather eat insects first . Terrible taste not worth buying or giving away either . Total waste of money . I had eat a full meal with glass of milk to get rid of the bad taste .
 The first watch was missing part of the numbers on the dial.It was impossible to read or to set the functions . The second watch worked right but did n't have some of the features that I wanted in a ski watch . I returned the second watch and got another brand .
 The selection and description of quantities led me to believe that I would get at least 3 times more . This is undoubtedly the smallest amount of heat shrink I , ve ever received for the amount I paid ... . Very disappointed !
 Had 170 thousand miles on my Sienna . After reading all the great reviews about this product and decided to try it . follow all directions , put in intake , fuel tank and engine . Car started to leaking oil after 1 week putting sea foam in engine . after 2 weeks , leak gets worst , so changed oil and put Lucas stop leak in . No luck , still leaks as of today . Sea foam kills seals people , do n't put it in your old car engine .
 Google the MSDS on this , it 's naptha and alcohol . I 've been an automotive technician for 15 + years , have never and will never recommend this stuff .
 I used 1/3 on crankcase and 16 oz on gas tank . Changed engine oil and filter after 200 miles . Btw my minivan used to average 320 miles full tank . 1st fillup 260 miles , averaging 19 mpg . 2nd fill up with new engine oil and filter 238 miles , averaging 17 mpg .10 % city and 90 % freeway driving.Google search sea foam decreasing mpg .2003 toyota sienna88k miles
 First off , I never heard of Seafoam before . Someone had suggested it on the Gold Box Forum when I started a thread about an issue on my car . Because lately , my car needs to be revved -LRB- two minutes minimum -RRB- in order for my RPM to reach at least 1,000 if not , my car would sputter and die down . So after spending time watching youtube on how to apply this product . I gave it a shot , little did I know not only did it not solve my problem , it also , turned on my check engine light.I would have given it one star but I 'm sure it cleaned the carbon out of my motor even a little . So now I have to resort to cleaning my Idle Control Valve and hope that will solve my problem . For the record though , this is the first and the last time I 'll be using this product .
 2000 Ranger good condition at 130,000 easy miles well maintained . Had slight stutter past year like a bad accelerator pump but this is injected of course . My brother put Seafoam in has high milage missing Nissan with good results so I figured it could n't hurt anything in my Ford . WRONG . I went about 10 miles and it started missing . I thought I just need to get out on the highway and I put 130 high speed miles on it . Went to a dead miss . Took the thing to a reputable shop . I figured a bad injector or maybe plugs/wires . weather too hot for me to mess with . Shop called said bad plugs and this 4 banger has 8 plugs . Okay fix it I say . Next they say they ran a compression test and # 3 reads only 75lbs , needs a valve job . Okay fix it I say . After taking head off and doing valve job they say it was n't the problem , must be the rings . They quoted me a $ 2500 . price to fix it and I say stop right there and pulled it home . The cylinder wall is slick as new and cant see any reason for the mis-fire . The injectors look clean and the shop completely rejected them as the problem . Do n't know what that Seafoam did but the only other time I 've used an additive was over 50 years ago and it ruined the engine in my 1938 Buick . De ja vu all over again ? Now I do n't trust Seafoam or that shop .
 Product didnt remove water from the fuel as discribed all it did was settel it out and create foam in the fuel . Shipping was slow I wouldnt use this again
 My Jeep had almost 120K on it and I was beginning sense that the engine needed a ` clean out ' as it was running a bit rough . Someone suggested Sea Foam . I tried a can and used it as directed . The user reviews cautioned about the smoke that is generated when it is added . I saw a little bit of smoke at first , then I took it for a test drive . Within about 3 miles of driving , the check engine light came on . I immediately turned around and drove back home without incident . I hooked up my scan tool and it said that the ` oxygen sensor was dirty or defective ' . It cost $ 75.00 for a new sensor and the car runs no better after using the Sea Foam . So for me , it was an expensive experiment .
 These shirts are a great price . My husband is a 4xlt and with one wash they shrunk drastically . Mostly shrunk in length . While they were a great deal - with only wearing them one time . . they have now become too short for him . I followed the instructions for washing also ...
 As a traction device , this thing is worse than worthless . It 's uncomfortable , difficult to use , and at least for me , had zero effect . I did n't have high hopes when I bought it , but I did n't think that I would only have a half-inch of velcro trying to hold the thing together on my head . I did n't think that moving the slightest amount would cause something on it to come unhooked almost every time . I did n't think that it would require such a ridiculous balancing act of trying to keep enough tension on the sling so it does n't pop off the crossbar while trying to lower the weight . I did n't think the rope would be so slick as to have to double-knot it to keep it from slipping.The only reason I can give it any stars at all is because at least the pullies and door-hanger are mildly useful for other purposes .
 I have used several Traction Devices over the past ten years , but thisMickey Mouse Kit is n't anywhere near `` as advertised '' . I feel very ripped off .
 I wish I could say more . It was just a waste of money for us and did not work at all .
 Product came on time . We have Cervical problem . We wanted to try some instrument for neck exercise . This product is not engineered good enough to do the job . Two clips on the hanger does not stay in proper position . Strip that holds front and back flap is too short . If you stick the flap firmly then it chocks the wind pipe -LRB- My wife had terrible experience -RRB- and if you leave loose it slips through your head . too risky . I called the customer service within 2 weeks or so about the problem . He said I can return the product but i will be charged 10 % restocking fee and all the shipping and handling . Beside all this product that I received is not safe and I think I have to complain to food and drug administration about this product .
 Kayak skirts should include an approximate size of the cockpit it fits . Skirts are interchangeable between kayaks but you can only buy it if you know it will fit your kayak . If you do n't include the size you are perhaps losing 95 % of your possible sales . Most skirts have a dimension like 19 '' by 38 '' but a diameter measurement could be useful as well . Measure the diameter of the inside lip where the elastic of the skirt fits into .
 I purchased the P90X workouts the Summer of 2008 , and I loved the original workouts . They are a must for someone working out at home , who has gotten a little bored with their traditional workout . At the same time , I bought the Plus series too . They just do n't pack the punch of the P90X workouts from the standpoint of routines , challenge , and production value . They simply are n't as challenging and intense as the originals.IntervalX and Abs/Core introduces variations of traditional ab and cardio work . Some of the new variations are fun , but they are n't that different than other routines in P90X . With me being almost done with my second round of P90X , I use these workouts about once every two weeks on average . I 've been critical so far , but I do like the Interval X workout for its quick cardio . You can get a good burn doing the short 30 minute workout . Tony takes you thru 12 different routines of slow , medium , and then fast . It gets the heart pumping and you get a good sweat from it.Total Body Plus is a 40 minute workout with 10 minutes of warm up and cool down , plus around 30 minutes of actual workout . Tony takes you heat to toe working out shoulders , chest , back , arms , and legs . Its not overly challenging , but you can get a good workout in the 25 minutes of actually working out . You do a variations of routines with and without weights . From push ups to pull ups to some lifting , this workout will work your entire body . You wo n't be spent after the workout , so you could do some cardio or abs along with this routine . It too easy for me , and I 'm looking for something a bit harder . That being said , my teenage daughter and wife loves this workout . They do it twice a week , so its almost ideal for a total body workout at low to medium intensity . I 'm not saying this workout is for women only , but its not challenging enough for me personally.Kenpo Cardio is another short cardio burn that IS more intense than the first Kenpo P90X workout . I actually use this over the original , because while shorter I feel it gives me a better burn . The original Kenpo was more of a slow steady burn for 40 minutes , while this is more of an up tempo 32 minute burn . It has most of the same moves but at a quicker and more intense pace . As stated earlier , I use this one exclusively over the 1st Kenpo.Upper Plus is a good solid workout that is n't much different . It variations of all your normal back , chest , and arm workouts . It maybe be the most intense of the Plus series , but its nothing you have to have or did n't do with P90X.I do n't want to be overly critical of the Plus series , but Beach Body made these to capitalize on the original . I do n't blame them , but I am disappointed and wished I had n't bought them . They simply fall short in production value , intensity , and the results you get from them . These are shorter workouts meant to go along with the P90X workouts and not to replace them . You simply wo n't get the results as the original routines , but I do n't think they are meant to . They only compliment the others , and so I could live without them . At 40 I 'm looking for intense and challenging workouts to maintain what I got , and these do n't do it for me . These are ideal for men and women who want a moderate workout in less than 35 minutes . If you have n't bought the P90X workouts , then I highly encourage you to do so . You wo n't be disappointed and the 12 routines will keep things really fresh . If you do have the originals , you really do n't need these at all . They are nice complimentary workouts , and only ideal for someone looking for a moderate workout . I 'm not a fitness trainer , so my opinion may not be worth spit . But for all of you guys , that are looking for a challenging to hard workout ... do n't buy these dvds . They are good but not worth the hundred Plus bucks you 'll pay for them .
 I 've finished the P90X program and decided to try ` the next stage ' in Tony 's program . They really messed up with this one ; it is nowhere near as good as the original P90X program . You will burn calories , but it seems like it is more of a cardio workout than anything . Other problems :1 . -RRB- It is too rushed ! For some reason they decided to make each dvd shorter ... about 40-45 minutes now instead of the 60 + in the original dvd 's . To do this they had to ` hurry ' things along . My pull up bar is in my hallway and I have to walk about 20 paces to get to it ... usually by the time I get there 10 seconds of the routine is gone . You barely have enough time to ` write it down ' as Tony likes to say . By the time you write your info down on your sheet , get to your dumbbells -LRB- or selectechs in my case-dial in the proper weight -RRB- the routine has already started . This is very annoying .2 . -RRB- Sound quality is just terrible . It sounds like Tony is speaking in a box and his voice overwhelms the music -LRB- which you can barely hear -RRB- .3 . -RRB- Tony basically does little to nothing in the form of a workout ... it was inspiring to see him do the routines in the original . He does more flirting with the girl than anything else ... 4 . -RRB- The abs routine is nothing special ... not nearly as good as the original .5 . -RRB- Kenpo is the weakest dvd ... I realize that this is basically another ` rest day ' .6 . -RRB- I think they sat around and tried to come up with exercises that were new ... and they did ... but they are unnecessarily complicated and rushed.I 'll continue to use them , but I 'm basically going back to the old P90X routine and I 'll throw one of these in my routine now and then to vary things up . P90X was/is very successful for a reason ... it works ... they tried to capitalize on the success of that program by rushing this out . I think most of us who have completed the program wanted something more/different to continue on ... changing the original format was a huge mistake .
 I am a `` graduate '' of P90X and loved the workout and got excellent results -LRB- See my p90X review -RRB- . I was really looking froward to taking my workout to the next level with P90X + . I am very dissapointed . There is much less energy . Their are only 2 exercisers and it the same 2 exercisers on all the DVDs . They do not bring the same energy levels that the exercisers on P90X have . On P90X there are 4 exercisers on each DVD who change on each DVD . This is just one of the little things that helped keep me motivated.Specific comments on P90X + -1 -RRB- Instruction `` manual ''
 First of all P90x changed my life . I have never reviewed a product , but would like to express that I 'm disappointed in P90x Plux . Here are my reasons :1 . TERRIBLE MUSIC !! My wife does ChaLean , she gets results and the music is great and really pumps you up . P90X music is TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE . Buy it and you 'll see .2 . FAST NO FORM !! There is a guy in the workout named Mark Briggs . Do n't watch him if you purchase this . He goes extremely fast and loses form and balance many times . Tony even scolds him sometimes .3 . PROMO BOWFLEX !! Every 5 minutes you will hear a Plug
 I purchased P90X and it did wonders for my body . I got more results in those first 90 days than i have in the past 5 years !! I lost 20 lbs and nearly 5 inches off the waist . Well when saw that there was a P90X Plus for grads , i was thinking thinking it would take it to a whole new level !! Wrong !! The workouts are shorter and less intense . I decided I would stick it out and finish the next 90 days using Plus . Well after week 4 i saw no results . I still have plenty of fat to burn ! I decided i would work harder , but after week 6 when i measured myself for the sh *** and gigs , not only did i gain an inch back on my waist but i added 5 lbs ! . I regressed using this workout . I decided to go back to the original p90X and start over on week 1 . I damn near puked after chest and back . Didnt even have the energy to do abs . I really regret using Plus because i saw no results other than negative and i feel like i wasted my time . But , now I have a new attitude and am more motivated to get back on track and finish another 90 days of the regular p90X . The only positve thing i can say about plus is that its interval X could substitute plyometrics or cardio X. Hope this helps
 This was a major let down after doing the original P90x version . The workouts are not challenging at all compared to the original workouts , and the format is not as good either . Instruction is not as good , and timing between exercises is to close . I plan on using them to add into my original P90X workout routine as add ons .
 I was not happy . The set was not complete . It was missing the yoga DVD . I tried contacting the provider -- they will not respond .
 I returned this product promptly after I got it and have yet to recieve my refund .
 I have purchased items on-line only once . This particular video I bought is broken . One of the 4 cd 's does n't even work . I spent $ 60 for videos that look like they have been copied and resealed . What 's up with that ? Can I return these ?
 HATED IT.The P90X series of workouts was great and extremely effective . The P90X Plus workouts are n't workouts at all . They 're infomercials for Bowflex , Power Stands , and Pull up bars . The exercises are extremely contrived and often just plain painful . Do n't waste your money here .
 I 'm kicking myself right now because I was actually aware of the `` bad '' reviews on Plus and decided to purchase it anyway . Plus is a huge disappointment compared to their classic series . Just as most of the other reviewers stated , Beachbody 's motive for Plus was to clearly profit off the success of their predecessor . I enjoyed P90X because of the little equipment needed -LRB- pull up bar and bands -RRB- . With Plus it 's as if they want you to by the Bowflex Selectech dumbbells . There are moves that you simply ca n't do without dumbells . At least with P90X you could choose to use the bands . I wonder how much money Bowflex paid Beachbody to advertise their product .
 Tony Horton came to Misawa AFB and explained that this product is a rip off of the real thing . It 's not endorsed or approved by Tony . DO NOT BUY THIS . This is a secondry company ripping him off .
 There is an instruction booklet with the DVDs which gives the individual instructions on how to do the P90X program . It seems impossible to follow the program is all the DVDs are not present . It will not be possible to get the optimum workout as prescribed by the creator of the program . I do not think that workout programs should be broken up into pieces/sets when this is not what is the intention of the creator of the program .
 DO NOT BUY ! End of story ! This is a waste of $ 75.00 . I thought that it would be tougher than P90x but it is n't . I did P90x twice and was expecting something of a higher level with this product and it is n't . The workouts are only 40-45 min long with warm and cool down . There seems to be jumping from a lot of equipment for one set . To me pointless ... ex . 1x1 which is one pushup one pull ups . When i do the p90x workout it absolutely kills me . P90x plus is the easy workout ... It is just an informercial for everything that he is selling now ... If he is n't selling the push up things he is selling the bowflex weights , if he is n't selling that he is selling the shakes , if he is n't selling that he is selling the shoes his `` uncle '' or `` cousin '' bought him.This is n't a good product . He only has 2 people working with him , you can tell there was n't any prepping before . In some exercises he you do n't know if it is for time or for reps until you are half way down with the set . In the Upper Plus while doing the pumpers the models are waiting for him and he says do n't mind me just start , then half way through he starts changing what to do . Bad bad product.I just felt that the money was n't put into this dvd like the other one . There was n't a workout booklet telling you about each video . It was just the 5 videos and that is it.Honestly I am very very disappointed with this . .
 The product description and pictures misrepresented this product . Thirteen videos were described and photographed . Only seven arrived with the ` complete ' package . Disappointing .
 There is nothing new to this program . Take the money you 'd spend on it and join a gym or the YMCA . It 'll cost less and it 's better for you . This whole concept has been around for years and years . Any good trainer will teach this as the proper way to work out .
 I purchased two-pound , not one pound , because they show up as black . But they are pink . They were for a boy ...
 The neoprene coating is already cut and coming off when I received the weights . On top of it I am having to pay postage to return them ! I feel ripped off : -LRB- Do n't buy these weights . Some of the roughest coating I have ever seen on weights . I would give it 0 stars if I could .
 I ordered these weights in December 2011 , both the 10 lb and the 8 lb . The 8 lb weights immediately started shedding the neoprene coating . Every time I see them , more and more looks like it 's coming off , and I hate to use them because they are a mess to look at , not to mention the coating it leaves all over the floor . This started happening a few months later w/the 10 lbs weights . I do not do anything weird to them . They just sit there when not in use . I would return them but ca n't imagine what it would cost to return 36 lbs of weights ... Just recommend buyhing something else . I 'll probably have to replace these soon .
 I bought this watch from Amazon and it stopped working in less than 6 months . Buying from Amazon does not give you warranty from manufacture . I contacted the Amazon third party warranty service and had to ship my watch to them . Shipping cost is mine . I did call them and they were nice on the Phone . I will update this based on the result.I expected a 300 $ watch to last longer ' .
 After much research on watches , I decided to go for this Tissot PRS200.It was reasonably priced -LRB- for a swiss brand -RRB- and looked good.However the watch was a complete let down when I received it.It may have looked beautiful , but it did not do the most basic function that we expect from a watch ... keep the time.It always ran a hour or two late.I returned the watch 3 days after I received it.The only bright spot in the entire order was that JTV watches refunded me promptly for the entire amount.On the whole it has been a very disgusting and frustrating first experience with Tissot .
 I 'm a size 6 and I should have purchased a small -LRB- I purchased a medium . -RRB- They are too long on the inseem and too loose . The length is good .
 This item was a gift to a sick boy in the hospital.I ordered it on a three day rush.The boy NEVER received the item , there is no record of it being shipped and not only is he not in the hospital anymore but when they tried to reship the item his size was sold out !!! I had a very good experience dealing directly with this company once before but not this time when dealing with AMAZON!Very disappointed . So was the sick boy !
 I bought this watch at target because it looked great . I have had it for a couple of months and normally wear it outside in short sleeves so it gets plenty of sun . However , it randomly resets itself to 1-1-2000 12 midnight about every 2 weeks ! I find it very annoying to have to reset the watch so frequently . It also goes into power save mode at random times and displays an incorrect time -LRB- power save mode freezes the clock hands and shuts off the digital display when it thinks you wo n't be using the watch -RRB- . I think this is all probably a defect in the solar technology and not just a defect in my watch . I would n't recommend this watch
 Features and price are excellent , but the battery does n't make good contact , so the units keeps reseting ; which is really annoying , since you have to program all the information again -LRB- wheel size , time , etc. -RRB- .
 They are less than two months old , only used twice . They worked nicely the first time , now they do not work at all . The store wo n't take them back -LRB- more than 30 days -RRB- and Midland wants me to pay to send them to Kansas and then wait 4-6 weeks . This looks like the second review where the product was defective when it was still brand new .
 I love Citizen 's Eco-Drive system . I own 2 other watches with this system and they work fine . This particlar watch was defective , as it would not hold the charge and would lose time and date very quickly . I had to continuously reset the watch . I 'm sure I just got a lemon with this one .
 This sump checks for water about every three minutes and turns on if water is detected . This allows adequate time for your sump to run over all the floor . How hard would it have been to design this to turn on when water is detected ? I submerged this moronic contraption in a washing machine full of water to test it and it sat there for several minutes before it turned on . I hope the designer installs one of these in his own home and has to deal with the consequences .
 I bought two -LRB- 2 -RRB- sets of these for my snorkel masks . Within the first day of snorkeling , they either fell off or were knocked off in the Caribbean Sea . We resorted to spitting into the mask to keep the fog off the lens and this worked perfectly .
 Very disappointed that this rangefinder was not useful beyond 800 yards . Nikon 's blurb says 1200 yards on non-reflective targets but it just does not do it . In daylight , it occasionaly would range a tree at 900 yards , but rarely . The Swarovski Laser Guide on the same bushes and trees at the same time consistently ranges to 1200 yards on non-reflective targets in full daylight and occasionaly out to 1900 yards on large trees . If you need 1000 yards , do not buy a Nikon .
 The RT 88 was a severe disappointment ; I returned it one day after its purchase . The main draw in acquiring this unit was its cordless operation , which obviates a wire going from the head unit to the wheel sensor . The absence of a wire allows a cleaner look than corded models and reduces a chance of a snag , all for just a $ 10 - $ 15 premium . Unfortunately , the rudimentary wireless connectivity is highly susceptible to interference other electronic and electrical devices.Vetta -LRB- Acumen Inc. -RRB- acknowledges this interference is a known issue . Hence , I ca n't recommend this cyclocomputer to anyone who might be near electrical devices -LRB- cell phones , CD players , utility transformers , power lines -RRB- while using the RT 88 . The first red flag appeared immediate after I programmed the final setting and switched to the main operational mode . The speed was fluctuating between 37 and 48 miles per hour . At first , I thought the device was simply malfunctioning . After some experimentation , I realized that it was sensitive to interference generated from my laptop anywhere within a three -LRB- 3 -RRB- foot radius -LRB- sans wireless connectivity enabled -RRB- . While I do n't ride with a laptop , I do have a cell phone mounted on my handlebars . Call transmission makes the RT 88 go haywire , showing excessive speeds.After several phone calls and emails to Vetta tech support , I was finally contacted by a Vetta staff member . The tech support person -LRB- marginally technical -RRB- acknowledged that interference is a known issue with the RT 88 . Even CD players cause this problem , he said . Here in Manhattan , bicycle store employees suggested that underground electrical equipment also has the same effect . However , I never bothered to install the unit on my bike.When I indicated to the Vetta representative that such interference problems never occurred with my -LSB- $ 300 -RSB- Polar S710 -LRB- current successor is the S-725 -RRB- , his reply was `` that it why it costs $ 300 '' . It dawned on me that Polar boasts their sensors are coded . Presumably this means that the heart sensor -LRB- and wheel sensor -RRB- was paired with the head unit . However , it is n't clear what type of wireless connectivity is used.Even though it is fairly obvious when the speed is erroneous , the erratic jumps cause a permanent problem by dramatically affecting the trip distance and odometer.In summary , the RT 88 * may * work for your particular usage pattern . However , no one should have to be concerned about the accuracy of such an instrument .
 This thing is -LRB- WAS -RRB- a piece of junk . I regretted buying it from day one . Buttons are incedibly difficult to use . Thankfully , the thing stopped working after only ONE MONTH ! -LRB- It started flashing MPHs and counting up miles on the odo while my bike was PARKED in my garage !! -RRB- I trash canned this piece of garbage and bought a different brand and have had no problems since . You have been warned . Avoid this junk . The only reason I gave it one star is because I ca n't give it a zero .
 Putting it on my bike was pretty easy but I could n't get the sensor to work . No matter how much I spun my wheel or how close I put the sensors together , the computer would n't register anything.I sent it back and got a wired computer , which works perfectly
 after 15 miles it has malfunctioned . Even with battery changes , realignment , it fails to record any speed or distance . Poor equipment .
 The Vetta RT77 was my first bike computer . It 's a cheap , very basic model that has worked okay , but there is major room for improvement . Personally , I would spend a little extra to get a computer with a bigger screen and more functionality . This computer gives you the basics
 this is not reversible ! i wanted a scarlet singlet for a PL meet and when i saw this one , I thought `` hey , why not have both ?! maybe I 'll get bored with scarlet in time '' . I got the blue one , the scarlet is not for wearing on the outside . I do n't have a long torso , and it fits poorly on the upper body . It is too small , although it 's fine on the lower-body .
 The floating marker is not balanced , so if you put the compass in horizontal position , the moving part of the compass is touching the glass . In flight , I need to change the angle of the compass all the time in order to read it , but for each direction , I need to have a different angle , so it is almost impossible to read . I had lot of compasses before , and I decided to buy a `` good '' one because I need more precision , but I comitted a big mistake choosing this one .
 The selection and description of quantities led me to believe that I would get at least 3 times more . This is undoubtedly the smallest amount of heat shrink I , ve ever received for the amount I paid ... . Very disappointed !
 Bad the disc are scratch and are the same price than geting it at beach body and to long to recived
 I agree with other reviewers here . P90X2 is just not as good as the original.First off , it just feels like you are adding `` balance on one foot '' or `` balance on stability ball '' to everything . I feel like I 'm not getting as good a work out on the targeted zones.Second , the fun and witty banter is gone . This is more serious and , frankly , more boring . The personalities were one thing that made P90X v1 so much fun.Third , the stretching before the workout is lame and feels like a complete waste of time . I already foam roll , and I do n't do it just before a workout . Also , it 's just a `` roll if you got 'em '' unstructured approach , and you only get 3 minutes -- not even enough time to work your different areas . It 's awkward and not a good fit . Foam rolling is important , but this is poorly executed.Lastly , it does indeed feel like an infomercial for special gear , and I do n't even have room for the specialized chin-up bar they use . All this equipment makes the workout really inaccessible.I did like some of the new moves on shoulders and arms -LRB- once I stopped trying to balance on one foot -RRB- , but there 's not enough here.I got Insanity , and I mix Insanity -LRB- which is FANTASTIC cardio/core -RRB- with P90X1 , and I hope they 'll do a P90X3 and get back to what made them a success . I will also look into the supplemental P90X workouts , and see if those can help refresh my program .
 For a year my husband and I have been doing the first P90X workout program and love it . We thought we 'd move up , hopefully with a little bit harder workout . This program is ridiculous . Tony Horton has so many useless props and moves that it seems he just made up to make another set of DVD 's to make more money ! I can not believe we spent so much money on such garbage . I 'm sticking to the first set he made and the Insanity workout .
 First of all , I highly recommend p90X ! P90X literally changed my life as it has done for millions . I have about 3 years of p90X experience under my belt and 2 years of incorporating Insanity along with it to change things up a bit . I was extremely excited about 90X2 , especially because of the PAP hype . I purchased the delux package , then I find out that you can modify all of the moves and still get an excellent workout without the equipment they required . The workouts in my opinion are not as intense nor as effective as the originals . I barely even sweat compared to the regular p90X where it kicks your butt right off the bat . Honestly , stick to the original , do n't waste your money ...
 I was an avid fan of the first P90X and told all my friends about how good it was and raved about it to complete strangers . Needless to say I was ecstatic when the mention P90X-2 came out . I thought it would revolutionize the world by introducing fast and simple workouts to the masses.I was surprised to find out that P90X-2 is just a propaganda machine that forces you to purchase dubious amounts of exercise equipment and repeats pointless workouts over and over . I mean who really has the money in today 's economy to buy 3 medicine balls ? And a 60 dollar roller that is on every disk and just happens to be Tony Horton 's `` favorite '' piece of equipment.I , being the sincere guy that I am , gave away the first P90X set to my best friend thinking that I would no longer need it and now I am contemplating going back to the gym , again , and pay a membership fee.I was in the military , I know how to work out and I do n't think that you need stacks and stacks of cash to purchase your own in-home gym to be fit . I think that this is a money making scheme that is in the same line of a Kardashian plan to squander money from the clueless.If you have the first P90X , do n't buy the second one . That 's what I 'm telling everyone here at least in my community . I 'm sure that this post will be deleted shortly after I post this but it feels good to vent about something that I am so frustrated by .
 If you have P90X and want P90X2 without actually buying it , do the following steps :1 . Take every weight work out in P90X and do them while balancing on one foot .2 . Take every push up/floor exercise and do them while balancing on medicine balls.Congratulations ! you now own P90X2 !!!
 The original p90x is what a workout should be , no additional products to buy you dont need just a solid , tough workout . p90x2 is a big money grab for beachbody where they push you to buy mats , medicine balls , foam rollers , shakes , etc. . All the exercises are complex with most being dangerous . Stick wth the originial , just like movies the second one always sucks .
 I 've completed p90x 3 times in the past 5 years , and am in -LRB- what I consider -RRB- to be great shape . I was so excited when P90X2 came out - and i feel let down . In so many ways it falls short of the experience P90X gives you . The one thing I love about these routines is the focus on working multiple muscle groups and challenging the core through stabilizing moves ... that really is the essence of this series ... the addition of basic equipment is great as well . But despite it being a great idea - it just is n't working.Warmup & Cooldown is too long and monotonous.As others have said - the workouts are too short and the warm up/cool down is too long . I especially hate that he uses the exact same warmup routine for every workout - it feels stale , which is one of the things we all love about P90X . It also makes the workouts too short . ` Mixing it up ' is great - this is too muchI understand that Tony is trying to create a series of entirely ` new ' exercises so that us seasoned P90Xer 's feel like this is something fresh . The problem is - most of these moves I feel are over-the-top , and many I feel are very unsafe . There are many plyometric push-up moves that involve balancing on a stability ball or medicine balls - and these moves feel horribly unsafe to me . I injured my tricep in one of these moves - and I 'll never do them again - opting to keep the ground or push up bars under my hands . The balls are too unpredictable and I feel these moves - despite how strong you are - can really be dangerous for your wrist , elbow and shoulders.Recovery + Mobility is a waste.The first time watching this DVD its very informative on how to use the the roller - and he demonstrates the importance of stretching ... but thats my issue with this DVD - it feels ` introductory ' . I 've since opted to stretch with the roller everyday for 15-20 min - and on recovery & mobility days I do the p90X stretch routine or do yoga.The challenge can be too much.Some of these moves are too much . And as others have said - often the challenge of the required balance or strength leads to poor form . Instead of regular bicep curls - you 're doing them in warrior 3 , instead of a basic push up - you 're doing it plyo on 2 medicine balls . It 's difficult to keep good form and work muscles effectively in many of the moves.Overall - I like the idea behind this - but it 's just not a right fit for me . It 's like Core Synergistics on crack . The idea of stability training is incredibly important , and I love the ` whole body workout ' idea of this - but it 's just not working . Better luck next time , Tony .
 Like many of the other reviewers , I had great success with P90x -LRB- and Insanity -RRB- and recommend these workouts highly . Since I had hit a plateau from doing several rounds of these programs , I was hoping that P90X2 would take my fitness even further . BeachBody ads claim this program is `` outrageously effective '' with `` more muscle confusion . '' Bunk.The biggest problems I see with this program are :1 . I 'm most disappointed in the lack of instruction in many of the moves . With P90x , moves often start with instruction , then a countdown after which the music starts , giving you a good cue . With many of the X2 moves , the people in the video often start exercising before any cue , sometimes with the camera focused elsewhere . I did round 1 for 5 weeks and even in the 5th week I had to watch many the moves then rewind in order for me to know what I was doing . X2 is substituting mental confusion over muscle confusion .2 . Moves are technically more difficult , and most of your effort is focused on balance no matter which move you are doing . So unless you 've got amazing balance , equal or better to any of the balance moves in P90x -LRB- think warrior 3 in Yoga x -RRB- , and have enough flexibility to easily palm the floor with legs extended bending forward , you will struggle greatly with the X2 moves and ultimately compromise your workouts .3 . Focus on core/abs is probably a good thing , but in X2 this seems to be everything . My least favorite P90x workouts were Ab ripper X and Core Synergistics , and it feels like I 'm doing these every day . Remember , `` I hate it , but I love it ? '' There is a lot of hate here , not much love .4 . Warm ups and cool downs are way too long . If you are busy , this can feel like a waste of time .5 . While I have n't done phase 3 yet , with each workout in phases 1 and 2 I feel like I am working hard to do the moves with good form but at the end feel less worked out , and am sweating a whole lot less than in P90x or Insanity.If you are looking for a program to get into excellent shape , skip this and do P90x . If you have peaked on P90x AND want to work on core and balance , then -LRB- and only then -RRB- this may be worth a try.UPDATE
 I have both P90x and P90x2 . I would be totally lost had I not done the original first . And as with most sequels it has not lived up to the hype , in my opinion . The nutrition guide is a waste , well there is a couple of different recipes that are good but the logic can be found on any website by googling good nutrition . And the fitness guide should be and embarrassment to BeachBody . No workout sheets are you kidding me I just paid $ 140 for this lame book . P90x is way better . Disappointing Product !
 Well , I am a P90X fan and have done it over the past 3 years so many times ! I have done many hybrids of it as well by inserting Insanity , Insanity Asylum and of course P90X + . I find the P90X + Kempo much better so always substitute there . I am stunned to say the least about this new one . As with many of the other reviews , I walk away wondering if I burned any calories or not . The real kicker for me was this morning with Shoulders & Arms . I am a shoulders girl and I like definition , no lean for me . In my opinion , there is nothing like a woman with nice shoulders in a tank top . That said , I was floored at how little we did today with this routine versus the Shoulders , Arms & Tris on P90X . I would walk away there knowing I did a killer muscle workout ! Not with this one . Again , I found myself wondering if I did anything at all to maintain muscle . I 'm 47 years old so it is important to work the muscles to maintain them and this just did n't do it for me . I found phase 1 to be the same way as others did . I am so focused on not falling on my butt and getting hurt that the weight has been compromised.I will keep it for now and like others , substitute some in with my P90X . I am looking into the Supreme 90 that I 'm hearing about now.This is such a bummer to me !
 I loved P90x and got great results . I have also used Power Half Hour and P90 -- both wonderful programs . However , after 3 years of rotating the 3 programs I was ready for something new . I was very excited when P90x2 was announced and immediately pre-ordered the base kit . I made sure to order the roller and medicine balls as well.When the kit arrived I was excited , but upon going through the first exercise DVD and subsequently the remaining ones over a 3 months period -- yes I did follow the program , I found that the results were weak and the workouts themselves paled in comparison to the original , as a matter of fact the P90 workouts are much better . I honestly feel that Tony and co simply watched the Core Secrets program and mixed those workouts in with the P90 and P90x material . If you are looking for a workout that implements the exercise ball you are better off mixing in the Core Secret series with the P90 and P90x workoouts , it 's significantly cheaper and you 'll get better results . Overall , I felt P90x2 shows that the whole P90 train has run out of steam . Skip P90x2 and stick with the original series .
 Like others , I 've completed multiple rounds of P90x , tried p90x plus , and even mixed in some one-on-one workouts -LRB- plyocide , medicine ball core cardio -RRB- . I agree with most
 Having done P90x twice in the last year I was pumped to start 2 . I 'm in good shape , former college soccer player who works out everyday . P90x was really good at getting that shredded look . Core was important . Now with P90X2 its all core no matter what your doing . I agree with others , some of the excercises are down right dangerous . I have already injured my wrist doing the various pushups that require you to balance yourself with your hands on either a medicine ball or stability ball . I know you do n't have to use these pieces of equipment but then whats the point of buying 2 ?? Just buy the original P90X and save money on all the extra crap they want you to buy now . Do n't get me started with the stretching before , its horrible . A couple of swings of your body back and forth with a stability ball and a couple lunges are your suppose to be ready to do 12 + pull up excersises ? The foam roller is worthless , trust me do n't buy it because you do n't need it.My wife who was never very athletically inclined loved P90X . I could never get her excited to do a workout but with the first one she was pushing me and giving me a hard time if I missed one ! Needless to say after 4 weeks -LRB- 2 in the first phase and 2 in the second -RRB- she has decided to go back and do P90X again . She absolutly hates P90X2 . She really liked Tony 's attidute and explaination in the first workout series , now he is all over the room with the people on the DVD doing what looks like their own thing . And do n't get her started on Drea -LRB- sp ? -RRB- , the gymnist from the first ones who was very good . Now she bounces around like a idiot in the P90X2.All in all P90X is by far superior to P90X2 . Take it from someone whos done countless workouts over their life and loved P90X .
